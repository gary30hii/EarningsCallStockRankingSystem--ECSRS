I'll now turn the call over to Brad Jacobs. Mr. Jacobs, you may begin.\nBrad Jacobs: Thank you, Melissa. And good morning everybody and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings call.  Joining me on the call today are Malcolm Wilson, our CEO of XPO Europe; David Wyshner, our CFO; and Matt Fassler, our Chief Strategy Officer.  I'm very pleased with our fourth quarter results. We reported much better-than-expected revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. Year-over-year, revenue was up 13% and strengthened across every business unit in logistics and transportation. In fact, revenue in both segments showed increases in the double digits.  Adjusted EBITDA was a fourth quarter record. We also generated solid free cash flow that brought us to over $0.5 billion for the full year.  Within transportation, in our LTL business, our fourth quarter adjusted operating ratio, excluding real estate, was also a record. And our truck brokerage results were simply stellar.  Within logistics, our growth accelerated in both North America and Europe and these higher volumes are increasingly being handled by robots.  We're off to a great start in Q1. Across our key regions, the consumer-led recovery remains robust, and the industrial economy is starting to catch up. Demand for our expertise has never been greater, driven by the shift to outsourcing, e-commerce growth and customer interest in our technology.  We're seeing strong momentum in our three largest lines of business; truck brokerage, LTL and logistics, and we expect both of our segments to generate year-over-year EBITDA growth in the range of 24% to 29%. We issued higher-than-expected guidance for full-year adjusted EBITDA of $1.725 billion to $1.8 billion.  We're also making good progress on the planned spin-off of our logistics segment. We've named a world-class management team from our own ranks, and we're excited about the impressive talent we're recruiting. We're still targeting a completion date in the second half of this year. We remain confident that the spin, if completed as planned, would enhance the growth prospects of both companies, giving them greater flexibility to tailor strategies and capital allocations to their end markets. We believe that the planned spin-off is an effective way to unlock significant value for our customers, employees and shareholders. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Malcolm Wilson to update you on our European business. Malcolm runs our European operations, and upon the completion of the planned spin, will become CEO of the global logistics business. Malcolm has been managing multinational 3PLs for three decades in Europe, North America and Asia. He joined us in 2015 when we acquired Norbert Dentressangle, where he grew the logistics division into its largest revenue producing unit. Then he came to XPO and led our logistics business to unprecedented growth and efficiencies. He\u2019s ideally suited for this next opportunity. Malcolm?\nMalcolm Wilson: Thank you, Brad, and good morning to everyone. I'm very excited about our momentum in Europe. Our logistics business has fully recovered from COVID and our transportation business is most of the way back. Our European logistics business operates in 15 countries and we\u2019re a leader in many important verticals. Foremost among these is e-commerce, where we are the first European outsourced provider of logistics.  Across e-commerce and all of our verticals, we're helping our customers accelerate their adoption of new technology. We have a large and growing population of robots in our warehouses and the benefit of our XPO Smart productivity tools. We believe we'll see large upside to productivity when XPO Smart is fully utilized in all of our logistics sites.  To give you an idea of our operating landscape in Europe, we have the bluest of blue chip customer bases, with an average customer relationship of between 5 and 10 years. Some of these relationships go back 30 years or more. As we infuse more technology into our operations, the tenure is growing. Ten-year contracts are becoming quite normal now.  As is the case in the US, COVID has created a real appreciation for the critical importance of supply chains throughout Europe. During the past four years, our senior management team have delivered 12% CAGR in logistics gross margin, while tackling big projects in a variety of market environments. The company has been very resilient through the pandemic.  We started our highly automated Nestl\u00e9 facility in the UK during the height of COVID last year, while maintaining stringent safety measures. This brought the facility online in time to deliver an excellent peak season performance. We also started new operations for several omnichannel retailers including the luxury brand Kering in Northern Italy, where we launched a large campus of automated warehouses, also in the peak of COVID.  Although new lockdowns were implemented in many countries in the fourth quarter, governments have been much more thoughtful about how they apply these measures. The latest restrictions were designed to keep commerce moving. We've seen no material impact to our business.  As for Brexit, we've experienced only minimal impact there as well. Our logistics business in the UK has been unaffected by the changes in the trading relationship with the rest of Europe as our UK sites largely serve customers who sell to UK consumers.  And with our UK Transportation business, Brexit has actually worked in our favor. We have been able to record costs related to border delays, and some of our competitors have exited the lanes going into the U.K, so we\u2019ve picked up share.  Looking forward, we have several new high-profile projects starting in 2021. One notable logistics contract is with Nutricia, Danone\u2019s healthcare products business. This will be a fully automated facility in the Netherlands. And finally, we\u2019re very excited to have completed the acquisition of the majority of Kuhne & Nagel's UK contract logistics business, which gave us the opportunity to welcome nearly 6,000 new colleagues serving three strategic verticals; tech and e-commerce, food service and beverages. We've also onboarded many new customers with the acquisition. These blue-chip brands operate across Europe, and we are already seeing new business opportunities with them. The tech customers in particular include many industry leaders, such as Virgin Media and BT. All the customers are high-quality relationships.  The transaction closed on January 1. The transition has gone smoothly and all customers and key employees have been retained. We had identified significant synergy benefits prior to the acquisition, and a number of these are already in process. We expect this acquisition to add more than $600 million to our annual revenue and drive significant synergies during 2021. All in, we have an enormous opportunity in front of us, and even more so as a separate company. I\u2019ve had the pleasure of meeting some of you and I'm looking forward to spending time with more of you in the months ahead. Now, David will cover the results.\nDavid Wyshner: Thanks, Malcolm, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'd like to discuss our fourth quarter and full year results, our balance sheet and liquidity, some insights we gained during the pandemic, and our outlook for 2021.  In the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $4.7 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $449 million. Both figures reflect year-over-year increases despite the pandemic, and they are higher than we expected at the beginning of the quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA is an all-time fourth quarter record and reflects our commercial momentum and a continued strong recovery over the last six months.  As Brad mentioned, revenue grew 13% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. We incurred direct COVID-related costs of $9 million, and our gains on LTL real estate sales were $14 million versus $32 million last year. Excluding those two items, adjusted EBITDA in the quarter grew by 11%.  The holiday peak was long and strong. We saw robust consumer demand and a continuing rebound in industrial activity. As revenue increased, we began to benefit from the operating leverage inherent in our business. Matt will review our segment detail in a few minutes. Our adjusted earnings were $1.19 per diluted share in the quarter and increased year-over-year despite higher interest expense. We generated $193 million of cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter, spent $149 million on gross capex, and received $47 million of proceeds from asset sales. As a result, we generated free cash flow of $91 million in the quarter. We didn't repurchase any common stock in the fourth quarter, so we continue to have $500 million of authorized share buyback capacity.  For the full year, we generated revenue of $16.3 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 billion. Our adjusted earnings were $2.01 per diluted share.  For analysts who exclude amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets for comparison purposes, I'll note that our full year 2020 results include $0.96 of amortization expense related to intangibles. Going forward, we're going to add intangible asset amortization back in our calculations of adjusted EPS. We and many investors we've spoken with think that produces a more comparable and meaningful metric. With this modification, our 2020 adjusted earnings are $2.97 per diluted share. Our gross capital expenditures were $526 million in 2020, which reflects decisions we made in the second half of the year to resume capital spending in support of key initiatives. After considering our regular course asset sales, our net capital expenditures were $331 million in 2020. And importantly, our full-year 2020 free cash flow was $554 million.  Maintaining strong liquidity continues to be a top priority for us as an organization. Our cash balance at December 31 was $2.1 billion. This cash, combined with available debt capacity under committed borrowing facilities, gave us total liquidity of more than $3 billion at year-end. Our net leverage was 3.3 times LTM adjusted EBITDA.  We redeemed our 6.5% senior notes due 2022 in January, which reduced our debt and cash balances by an equivalent amount. We have no significant debt maturities until September 2023 and our liquidity position is strong. We've learned a lot over the course of the last year. The list of insights is a mile long but here are a few key takeaways.  Our business is incredibly resilient. Both our transportation and logistics segments have an ability to operate, rebound and prosper, even when circumstances are at their most challenging. In 2020, we also proved our agility by adjusting our expenses to changes in demand, even though the changes were sharp and unpredictable.  On a macro level, we're benefiting from the trends toward e-commerce, outsourcing and automation, all of which have accelerated. Transportation and logistics customers of all sizes see the advantages of working with strong partners like XPO. And in many cases, they also saw the risks associated with relying on firms that don't have the resources we do. And lastly, once the scope of the COVID impact on our end markets took shape, we were quick to take actions that strengthened our position in the recovery, like retaining people, securing new business and investing in technology. We saw an opportunity to grow rather than retrench and it has proven to be the right move. Turning to our outlook. Our guidance reflects the improved operating environment we saw in the fourth quarter, as well as our expectation that the effects of COVID will continue to moderate in 2021. All of our projections exclude impacts from our planned spin-off of our logistics segment.  As Brad highlighted, we expect to generate $1.725 billion to $1.8 billion of adjusted EBITDA in 2021 with growth of 24% to 29% in each of our transportation and logistics segments. Our outlook assumes ongoing COVID-related cost for at least the first six months of the year and lower year-over-year gains from LTL real estate sales.  We\u2019re optimistic that our base case scenario will prevail. That is that consumer demand will continue to be solid, e-commerce will continue to grow, industrial demand will continue to recover, and new business opportunities will continue to emerge. In the first quarter, we expect that our adjusted EBITDA will be in the low 20s as a percentage of our full-year adjusted EBITDA, which is consistent with our typical seasonality. On the cash flow front, we estimate that our full year free cash flow will be in the $600 million to $700 million range. We're targeting roughly $650 million of gross capital expenditures and $500 million of net capex, although both of these estimates could vary based on new business opportunities in our logistics segment.  We expect depreciation, excluding intangibles amortization, to be up slightly this year to $635 million to $655 million. With the repayment of our $1.2 billion of senior notes in January, we\u2019re forecasting $275 million to $285 million of interest expense in 2021, which represents a nearly $50 million year-over-year reduction. And we estimate that our effective tax rate will be in the 24% to 26% range, which is standard for us.  With nearly all of our outstanding convertible preferred stock having been converted into common stock in December, we'll have 113 million diluted common shares outstanding this year. As a result, we're projecting adjusted earnings of $5.10 to $5.85 per diluted share, representing 84% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. These figures all add back the intangibles amortization expense I mentioned. In sum, we delivered strong results again this quarter, ahead of both Street expectations and our own. We move into 2021 with the wind at our back, with robust liquidity, growing revenues, solid results in both segments of our business, and record adjusted EBITDA in each of the last two quarters despite the pandemic.  We remain enthusiastic about our prospects as a leader in the markets we serve. And we believe that we're proceeding toward our planned spin-off of our logistics business from a position of strength. I'll now turn things over to Matt.\nMatt Fassler: Thanks, David, I'll review the fourth quarter operating results starting with our transportation segment. In North American LTL, we showed a solid progression in revenue trends throughout the quarter. Our tonnage per day accelerated to 1.6% growth, which was an improvement from the third quarter of almost six percentage points. Tonnage was positive in every month of the quarter.  We also saw a pickup in the trend of shipments per day, which were down 0.7% year-over-year. That's 3.3 percentage points better than Q3. Weight per shipment rose 2.6% year-over-year, which compares to flattish in Q3.  The pricing backdrop for LTL remains rational. Yield, excluding fuel, rose 1.5% year-over-year, consistent with our Q3 increase. Underlying yield trends improved quarter-to-quarter, offset by the increase in weight per shipment, which tends to impact reported yield numbers.  Growth in revenue per shipment, excluding fuel, improved to 3.8%, which is more than twice the growth rate we saw in the third quarter, and it accelerated through the fourth quarter. Growth in revenue per day, excluding fuel, also accelerated through the quarter to 3.1%. That picked up 5.7 percentage points from the third quarter.  Tonnage trends improved in all of our top seven verticals, which together comprise 85% of our throughput. Consumer verticals remained stronger than industrial. You\u2019ll recall that we're overweight industrial in LTL, and any improvement in the industrial economy is good for our business.  Our adjusted operating ratio of 83% compared to 82.3% a year ago. Excluding real estate gains, our adjusted OR improved to 84.5%, which was 130 basis points better than the fourth quarter a year ago. We've improved this fourth quarter metric for six consecutive years. Both operating ratios include a 60-basis point impact from COVID-related costs.  Adjusted operating income, ex-real estate increased by 11%. We also saw ongoing improvements in productivity in LTL. Our load factor increased by 3.1% year-over-year, and we were 3.7% more efficient in pickup and delivery than we were last year.  Internal adoption of our XPO Smart labor management tools in our LTL facilities increased by over 50% from the first quarter to the fourth quarter in 2020, contributing to our labor efficiency. We see big upside from this technology as it becomes fully utilized.  Our North American truck brokerage business delivered tremendous results. We generated a 76% year-on-year increase in revenue and a 110% increase in net revenue. Loads per day increased by 24%, sharply outpacing the market.  Net revenue per load increased by 69%. Net revenue margin rate increased by 300 basis points year-over-year to 18.6%.  As you might imagine, earnings for this business rose substantially. It marked a continuation of the strong performance we've generated for the past several quarters in truck brokerage.  There\u2019s a great story behind our volume growth in the second half of the year. We drove that growth by making a strategic decision to hire and train people at the bottom of the market. As demand rebounded and the environment became exceptionally tight, we were in a strong position to help our customers procure capacity. Our brokerage teams continue to leverage our XPO Connect digital platform to drive profits in tandem with our real-time pricing tools. We're also using API tools to generate quotes for some shippers. This is a relatively recent pricing channel for us. It's an efficient, touchless way to capture revenue and maintain our margin.  In the fourth quarter, we increased the number of API quotes we issued by about 45% quarter-over-quarter, which led to nearly twice the number of delivered loads negotiated through these tools. We're seeing year-over-year quarterly improvements in brokered loads per head. Even as we staff up, we're growing volume faster than headcount, again, because of XPO Connect.  And carrier adoption of the platform is on a strong upward trajectory. We've seen a 47% increase in downloads for our Drive XPO carrier app in the last the months, taking the cumulative total from 200,000 at the end of the third quarter to over 300,000 at year-end. We now have approximately 58,000 brokerage carriers registered on XPO Connect in North America and another 17,000 or so in Europe, and these numbers keep climbing.  Looking at our transportation segment overall, revenue increased by 13% year-over-year in the quarter and adjusted EBITDA increased by 8%. COVID costs impacted our EBITDA growth by two percentage points and lower gains from LTL real estate impacted it by eight percentage points. Turning to our logistics segment. We increased revenue 13% in the fourth quarter year-over-year. The biggest growth driver for contract logistics continues to be e-commerce, both in Europe and North America. There's been a lot written about the secular shift to online and omnichannel and we are seeing it firsthand.  Demand for e-fulfillment and returns management expertise is surging at our existing sites, and it\u2019s spurring new commercial opportunities. In 2020, we shipped about five times as many units using robotic automation than we did in the prior year.  Our European logistics business has excellent momentum. As the largest outsourced e-fulfillment platform in Europe, we're a natural place for e-commerce customers to turn. We see a lot of new business ahead as these customers seek out our scale and automation capabilities. Our European logistics revenue rose 19% in the fourth quarter year-over-year or 13% excluding the impact of FX. For the full year, consumer goods generated over 80% of the revenue in European logistics.  In North American logistics, our revenue grew 4% year-over-year and, importantly, it accelerated. While our strongest growth emanated from omnichannel retail, we also saw a big increase in consumer packaged goods.  There are also some challenges in the quarter. As e-commerce volumes surged over the course of an extended peak, warehouse employment rose 9% in December, and seasonal hourly wages spiked. The increase was sharp and sudden, with a 4% month over month pop in December alone. This led to higher compensation costs, particularly for seasonal labor.  In addition, COVID created some special constraints for launching new projects. We completed 11 start-ups in the fourth quarter versus eight a year ago. These required complex installations of equipment and technology, as well as permit inspections and testing, many of which ran into delays from COVID. This added to the cost of launching these customer projects, but the issues are temporary. Seasonal labor costs are abating, and our recent startups are running well. These new contracts will generate significant revenue and profit over the next five to ten years. We get asked a lot about our shared distribution network in North America. Well, XPO Direct had a terrific quarter, with its fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year profit improvement. If XPO Direct was its own vertical, it would have been our fastest growing vertical in Q4 for the logistics business.  The benefits that are resonating most strongly with retailers and brands is that they can use the XPO Direct network to position their inventory close to end customers and to reposition it when demand patterns change. These shorten distribution times. We\u2019re onboarding numerous emerging and mid-sized firms who trust us to provide fulfillment services for their consumers. Returning to our global logistics business overall, we expect year-over-year profit growth in this business of at least 15% in the first quarter and growth of 24% to 29%, in line with our guidance for the company overall for the full year. And that's pretty much the theme of 2021 across all our lines of business. They were all off to a strong start in January.  Consumer spending growth remains strong, with the shift to e-commerce persisting and the industrial economy is beginning to regain momentum. We remain focused on driving share gains and efficiency through innovation.  In our warehouses, we plan to roughly double the number of robots in place over the course of this year, which will continue to deliver critical productivity improvements. XPO Smart is helping us drive consistent 5% to 7% productivity improvement in contract logistics labor, and it's improving dock productivity in LTL as well.  Also in LTL, our pricing algorithms are driving fully automated responses to 75% of the RFPs we receive. As you can see, automated pricing is a consistent theme throughout our transportation segment.  To give you a little color on January, in LTL, revenue growth ex-fuel continued to accelerate. Both tonnage growth and yield growth picked up further from Q4 levels. We successfully executed our annual GRI, and the pricing backdrop is constructive. We expect year-over-year adjusted OR improvement in Q1 with significant OR improvement for the full year. In truck brokerage, volume growth remains very strong in a tight market. This tightness is driven largely by the supply side, with ongoing congestion at some of the major ports and a driver shortage. There has been some loosening in capacity from the seasonal peak, which helps us with procuring capacity for our customers.  Our organic revenue growth in our logistics segment in January was consistent with fourth quarter levels. And again, our outlook for Q1 earnings growth in logistics is solidly positive. I'll close with a few of the accolades we received in the quarter. On the customer front, we received Dow\u2019s Sustainability Award for 2020 in road transportation, and we were named the GlobalTranz LTL Collaborator of the Year. We also won a Green Supply Chain Award from Supply & Demand Chain Executive magazine. Finally, we were named a World's Most Admired Company by Fortune magazine for the fourth straight year. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Wetherbee: Thanks and good morning everybody. I'd like to touch on the guidance for a moment. So, you gave some pretty detailed and good guidance, particularly on the profit level. I was wondering what the outlook is on the revenue side, and maybe if you could kind of break that down into the global logistics business as well as the transport business. Can you give us a sense of sort of what the revenue growth potential could be, what the backlog might look like for 2021?\nMatt Fassler: Chris, it's Matt. Good morning. So, a couple of points on the revenue. Revenue moves around a lot due to exogenous factors like currency, FX, fuel, truckload rates. So we haven't guided to revenue this year, and we typically haven't guided to revenue.  We're off to a very strong start for the first quarter and the trends that you saw in the fourth quarter are pretty good sign all in of what we're seeing in Q1. But we expect strong balanced revenue growth over the course of the year, both for transportation and for logistics.  Keep in mind, as you model revenue for the year, that we closed the Kuehne + Nagel acquisition at the outset of the year. We're thinking of that as about $600 million to revenue over the course of the year. So, as you build your models, that's something to consider for the total number. All the comments I gave you about the tone of business are prior to considering the addition of K + N.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay, that's helpful. And then, maybe just as a follow-up to that in terms of the logistics side, can you talk a little bit about the pipeline in terms of the new business wins? Let\u2019s take K + N out for a moment. It sounds like there's a lot out there from a pipeline standpoint. Can you just give us a sense of what that might look like?\nMatt Fassler: The backlog for contract logistics is very strong. There are so many tailwinds for the contract logistics business. You think about the tailwinds from outsourcing. You think about the tailwind from industrial automation and the way we deploy our technology in our warehouses. Of course, you think about the tailwind from e-commerce, which, if anything, gained momentum as we made our way through 2020.  Certainly, the demand for incremental e-commerce projects is a very substantial part of our backlog. So, we have a strong backlog, both in North America and in Europe, as we look forward to 2021. And we expect that to be the case for years ahead.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay. And if I could just sneak one in on the LTL side. You mentioned year-over-year gains in the OR in the first quarter and then more substantial improvement beyond that. Can you just talk a little bit about sort of what the opportunity looks like? You have tonnage and pricing both turning positive here or at least tonnage turning positive, pricing accelerating from where we were in the fourth quarter. How should these incremental margins look in this business there? You have a target for $1 billion of profit going out into the future, just want to get a sense of what '21 might look like from an OR standpoint.\nMatt Fassler: Sure. To answer the first part of your question, we do expect OR improvement in Q1, and we expect OR improvement of at least a couple of hundred basis points excluding real estate for the full year.  Now, in addition to tonnage, which you cited, and pricing, which you cited, we have a number of company-specific initiatives: continuing to drive dock productivity through XPO Smart; continuing to drive route optimization, both pickup and delivery and linehaul. These are company-specific initiatives that will help us on the cost front, in addition to the top line drivers that you cited. All of these are part of our game plan for achieving strong OR expansion this year and for achieving that LTL EBITDA target of at least $1 billion in 2022.\nChris Wetherbee: Great. Thanks so much for the time.\nMatt Fassler: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nAllison Landry: Good morning. Thanks. So, just another one on LTL. I think around a couple of years ago, you guys were talking about the pricing algorithms and the automated pricing facilitating an ability to gain some share. And I think you specifically maybe talked about being able to go after some spot market freight. So, wondering if you could remind us of the potential size of this opportunity? I think it was maybe challenging on this front in 2020, but any sense of if you think you can make some inroads here in 2021?\nMatt Fassler: Allison, it's Matt. Two points to make. First of all, we're really in the early innings of optimizing pricing in LTL. We've made some good headway, but we have a lot more to go, particularly in terms of price elasticity.  Secondly, one of the skills that we've been developing in LTL, is the skill of assessing the OR profile of freight as we bring it into the network. So, one of the reasons we continue to drive strong OR improvement and we had very strong incremental margins in LTL in the fourth quarter year-over-year as we think about pricing in terms not just of yield, but also in terms of the OR profile of the freight we bringing in, and that is certainly been helping us drive that operating income improvement. You saw that 11% EBIT increase in LTL, excluding the impact of real estate. Clearly, our pricing work is one of the drivers of that improvement.\nAllison Landry: Okay. And then, Matt, you just sort of listed some of the different tailwinds in contract logistics. Maybe this is more of a question for Malcolm, but could you just sort of give us a sense of the nature of some of the commercial opportunities, more recently because of COVID? Is it more just the sort of broad outsourcing trend? Or is there more of a trend for wanting industrial automation or warehouses of the future, fulfillment? Maybe if you can just sort of give us a sense of how those discussions have evolved over the last, I don\u2019t know, 6 to 12 months in terms of those sort of buckets of growth drivers.\nMalcolm Wilson: Matt, it's Malcolm. I'll take that question, please. So, Allison, what we're seeing is really we're just able to capitalize on being the largest e-fulfillment provider in Europe, our reverse logistics returns management, the strength we have in omnichannel distribution and, of course, XPO Direct.  What we've seen through COVID is it's brought a new appreciation of just the critical nature of supply chain to our customers. And that's fueling our ability to sign longer-term contracts. So, in the past, 10 years would have been a long contract. Now, it\u2019s more and more the normal type of contract.  Customers are really wanting more and more technology in their operations. So, with more and more robots in our warehouses, collaborative robots, larger automation sortation centers. So, all of these are driving a very, very positive trend in terms of organic growth. And of course, technology brings productivity and that's enabling us also to improve EBITDA levels.\nAllison Landry: Okay. So, is it fair to think about sort of the more complex nature of the pipeline as maybe having a better margin profile versus historical?\nMalcolm Wilson: I think it allows us to bring more to our relationship with our customers. It really moves us up the importance of the supply chain. So, we mentioned earlier, I think Matt mentioned about the warehouse of the future, that we successfully implemented in 2020. That project, in fact, was two years from the beginning to the end, involving a greenfield construction of the site, XPO deploying all of its skill set to turn a greenfield into a highly automated warehouse that was delivered on time and able to deliver an excellent performance at the peak of the season, even in a COVID environment. So, we're seeing really that customers are coming to XPO, really because of those experiences and that reputation that we have for delivering things on time in a reliable way, really making ourselves an integral part and assistance to their success also.\nAllison Landry: Okay, thank you guys.\nMatt Fassler: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer & Company. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks very much. Good morning. I was hoping you could address the contract logistics, EBITDA margin, some headwinds in the fourth quarter you outlined. And it sounds like kind of similar to Chris's question on LTL. First quarter will be solid, but it will really be the latter quarters. So, if you could just elaborate on what you see. It sounds like a lot of won business in 2020 and more in the pipeline,. How are you' going to become more efficient with the margin and what type of expectations you have for that that segment business over the course of the year? Thanks.\nMatt Fassler: Sure. Scott, this is Matt. I'm happy to take that question. Think about the margin pressure that we saw in contract logistics in the fourth quarter of 2020 as an isolated incident related specifically to the two unique idiosyncratic factors that I discussed a moment ago. One of them relates to pressure on seasonal wages that we saw in the fourth quarter and the second relates to the challenge of starting up new business in a COVID environment.  And just to shed a little more light on that, some of the projects that we implemented in the second half of the year had very advanced automation at their core. As we installed some of this new machinery, we needed to move tech people around the country. We needed to get sign-off from municipalities. The inspection process was sometimes delayed, and we had to provide interim solutions that were quite labor-intensive and, going back to the prior issue, at a moment in time when labor was extremely expensive.  We did what we needed to do to deliver for our customers in the fourth quarter. It cost us some money. Happily, as we speak today, these issues are in the rearview mirror. We stated a moment ago that we expect adjusted EBITDA growth for contract logistics in the first quarter of at least 15%. We expect adjusted EBITDA growth for logistics in the 24% to 29% range for the year, consistent with our outlook for the broader company. So, we feel very good about the earnings outlook for the logistics business.\nScott Schneeberger: Great, thanks. Appreciate that. And then, curious to hear about last mile logistics, given it was the peak quarter. Just a little bit more insight into how you handled the quarter end and what you're expecting for the coming year. Thanks.\nMatt Fassler: Yes, happy to take that one as well. So, our last mile revenue grew 13% in the quarter. Our contribution dollars from last mile grew 15% year-over-year, and the contribution margin rate increased to 22% from 21.6%.  As you know, we're the largest outsourced provider of last mile logistics for heavy goods for most of the leading retailers and e-tailers out there \u2014 not a surprise, when customers tell us that our service metrics are best-in-class. Our claims frequency is astounding, 1 out of only 600 or so deliveries results in a claim. We bought and integrated this business from 2013 to 2015, as you know, before the industry really came to a high-profile notice. We had first-mover advantage here, really starting with one-of-a-kind platform in 3PD.  More recently, we've invested in world-class consumer-facing technology, which will really enhance the value proposition for our customers. So, a very strong close to the year for this business, to your point.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks. I'll turn it over.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nTom Wadewitz: Yes, good morning. I wanted to ask you a little bit about brokerage and congratulations on the really impressive results in brokerage. Can you give us a sense of what that percentage change was in brokerage headcount year-over-year? And also, how you think about the increase in automation? If you could give a sense of kind of what percent of loads were automated on one side or on both sides? Just to think about kind of where you're at in that process of leveraging the kind of DFM type of approach.\nMatt Fassler: Tom, it's Matt. Our brokerage headcount was up 20% year-over-year. To repeat a stat that I gave in my prepared remarks, our load count was up 24% year-over-year. So, we achieved improvement in productivity per rep, even as we staffed up. But the most important metric to integrate or synthesize with that picture are the increases that we drove in that margin per load which were substantial. And that tied to our ability to really invest time working for our customers, procuring capacity in a very dynamic market.  On your question on digital, at this point, all of our orders are running through the XPO Connect platform in one sense or another. This is the system that our customers and our carriers use for transacting business with us. So there\u2019s a digital element to everything that we're doing in brokerage.  And one of the great changes over the past year or two, is the way Connect has been integrated into the day-to-day business practices of our reps and that is contributing to their efficiency, contributing to better price discovery, and contributing to the margin and profit results that we delivered in the fourth quarter.\nTom Wadewitz: How would you think about -- fourth quarter seem to be a kind of uniquely good environment for brokers, obviously you capitalized on that. But I guess if we go back to -- if we think of 2021 as an analogous to 2018, contract rates up a lot, that's a pretty good environment for brokers as well, how do you think about the kind of pace of top line growth in 2021 for your brokerage business just given that it was such a big step-up in activity in the fourth quarter?\nMatt Fassler: Sure. We're almost halfway through the first quarter. We're doing extremely well in truck brokerage. Q1 will be spectacular, maybe not quite as spectacular as the fourth quarter, but it will be exceptionally strong. Typically, as you know, you would see a seasonal step down from the fourth quarter to the first quarter.  One thing to keep in mind on our recent hires, as the tenure of these new hires increases, they'll be more impactful. They will be able to transact more business than they did in the past. So, we think we're setting ourselves up here for a sustained period of success relative to the market.\nTom Wadewitz: If I can sneak in one other quick one. Just what about intermodal within freight brokerage, anything of note happening there?\nMatt Fassler: Intermodal had a massive recovery in the fourth quarter. Organic revenue per day was up low double digits. That was a nice acceleration from Q3. Loads per day were up 4%. This was the first positive quarter that we had in this metric in 2020. Gross margin per load was up 8%. And you can think about the recovery there, reflecting the tight truckload market, which leads to some conversion to intermodal and incremental demand from consumer and retail customers, particularly with that extended peak later in the year.\nTom Wadewitz: Okay, thank you for the time.\nMatt Fassler: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Seidl: Thank you, operator. And good morning, gentlemen. How should we think about tonnage growth on the LTL side considering the industrial economy is still lagging, so that seems to be on the comp [indiscernible].\nMatt Fassler: Jason, it's Matt. The industrial economy is still lagging the consumer economy, though it is beginning to recover. Our tonnage per day in January was stronger than our tonnage per day in the fourth quarter. And our expectation is that we will see improvement as the industrial economy continues to recover.\nJason Seidl: Okay. Want to switch over to the robotics side. So, you made some interesting comments about how much increase you guys have seen and what you're going to plan for 2021. The fourth quarter saw a big spike in seasonal wages for your logistics business. As you implement more and more robotics throughout your businesses, does that sort of buttress you a little bit away from the seasonal wage increase issues that may come and go, depending upon the given year?\nMatt Fassler: Overtime, it can. I mean, we're continuing to see sixfold productivity improvement with goods-to-person robotics versus manual sites. We said earlier we shipped five times as many units using robotic automation technology. Year-on-year, we grew the number of robots in our warehouses by about four times, so there\u2019s some productivity improvement embedded within that for us. As you can see, we plan to double the number of robots that we have in 2021.  We have a first-mover advantage in goods-to-person robots. The cost of entry is high. Many customers are consequently outsourcing, that including to us. And robots are particularly critical in supporting large scale ecommerce rollouts in tandem with our workforce.\nJason Seidl: And what part are the robots, as a percentage of your CapEx, is it still less than 2, 3%?\nMatt Fassler: It's a small number in the grand scheme of the CapEx guide that David gave you a moment ago, but it will grow over time as they emerge as a bigger part of our story.\nJason Seidl: Okay. I appreciate the color. Nice quarter.\nMatt Fassler: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks, operator. Hi, everybody. Malcolm, congrats on the appointment as CEO, SpinCo. I guess I'd like to direct my first question to you, Malcolm, if that's okay. And that's really just regarding the structural return potential in contract logistics, not just this year, but kind of over the next several years because we talk a lot about revenue growth in logistics, and that's clearly very compelling, but we don't talk about margin expansion or structural margin expansion, and one of the concerns out there with investors and analysts is a relatively low margin profile of the logistics business. So, in that context, Malcolm, I was just wondering is there a structural margin expansion story at logistics as you penetrate more value-added services and if you could just talk about in terms of what that structure return potential could be over the next four or five years?\nMalcolm Wilson: Thank you, Amit. Just to remind, for quarter one, we're already tracking for our logistics business to be above 15% in adjusted EBITDA for quarter one, and 24% to 29% for the full year, in line with the business.  Going forward, if I consider the experience that we have, we can see a lot of potential for margin expansion. That's coming from more and more deployment of technology into our business. So, as Matt just explained, the productivity improvements that we get from at the cooperative robots and autonomous robots, it's really quite significant. We're also seeing significant productivity improvement from our XPO Smart productivity tools. So, these things combined give us great confidence that we can expand margins on the go forward.\nAmit Mehrotra: Great. And so what is the ceiling on that, is it high single-digit operating margins, low-double digit EBITDA margins, like what is the opportunity from where we are today?\nMalcolm Wilson: Right now, we're operating our business with high single digit (corrected by company after the call) EBITDA margins, and we expect that to have the ability to expand as we're rolling out these new technologies. The solutions that our customers are demanding are larger, more complex, more embracing. We're obviously seeing the benefit of this huge secular change that's coming as a consequence of e-commerce. We're all buying more and more things on the online, and that's driving our ability to deploy more and more technology in our warehouses.  So, these things all together definitely are going to allow us to expand margins. And not to lose sight of the very leading position we have, strongest e-fulfillment provider, with strength in reverse logistics in returns management, the strength we have in omnichannel, and of course, in North America, XPO Direct. So, there's a lot of runway ahead for us to improve.\nAmit Mehrotra: Yes, okay, thank you, Malcolm. And then, just as my follow-up, maybe for David or Matt. If I strip out the $600 million of Keuhne + Nagel UK logistics inorganic growth this year on the top line, it looks like, and I could be wrong on this, but it looks like the implied incrementals on the organic growth is like low to mid 20% range. And I just would've thought it would be higher than that given, one, the split between fixed and variable costs and you're comping COVID costs, then you have this $500 million non-volume opportunity. So, I'd love you to kind of help me with, first of all, is that right in terms of low to mid 20% incremental on the organic growth, and why that is in higher given all these kind of lapping of costs in the non-volume-driven cost opportunity?\nMatt Fassler: So, a couple of points on that, and some of them are going to repeat, I think, the clear premises you have in your question. We do see a strong revenue performance in Q1 and for the year. We do expect substantial operating leverage in 2021.  We talked about K + N and it is coming in most likely at a lower EBITDA margin, but we're going to build that margin up over time through synergies. Your math is pretty good excluding K + N. We expect to generate incremental margins into the 20%s. It's early in the year. Let's see where we can take this.\nAmit Mehrotra: Okay, very good. Thank you for answering my questions. Appreciate it.\nMatt Fassler: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good morning and thanks for taking my question. I'll just keep it to two today. But, Malcolm, I guess coming off that answer more holistically, how do you want to manage the business from a growth perspective? Would you rather get price and margin? Or would you rather see greater organic expansion looking forward? And I guess, along those lines, how much of the benefits from robotics and productivity in the business do you have to give back just via your contract structures?\nMalcolm Wilson: Thank you, Brandon. Going forward, we're going to use the same strategy that we've had since XPO acquired the ND legacy business. Under my leadership, that strategy is delivered a 17% CAGR in logistics gross margin, while adding 6% CAGR revenue growth, all while throwing off tons of free cash flow. No acquisitions in those numbers, just good solid management. It's been achieved by us capitalizing on our leading position in omnichannel and e-fulfillment logistics.  We give superb and reliable customer service to our blue-chip customers and everybody's seen that during the last year of the pandemic. Optimizing our operations, we utilize the technology, all the robotics, automated sortation machines. All of those help keep our business lean and efficient.  And finally, we work hard in developing a very positive engagement with all of our employees and that's an integral part of our success. So, when you put all these things together, we've got years and years ahead of us in terms of strong organic revenue and EBITDA growth. That's for the combined business.  I think the volume now and the acceleration that we see in robotic technology, in automation technology, in technology generally that we're able to deploy in the warehouse, it's a super exciting environment that we're in and really bodes very, very well for the future of our logistics business.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you for the response. And I understand like a big drive here with the split is to be very focused on capital deployment. Any changes there, does M&A move up the list for you as you look forward or is it more internal development?\nMalcolm Wilson: For our internal development, we scrutinize every project. We look at the ROI returns that we got on every project, and we're going to carry on with that very good cadence in the new spin company.  When it comes to acquisitions. I've got tons of experience of acquisitions. And in fact, we've just completed on the K+N deal. Indeed, I've been acquired myself on a couple of occasions. That gives us a great perspective, an appreciation of what goes into making a very smooth and a successful integration.  But really, in the initial environment, we're just going to focus on our core business in North America, in Asia Pacific, in Europe; in our current wheelhouse \u2014 e-fulfillment, reverse logistics, omnichannel, XPO Direct. We're in the largest and fastest growing verticals in retail and e-comm with bluest of blue-chip customers. Then, on top of all of that, we've got our leading position in automation and robotics. We're driving the full deployment of XPO Smart productivities. We've got plenty of things to be getting on with. But of course, we'll always be open to projects that will be accretive to our shareholder value.\nBrandon Oglenski: All right, Malcolm. I appreciate the thorough response.\nMalcolm Wilson: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you.\nBrad Jacobs: Okay, I see it's 9:30. The market is opening up. We very much appreciate the hour we got to spend with you all. Obviously, we had a fantastic quarter. Good job team XPO, we have a lot of wind to our back especially from e-commerce, from the outsourcing trend, from the significant investments we've made in technology over the year. We need to stay focused and keep executing well. Thank you for your support. Talk to you in three months, everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Malcolm Wilson",
            "content": "Thank you, Brad, and good morning to everyone. I'm very excited about our momentum in Europe. Our logistics business has fully recovered from COVID and our transportation business is most of the way back. Our European logistics business operates in 15 countries and we're a leader in many important verticals. Foremost among these is e-commerce, where we are the first European outsourced provider of logistics.  Across e-commerce and all of our verticals, we're helping our customers accelerate their adoption of new technology. We have a large and growing population of robots in our warehouses and the benefit of our XPO Smart productivity tools. We believe we'll see large upside to productivity when XPO Smart is fully utilized in all of our logistics sites.  To give you an idea of our operating landscape in Europe, we have the bluest of blue chip customer bases, with an average customer relationship of between 5 and 10 years. Some of these relationships go back 30 years or more. As we infuse more technology into our operations, the tenure is growing. Ten-year contracts are becoming quite normal now.  As is the case in the US, COVID has created a real appreciation for the critical importance of supply chains throughout Europe. During the past four years, our senior management team have delivered 12% CAGR in logistics gross margin, while tackling big projects in a variety of market environments. The company has been very resilient through the pandemic.  We started our highly automated Nestle\u0301 facility in the UK during the height of COVID last year, while maintaining stringent safety measures. This brought the facility online in time to deliver an excellent peak season performance. We also started new operations for several omnichannel retailers including the luxury brand Kering in Northern Italy, where we launched a large campus of automated warehouses, also in the peak of COVID.  Although new lockdowns were implemented in many countries in the fourth quarter, governments have been much more thoughtful about how they apply these measures. The latest restrictions were designed to keep commerce moving. We've seen no material impact to our business.  As for Brexit, we've experienced only minimal impact there as well. Our logistics business in the UK has been unaffected by the changes in the trading relationship with the rest of Europe as our UK sites largely serve customers who sell to UK consumers.  And with our UK Transportation business, Brexit has actually worked in our favor. We have been able to record costs related to border delays, and some of our competitors have exited the lanes going into the U.K, so we've picked up share.  Looking forward, we have several new high-profile projects starting in 2021. One notable logistics contract is with Nutricia, Danone's healthcare products business. This will be a fully automated facility in the Netherlands. And finally, we're very excited to have completed the acquisition of the majority of Kuhne & Nagel's UK contract logistics business, which gave us the opportunity to welcome nearly 6,000 new colleagues serving three strategic verticals; tech and e-commerce, food service and beverages. We've also onboarded many new customers with the acquisition. These blue-chip brands operate across Europe, and we are already seeing new business opportunities with them. The tech customers in particular include many industry leaders, such as Virgin Media and BT. All the customers are high-quality relationships.  The transaction closed on January 1. The transition has gone smoothly and all customers and key employees have been retained. We had identified significant synergy benefits prior to the acquisition, and a number of these are already in process. We expect this acquisition to add more than $600 million to our annual revenue and drive significant synergies during 2021. All in, we have an enormous opportunity in front of us, and even more so as a separate company. I've had the pleasure of meeting some of you and I'm looking forward to spending time with more of you in the months ahead. Now, David will cover the results. Matt, it's Malcolm. I'll take that question, please. So, Allison, what we're seeing is really we're just able to capitalize on being the largest e-fulfillment provider in Europe, our reverse logistics returns management, the strength we have in omnichannel distribution and, of course, XPO Direct.  What we've seen through COVID is it's brought a new appreciation of just the critical nature of supply chain to our customers. And that's fueling our ability to sign longer-term contracts. So, in the past, 10 years would have been a long contract. Now, it's more and more the normal type of contract.  Customers are really wanting more and more technology in their operations. So, with more and more robots in our warehouses, collaborative robots, larger automation sortation centers. So, all of these are driving a very, very positive trend in terms of organic growth. And of course, technology brings productivity and that's enabling us also to improve EBITDA levels. I think it allows us to bring more to our relationship with our customers. It really moves us up the importance of the supply chain. So, we mentioned earlier, I think Matt mentioned about the warehouse of the future, that we successfully implemented in 2020. That project, in fact, was two years from the beginning to the end, involving a greenfield construction of the site, XPO deploying all of its skill set to turn a greenfield into a highly automated warehouse that was delivered on time and able to deliver an excellent performance at the peak of the season, even in a COVID environment. So, we're seeing really that customers are coming to XPO, really because of those experiences and that reputation that we have for delivering things on time in a reliable way, really making ourselves an integral part and assistance to their success also. Thank you, Amit. Just to remind, for quarter one, we're already tracking for our logistics business to be above 15% in adjusted EBITDA for quarter one, and 24% to 29% for the full year, in line with the business.  Going forward, if I consider the experience that we have, we can see a lot of potential for margin expansion. That's coming from more and more deployment of technology into our business. So, as Matt just explained, the productivity improvements that we get from at the cooperative robots and autonomous robots, it's really quite significant. We're also seeing significant productivity improvement from our XPO Smart productivity tools. So, these things combined give us great confidence that we can expand margins on the go forward. Right now, we're operating our business with high single digit (corrected by company after the call) EBITDA margins, and we expect that to have the ability to expand as we're rolling out these new technologies.

            "name": "Matt Fassler",
            "content": "Thanks, David, I'll review the fourth quarter operating results starting with our transportation segment. In North American LTL, we showed a solid progression in revenue trends throughout the quarter. Our tonnage per day accelerated to 1.6% growth, which was an improvement from the third quarter of almost six percentage points. Tonnage was positive in every month of the quarter.  We also saw a pickup in the trend of shipments per day, which were down 0.7% year-over-year. That's 3.3 percentage points better than Q3. Weight per shipment rose 2.6% year-over-year, which compares to flattish in Q3.  The pricing backdrop for LTL remains rational. Yield, excluding fuel, rose 1.5% year-over-year, consistent with our Q3 increase. Underlying yield trends improved quarter-to-quarter, offset by the increase in weight per shipment, which tends to impact reported yield numbers.  Growth in revenue per shipment, excluding fuel, improved to 3.8%, which is more than twice the growth rate we saw in the third quarter, and it accelerated through the fourth quarter. Growth in revenue per day, excluding fuel, also accelerated through the quarter to 3.1%. That picked up 5.7 percentage points from the third quarter.  Tonnage trends improved in all of our top seven verticals, which together comprise 85% of our throughput. Consumer verticals remained stronger than industrial. You'll recall that we're overweight industrial in LTL, and any improvement in the industrial economy is good for our business.  Our adjusted operating ratio of 83% compared to 82.3% a year ago. Excluding real estate gains, our adjusted OR improved to 84.5%, which was 130 basis points better than the fourth quarter a year ago. We've improved this fourth quarter metric for six consecutive years. Both operating ratios include a 60-basis point impact from COVID-related costs.  Adjusted operating income, ex-real estate increased by 11%. We also saw ongoing improvements in productivity in LTL. Our load factor increased by 3.1% year-over-year, and we were 3.7% more efficient in pickup and delivery than we were last year.  Internal adoption of our XPO Smart labor management tools in our LTL facilities increased by over 50% from the first quarter to the fourth quarter in 2020, contributing to our labor efficiency. We see big upside from this technology as it becomes fully utilized.  Our North American truck brokerage business delivered tremendous results. We generated a 76% year-on-year increase in revenue and a 110% increase in net revenue. Loads per day increased by 24%, sharply outpacing the market.  Net revenue per load increased by 69%. Net revenue margin rate increased by 300 basis points year-over-year to 18.6%.  As you might imagine, earnings for this business rose substantially. It marked a continuation of the strong performance we've generated for the past several quarters in truck brokerage.  There's a great story behind our volume growth in the second half of the year. We drove that growth by making a strategic decision to hire and train people at the bottom of the market. As demand rebounded and the environment became exceptionally tight, we were in a strong position to help our customers procure capacity. Our brokerage teams continue to leverage our XPO Connect digital platform to drive profits in tandem with our real-time pricing tools. We're also using API tools to generate quotes for some shippers. This is a relatively recent pricing channel for us. It's an efficient, touchless way to capture revenue and maintain our margin.  In the fourth quarter, we increased the number of API quotes we issued by about 45% quarter-over-quarter, which led to nearly twice the number of delivered loads negotiated through these tools. We're seeing year-over-year quarterly improvements in brokered loads per head. Even as we staff up, we're growing volume faster than headcount, again, because of XPO Connect.  And carrier adoption of the platform is on a strong upward trajectory. We've seen a 47% increase in downloads for our Drive XPO carrier app in the last the months, taking the cumulative total from 200,000 at the end of the third quarter to over 300,000 at year-end. We now have approximately 58,000 brokerage carriers registered on XPO Connect in North America and another 17,000 or so in Europe, and these numbers keep climbing.  Looking at our transportation segment overall, revenue increased by 13% year-over-year in the quarter and adjusted EBITDA increased by 8%. COVID costs impacted our EBITDA growth by two percentage points and lower gains from LTL real estate impacted it by eight percentage points. Turning to our logistics segment. We increased revenue 13% in the fourth quarter year-over-year. The biggest growth driver for contract logistics continues to be e-commerce, both in Europe and North America. There's been a lot written about the secular shift to online and omnichannel and we are seeing it firsthand.  Demand for e-fulfillment and returns management expertise is surging at our existing sites, and it's spurring new commercial opportunities. In 2020, we shipped about five times as many units using robotic automation than we did in the prior year.  Our European logistics business has excellent momentum. As the largest outsourced e-fulfillment platform in Europe, we're a natural place for e-commerce customers to turn. We see a lot of new business ahead as these customers seek out our scale and automation capabilities. Our European logistics revenue rose 19% in the fourth quarter year-over-year or 13% excluding the impact of FX. For the full year, consumer goods generated over 80% of the revenue in European logistics.  In North American logistics, our revenue grew 4% year-over-year and, importantly, it accelerated. While our strongest growth emanated from omnichannel retail, we also saw a big increase in consumer packaged goods.  There are also some challenges in the quarter. As e-commerce volumes surged over the course of an extended peak, warehouse employment rose 9% in December, and seasonal hourly wages spiked. The increase was sharp and sudden, with a 4% month over month pop in December alone. This led to higher compensation costs, particularly for seasonal labor.  In addition, COVID created some special constraints for launching new projects. We completed 11 start-ups in the fourth quarter versus eight a year ago. These required complex installations of equipment and technology, as well as permit inspections and testing, many of which ran into delays from COVID. This added to the cost of launching these customer projects, but the issues are temporary. Seasonal labor costs are abating, and our recent startups are running well. These new contracts will generate significant revenue and profit over the next five to ten years. We get asked a lot about our shared distribution network in North America. Well, XPO Direct had a terrific quarter, with its fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year profit improvement. If XPO Direct was its own vertical, it would have been our fastest growing vertical in Q4 for the logistics business.  The benefits that are resonating most strongly with retailers and brands is that they can use the XPO Direct network to position their inventory close to end customers and to reposition it when demand patterns change. These shorten distribution times. We're onboarding numerous emerging and mid-sized firms who trust us to provide fulfillment services for their consumers. Returning to our global logistics business overall, we expect year-over-year profit growth in this business of at least 15% in the first quarter and growth of 24% to 29%, in line with our guidance for the company overall for the full year. And that's pretty much the theme of 2021 across all our lines of business. They were all off to a strong start in January.  Consumer spending growth remains strong, with the shift to e-commerce persisting and the industrial economy is beginning to regain momentum. We remain focused on driving share gains and efficiency through innovation.  In our warehouses, we plan to roughly double the number of robots in place over the course of this year, which will continue to deliver critical productivity improvements. XPO Smart is helping us drive consistent 5% to 7% productivity improvement in contract logistics labor, and it's improving dock productivity in LTL as well.  Also in LTL, our pricing algorithms are driving fully automated responses to 75% of the RFPs we receive. As you can see, automated pricing is a consistent theme throughout our transportation segment.  To give you a little color on January, in LTL, revenue growth ex-fuel continued to accelerate. Both tonnage growth and yield growth picked up further from Q4 levels. We successfully executed our annual GRI, and the pricing backdrop is constructive. We expect year-over-year adjusted OR improvement in Q1 with significant OR improvement for the full year. In truck brokerage, volume growth remains very strong in a tight market. This tightness is driven largely by the supply side, with ongoing congestion at some of the major ports and a driver shortage. There has been some loosening in capacity from the seasonal peak, which helps us with procuring capacity for our customers.  Our organic revenue growth in our logistics segment in January was consistent with fourth quarter levels. And again, our outlook for Q1 earnings growth in logistics is solidly positive. I'll close with a few of the accolades we received in the quarter. On the customer front, we received Dow's Sustainability Award for 2020 in road transportation, and we were named the GlobalTranz LTL Collaborator of the Year. We also won a Green Supply Chain Award from Supply & Demand Chain Executive magazine. Finally, we were named a World's Most Admired Company by Fortune magazine for the fourth straight year. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for your questions. Chris, it's Matt. Good morning. So, a couple of points on the revenue. Revenue moves around a lot due to exogenous factors like currency, FX, fuel, truckload rates. So we haven't guided to revenue this year, and we typically haven't guided to revenue.  We're off to a very strong start for the first quarter and the trends that you saw in the fourth quarter are pretty good sign all in of what we're seeing in Q1. But we expect strong balanced revenue growth over the course of the year, both for transportation and for logistics.  Keep in mind, as you model revenue for the year, that we closed the Kuehne + Nagel acquisition at the outset of the year. We're thinking of that as about $600 million to revenue over the course of the year. So, as you build your models, that's something to consider for the total number. All the comments I gave you about the tone of business are prior to considering the addition of K + N. The backlog for contract logistics is very strong. There are so many tailwinds for the contract logistics business. You think about the tailwinds from outsourcing. You think about the tailwind from industrial automation and the way we deploy our technology in our warehouses. Of course, you think about the tailwind from e-commerce, which, if anything, gained momentum as we made our way through 2020.  Certainly, the demand for incremental e-commerce projects is a very substantial part of our backlog. So, we have a strong backlog, both in North America and in Europe, as we look forward to 2021. And we expect that to be the case for years ahead. Sure. To answer the first part of your question, we do expect OR improvement in Q1, and we expect OR improvement of at least a couple of hundred basis points excluding real estate for the full year.  Now, in addition to tonnage, which you cited, and pricing, which you cited, we have a number of company-specific initiatives: continuing to drive dock productivity through XPO Smart; continuing to drive route optimization, both pickup and delivery and linehaul. These are company-specific initiatives that will help us on the cost front, in addition to the top line drivers that you cited. All of these are part of our game plan for achieving strong OR expansion this year and for achieving that LTL EBITDA target of at least $1 billion in 2022. Thank you. Allison, it's Matt. Two points to make. First of all, we're really in the early innings of optimizing pricing in LTL. We've made some good headway, but we have a lot more to go, particularly in terms of price elasticity.  Secondly, one of the skills that we've been developing in LTL, is the skill of assessing the OR profile of freight as we bring it into the network. So, one of the reasons we continue to drive strong OR improvement and we had very strong incremental margins in LTL in the fourth quarter year-over-year as we think about pricing in terms not just of yield, but also in terms of the OR profile of the freight we bringing in, and that is certainly been helping us drive that operating income improvement. You saw that 11% EBIT increase in LTL, excluding the impact of real estate. Clearly, our pricing work is one of the drivers of that improvement. Thank you. Sure. Scott, this is Matt. I'm happy to take that question. Think about the margin pressure that we saw in contract logistics in the fourth quarter of 2020 as an isolated incident related specifically to the two unique idiosyncratic factors that I discussed a moment ago. One of them relates to pressure on seasonal wages that we saw in the fourth quarter and the second relates to the challenge of starting up new business in a COVID environment.  And just to shed a little more light on that, some of the projects that we implemented in the second half of the year had very advanced automation at their core. As we installed some of this new machinery, we needed to move tech people around the country. We needed to get sign-off from municipalities. The inspection process was sometimes delayed, and we had to provide interim solutions that were quite labor-intensive and, going back to the prior issue, at a moment in time when labor was extremely expensive.  We did what we needed to do to deliver for our customers in the fourth quarter. It cost us some money. Happily, as we speak today, these issues are in the rearview mirror. We stated a moment ago that we expect adjusted EBITDA growth for contract logistics in the first quarter of at least 15%. We expect adjusted EBITDA growth for logistics in the 24% to 29% range for the year, consistent with our outlook for the broader company. So, we feel very good about the earnings outlook for the logistics business. Yes, happy to take that one as well. So, our last mile revenue grew 13% in the quarter. Our contribution dollars from last mile grew 15% year-over-year, and the contribution margin rate increased to 22% from 21.6%.  As you know, we're the largest outsourced provider of last mile logistics for heavy goods for most of the leading retailers and e-tailers out there \u2014 not a surprise, when customers tell us that our service metrics are best-in-class. Our claims frequency is astounding, 1 out of only 600 or so deliveries results in a claim. We bought and integrated this business from 2013 to 2015, as you know, before the industry really came to a high-profile notice. We had first-mover advantage here, really starting with one-of-a-kind platform in 3PD.  More recently, we've invested in world-class consumer-facing technology, which will really enhance the value proposition for our customers. So, a very strong close to the year for this business, to your point. Tom, it's Matt. Our brokerage headcount was up 20% year-over-year. To repeat a stat that I gave in my prepared remarks, our load count was up 24% year-over-year. So, we achieved improvement in productivity per rep, even as we staffed up. But the most important metric to integrate or synthesize with that picture are the increases that we drove in that margin per load which were substantial. And that tied to our ability to really invest time working for our customers, procuring capacity in a very dynamic market.  On your question on digital, at this point, all of our orders are running through the XPO Connect platform in one sense or another. This is the system that our customers and our carriers use for transacting business with us. So there's a digital element to everything that we're doing in brokerage.  And one of the great changes over the past year or two, is the way Connect has been integrated into the day-to-day business practices of our reps and that is contributing to their efficiency, contributing to better price discovery, and contributing to the margin and profit results that we delivered in the fourth quarter. Sure. We're almost halfway through the first quarter. We're doing extremely well in truck brokerage. Q1 will be spectacular, maybe not quite as spectacular as the fourth quarter, but it will be exceptionally strong. Typically, as you know, you would see a seasonal step down from the fourth quarter to the first quarter.  One thing to keep in mind on our recent hires, as the tenure of these new hires increases, they'll be more impactful. They will be able to transact more business than they did in the past. So, we think we're setting ourselves up here for a sustained period of success relative to the market. Intermodal had a massive recovery in the fourth quarter. Organic revenue per day was up low double digits. That was a nice acceleration from Q3. Loads per day were up 4%. This was the first positive quarter that we had in this metric in 2020. Gross margin per load was up 8%. And you can think about the recovery there, reflecting the tight truckload market, which leads to some conversion to intermodal and incremental demand from consumer and retail customers, particularly with that extended peak later in the year. Thank you. Jason, it's Matt. The industrial economy is still lagging the consumer economy, though it is beginning to recover. Our tonnage per day in January was stronger than our tonnage per day in the fourth quarter. And our expectation is that we will see improvement as the industrial economy continues to recover. Overtime, it can. I mean, we're continuing to see sixfold productivity improvement with goods-to-person robotics versus manual sites. We said earlier we shipped five times as many units using robotic automation technology. Year-on-year, we grew the number of robots in our warehouses by about four times, so there's some productivity improvement embedded within that for us. As you can see, we plan to double the number of robots that we have in 2021.  We have a first-mover advantage in goods-to-person robots. The cost of entry is high. Many customers are consequently outsourcing, that including to us. And robots are particularly critical in supporting large scale ecommerce rollouts in tandem with our workforce. It's a small number in the grand scheme of the CapEx guide that David gave you a moment ago, but it will grow over time as they emerge as a bigger part of our story. Thank you. So, a couple of points on that, and some of them are going to repeat, I think, the clear premises you have in your question. We do see a strong revenue performance in Q1 and for the year. We do expect substantial operating leverage in 2021.  We talked about K + N and it is coming in most likely at a lower EBITDA margin, but we're going to build that margin up over time through synergies. Your math is pretty good excluding K + N. We expect to generate incremental margins into the 20%s. It's early in the year. Let's see where we can take this. Thank you."

            "name": "David Wyshner",
            "content": "Thanks, Malcolm, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'd like to discuss our fourth quarter and full year results, our balance sheet and liquidity, some insights we gained during the pandemic, and our outlook for 2021.  In the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $4.7 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $449 million. Both figures reflect year-over-year increases despite the pandemic, and they are higher than we expected at the beginning of the quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA is an all-time fourth quarter record and reflects our commercial momentum and a continued strong recovery over the last six months.  As Brad mentioned, revenue grew 13% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. We incurred direct COVID-related costs of $9 million, and our gains on LTL real estate sales were $14 million versus $32 million last year. Excluding those two items, adjusted EBITDA in the quarter grew by 11%.  The holiday peak was long and strong. We saw robust consumer demand and a continuing rebound in industrial activity. As revenue increased, we began to benefit from the operating leverage inherent in our business. Matt will review our segment detail in a few minutes. Our adjusted earnings were $1.19 per diluted share in the quarter and increased year-over-year despite higher interest expense. We generated $193 million of cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter, spent $149 million on gross capex, and received $47 million of proceeds from asset sales. As a result, we generated free cash flow of $91 million in the quarter. We didn't repurchase any common stock in the fourth quarter, so we continue to have $500 million of authorized share buyback capacity.  For the full year, we generated revenue of $16.3 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 billion. Our adjusted earnings were $2.01 per diluted share.  For analysts who exclude amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets for comparison purposes, I'll note that our full year 2020 results include $0.96 of amortization expense related to intangibles. Going forward, we're going to add intangible asset amortization back in our calculations of adjusted EPS. We and many investors we've spoken with think that produces a more comparable and meaningful metric. With this modification, our 2020 adjusted earnings are $2.97 per diluted share. Our gross capital expenditures were $526 million in 2020, which reflects decisions we made in the second half of the year to resume capital spending in support of key initiatives. After considering our regular course asset sales, our net capital expenditures were $331 million in 2020. And importantly, our full-year 2020 free cash flow was $554 million.  Maintaining strong liquidity continues to be a top priority for us as an organization. Our cash balance at December 31 was $2.1 billion. This cash, combined with available debt capacity under committed borrowing facilities, gave us total liquidity of more than $3 billion at year-end. Our net leverage was 3.3 times LTM adjusted EBITDA.  We redeemed our 6.5% senior notes due 2022 in January, which reduced our debt and cash balances by an equivalent amount. We have no significant debt maturities until September 2023 and our liquidity position is strong. We've learned a lot over the course of the last year. The list of insights is a mile long but here are a few key takeaways.  Our business is incredibly resilient. Both our transportation and logistics segments have an ability to operate, rebound and prosper, even when circumstances are at their most challenging. In 2020, we also proved our agility by adjusting our expenses to changes in demand, even though the changes were sharp and unpredictable.  On a macro level, we're benefiting from the trends toward e-commerce, outsourcing and automation, all of which have accelerated. Transportation and logistics customers of all sizes see the advantages of working with strong partners like XPO. And in many cases, they also saw the risks associated with relying on firms that don't have the resources we do. And lastly, once the scope of the COVID impact on our end markets took shape, we were quick to take actions that strengthened our position in the recovery, like retaining people, securing new business and investing in technology. We saw an opportunity to grow rather than retrench and it has proven to be the right move. Turning to our outlook. Our guidance reflects the improved operating environment we saw in the fourth quarter, as well as our expectation that the effects of COVID will continue to moderate in 2021. All of our projections exclude impacts from our planned spin-off of our logistics segment.  As Brad highlighted, we expect to generate $1.725 billion to $1.8 billion of adjusted EBITDA in 2021 with growth of 24% to 29% in each of our transportation and logistics segments. Our outlook assumes ongoing COVID-related cost for at least the first six months of the year and lower year-over-year gains from LTL real estate sales.  We're optimistic that our base case scenario will prevail. That is that consumer demand will continue to be solid, e-commerce will continue to grow, industrial demand will continue to recover, and new business opportunities will continue to emerge. In the first quarter, we expect that our adjusted EBITDA will be in the low 20s as a percentage of our full-year adjusted EBITDA, which is consistent with our typical seasonality. On the cash flow front, we estimate that our full year free cash flow will be in the $600 million to $700 million range. We're targeting roughly $650 million of gross capital expenditures and $500 million of net capex, although both of these estimates could vary based on new business opportunities in our logistics segment.  We expect depreciation, excluding intangibles amortization, to be up slightly this year to $635 million to $655 million. With the repayment of our $1.2 billion of senior notes in January, we're forecasting $275 million to $285 million of interest expense in 2021, which represents a nearly $50 million year-over-year reduction. And we estimate that our effective tax rate will be in the 24% to 26% range, which is standard for us.  With nearly all of our outstanding convertible preferred stock having been converted into common stock in December, we'll have 113 million diluted common shares outstanding this year. As a result, we're projecting adjusted earnings of $5.10 to $5.85 per diluted share, representing 84% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. These figures all add back the intangibles amortization expense I mentioned. In sum, we delivered strong results again this quarter, ahead of both Street expectations and our own. We move into 2021 with the wind at our back, with robust liquidity, growing revenues, solid results in both segments of our business, and record adjusted EBITDA in each of the last two quarters despite the pandemic.  We remain enthusiastic about our prospects as a leader in the markets we serve. And we believe that we're proceeding toward our planned spin-off of our logistics business from a position of strength. I'll now turn things over to Matt."

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. Before the call begins, let me read a brief statement on behalf of the company regarding forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. During this call, the company will be making certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws, which by their nature, involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. A discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in the company's SEC filings. The forward-looking statements in the company's earnings release or made on this call are made only as of today, and the company has no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements, except to the extent required by law. During this call, the company also may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined under applicable SEC rules. Reconciliations of such non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are contained in the company's earnings release and the related financial tables. You can find a copy of the company's earnings release, which contains additional important information regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures in the Investors section on the company website. I will now turn the call over to Brad Jacobs. Mr. Jacobs, you may begin.\nBrad Jacobs: Thanks, Hector. Good morning, everybody. I'm here today with David Wyshner, our CFO; and Matt Fassler, our Chief Strategy Officer. And also for the Q&A portion of the call, we have Tavio Headley, our Vice President of Investor Relations; Ravi Tulsyan, our Treasurer; and Kyle Wismans, Senior Vice President of FP&A. We had solid beats versus consensus across the board in the third quarter. We beat revenue by $364 million or 9%. We beat on adjusted EBITDA by $87 million or 25%. We beat on adjusted EPS by 115%. And notably, we beat free cash flow by $173 million or 234%. The $430 million [Later changed by the Company to $439 million] of adjusted EBITDA we generated in the quarter brought us back to par with the same period last year and even a little bit better. That was a big swing. Our third quarter adjusted EBITDA was 2.5 times our second quarter adjusted EBITDA. I'm particularly pleased that our performance was broad-based. We rebounded to pre-COVID levels across our service lines and geographies. In LTL, we improved our adjusted operating ratio by 110 basis points year-over-year to 79.7%. That's the best adjusted operating ratio of any quarter in our history. Our performance in truck brokerage was off the charts with net revenue up 17%, and net revenue per load up 13%. We improved our last mile net revenue dollars by 15% and achieved a third quarter record net revenue margin of 35%. This was the seventh consecutive quarter that our net revenue margin in last mile was up year-over-year. Intermodal had a massive recovery in the third quarter. Organic revenue per day recovered from a 34% year-over-year decline in the second quarter to a 2% increase in the third quarter. We grew EBITDA in our logistics business year-over-year by 14% on a 5% increase in revenue. On the technology front, XPO Connect, XPO Smart and our LTL pricing algorithms and other technology innovations have been firing on all cylinders. On a personal note, it's bittersweet to see my good friend and our Chief Customer Officer, Greg Ritter, retire into the sunset of Colorado. Greg was the fifth person I hired at XPO, way back in 2011. He\u2019s been super instrumental in the company's success. He started our brokerage business from scratch. And today, it's the second largest broker in the Western Hemisphere. He also personally signed up dozens of customers who became some of our largest accounts. I'm grateful for his many accomplishments and wish him all the best in his retirement. I also want to mention the recent appointment of Alex Santoro to the newly created position of Chief Commercial Officer. Alex is turbocharging our global sales organization, overseeing everything from sales training, compensation plans, go-to-market strategy and, most importantly, keeping our customers delighted. So in sum, we had a remarkably good quarter. There are exciting trends in our favor, such as the growth in customer outsourcing and e-commerce, and it's gratifying to know that our years of investment in the business, especially technology, have put us in a strong position to support our customers through the ups and downs of the recovery. We have excellent momentum going into the fourth quarter and for 2021. With that, I'd like to turn it over to David.\nDavid Wyshner: Thanks Brad. And good morning everyone. Today, I'd like to discuss our third quarter results, our balance sheet and liquidity, and our outlook. In the third quarter, we generated revenue of $4.2 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $439 million. Both figures reflect year-over-year increases, despite negative impacts from COVID, and they are higher than we expected at the beginning of the quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA is an all-time third quarter record, and reflects cost saving actions we've taken throughout our operations in what has been a V-shaped recovery for our business. Amid the pandemic, our financial results have reverted to near-normal levels sooner than we had anticipated. The trend of sequential monthly improvement that began in May continued through the third quarter and across our business. Third quarter revenue increased 21% versus Q2. As revenue increased, we benefited from operating leverage inherent in our business and from actions we've taken over the last six months to reduce our costs. Matt will review our segment detail in a few minutes. Our adjusted earnings were $0.84 per share in the quarter. Our year-over-year EPS comparison was negatively impacted by a higher-than-usual effective tax rate this year, as well as increased interest expense. We generated $298 million of cash flow from operations in Q3, spent $122 million on CapEx, and received $71 million of proceeds from asset sales. As a result, we generated positive free cash flow of $247 million in the quarter. This brings our year-to-date free cash flow to $463 million, which represents a year-over-year increase of $56 million. We've been able to generate positive free cash flow during the pandemic by closely managing our working capital. We became even more disciplined about collections in the COVID environment, working with our customers to limit our receivables and staying disciplined with respect to payment terms we provide. We didn't repurchase any shares in the third quarter, so we continue to have $500 million of authorized share buyback capacity. In April, as you know, we throttled back our planned capital expenditures dramatically. In the third quarter, we resumed some projects as our outlook for operating cash flow strengthened and new business opportunities rebounded. We estimate that our gross CapEx will be $530 million to $550 million this year, which is up from our July estimate of $450 million to $475 million, but still represents a reduction of 14% from our pre-pandemic plan. And we estimate that as a result of our regular course asset sales, our net capital expenditures will be $330 million to $350 million this year. Maintaining strong liquidity continues to be a top priority for us as an organization. We repaid $400 million of borrowings under our ABL facility in the third quarter, and those funds continue to be available to us if we wish to access them. Our cash balance at September 30 was $2 billion. This cash combined with available debt capacity under committed borrowing facilities gives us total liquidity of more than $3 billion. Our net leverage at September 30 was 3.4 times adjusted EBITDA. We have no significant debt maturities until mid-2022. Our liquidity position is strong. Turning to our outlook. Our guidance reflects the improved operating environment we saw in the third quarter, when we had a sharp sequential rebound in revenues and adjusted EBITDA, as well as our current estimates of the continuing effects from COVID. We expect to generate $400 million to $410 million of adjusted EBITDA in Q4 even with the typical fourth quarter pressure on margin from our business mix and lower year-over-year gains from LTL real estate sales. We're optimistic that demand will continue to be solid as many of our consumer-facing customers anticipate a strong holiday peak, particularly in e-commerce. The year-over-year decline in fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA that we're forecasting is entirely due to lower LTL real estate sale gains and COVID costs, which together represent a headwind of $25 million to $30 million. On the cash flow front, we\u2019ve generated more than $460 million of free cash flow so far this year. And we estimate that our full year free cash flow will be roughly $500 million. This implies lower free cash flow in Q4 than in Q3, largely due to our decision to resume some capital projects we had put on hold and to working capital movements. Approximately $60 million of free cash flow came in Q3 rather than Q4 due to the timing of working capital. This past quarter, we successfully delivered year-over-year growth in revenue and EBITDA even though COVID and the uneven economic conditions associated with the pandemic continue to impact our business. Our third quarter results are a credit to our colleagues around the globe who proved to our customers that we can rise to challenges and serve them well in any climate. Our liquidity is strong and our free cash flow generation is robust. In addition, we continue to invest in our business in order to drive efficiency and differentiate our service offerings. We're delivering on the objectives we laid out six months ago and we're positioning our business for future growth. As a result we are enthusiastic about our prospects as a leader in the markets we serve. I'll now turn things over to Matt.\nMatt Fassler: Thanks David. I'll review the third quarter operating details, starting with our Transportation segment. In North American LTL, we showed a solid progression in tonnage and revenue through the quarter. Tonnage was down 4% in the third quarter with July down 6%, August down 4%, and September down 2%. Our LTL shipments were 4% lower than last year, which was relatively consistent through the quarter with weight per shipment improving through the quarter and tracking in line with last year's performance. These trends in LTL reflected the ongoing strength in consumer spending, particularly e-commerce. The consumer continues to lead the U.S. economy. We also saw improvement in industrial production, notably in auto, as our customers resumed production after the Q2 shutdowns. The pricing backdrop for LTL remains rational. Yield, excluding fuel, rose 1.7% year-over-year, consistent with the Q2 increase. As Brad mentioned, we posted a record quarterly operating ratio for LTL. Our adjusted OR improved to 79.7%, which was 110 basis points better than the third quarter a year ago. Excluding real estate, we achieved an OR of 82.5%, 100 basis points better than a year ago. Both operating ratios include a 50 basis point impact from COVID-related costs. We also saw terrific improvements in productivity in LTL. Our load factor increased by 2.1% year-over-year and we were 3.7% more efficient in pickup and delivery than we were last year. We are reducing LTL cost per stop by providing P&D planners and dispatchers with the visibility to lower costs during route planning. Our freight brokerage business delivered outstanding results. The star here was our truck brokerage business where we generated a 17% increase in net revenue and a 13% increase in net revenue per load, outperforming the market. The truckload market got tighter through the quarter and by September was as tight as we'd ever seen. It was a dynamic environment and our team seized the opportunity with fantastic results. We honored our contracts, taking losses where we needed to, and our customers rewarded us with high-margin spot business. The leaders of our brokerage effort have had every job in the business from procurement to customer engagement to tracking loads. And our incentive plans reward our reps for profitable volume and customer satisfaction. Our performance was aided by XPO Connect and our other proprietary technology across brokerage. Our Drive XPO carrier app had 60,000 downloads in Q3 which was nearly double the number of Q2 downloads. Cumulative downloads of the app now exceed 200,000, which is more than three times higher than the download count at this time last year. And active customer users on Connect have jumped 94% since the start of the year. Our intermodal business also rebounded from Q2 levels. The year-over-year decline in intermodal edged towards flat in the third quarter, with the rebound led by the resumption of automotive. We also saw increased demand for intermodal from retail customers, in part, because of higher truckload rates. Our last mile business was a standout in the quarter. We grew last mile revenue 11% year-over-year, powered by strong growth in e-commerce, the shift in consumption to goods from services, and a growing consumer focus on the home environment. We saw notable growth in furniture, appliances and other home improvement goods, as well as exercise equipment, with much of it served through our last mile hub network. These market dynamics contributed to our 15% growth in last mile net revenue in the quarter and increased our net revenue margin by 160 basis points to a third quarter record of 35%. In European transportation, revenue was down 3% year-over-year, which was a 26 percentage point improvement from the second quarter's year-over-year growth rate. European LTL and brokerage had the strongest performance of our major service lines. On a country basis, our transportation business in Spain recovered to pre-COVID levels and then some, followed by France, while the U.K. continued to lag. Importantly, we're getting significant traction in Europe with XPO Connect. We now have more than 4,000 customers registered on XPO Connect in Europe, and plan to onboard thousands more by year-end. Turning to our Logistics segment, we increased revenue 5% in the third quarter, year-over-year, and realized meaningful operating leverage. This helped to grow adjusted EBITDA in the segment by 14%. Key drivers of our revenue growth in Logistics include the global acceleration of e-commerce, which increases both fulfillment and returns, as well as an increase in the customer trend toward outsourcing and the rapid growth of supply chain automation. We excel in all of these areas and we're actively engaged in discussions with customers on many new business opportunities. Our XPO Smart labor management tools are driving productivity across our operations. We've rolled out the technology to about 80% of our supply chain sites in North America, and about 50% in Europe, with ongoing rollouts underway. Initially, we saw productivity gains of 5% or better from deployments of XPO Smart, and now our warehouse managers are realizing additional gains beyond the first year of adoption. Our European logistics revenue rose 12% in the third quarter, year-over-year, or 7%, excluding the impact of FX. Consumer verticals generated 82% of revenue in European logistics. And within consumer, the largest areas were e-commerce and food retail, positioning us for current trends and the long run. Several large new contracts are contributing to revenue growth in European logistics. Our operations at Nestl\u00e9's 'warehouse of the future' are fully launched, as is our service for Waitrose, which was a major win earlier this year. In North American logistics, where our mix is a bit more diversified beyond the consumer, our revenue was down 6% year-over-year, but that was a significant rebound from the second quarter. We had a tailwind from the reopening of brick-and-mortar retail, and from some of our industrial customers, with restocking activity coming back in both of these verticals. We're also serving growing demand in omnichannel retail and the consumer-packaged goods. We expect to see our revenue continue to improve in North American logistics as more of our customers return to pre-COVID levels, we onboard new wins and we lap the exit of some lower margin contracts. Our XPO Direct distribution network continues to thrive in this environment. The downsizing of U.S. retail activity and the emergence of more direct-to-consumer brands are driving a surge in opportunities for this unique shared-space network. XPO Direct has operated in the black all year and we saw a nice year-over-year profit improvement in the third quarter. Looking forward, across our business, the shift in consumer spending to goods from services continues to aid in the freight markets. The retail peak has started earlier with more holiday shopping expected to take place via e-commerce. Brick-and-mortar shopping is likely to be spread over a longer period of time as well, as consumers look to avoid crowds. Our supply chain and last mile operations will be the biggest beneficiaries. As we moved into October, we saw a continuation of the solid trends that underpinned our performance in Q3 even as COVID has ebbed and flowed. Consumers, businesses and governments have a much better understanding of how to operate safely. At XPO, we've shown that we operate at a high level under the most trying conditions, and fulfill our responsibilities to our customers. Applying that same forward lens to our service offerings, in North American LTL, growth in tonnage and revenue per day accelerated in October, with tonnage turning positive year-over-year. We expect our fourth quarter OR, excluding real estate, to be equal to or better than last year. We believe that the industry's LTL tonnage trends are healthy, especially considering that industrial production is still soft. If the industrial economy moves into expansion mode, our LTL business is capable of significantly more acceleration. Looking at our other transportation lines, in truck brokerage, the market remains tight. Net revenue per load in October was robust and load growth accelerated. In intermodal, capacity is also tight. This is expected to persist. In last mile, consumer demand for heavy goods remains strong, propelled by secular shifts to large e-commerce purchases and direct-to-consumer sales of fitness equipment, appliances, and mattresses. In European transportation, activity tracked in line with Q3, and the same is true in our logistics segment, where our activity levels and sales opportunities are robust. Finally, we remain very focused on our 10 profit improvement initiatives. Pricing optimization, margin expansion in European logistics, the high efficiency of XPO Connect in brokerage and last mile, and our XPO Smart labor analytics were all particularly effective. I'll close with a few of the accolades we received in the quarter, starting with Whirlpool awarding us with Intermodal Carrier of the Year for 2020. We also received the Maytag Dependability Award for superior results in reverse logistics. In addition, we received a Gold World Excellence Award from Ford for our Managed Expedite service and we were just named Supplier of the Year by Owens Corning. XPO was designated a bronze-level Military-Friendly Employer by Viqtory, that's Viqtory with a Q, for helping connect veterans with career opportunities. As we prepare to move on to Q&A, we know there's been speculation in the media about our M&A activity. We're not going to address questions about potential acquisitions or divestitures on this call. With that, I'll turn it back to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Seidl: Impressive quarter. I wanted to talk a little bit about the overall exposure to e-commerce/retail. In the past you've talked about it at 25% levels. Clearly, just the market itself is growing exponentially and you have some very good products out there in the marketplace that are probably allowing you to take market share above market growth rates. Where should we see that number growing over time?\nMatt Fassler: Jason, this is Matt. We continue to expect that number to move higher as a proportion of our mix. You spoke about some of the products that we have that are well positioned to help us take more share in that arena. I'd really focus on a couple of different avenues. First of all, e-commerce is a critical driver of our business in global contract logistics. We have the leading - we are the leading e-fulfillment platform in Europe. We're a leader in reverse logistics globally and a disproportionate amount, in a good way, of our forward revenue opportunities for global contract logistics come from e-commerce. Secondly, as you know, we are the U.S. leader in last mile for heavy goods, and this has been an outstanding place to be this year obviously, but there is a terrific secular opportunity. It relates to - certainly relating to the growth of e-commerce and to changing consumer habits. Also our scale here is a critical advantage in terms of procuring capacity, offering the best combination of loads and business opportunities to our carriers. Finally, within LTL, kind of an emerging opportunity, we're seeing more and more impact of consumer and within that e-commerce driving LTL, that certainly is beginning to help us here as we exit 2020 and enter 2021. So very optimistic about our ability to capitalize on this secular trend.\nJason Seidl: That's good color and that goes well into my next question here as the follow-up on the LTL. You guys continued to impress there. I mean, that's a great operating ratio. I've covered XPO Freight/Con-way for a long, long time. I wanted to know sort of where are you at with some of the productivity measures that you guys outlined for us a couple of quarters ago, and sort of how much left do you think you can squeeze out of the margin and sort of get to that sort of top level that one of your peers keeps raising the bar on.\nMatt Fassler: Jason, it's Matt. I'm happy to grab that one as well. We have a lot of room to go. We have a number of initiatives within the 10 levers that we've discussed that relate to LTL. Pricing and revenue management is a terrific opportunity for us in LTL. We've talked about the impact of XPO Smart on labor productivity and we continue to see improvement in dock productivity driven by Smart, in somewhat earlier stages, but gaining momentum, our route optimization for P&D and linehaul. As you know, we have a $1 billion adjusted EBITDA target for LTL in 2022 and embedded in our path to that target is realization of some of the opportunities that we just discussed.\nOperator: Your next call comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nAllison Poliniak: Just following on the last question, looking at your growth through the lens of your technology investments, is there a way to help quantify what percent of growth or above market growth of business wins were attributed to some of those technology investments here?\nDavid Wyshner: Allison, it's David. It's really hard to point to one particular item like technology in terms of a new business win, but it's clearly having an impact, and in our case, a very positive impact. It's differentiating us in conversations with customers and I think, in many cases, helping us get over the finish line and helping us also in terms of other elements of the negotiations we have with our customers because our technology gives us a differentiating factor. And that's really one of the reasons why we\u2019ve made the decision to step back up our technology and capital spending compared to how we had cut it back at the start of the pandemic. We see opportunities for strong returns on investment associated with that technology spending across our business.\nAllison Poliniak: And then just on the lines of the new hires that you announced this summer. Certainly, still early in their tenure here, but any unique insights that they brought to the company over the past few months that are sort of having you look at the company and the business model a little differently here?\nBrad Jacobs: Yes, hi, Allison. It's Brad. So you're referring to Eduardo and Alex. Eduardo has been focusing on revenue management, on LTL efficiency initiatives and procurement, amongst other things, but those three are the big things. And lots of progress on those, and a lot of high expectations going forward. Alex, we gave an additional responsibility recently to be Chief Commercial Officer, because he was looking at our organization and saying we could do it a little bit differently, we could structure the sales force differently, we could have the reporting lines a bit different, we could do this with training, we could do this with compensations, maybe we could refine our go-to-market strategy here. And these are all fresh ideas and we said, okay, go run with it. So we also have high expectations for him as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Wetherbee: Maybe a little bit more specific on the LTL outlook for 2021. I know it's early yet still, but when you think about the operating ratio sort of puts and takes, it seems like you have some COVID expenses, which I guess may or may not stick around for an extended period in 2021, but you'll begin to lap those at least in the back half of the year. But then you have tonnage turning positive and then presumably pricing getting a little bit stronger given what's going on with the truckload backdrop. So can you talk a little bit about sort of how you would view sort of natural incrementals in that business in the circumstances that I just outlined, I guess, keeping in mind too that there is the gain on sales that you have to comp to? So when you think about putting all that together, how should we be thinking about incrementals in that business next year?\nDavid Wyshner: Sure, Chris. It's early for us to be talking about 2021 and we expect to provide our guidance there in February when we announce full-year results. But the points you raised I think are the right ones to be thinking about. This past quarter, COVID costs were probably a 0.5 point headwind and at some point in 2021, we expect that that to go away. That's a 0.5 point on operating ratio. Clearly our tonnage was down 4% in the third quarter and it was significantly impacted early in the quarter by COVID. So we see the opportunity for volumes to be stronger. We've seen yield be fairly consistent, up a couple of points or so year-over-year for a while, and our hope would certainly be that, that yield continues to be a headwind - a tailwind, a favorable item for us going forward. We've seen the ability to drive load factor and dock productivity and overall productivity up over time. And we've been doing that even up against the challenges of COVID which produced some inefficiencies, some loss of network density and so forth. And as a result, while the direct COVID costs were only about a 0.5 point impact on our operating ratio, we could certainly make the case that the broader COVID impact is greater than that. So, well, again it's too early for us to predict or project specifically on 2021. I do think that there are a number of tailwinds or things that were headwinds this year that should go away as we move into next year.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay, that's helpful. I appreciate the color on that. And then on the logistics - contract logistics business, margins improved nicely. You got some operating leverage back into that business as the revenue came back. It had some, I mean, key business wins that you've outlined benefit the top-line here. As those continue to sort of mature, how should we think about the margin profile of that business in general? Will those new contracts and sort of the pipeline that you're building generally be accretive or does that have a bit of a dampening effect as you get some of these businesses up and running and realize other start-up costs kind of associated with that? Just trying to get a sense of how that plays through the contract logistics margins.\nA \u2013David Wyshner: Yeah, we feel good about the new business that we're bringing on. We also feel good about a couple of contracts that we've stepped away from because they were low margin over the last year or so. So I think as we look forward, we're enthusiastic about how we're positioned. And the same as LTL, some of the - COVID has had some negative impacts on efficiency in our business and I think as those ameliorate over the next year or so, ideally over the next six months, as COVID impacts become less, that will be helpful to us as well. But I think the - I think our ability to differentiate ourselves in terms of automation and technology that we bring to bear is really helpful to us as we negotiate contract renewals and new business and that can be helpful to us from a margin perspective going forward over time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nBrandon Oglenski: I guess, I don't want to get too nitty-gritty on the EBITDA outlook for the fourth quarter, but Matt or Brad, it does feel kind of sequentially like a normal pattern seasonally for you guys from 3Q to 4Q. Can you just talk about the puts and takes here with I think lower expected sale gains and maybe what you're assuming for kind of like normal underlying acceleration in the economy?\nDavid Wyshner: Sure. It's actually David. I'll take that one. The decline that we have sequentially is a typical - actually a little bit less than a typical Q3 to Q4 margin decline that we have. And when we look at EBITDA year-over-year, the decline is entirely due to lower LTL real estate gains and COVID costs. So from that perspective, excluding those two items, we'd be essentially flat year-over-year in terms of our EBITDA. And when we look at the sequential trends and adjust for items like that, what we see is that our decline is actually less than we would typically see moving sequentially from Q3 to Q4.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay, I appreciate that, David. And I guess if I were to just annualize that you guys are around $1.6 billion in annualized EBITDA, when should we start thinking about these 10 initiatives really starting to deliver on that $700 million to $1 billion target? And is it going to be linear or do you get it in chunks at a time?\nDavid Wyshner: Sure. We think we are delivering benefits already from the 10 levers, and they're helping us. They helped us this past quarter and they will continue to help us going forward. It's not perfectly linear, but I do expect these benefits to come in over time. And our goal our target our expectation is really to be at the $700 million to $1 billion run rate by the end of 2023. So we are expecting these to come in over-time and to produce benefits. And that's - and that will help us as we move into 2021.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nAllison Landry: So just if we go back to the beginning of this year, and the original EBITDA guidance for 2020 I think implied around $1.8 billion of EBITDA. And just as we look at the second-half run rate, you're sort of tracking pretty close to those levels. And I know you don't want to give specific guidance, but maybe as a framework or starting-off point, is it reasonable to assume that 2021 could look like the original 2020 guidance?\nBrad Jacobs: We just don't want to give guidance yet for 2021. You got the COVID thing out there, you got the election thing, you got positive stuff going on with e-commerce, there's a lot of puts and takes and let's see how the world looks, but right now we're feeling very good. I mean, obviously, we had a very big rebounded quarter. And we got a lot of momentum continuing into the fourth quarter and let's wait a little bit until we get in a position to say what 2021 is going to look like. At the moment, right this second, it's looking very good. But some of that depends on things that have nothing to do with XPO Logistics.\nAllison Landry: And then just without commenting on the European logistics sales, could you give us an update on how you're thinking about capital allocation more broadly? Where do you stand as far as revisiting of strategic sale or asset sales versus re-engaging in M&A and are you more inclined to consider one versus the other? Thank you.\nA \u2013Brad Jacobs: You're right, we're not going to comment on strategic alternatives on this call. In terms of, generally, capital allocation, it's the same choices that we've always had between M&A and CapEx and paying down debt and buying back shares and so forth. And our strategy is always going to be the same. Whatever is the best thing for our shareholders in terms of creating the most amount of shareholder value, that's what we'll do.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nAmit Mehrotra: David, I wanted to ask about free cash conversion relative to EBITDA. I think it was - if you look at the guidance this year, it implies kind of 37%, it was pretty much the same in 2019, plus a little bit higher, but pretty much the same. Is that the right way to think about it structurally for the business, mid-long term? And the reason I ask, obviously, because we're expecting - I think everybody is expecting nice growth, particularly in the logistics business next year. I know there may be some working capital investments that are disproportionately high as a result of that kind of mix shift, even though, I guess, maybe you guys have been doing actually a pretty good job on the working capital side. But I just want to understand, kind of, what's the right expectation for free cash conversion relative to EBITDA.\nDavid Wyshner: Yes, the way I think about it is the interest costs are essentially a fixed outlay that we have. And as a result, measuring that as a percentage of EBITDA will change depending on where our EBITDA is. So as our - as EBITDA rebounds, we're seeing the interest outlay portion go down a bit and so I think that will be helpful. Other than that item, I don't really see anything really impacting cash flow conversion a bit, but we will - but we should have the tailwind associated with - that you saw in Q3 where interest becomes a lower percentage of EBITDA as EBITDA rebounds. The other thing I would just point out is that you're right to look at free cash flow and free cash flow conversion on an annual basis. There is a fair amount of noise and volatility from quarter to quarter. So I do think it's very helpful to approach it the way you are - you were suggesting on more of an annual basis.\nAmit Mehrotra: So, just if I'm reading your comments correctly, then the working capital and CapEx evolution relative to EBITDA growth shouldn't be that materially different. Correct?\nDavid Wyshner: Yes, we're not giving a projection on 2021 yet. But, yes, that's correct.\nAmit Mehrotra: And then just a follow-up for me, David, the company has had this $0.5 billion cost opportunity out there for some time. I think that's 60% of the $700 million to $1 billion. The balance is revenue and pricing-driven, but this idiosyncratic cost opportunity is about $0.5 billion. You've brought in - the company has brought in kind of proven executors to go after that opportunity and then some. Do we start seeing more of a bending of the cost curve in 2021? I mean, you guys have talked about 23/77 fixed versus variable cost structure, that implies 30 percentage points - sorry, 30% of kind of incremental/decrementals at your margin level, but when do we start seeing some bending of that cost curve in the context of that idiosyncratic cost opportunity?\nDavid Wyshner: Yes, Amit, we're - it's a great point and I think it will be easier to see next year. We're actually generating benefits from the actions we've taken, whether it's XPO Smart labor planning and helping us manage costs from that perspective, the optimization initiatives that are going on, and even SG&A and back-office savings that we've been able to implement. Obviously, amid the pandemic the - seeing that amid all of the other moves in our - in revenues and costs is a bit harder, but we believe we're making progress there already, and I do think it will become even more evident over time. And one of the ways we'll be able to see that is as we look at 2021, compared to our last normalized year, which is 2019, I expect the benefits that we're generating and the efforts that Eduardo and Alex and I and a ton of other people in our operations are taking will be evident.\nAmit Mehrotra: So that's a great point. So what you're saying, if I read you correctly is, when we look at 2021, we should really compare the top-line of the revenue evolution from 2019 and kind of the contribution margins associated with hopefully that growth or whatever, even that contraction, hopefully not. The contribution margins associated with that change will reflect a better kind of implied drop-through than what the 23/77 fixed variable cost structure. Is that - am I reading you correctly?\nDavid Wyshner: Yeah. The comparisons to 2019, I think, not only for us, but for a lot of companies, are going to be a cleaner and easier to understand and, in our case, the benefits of various initiatives will be more evident as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Schneeberger: Could you please compare and contrast conditions in North America versus Europe thus far in the fourth quarter? And just with regard - they seem to be a little bit ahead of us, and hopefully we don't follow, in restrictions right now. So just curious, you have a pretty tight guidance range for the fourth quarter, only a 1.5 months to go. What are your considerations in the guidance for COVID impacts and timing of peak season? Thanks.\nMatt Fassler: So Scott, it's Matt. I'll take that with a couple of thoughts here. Obviously, in the third quarter, the economy saw a meaningful recovery both here and in Europe versus the second quarter. Each month was better than the next. The U.S., probably, from a macro perspective, talking about macro activity not COVID, is a bit ahead of Europe at this point in time. That's probably different from where we were a few months ago, where we had started to see Europe recover earlier. I think in both regions, the consumer is stronger than industrial. The Fed\u2019s industrial production number was down 7% in the third quarter, as I'm sure you saw. For the balance of the fourth quarter, if we see good momentum now, there's three things that we need to watch: how the virus evolves; how the government - how governments respond; and how people behave in reaction to that. We've considered in our guide the potential impact of some of the partial shutdowns that were announced in Europe over the weekend, understanding that the shutdowns are more limited and more protective of business and particularly the kinds of businesses where we have exposure. If there is impact, it\u2019s more likely to be travel, entertainment, leisure; less so, some of the fall-off for industrial, for example, that we saw in the second quarter. So we think if there is an impact and we do anticipate there could be some, it will be more limited for the areas that matter to us.\nBrad Jacobs: Matt\u2019s exactly correct. Each month in the quarter was better than the previous month. So there\u2019s a meaningful recovery taking place despite all this - these adverse things going on in the world. That's partly due to our own positioning because we have so much consumer and we have so much e-commerce. The demand for automation is strong and demand for outsourcing. People are outsourcing more than they were before the pandemic. So it's a lot of wind to our back here. Let's see how the good things that are about us overtake any bad things in the outside world or let's see if the bad things in the outside world get better.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks Matt and Brad, appreciate that. And then just a quick follow-up, XPO Direct, you touched on a little bit in prepared remarks, but looking for a progress report. Curious to see - obviously, it's probably very dynamic this time of year. Curious to see how you think that's tracking towards your long-term objectives. Thanks.\nA \u2013Matt Fassler: Scott, we're really happy with Direct. We saw our third consecutive quarter of solid profit growth. We're seeing a surge in revenue opportunities here as e-commerce continues to gain share versus brick-and-mortar retail. And when you think about Direct and the sweet spot for Direct, think about the growth from medium-sized consumer-facing firms who really want to leverage this network rather than develop their own distribution infrastructure for e-commerce. So growth from those kinds of players is really what's propelling both the growth and the additional opportunities that we see for XPO Direct.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nRavi Shanker: Brad, David or Matt, I know you guys don't quantify your pipeline of new business anymore, but can you just give us some color on kind of how that's looking? And also kind of relative to that, I'm not asking you for 2021 guidance, but if the world was relatively normal, do you think that pipeline can support GDP plus growth or go back to the 2017-'18 playbook of growing at like 2- or 3-times GDP?\nA \u2013Matt Fassler: I mean GDP plus is GDP plus, 2 to 3 times GDP is also GDP plus. So, clearly...\nA \u2013Matt Fassler: Yes, in a quarter like this one - by the way, our revenue growth nicely outperformed growth in global GDP. Global GDP year-on-year was down. GDP was down year-on-year in every major market in which we participated and our revenue as a company was up year-on-year. We see terrific revenue opportunity. We'll obviously guide to '21 when we get there and we'll also probably have a better sense of what global GDP might look like, certainly, a better sense than we do now for 2021. But we continue to expect our businesses, based both on the spaces that - in which we operate, the fastest growing areas of transportation and logistics, and our idiosyncratic revenue opportunities, to nicely outgrow the economies in which we operate.\nRavi Shanker: Great, thanks for the color. And as a follow-up, Walmart recently announced a plan to drop a trial of using robots to stock at store shelves and going back to humans instead. Are you surprised by this? Is this a one-off thing and as a leader in warehouse automation and robotics? I get that warehouses are different than stores, but are you seeing any trend either towards using robotics and automation or away from it, kind of, given the state of the current workforce?\nMatt Fassler: Ravi, it's Matt. We saw that news. I've seen those robots in action. Our - we have excellent momentum for the deployment of robotics in our warehouse. The way we use robotics in our contract logistics operations and the way an inventory tracking robot operates in a store are very, very different. We have excellent momentum up and to the right for the deployment of robotics, both in North America and in Europe in contract logistics. We feel very good about the productivity that we're getting from our goods-to-person and collaborative robots in that regard. Don't forget that a warehouse is a very controlled environment. You're not interacting with, bumping into consumers. This is a - we can really write our own ticket for how we want a traffic pattern and such to operate in the warehouse. The story is very, very different.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Ossenbeck: So, this a question about the investments that you start, and maybe for David. Could you just give us some sense as to what you're comfortable putting back in the play here even from a capital or technology perspective? And then as you look at these opportunities for the next couple of years, what do you think the capital intensity in the tech spending will be relative to the previous years to meet that potential growth especially compared to maybe a couple of years ago when you were scaling up some of the larger platforms and investments?\nDavid Wyshner: Sure. When we look at the fourth quarter, our guide for capital spending - gross CapEx for the full year of $530 million to $550 million implies potentially about $170 million of gross CapEx in Q4. And so that's sort of the ramp up and a little bit of catch-up that we're seeing in the fourth quarter. When we look ahead at technology spending, we continue to expect that to be a considerable part of our aggregate CapEx and we're really excited about the returns that are available to that. So I would expect that to be consistent with what we've been doing over the prior years, because we've been really happy with the returns, we're able to generate on that. I think the other thing to think about with respect to CapEx is the - that there is the potential for some lumpiness there over the next couple of years, particularly in contract logistics, based on the contracts we sign. So there are situations there where additional CapEx, if it happens, would be a good thing for us because it means we're bringing on attractive new customers. So that's an opportunity we'll continue to look at from a CapEx perspective going forward.\nBrian Ossenbeck: One quick follow-up on LTL. When you think about - maybe you can just give us the renewals for the quarter. If you gave it, I think I missed it. And then do you expect that, that can reach sort of the mid-single-digits next year similar to 2018 or do you think that can - you can potentially outpunch that with some of the focus you have on pricing, and then maybe it's not just to focus on price, but more of a holistic network approach with utilization and not just rate, when you look at the longer-term EBITDA target? Thank you.\nBrad Jacobs: Contract renewals in LTL were positive 4.4% in the quarter, so that's up from 3.7% in the second quarter. The pricing environment in LTL is good. It's very rational, it's very, very constructive. We're migrating more and more towards IT-generated pricing as opposed to human-generated pricing, and we are seeing great benefits in that from the get-go. And as we keep refining it and keep validating it, we're going to increase it, and I think that's the way with the future. That's a general trend across our whole business and across industries in general, is automation, AI, machine learning, taking the power of the computer and figuring out ways to use it, that is much better and more efficient, more productive and more profitable than humans. That's an inevitable wave in our opinion.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ari Rosa with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nAri Rosa: Congratulations on the strong results. So we saw a strong recovery, obviously, from second quarter with the benefit of a little bit of distance in terms of time. Maybe you could reflect on what went wrong in second quarter and how can investors get comfort that those kind of stumbles are unlikely to recur, especially as we see kind of rising COVID cases and lockdowns in Europe which you addressed a little earlier, Matt?\nA \u2013Brad Jacobs: I don't think we agree with the characterization that the second quarter was a stumble. In the second quarter, we didn't focus on profit, and we told people that. We told people right when COVID hit, we are going to put profit off to the side for a little while here and we're going to concentrate on the health and safety of our employees to the extreme in terms of investing money and also investing time - management time. So management's time across the organization, globally, was displaced from focusing on raising revenue, taking out costs, growing margins, generating free cash flow and all the things that - all the blocking and tackling that we normally do and do well. We put that to the side and we prioritized getting our arms around this new and potentially very deadly pandemic that was unfolding. And that's what we did. And we didn't cut salaries, we paid $48 million of direct COVID costs, we paid out a lot of employee appreciation bonuses. In LTL, we didn't furlough as much as some of our competitors did. We knew the business was going to come back. We didn't want to have to retrain newbies later. And in the second quarter, industrial business got much worse than retail. Obviously, the consumer was still buying stuff in the second quarter, but the industrial kind of shut down and we have a large amount of our business in LTL, in particular, that's industrial-related, so that hurt us. So industrial in LTL, and then industrial in European transportation, we have outsized exposures to. Sometimes that works for us and sometimes works against us. In the second quarter, that worked against us. So now you see in the third quarter, we've got all the things that we have to learn already behind us in terms of protecting our employees in an efficient way and we have the organization not compromising on that one iota, but also focusing on the blocking and tackling that we've done throughout the whole company that's generated the superior returns that we've done. So I feel very, very comfortable about where we are going into the fourth quarter and going into next year. And I'm just hoping that the world stays the sane as well.\nAri Rosa: And then just along those lines, we saw a bit of a step down in terms of SG&A expense on a sequential basis this quarter. I know there were some bonuses and things like that, that occurred in the second quarter speaking of taking care of your employees. But maybe you could talk about the sustainability of the SG&A line as a percent of revenue that we saw this quarter going forward.\nDavid Wyshner: Yes, there was a sequential step down and even so the third quarter had a number of items in it that were working against us. Our self-insurance costs are moving up a little bit, FX didn't impact the percentage, but it did impact the amount of SG&A expense we had year-over-year. And there is still obviously COVID-related cost - direct COVID-related costs that are impacting those numbers. So when we look at that, we actually still see some things that over time should abate and work in our favor.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question and answer session. And I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Brad Jacobs for closing remarks.\nBrad Jacobs: Well, thank you, operator, and thank you everyone for participating in our call. Obviously, it was really a great quarter and we look forward to talking to you again in three months. Have a great one. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Matt Fassler",
            "content": "Thanks David. I'll review the third quarter operating details, starting with our Transportation segment. In North American LTL, we showed a solid progression in tonnage and revenue through the quarter. Tonnage was down 4% in the third quarter with July down 6%, August down 4%, and September down 2%. Our LTL shipments were 4% lower than last year, which was relatively consistent through the quarter with weight per shipment improving through the quarter and tracking in line with last year's performance. These trends in LTL reflected the ongoing strength in consumer spending, particularly e-commerce. The consumer continues to lead the U.S. economy. We also saw improvement in industrial production, notably in auto, as our customers resumed production after the Q2 shutdowns. The pricing backdrop for LTL remains rational. Yield, excluding fuel, rose 1.7% year-over-year, consistent with the Q2 increase. As Brad mentioned, we posted a record quarterly operating ratio for LTL. Our adjusted OR improved to 79.7%, which was 110 basis points better than the third quarter a year ago. Excluding real estate, we achieved an OR of 82.5%, 100 basis points better than a year ago. Both operating ratios include a 50 basis point impact from COVID-related costs. We also saw terrific improvements in productivity in LTL. Our load factor increased by 2.1% year-over-year and we were 3.7% more efficient in pickup and delivery than we were last year. We are reducing LTL cost per stop by providing P&D planners and dispatchers with the visibility to lower costs during route planning. Our freight brokerage business delivered outstanding results. The star here was our truck brokerage business where we generated a 17% increase in net revenue and a 13% increase in net revenue per load, outperforming the market. The truckload market got tighter through the quarter and by September was as tight as we'd ever seen. It was a dynamic environment and our team seized the opportunity with fantastic results. We honored our contracts, taking losses where we needed to, and our customers rewarded us with high-margin spot business. The leaders of our brokerage effort have had every job in the business from procurement to customer engagement to tracking loads. And our incentive plans reward our reps for profitable volume and customer satisfaction. Our performance was aided by XPO Connect and our other proprietary technology across brokerage. Our Drive XPO carrier app had 60,000 downloads in Q3 which was nearly double the number of Q2 downloads. Cumulative downloads of the app now exceed 200,000, which is more than three times higher than the download count at this time last year. And active customer users on Connect have jumped 94% since the start of the year. Our intermodal business also rebounded from Q2 levels. The year-over-year decline in intermodal edged towards flat in the third quarter, with the rebound led by the resumption of automotive. We also saw increased demand for intermodal from retail customers, in part, because of higher truckload rates. Our last mile business was a standout in the quarter. We grew last mile revenue 11% year-over-year, powered by strong growth in e-commerce, the shift in consumption to goods from services, and a growing consumer focus on the home environment. We saw notable growth in furniture, appliances and other home improvement goods, as well as exercise equipment, with much of it served through our last mile hub network. These market dynamics contributed to our 15% growth in last mile net revenue in the quarter and increased our net revenue margin by 160 basis points to a third quarter record of 35%. In European transportation, revenue was down 3% year-over-year, which was a 26 percentage point improvement from the second quarter's year-over-year growth rate. European LTL and brokerage had the strongest performance of our major service lines. On a country basis, our transportation business in Spain recovered to pre-COVID levels and then some, followed by France, while the U.K. continued to lag. Importantly, we're getting significant traction in Europe with XPO Connect. We now have more than 4,000 customers registered on XPO Connect in Europe, and plan to onboard thousands more by year-end. Turning to our Logistics segment, we increased revenue 5% in the third quarter, year-over-year, and realized meaningful operating leverage. This helped to grow adjusted EBITDA in the segment by 14%. Key drivers of our revenue growth in Logistics include the global acceleration of e-commerce, which increases both fulfillment and returns, as well as an increase in the customer trend toward outsourcing and the rapid growth of supply chain automation. We excel in all of these areas and we're actively engaged in discussions with customers on many new business opportunities. Our XPO Smart labor management tools are driving productivity across our operations. We've rolled out the technology to about 80% of our supply chain sites in North America, and about 50% in Europe, with ongoing rollouts underway. Initially, we saw productivity gains of 5% or better from deployments of XPO Smart, and now our warehouse managers are realizing additional gains beyond the first year of adoption. Our European logistics revenue rose 12% in the third quarter, year-over-year, or 7%, excluding the impact of FX. Consumer verticals generated 82% of revenue in European logistics. And within consumer, the largest areas were e-commerce and food retail, positioning us for current trends and the long run. Several large new contracts are contributing to revenue growth in European logistics. Our operations at Nestle\u0301's 'warehouse of the future' are fully launched, as is our service for Waitrose, which was a major win earlier this year. In North American logistics, where our mix is a bit more diversified beyond the consumer, our revenue was down 6% year-over-year, but that was a significant rebound from the second quarter. We had a tailwind from the reopening of brick-and-mortar retail, and from some of our industrial customers, with restocking activity coming back in both of these verticals. We're also serving growing demand in omnichannel retail and the consumer-packaged goods. We expect to see our revenue continue to improve in North American logistics as more of our customers return to pre-COVID levels, we onboard new wins and we lap the exit of some lower margin contracts. Our XPO Direct distribution network continues to thrive in this environment. The downsizing of U.S. retail activity and the emergence of more direct-to-consumer brands are driving a surge in opportunities for this unique shared-space network. XPO Direct has operated in the black all year and we saw a nice year-over-year profit improvement in the third quarter. Looking forward, across our business, the shift in consumer spending to goods from services continues to aid in the freight markets. The retail peak has started earlier with more holiday shopping expected to take place via e-commerce. Brick-and-mortar shopping is likely to be spread over a longer period of time as well, as consumers look to avoid crowds. Our supply chain and last mile operations will be the biggest beneficiaries. As we moved into October, we saw a continuation of the solid trends that underpinned our performance in Q3 even as COVID has ebbed and flowed. Consumers, businesses and governments have a much better understanding of how to operate safely. At XPO, we've shown that we operate at a high level under the most trying conditions, and fulfill our responsibilities to our customers. Applying that same forward lens to our service offerings, in North American LTL, growth in tonnage and revenue per day accelerated in October, with tonnage turning positive year-over-year. We expect our fourth quarter OR, excluding real estate, to be equal to or better than last year. We believe that the industry's LTL tonnage trends are healthy, especially considering that industrial production is still soft. If the industrial economy moves into expansion mode, our LTL business is capable of significantly more acceleration. Looking at our other transportation lines, in truck brokerage, the market remains tight. Net revenue per load in October was robust and load growth accelerated. In intermodal, capacity is also tight. This is expected to persist. In last mile, consumer demand for heavy goods remains strong, propelled by secular shifts to large e-commerce purchases and direct-to-consumer sales of fitness equipment, appliances, and mattresses. In European transportation, activity tracked in line with Q3, and the same is true in our logistics segment, where our activity levels and sales opportunities are robust. Finally, we remain very focused on our 10 profit improvement initiatives. Pricing optimization, margin expansion in European logistics, the high efficiency of XPO Connect in brokerage and last mile, and our XPO Smart labor analytics were all particularly effective. I'll close with a few of the accolades we received in the quarter, starting with Whirlpool awarding us with Intermodal Carrier of the Year for 2020. We also received the Maytag Dependability Award for superior results in reverse logistics. In addition, we received a Gold World Excellence Award from Ford for our Managed Expedite service and we were just named Supplier of the Year by Owens Corning. XPO was designated a bronze-level Military-Friendly Employer by Viqtory, that's Viqtory with a Q, for helping connect veterans with career opportunities. As we prepare to move on to Q&A, we know there's been speculation in the media about our M&A activity. We're not going to address questions about potential acquisitions or divestitures on this call. With that, I'll turn it back to the operator for your questions. Jason, this is Matt. We continue to expect that number to move higher as a proportion of our mix. You spoke about some of the products that we have that are well positioned to help us take more share in that arena. I'd really focus on a couple of different avenues. First of all, e-commerce is a critical driver of our business in global contract logistics. We have the leading - we are the leading e-fulfillment platform in Europe. We're a leader in reverse logistics globally and a disproportionate amount, in a good way, of our forward revenue opportunities for global contract logistics come from e-commerce. Secondly, as you know, we are the U.S. leader in last mile for heavy goods, and this has been an outstanding place to be this year obviously, but there is a terrific secular opportunity. It relates to - certainly relating to the growth of e-commerce and to changing consumer habits. Also our scale here is a critical advantage in terms of procuring capacity, offering the best combination of loads and business opportunities to our carriers. Finally, within LTL, kind of an emerging opportunity, we're seeing more and more impact of consumer and within that e-commerce driving LTL, that certainly is beginning to help us here as we exit 2020 and enter 2021. So very optimistic about our ability to capitalize on this secular trend. Jason, it's Matt. I'm happy to grab that one as well. We have a lot of room to go. We have a number of initiatives within the 10 levers that we've discussed that relate to LTL. Pricing and revenue management is a terrific opportunity for us in LTL. We've talked about the impact of XPO Smart on labor productivity and we continue to see improvement in dock productivity driven by Smart, in somewhat earlier stages, but gaining momentum, our route optimization for P&D and linehaul. As you know, we have a $1 billion adjusted EBITDA target for LTL in 2022 and embedded in our path to that target is realization of some of the opportunities that we just discussed. So Scott, it's Matt. I'll take that with a couple of thoughts here. Obviously, in the third quarter, the economy saw a meaningful recovery both here and in Europe versus the second quarter. Each month was better than the next. The U.S., probably, from a macro perspective, talking about macro activity not COVID, is a bit ahead of Europe at this point in time. That's probably different from where we were a few months ago, where we had started to see Europe recover earlier. I think in both regions, the consumer is stronger than industrial. The Fed's industrial production number was down 7% in the third quarter, as I'm sure you saw. For the balance of the fourth quarter, if we see good momentum now, there's three things that we need to watch: how the virus evolves; how the government - how governments respond; and how people behave in reaction to that. We've considered in our guide the potential impact of some of the partial shutdowns that were announced in Europe over the weekend, understanding that the shutdowns are more limited and more protective of business and particularly the kinds of businesses where we have exposure. If there is impact, it's more likely to be travel, entertainment, leisure; less so, some of the fall-off for industrial, for example, that we saw in the second quarter. So we think if there is an impact and we do anticipate there could be some, it will be more limited for the areas that matter to us. Ravi, it's Matt. We saw that news. I've seen those robots in action. Our - we have excellent momentum for the deployment of robotics in our warehouse. The way we use robotics in our contract logistics operations and the way an inventory tracking robot operates in a store are very, very different. We have excellent momentum up and to the right for the deployment of robotics, both in North America and in Europe in contract logistics. We feel very good about the productivity that we're getting from our goods-to-person and collaborative robots in that regard. Don't forget that a warehouse is a very controlled environment. You're not interacting with, bumping into consumers. This is a - we can really write our own ticket for how we want a traffic pattern and such to operate in the warehouse. The story is very, very different."

            "name": "David Wyshner",
            "content": "Thanks Brad. And good morning everyone. Today, I'd like to discuss our third quarter results, our balance sheet and liquidity, and our outlook. In the third quarter, we generated revenue of $4.2 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $439 million. Both figures reflect year-over-year increases, despite negative impacts from COVID, and they are higher than we expected at the beginning of the quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA is an all-time third quarter record, and reflects cost saving actions we've taken throughout our operations in what has been a V-shaped recovery for our business. Amid the pandemic, our financial results have reverted to near-normal levels sooner than we had anticipated. The trend of sequential monthly improvement that began in May continued through the third quarter and across our business. Third quarter revenue increased 21% versus Q2. As revenue increased, we benefited from operating leverage inherent in our business and from actions we've taken over the last six months to reduce our costs. Matt will review our segment detail in a few minutes. Our adjusted earnings were $0.84 per share in the quarter. Our year-over-year EPS comparison was negatively impacted by a higher-than-usual effective tax rate this year, as well as increased interest expense. We generated $298 million of cash flow from operations in Q3, spent $122 million on CapEx, and received $71 million of proceeds from asset sales. As a result, we generated positive free cash flow of $247 million in the quarter. This brings our year-to-date free cash flow to $463 million, which represents a year-over-year increase of $56 million. We've been able to generate positive free cash flow during the pandemic by closely managing our working capital. We became even more disciplined about collections in the COVID environment, working with our customers to limit our receivables and staying disciplined with respect to payment terms we provide. We didn't repurchase any shares in the third quarter, so we continue to have $500 million of authorized share buyback capacity. In April, as you know, we throttled back our planned capital expenditures dramatically. In the third quarter, we resumed some projects as our outlook for operating cash flow strengthened and new business opportunities rebounded. We estimate that our gross CapEx will be $530 million to $550 million this year, which is up from our July estimate of $450 million to $475 million, but still represents a reduction of 14% from our pre-pandemic plan. And we estimate that as a result of our regular course asset sales, our net capital expenditures will be $330 million to $350 million this year. Maintaining strong liquidity continues to be a top priority for us as an organization. We repaid $400 million of borrowings under our ABL facility in the third quarter, and those funds continue to be available to us if we wish to access them. Our cash balance at September 30 was $2 billion. This cash combined with available debt capacity under committed borrowing facilities gives us total liquidity of more than $3 billion. Our net leverage at September 30 was 3.4 times adjusted EBITDA. We have no significant debt maturities until mid-2022. Our liquidity position is strong. Turning to our outlook. Our guidance reflects the improved operating environment we saw in the third quarter, when we had a sharp sequential rebound in revenues and adjusted EBITDA, as well as our current estimates of the continuing effects from COVID. We expect to generate $400 million to $410 million of adjusted EBITDA in Q4 even with the typical fourth quarter pressure on margin from our business mix and lower year-over-year gains from LTL real estate sales. We're optimistic that demand will continue to be solid as many of our consumer-facing customers anticipate a strong holiday peak, particularly in e-commerce. The year-over-year decline in fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA that we're forecasting is entirely due to lower LTL real estate sale gains and COVID costs, which together represent a headwind of $25 million to $30 million. On the cash flow front, we've generated more than $460 million of free cash flow so far this year. And we estimate that our full year free cash flow will be roughly $500 million. This implies lower free cash flow in Q4 than in Q3, largely due to our decision to resume some capital projects we had put on hold and to working capital movements. Approximately $60 million of free cash flow came in Q3 rather than Q4 due to the timing of working capital. This past quarter, we successfully delivered year-over-year growth in revenue and EBITDA even though COVID and the uneven economic conditions associated with the pandemic continue to impact our business. Our third quarter results are a credit to our colleagues around the globe who proved to our customers that we can rise to challenges and serve them well in any climate. Our liquidity is strong and our free cash flow generation is robust. In addition, we continue to invest in our business in order to drive efficiency and differentiate our service offerings. We're delivering on the objectives we laid out six months ago and we're positioning our business for future growth. As a result we are enthusiastic about our prospects as a leader in the markets we serve. I'll now turn things over to Matt. Allison, it's David. It's really hard to point to one particular item like technology in terms of a new business win, but it's clearly having an impact, and in our case, a very positive impact. It's differentiating us in conversations with customers and I think, in many cases, helping us get over the finish line and helping us also in terms of other elements of the negotiations we have with our customers because our technology gives us a differentiating factor. And that's really one of the reasons why we've made the decision to step back up our technology and capital spending compared to how we had cut it back at the start of the pandemic. We see opportunities for strong returns on investment associated with that technology spending across our business. Sure, Chris. It's early for us to be talking about 2021 and we expect to provide our guidance there in February when we announce full-year results. But the points you raised I think are the right ones to be thinking about. This past quarter, COVID costs were probably a 0.5 point headwind and at some point in 2021, we expect that that to go away. That's a 0.5 point on operating ratio. Clearly our tonnage was down 4% in the third quarter and it was significantly impacted early in the quarter by COVID. So we see the opportunity for volumes to be stronger. We've seen yield be fairly consistent, up a couple of points or so year-over-year for a while, and our hope would certainly be that, that yield continues to be a headwind - a tailwind, a favorable item for us going forward. We've seen the ability to drive load factor and dock productivity and overall productivity up over time. And we've been doing that even up against the challenges of COVID which produced some inefficiencies, some loss of network density and so forth. And as a result, while the direct COVID costs were only about a 0.5 point impact on our operating ratio, we could certainly make the case that the broader COVID impact is greater than that. So, well, again it's too early for us to predict or project specifically on 2021. I do think that there are a number of tailwinds or things that were headwinds this year that should go away as we move into next year. Sure. It's actually David. I'll take that one. The decline that we have sequentially is a typical - actually a little bit less than a typical Q3 to Q4 margin decline that we have. And when we look at EBITDA year-over-year, the decline is entirely due to lower LTL real estate gains and COVID costs. So from that perspective, excluding those two items, we'd be essentially flat year-over-year in terms of our EBITDA. And when we look at the sequential trends and adjust for items like that, what we see is that our decline is actually less than we would typically see moving sequentially from Q3 to Q4. Sure. We think we are delivering benefits already from the 10 levers, and they're helping us. They helped us this past quarter and they will continue to help us going forward. It's not perfectly linear, but I do expect these benefits to come in over time. And our goal our target our expectation is really to be at the $700 million to $1 billion run rate by the end of 2023. So we are expecting these to come in over-time and to produce benefits. And that's - and that will help us as we move into 2021. Yes, the way I think about it is the interest costs are essentially a fixed outlay that we have. And as a result, measuring that as a percentage of EBITDA will change depending on where our EBITDA is. So as our - as EBITDA rebounds, we're seeing the interest outlay portion go down a bit and so I think that will be helpful. Other than that item, I don't really see anything really impacting cash flow conversion a bit, but we will - but we should have the tailwind associated with - that you saw in Q3 where interest becomes a lower percentage of EBITDA as EBITDA rebounds. The other thing I would just point out is that you're right to look at free cash flow and free cash flow conversion on an annual basis. There is a fair amount of noise and volatility from quarter to quarter. So I do think it's very helpful to approach it the way you are - you were suggesting on more of an annual basis. Yes, we're not giving a projection on 2021 yet. But, yes, that's correct. Yes, Amit, we're - it's a great point and I think it will be easier to see next year. We're actually generating benefits from the actions we've taken, whether it's XPO Smart labor planning and helping us manage costs from that perspective, the optimization initiatives that are going on, and even SG&A and back-office savings that we've been able to implement. Obviously, amid the pandemic the - seeing that amid all of the other moves in our - in revenues and costs is a bit harder, but we believe we're making progress there already, and I do think it will become even more evident over time. And one of the ways we'll be able to see that is as we look at 2021, compared to our last normalized year, which is 2019, I expect the benefits that we're generating and the efforts that Eduardo and Alex and I and a ton of other people in our operations are taking will be evident. Yeah. The comparisons to 2019, I think, not only for us, but for a lot of companies, are going to be a cleaner and easier to understand and, in our case, the benefits of various initiatives will be more evident as well. Sure. When we look at the fourth quarter, our guide for capital spending - gross CapEx for the full year of $530 million to $550 million implies potentially about $170 million of gross CapEx in Q4. And so that's sort of the ramp up and a little bit of catch-up that we're seeing in the fourth quarter. When we look ahead at technology spending, we continue to expect that to be a considerable part of our aggregate CapEx and we're really excited about the returns that are available to that. So I would expect that to be consistent with what we've been doing over the prior years, because we've been really happy with the returns, we're able to generate on that. I think the other thing to think about with respect to CapEx is the - that there is the potential for some lumpiness there over the next couple of years, particularly in contract logistics, based on the contracts we sign. So there are situations there where additional CapEx, if it happens, would be a good thing for us because it means we're bringing on attractive new customers. So that's an opportunity we'll continue to look at from a CapEx perspective going forward. Yes, there was a sequential step down and even so the third quarter had a number of items in it that were working against us. Our self-insurance costs are moving up a little bit, FX didn't impact the percentage, but it did impact the amount of SG&A expense we had year-over-year. And there is still obviously COVID-related cost - direct COVID-related costs that are impacting those numbers. So when we look at that, we actually still see some things that over time should abate and work in our favor."

            "name": "Brad Jacobs",
            "content": "Thanks, Hector. Good morning, everybody. I'm here today with David Wyshner, our CFO; and Matt Fassler, our Chief Strategy Officer. And also for the Q&A portion of the call, we have Tavio Headley, our Vice President of Investor Relations; Ravi Tulsyan, our Treasurer; and Kyle Wismans, Senior Vice President of FP&A. We had solid beats versus consensus across the board in the third quarter. We beat revenue by $364 million or 9%. We beat on adjusted EBITDA by $87 million or 25%. We beat on adjusted EPS by 115%. And notably, we beat free cash flow by $173 million or 234%. The $430 million [Later changed by the Company to $439 million] of adjusted EBITDA we generated in the quarter brought us back to par with the same period last year and even a little bit better. That was a big swing. Our third quarter adjusted EBITDA was 2.5 times our second quarter adjusted EBITDA. I'm particularly pleased that our performance was broad-based. We rebounded to pre-COVID levels across our service lines and geographies. In LTL, we improved our adjusted operating ratio by 110 basis points year-over-year to 79.7%. That's the best adjusted operating ratio of any quarter in our history. Our performance in truck brokerage was off the charts with net revenue up 17%, and net revenue per load up 13%. We improved our last mile net revenue dollars by 15% and achieved a third quarter record net revenue margin of 35%. This was the seventh consecutive quarter that our net revenue margin in last mile was up year-over-year. Intermodal had a massive recovery in the third quarter. Organic revenue per day recovered from a 34% year-over-year decline in the second quarter to a 2% increase in the third quarter. We grew EBITDA in our logistics business year-over-year by 14% on a 5% increase in revenue. On the technology front, XPO Connect, XPO Smart and our LTL pricing algorithms and other technology innovations have been firing on all cylinders. On a personal note, it's bittersweet to see my good friend and our Chief Customer Officer, Greg Ritter, retire into the sunset of Colorado. Greg was the fifth person I hired at XPO, way back in 2011. He's been super instrumental in the company's success. He started our brokerage business from scratch. And today, it's the second largest broker in the Western Hemisphere. He also personally signed up dozens of customers who became some of our largest accounts. I'm grateful for his many accomplishments and wish him all the best in his retirement. I also want to mention the recent appointment of Alex Santoro to the newly created position of Chief Commercial Officer. Alex is turbocharging our global sales organization, overseeing everything from sales training, compensation plans, go-to-market strategy and, most importantly, keeping our customers delighted. So in sum, we had a remarkably good quarter. There are exciting trends in our favor, such as the growth in customer outsourcing and e-commerce, and it's gratifying to know that our years of investment in the business, especially technology, have put us in a strong position to support our customers through the ups and downs of the recovery. We have excellent momentum going into the fourth quarter and for 2021. With that, I'd like to turn it over to David. Yes, hi, Allison. It's Brad. So you're referring to Eduardo and Alex. Eduardo has been focusing on revenue management, on LTL efficiency initiatives and procurement, amongst other things, but those three are the big things. And lots of progress on those, and a lot of high expectations going forward. Alex, we gave an additional responsibility recently to be Chief Commercial Officer, because he was looking at our organization and saying we could do it a little bit differently, we could structure the sales force differently, we could have the reporting lines a bit different, we could do this with training, we could do this with compensations, maybe we could refine our go-to-market strategy here. And these are all fresh ideas and we said, okay, go run with it. So we also have high expectations for him as well. We just don't want to give guidance yet for 2021. You got the COVID thing out there, you got the election thing, you got positive stuff going on with e-commerce, there's a lot of puts and takes and let's see how the world looks, but right now we're feeling very good. I mean, obviously, we had a very big rebounded quarter. And we got a lot of momentum continuing into the fourth quarter and let's wait a little bit until we get in a position to say what 2021 is going to look like. At the moment, right this second, it's looking very good. But some of that depends on things that have nothing to do with XPO Logistics. Matt's exactly correct. Each month in the quarter was better than the previous month. So there's a meaningful recovery taking place despite all this - these adverse things going on in the world. That's partly due to our own positioning because we have so much consumer and we have so much e-commerce. The demand for automation is strong and demand for outsourcing. People are outsourcing more than they were before the pandemic. So it's a lot of wind to our back here. Let's see how the good things that are about us overtake any bad things in the outside world or let's see if the bad things in the outside world get better. Contract renewals in LTL were positive 4.4% in the quarter, so that's up from 3.7% in the second quarter. The pricing environment in LTL is good. It's very rational, it's very, very constructive. We're migrating more and more towards IT-generated pricing as opposed to human-generated pricing, and we are seeing great benefits in that from the get-go. And as we keep refining it and keep validating it, we're going to increase it, and I think that's the way with the future. That's a general trend across our whole business and across industries in general, is automation, AI, machine learning, taking the power of the computer and figuring out ways to use it, that is much better and more efficient, more productive and more profitable than humans. That's an inevitable wave in our opinion. Well, thank you, operator, and thank you everyone for participating in our call. Obviously, it was really a great quarter and we look forward to talking to you again in three months. Have a great one. Thank you."

I will now turn the call over to Brad Jacobs. Mr. Jacobs, you may begin.\nBrad Jacobs: Thank you, operator. Good morning everyone. In addition to my remarks today, you will hear from David Wyshner, our Chief Financial Officer; Matt Fassler, our Chief Strategy Officer and also, for the Q&A portion of the call, we have Tavio Headley, our Senior Director of Investor Relations; Meghan Henson, our Chief Human Resources Officer; Ravi Tulsyan, our Treasurer and Kyle Wismans, SVP of FP&A. The second quarter was dominated by the severe challenges of COVID-19. Nevertheless, we did deliver better-than-expected revenue, adjusted-EPS, adjusted EBITDA and, notably, free cash flow. For us, the trough was in April in both North America and Europe. Since then, we've seen a recovery in Europe with a more recent rebound in North America, and all of our sites are open. Each month in the quarter showed sequential improvement across our operating regions. Organic revenue for the company as a whole has gone from being down 21% in April year-over-year to down just 10% in June, and we\u2019ve continued to gain ground in July. The improvement has been broad-based in both transportation and logistics. In North American LTL for example, our tonnage per day was down 24% in April year-over-year, but down only 13% in June. We continue to regain tonnage in July. In Europe our LTL pallet count per day at the end of June was up from the trough in France by 49% and in Iberia by 44%. The U.K. was up 25% from the trough. And our European logistics business came back strong in the quarter, with a 7% increase in year-over-year revenue per day in the month of June. These are all positive trends going into the back half of the year. I also want to mention the three executive appointments we made this week. Eduardo Pelleissone is our new Chief Transformation Officer and Alex Santoro is Executive Vice President of Operations. These are two rare, talented operators who will work with our business leaders to turbocharge our profit improvement initiatives. We're excited to have them both onboard. I'm also extremely pleased that we have our first Chief Diversity Officer in LaQuenta Jacobs. LaQuenta has an impressive record as a champion of diversity at blue chip companies. She\u2019ll be leading initiatives that are high priorities for us, reporting directly to me. So to wrap it up, I\u2019m proud of the extraordinary focus our organization has placed on keeping our employees safe throughout the pandemic while keeping supply chains moving for our customers. There are still a lot of unknowns with COVID, but our positioning is strong. For years we've been investing in our vision for the future of supply chains, including our e-commerce capabilities, intelligent automation of warehouses and customer solutions that are in high demand for outsourcing. These industry trends have been accelerated by the pandemic. Finally, I want to say again how grateful I am to our employees for their intense dedication in such unusual times. It\u2019s a privilege to lead Team XPO. And with that, I'll turn the presentation over to David. David.\nDavid Wyshner: Thanks Brad and good morning everyone. Today I'd like to discuss our second quarter results, our balance sheet and liquidity and our outlook. In the second quarter we generated revenue of $3.5 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $172 million and an adjusted loss per share of $0.63. All three figures reflect year-over-year declines due to COVID, but they are all better than we expected at the beginning of the quarter. Matt will review the segment detail in a few minutes. We generated $214 million of cash flow from operations in Q2, spent $116 million on CapEx and received $23 million of proceeds from asset sales. As a result, we generated positive free cash flow of $121 million in the quarter. This brings our year-to-date free cash flow to $216 million, which represents a year-over-year increase of $66 million, despite our having $75 million of cash outflows this year related to our exploration of strategic alternatives. We've been able to generate positive free cash flow during the pandemic by managing working capital aggressively, turning our receivables into cash. We became even more disciplined about collections in the COVID environment, working with our customers to reduce our receivables and staying disciplined with respect to payment terms. We continue to use trade receivables programs, including our European Securitization, to manage our working capital. We didn't repurchase any shares in the second quarter, so we continue to have $500 million of authorized share buyback capacity. We throttled back our planned capital expenditures dramatically at the start of the quarter, but have begun to reopen the spigot a bit as demand and new business opportunities have rebounded. We currently estimate that our gross CapEx will be $450 million to $475 million this year, which is up from our May estimate of around $400 million, but down about 26% from our pre-pandemic plans. And we estimate that as a result of our regular course asset sales, our net capital expenditures will be $250 million to $300 million this year. Even though financial markets have normalized significantly over the last four months, maintaining strong liquidity continues to be a top priority for us as an organization. We issued $1.15 billion of 6.25% five-year senior notes in April and May. The proceeds are part of our $2.3 billion cash balance at June 30. This cash, combined with available debt capacity under committed borrowing facilities, gives us total liquidity of $2.8 billion at quarter end. Our net leverage at June 30 was 3.5x adjusted EBITDA, which is in the middle of our targeted range of 3x to 4x. We have no significant debt maturities until mid-2022. Our liquidity position is strong. In the second quarter, our adjusted EBITDA was right in line with what you would expect based on the combination of our second quarter 2019 results, a 17% year-over-year reduction in revenue due to the pandemic, the 77% variable 23% fixed breakdown of our expenses and the nearly $50 million of COVID related costs we incurred. We've been seeing sequential improvement from month-to-month since April with that favorable trend continuing in July. Revenues in the first half of the month were down high single digits year-over-year. And we estimate that our COVID related costs will be $10 million to $25 million in Q3. Based on these conditions, we expect to generate at least $350 million of adjusted EBITDA, including COVID related costs in the third quarter. This means we're positioned to outperform the results that would be implied by a high single-digit year-over-year revenue decline and our mix of variable and fixed costs. This is because of benefits that we expect to realize in Q3 from operating initiatives, restructuring programs and other cost saving actions that we've implemented. On the cash flow front, with us having generated more than $200 million of free cash flow in the first half, we continue to be confident in our ability to deliver hundreds of millions of dollars of free cash flow this year. Lastly, COVID-19 clearly dominated the second quarter of 2020. Revenues bottomed in April and have been recovering ever since. Throughout the quarter we protected our employees, kept serving our customers and adjusted our variable costs to align with dramatic declines in demand. We also solidified our liquidity, continued to generate significant positive free cash flow, implemented cost saving actions that will benefit future quarters and invested in technology. As a result, we expect the third and fourth quarters to be much stronger than Q2, and we are enthusiastic about our longer term prospects as a leader in the markets we serve. With that, I'll turn things over to Matt.\nMatt Fassler: Thanks David. I\u2019ll review the second quarter income statement and shed some more light on the trends we've seen in July. Starting with our transportation segment; segment revenue was down 22.6% in the quarter year-over-year and organic revenue was down 19.3%. Adjusted EBITDA declined by 60%. This included $27 million of costs related to COVID, primarily in our North American LTL unit. LTL tonnage per day declined by 19% in Q2 versus the prior year, primarily due to weak activity levels in industrial, manufacturing and automotive. April was the trough and the business gained momentum as we moved through the quarter. While we did well in consumer staples, this vertical was not enough to offset the shut down in the industrial economy. As industrial sectors reopened, our trends improved. LTL tonnage was down year-over-year by 23.5% in April, 20.8% in May and 12.8% in June. Improvement continued in July. Yield, excluding the impact of fuel improved 1.9% year-over-year. Yield growth in July is in line with Q2. Our LTL price increases on contract renewals remain solid, up 3.7%, which kept us on pace with the Q1 increase. Our adjusted operating ratio in LTL was 90.1% for the quarter, compared with 88.3% a year ago. The biggest driver of the change was lower tonnage, and we also had a negative impact of about 250 basis points from $20 million of COVID costs. These drags were offset in part by the improvement in yield. We are also effective at controlling key variable costs, including P&D, dock operations and line haul. Our XPO Smart productivity tools are proving valuable in this environment. Bear in mind that this was just the second full quarter since XPO Smart was rolled out nationally in our LTL network. The analytics are driving up dock productivity by 6.5% on average year-over-year. We're encouraged by the early results and we expect the improvements to compound going forward.  We also grew load factor by 3.9% and improved empty miles by 24%, better than the 15% decline in shipments. We expect the combination of a better revenue outlook and strong expense management in LTL to produce a significant sequential improvement in adjusted operating ratio in Q3, with much more modest year-over-year erosion. Within our freight brokerage business, truck brokerage delivered a strong performance in a volatile market. Revenue fell 8%, but net revenue rose 3%. Brokerage volumes troughed in May and rebounded strongly in June. And we posted solid year-over-year increases in net revenue margin each month in the quarter. We procured capacity exceptionally well, buying at a 7.5% discount to the market, aided by the pricing tools within our XPO Connect platform. XPO Connect continues to drive significant efficiencies in our truck brokerage service. In the second quarter the load count was essentially flat with Q2 last year and we handled it with 14% less headcount. Intermodal revenue was down sharply, reflecting the shutdown in automotive production. Intermodal revenue trends began to recover in June and have improved significantly in July as truckload capacity tightened. Last mile was a real highlight for us in the quarter. Revenue increased 3% year-over-year, while net revenue dollars rose 11%. Net revenue margin rate in last mile increased by 270 basis points to a record 37%. And here again, revenue trends accelerated as the quarter progressed. Our last mile specialization in heavy goods continues to benefit from the growth of e-commerce, and we saw strong demand for home improvement goods and exercise equipment. This was partially offset by slower appliance installations due to COVID restrictions. Turning to Europe. In our transportation business, Q2 revenue declined by 29% versus the prior year, organic revenue which excludes the impacts of FX and fuel was down 23% for the quarter as a whole. Importantly, the year-over-year trend in organic revenue growth became more positive throughout the quarter. We were down 37% in April when the government lockdowns in Europe sharply curtailed our automotive, industrial and chemical customers. We rebounded to a 20% decline in May and a 14% decline in June. The theme for the quarter in European transportation was \u201cfirst in, first out\u201d. Among our larger countries, France and Spain locked down first and recovered first. The U.K. locked down several weeks later. The timing of the U.K. trough recovery is tracking later as well, and the curve of the recovery there has been more subdued. Overall, July market conditions have continued to improve for European transportation. Moving on to our logistics segment. The contractual nature of this business mitigated the impact of COVID, as did our vertical mix and the embedded relationships we have with key customers. Logistics segment revenue was down 8% year-over-year for the quarter and organic revenue declined 6.5% \u2014 again, improving each month. Adjusted EBITDA declined 39%, including the impact of $19 million of COVID costs. In North American logistics, revenue declined 11% versus Q2 last year. We had solid growth in e-commerce and omni-channel retail, along with good results in consumer packaged goods and consumer technology. This was offset by the elimination of lower margin business and by temporary shutdown requests from a number of our customers. At the peak of the pandemic, 8% of our sites were impacted by closures, and now all of our sites are up and running. In logistics, as in LTL, our proprietary XPO Smart tools are driving productivity and cost efficiency. Nearly two-thirds of our warehouses utilize XPO Smart and we're seeing an average labor productivity improvement of 5%. Some individual sites are much higher. This tech is still in the early innings of the value it can bring to the business. Also, I\u2019m pleased to report that XPO Direct, our shared space distribution network, operated solidly in the black for the second consecutive quarter. The secular growth in e-commerce is driving more opportunities with omni-channel retailers. In Europe, logistics revenue declined by 6% year-over-year. FX had a negative impact of about 2.6 percentage points on revenue. Importantly, organic revenue for European logistics turned positive in the month of June. Consumer verticals represent about 85% of our European contract logistics revenue, with the vast majority related to either e-commerce or food and beverage. Consumers leaned into these verticals during the pandemic and we were happy to keep those goods flowing. We're encouraged by how well this business is performing and we see additional opportunities to grow the top and bottom lines. We\u2019re rolling out XPO Smart across Europe to drive labor productivity in our logistics warehouses. We had a soft opening for our warehouse of the future in the U.K. last month, which kicked off a 15-year contract with Nestl\u00e9. And the trend toward near-shoring creates additional potential business for us. Our acquisition of logistics operations from Kuehne + Nagel in the U.K. is on track to close this fall. That's an overview of the operating trends that underlie our Q2 results. Moving down the income statement, interest expense was $82 million in the quarter, versus $72 million a year ago. Our GAAP effective tax rate rose to 35% from 24% a year ago. Our weighted average diluted share count was $91 million. In a loss-making quarter, diluted shares outstanding don't include common stock equivalents. Our basic share count was down slightly from Q1 and from the year-ago number, reflecting the impact of our first quarter share repurchase activity. Our diluted loss per share was $1.45 for Q2 versus earnings per share of $1.19 a year ago, and our adjusted diluted loss per share was $0.63 versus EPS of $1.28 a year ago. I want to note two items in our reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics. We incurred $50 million in pre-tax restructuring costs in the quarter, primarily for severance. The pandemic led us to take a deeper dive into our cost structure and significantly reduce our overhead costs, particularly in Europe. This will drive approximately $100 million of annualized cost improvement. We expect to achieve this run rate by the middle of 2021. The other item is the $46 million we booked in transaction and integration expenses in the quarter, primarily associated with our exploration of strategic alternatives. The largest piece of this relates to employee retention. To summarize the second quarter, we responded to the pandemic by taking care of our employees, looking after our customers, protecting our liquidity and cash flow and rightsizing our variable cost to market conditions. As David mentioned, the adjusted EBITDA we delivered was in line with our mix of fixed and variable costs. In Q3, we remain focused on all of these critical efforts. At the same time, our operating environment is becoming increasingly stable and we're directing more of our attention to our strategic profit initiatives, particularly XPO Connect and other technologies that can leverage the return of demand. We now have more than 62,000 truckload carriers registered on XPO Connect globally. Downloads of our Drive XPO app grew 87% in the three months of Q2 versus Q1, and now exceed 150,000 downloads in total. And we more than doubled the number of customers on the platform in the same period. In LTL, we continue to make headway with our pricing initiatives, particularly as we gauge price elasticity, digging deeper into the full cost profile of each RFP. And we\u2019re expanding the data we use to optimize the line-haul portion of LTL in terms of visibility, compliance and routing. The opportunities within contract logistics are also compelling. Our capabilities with advanced automation are both a driver of new business and a competitive advantage. Customers who explore in-house robotics options often come to the conclusion that the cost of entry is high and the solutions can be tough to implement. Our first-mover advantage with goods-to-person systems and collaborative robots is leading companies to outsource these projects to us. Another tailwind in contract logistics is that retailers are coming to us for more e-commerce capacity. In the short run, customers need interim capacity to manage peaks in demand, especially since the pandemic has made buying patterns less predictable. For the mid-term, they\u2019re interested in arranging additional distribution centers for supplemental capacity on a regional basis. And longer term, retailers and brands are assessing transformational changes that de-risk their logistics networks. We can meet all of these needs. I\u2019ll close by mentioning a few other highlights of the quarter. XPO was once again recognized by Gartner, which named us a worldwide leader in their magic quadrant of 3PL providers. This was the third straight year that we were designated a leader by Gartner. Also in the quarter, we were proud to provide critical support to the City of New York\u2019s Office of Emergency Services during the peak of the pandemic. And the Tour de France race is scheduled to start on August 29 in Europe. 2020 marks the 40th anniversary of our partnership with this celebrated event. We're proud to help bring some much-needed sport to the world stage. Not only will our trucks and drivers cover every kilometer of the course \u2014 for the first time two of our ecofriendly, natural gas powered trucks will be at the finish line with the competitors arrive in Paris. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator and we look forward to your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you and our first question is coming from the line of Ravi Shankar with Morgan Stanley.\nRavi Shankar:\nBrad Jacobs:\nRavi Shankar:\nMatt Fassler:\nRavi Shankar:\nBrad Jacobs:\nRavi Shankar:\nBrad Jacobs:\nRavi Shankar:\nBrad Jacobs:\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions.\nAllison Landry:\nA - Brad Jacobs: Good morning, Allison. I wouldn't guide to 3.7% yield, because that contract renewal rate is part of our business, but not all of our business. But we are seeing positive yield. So, 1.9% positive yields in the quarter was helpful and the yield trends were positive every month. It wasn't enough though, even with a couple of points of yield, to overcome a tonnage decline of 19%. When you have tonnage decline of 19% \u2014 you can do all kinds of great stuff, but you\u2019re going to have to be able to overcome that, given the fixed-cost nature of the LTL business and the operating leverage. But Q2 tonnage also shows an improving trend. Tonnage was down in April 24% year-over-year; it was down 21% year-over-year in May. It was down only 13% in June, and here in July it\u2019s down single digits. So, there's a decent trend there. And there were some bright spots in LTL ,despite the poor OR. Load factor was up 3.9%. It was the highest load factor we\u2019ve had in eight years. Empty miles improved 24% year-over-year versus shipments being down 15%. Dock productivity was up 6.5%. And I would point you to our guidance for Q3. One of the reasons why we're going to generate at least $350 million of EBITDA in the third quarter is that we fully expect our OR in Q3 in LTL to be substantially better than it was in Q2. I feel that we're fully on track to achieve at least $1 billion of EBITDA. We have pushed that out from 2021 to 2022, and you'll see steady progress between now and there, getting to that level.\nAllison Landry:\nA - Brad Jacobs: Okay, so there was this one whale in Europe and there were two whales here in the United States. In the U.K., we signed a $250 million contract that starts October 1. It's a 5-year contract in transportation, it\u2019s delivery of chilled dairy products to stores and it\u2019s with Arla Foods. In the United States, we had two big e-comm wins and these will be some of the most automated warehouses in the world. So, we have one new e-comm fulfillment center on the west coast for a global branded apparel company. It is our largest site in the United States \u20141.2 million square feet. It's a five-year contract. It started this month and it's on its way to ramp up to 400 robots. And then we also have another large e-comm fulfillment center on the west coast for a global fashion retailer. That starts in September. It's also over 1 million square feet, also highly automated and that will be ramping up to 500 robots. So, we have some good momentum in the backlog on commercial wins.\nAllison Landry:\nA - Brad Jacobs: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Wetherbee:\nA \u2013 Matt Fassler: Chris, its Matt. A couple of points on that. First of all, as you start off by looking at the third quarter and you look at the EBITDA guidance and you think about the kind of revenue trend that we generated in July, you'll see that the decremental margins that are embedded in that are better than the decremental margins that we generated in Q2, and better than the decremental margins implied by that 77/23 math that we spoke about last call and that David mentioned earlier today. Secondly, as you emerge from the downturn, obviously we have flexed our variable costs. We are starting to make more headway with fixed costs. Fixed is probably a slightly higher percentage of your cost structure after a down year than it would have been going into a down year. So that implies the potential for more operating leverage to the upside, particularly, obviously, when you cycle a very unusual quarter like the one that we had in Q2, which obviously will be a big part of the \u201821 story. We\u2019re not going to talk much about \u201821 yet, but obviously that's the way the arithmetic works. So, to reiterate, the third quarter will be a substantially better performance on that front than the second quarter and then, emerging from a down revenue year, you have the opportunity to generate better incrementals than you\u2019d have in an average year. Plus, we have the 10 levers and the progress that those are likely to bring us above and beyond that.\nChris Wetherbee:\nA - Brad Jacobs: We are hugely excited about the 10 levers. This is a massive potential to literally transform the business. You\u2019re already seeing some benefits, but you'll see continuous quarter-after-quarter, year-after-year benefits from the 10 levers and, in 2023, we will have achieved a substantial part of that profit pool. We had a quarterly operating review a couple of weeks ago for three days, and a good part of that was going over the 10 levers and crowd sourcing everyone on each lever. What do you think? What do you think is the highest? What do you think is the lowest? What do you think is the likely? And, collectively we're feeling very good about each one of those levers. If you look at Smart, this has already helped us variablilize and manage labor costs nimbly. The labor productivity that improved 6.5% year-over-year in the second quarter, we would not have been able to do that without Smart. Smart improved the labor productivity in our contract logistics facilities by about 5% already and we\u2019re looking to improve on that going forward. So, I think the benefits will just keep compounding going forward. In truck brokerage, Connect helped us handle the same number of loads this quarter year-over-year, but with 14% lower headcount. So, that's an important lever. When you can get that kind of productivity from a sales force, that's really, really helpful. Look at procurement. In procurement, we've got about $8 billion or so of non-labor expenses. Adding Eduardo and Alex, they are going to be a big help with that. They\u2019ve got a lot of experience with that. On pricing, we're in the early innings of what we can deliver. We used pricing within Connect this quarter to buy 7.5% better than DAT. So, we bought 7.5% better than the market, due to the technology we're using on Connect. There is a big opportunity on pricing and LTL as well, for pricing elasticity and more automation on that. And in LTL, you have the process improvements in terms of optimizing line-haul and P&D spend, so we\u2019re very excited about the levers. The core of our strategy is to deliver substantial, long-term shareholder value, as we have. And our focus is on allocating capital in ways that achieve the best risk-adjusted returns. These 10 levers are a very, very, very important part of that strategy.\nChris Wetherbee:\nBrad Jacobs:\nOperator: Thank you.

            "name": "Matt Fassler",
            "content": "Thanks David. I'll review the second quarter income statement and shed some more light on the trends we've seen in July. Starting with our transportation segment; segment revenue was down 22.6% in the quarter year-over-year and organic revenue was down 19.3%. Adjusted EBITDA declined by 60%. This included $27 million of costs related to COVID, primarily in our North American LTL unit. LTL tonnage per day declined by 19% in Q2 versus the prior year, primarily due to weak activity levels in industrial, manufacturing and automotive. April was the trough and the business gained momentum as we moved through the quarter. While we did well in consumer staples, this vertical was not enough to offset the shut down in the industrial economy. As industrial sectors reopened, our trends improved. LTL tonnage was down year-over-year by 23.5% in April, 20.8% in May and 12.8% in June. Improvement continued in July. Yield, excluding the impact of fuel improved 1.9% year-over-year. Yield growth in July is in line with Q2. Our LTL price increases on contract renewals remain solid, up 3.7%, which kept us on pace with the Q1 increase. Our adjusted operating ratio in LTL was 90.1% for the quarter, compared with 88.3% a year ago. The biggest driver of the change was lower tonnage, and we also had a negative impact of about 250 basis points from $20 million of COVID costs. These drags were offset in part by the improvement in yield. We are also effective at controlling key variable costs, including P&D, dock operations and line haul. Our XPO Smart productivity tools are proving valuable in this environment. Bear in mind that this was just the second full quarter since XPO Smart was rolled out nationally in our LTL network. The analytics are driving up dock productivity by 6.5% on average year-over-year. We're encouraged by the early results and we expect the improvements to compound going forward.  We also grew load factor by 3.9% and improved empty miles by 24%, better than the 15% decline in shipments. We expect the combination of a better revenue outlook and strong expense management in LTL to produce a significant sequential improvement in adjusted operating ratio in Q3, with much more modest year-over-year erosion. Within our freight brokerage business, truck brokerage delivered a strong performance in a volatile market. Revenue fell 8%, but net revenue rose 3%. Brokerage volumes troughed in May and rebounded strongly in June. And we posted solid year-over-year increases in net revenue margin each month in the quarter. We procured capacity exceptionally well, buying at a 7.5% discount to the market, aided by the pricing tools within our XPO Connect platform. XPO Connect continues to drive significant efficiencies in our truck brokerage service. In the second quarter the load count was essentially flat with Q2 last year and we handled it with 14% less headcount. Intermodal revenue was down sharply, reflecting the shutdown in automotive production. Intermodal revenue trends began to recover in June and have improved significantly in July as truckload capacity tightened. Last mile was a real highlight for us in the quarter. Revenue increased 3% year-over-year, while net revenue dollars rose 11%. Net revenue margin rate in last mile increased by 270 basis points to a record 37%. And here again, revenue trends accelerated as the quarter progressed. Our last mile specialization in heavy goods continues to benefit from the growth of e-commerce, and we saw strong demand for home improvement goods and exercise equipment. This was partially offset by slower appliance installations due to COVID restrictions. Turning to Europe. In our transportation business, Q2 revenue declined by 29% versus the prior year, organic revenue which excludes the impacts of FX and fuel was down 23% for the quarter as a whole. Importantly, the year-over-year trend in organic revenue growth became more positive throughout the quarter. We were down 37% in April when the government lockdowns in Europe sharply curtailed our automotive, industrial and chemical customers. We rebounded to a 20% decline in May and a 14% decline in June. The theme for the quarter in European transportation was \u201cfirst in, first out\u201d. Among our larger countries, France and Spain locked down first and recovered first. The U.K. locked down several weeks later. The timing of the U.K. trough recovery is tracking later as well, and the curve of the recovery there has been more subdued. Overall, July market conditions have continued to improve for European transportation. Moving on to our logistics segment. The contractual nature of this business mitigated the impact of COVID, as did our vertical mix and the embedded relationships we have with key customers. Logistics segment revenue was down 8% year-over-year for the quarter and organic revenue declined 6.5% \u2014 again, improving each month. Adjusted EBITDA declined 39%, including the impact of $19 million of COVID costs. In North American logistics, revenue declined 11% versus Q2 last year. We had solid growth in e-commerce and omni-channel retail, along with good results in consumer packaged goods and consumer technology. This was offset by the elimination of lower margin business and by temporary shutdown requests from a number of our customers. At the peak of the pandemic, 8% of our sites were impacted by closures, and now all of our sites are up and running. In logistics, as in LTL, our proprietary XPO Smart tools are driving productivity and cost efficiency. Nearly two-thirds of our warehouses utilize XPO Smart and we're seeing an average labor productivity improvement of 5%. Some individual sites are much higher. This tech is still in the early innings of the value it can bring to the business. Also, I'm pleased to report that XPO Direct, our shared space distribution network, operated solidly in the black for the second consecutive quarter. The secular growth in e-commerce is driving more opportunities with omni-channel retailers. In Europe, logistics revenue declined by 6% year-over-year. FX had a negative impact of about 2.6 percentage points on revenue. Importantly, organic revenue for European logistics turned positive in the month of June. Consumer verticals represent about 85% of our European contract logistics revenue, with the vast majority related to either e-commerce or food and beverage. Consumers leaned into these verticals during the pandemic and we were happy to keep those goods flowing. We're encouraged by how well this business is performing and we see additional opportunities to grow the top and bottom lines. We're rolling out XPO Smart across Europe to drive labor productivity in our logistics warehouses. We had a soft opening for our warehouse of the future in the U.K. last month, which kicked off a 15-year contract with Nestle\u0301. And the trend toward near-shoring creates additional potential business for us. Our acquisition of logistics operations from Kuehne + Nagel in the U.K. is on track to close this fall. That's an overview of the operating trends that underlie our Q2 results. Moving down the income statement, interest expense was $82 million in the quarter, versus $72 million a year ago. Our GAAP effective tax rate rose to 35% from 24% a year ago. Our weighted average diluted share count was $91 million. In a loss-making quarter, diluted shares outstanding don't include common stock equivalents. Our basic share count was down slightly from Q1 and from the year-ago number, reflecting the impact of our first quarter share repurchase activity. Our diluted loss per share was $1.45 for Q2 versus earnings per share of $1.19 a year ago, and our adjusted diluted loss per share was $0.63 versus EPS of $1.28 a year ago. I want to note two items in our reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics. We incurred $50 million in pre-tax restructuring costs in the quarter, primarily for severance. The pandemic led us to take a deeper dive into our cost structure and significantly reduce our overhead costs, particularly in Europe. This will drive approximately $100 million of annualized cost improvement. We expect to achieve this run rate by the middle of 2021. The other item is the $46 million we booked in transaction and integration expenses in the quarter, primarily associated with our exploration of strategic alternatives. The largest piece of this relates to employee retention. To summarize the second quarter, we responded to the pandemic by taking care of our employees, looking after our customers, protecting our liquidity and cash flow and rightsizing our variable cost to market conditions. As David mentioned, the adjusted EBITDA we delivered was in line with our mix of fixed and variable costs. In Q3, we remain focused on all of these critical efforts. At the same time, our operating environment is becoming increasingly stable and we're directing more of our attention to our strategic profit initiatives, particularly XPO Connect and other technologies that can leverage the return of demand. We now have more than 62,000 truckload carriers registered on XPO Connect globally. Downloads of our Drive XPO app grew 87% in the three months of Q2 versus Q1, and now exceed 150,000 downloads in total. And we more than doubled the number of customers on the platform in the same period. In LTL, we continue to make headway with our pricing initiatives, particularly as we gauge price elasticity, digging deeper into the full cost profile of each RFP. And we're expanding the data we use to optimize the line-haul portion of LTL in terms of visibility, compliance and routing. The opportunities within contract logistics are also compelling. Our capabilities with advanced automation are both a driver of new business and a competitive advantage. Customers who explore in-house robotics options often come to the conclusion that the cost of entry is high and the solutions can be tough to implement. Our first-mover advantage with goods-to-person systems and collaborative robots is leading companies to outsource these projects to us. Another tailwind in contract logistics is that retailers are coming to us for more e-commerce capacity. In the short run, customers need interim capacity to manage peaks in demand, especially since the pandemic has made buying patterns less predictable. For the mid-term, they're interested in arranging additional distribution centers for supplemental capacity on a regional basis. And longer term, retailers and brands are assessing transformational changes that de-risk their logistics networks. We can meet all of these needs. I'll close by mentioning a few other highlights of the quarter. XPO was once again recognized by Gartner, which named us a worldwide leader in their magic quadrant of 3PL providers. This was the third straight year that we were designated a leader by Gartner. Also in the quarter, we were proud to provide critical support to the City of New York's Office of Emergency Services during the peak of the pandemic. And the Tour de France race is scheduled to start on August 29 in Europe. 2020 marks the 40th anniversary of our partnership with this celebrated event. We're proud to help bring some much-needed sport to the world stage. Not only will our trucks and drivers cover every kilometer of the course \u2014 for the first time two of our ecofriendly, natural gas powered trucks will be at the finish line with the competitors arrive in Paris. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator and we look forward to your questions."

            "name": "David Wyshner",
            "content": "Thanks Brad and good morning everyone. Today I'd like to discuss our second quarter results, our balance sheet and liquidity and our outlook. In the second quarter we generated revenue of $3.5 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $172 million and an adjusted loss per share of $0.63. All three figures reflect year-over-year declines due to COVID, but they are all better than we expected at the beginning of the quarter. Matt will review the segment detail in a few minutes. We generated $214 million of cash flow from operations in Q2, spent $116 million on CapEx and received $23 million of proceeds from asset sales. As a result, we generated positive free cash flow of $121 million in the quarter. This brings our year-to-date free cash flow to $216 million, which represents a year-over-year increase of $66 million, despite our having $75 million of cash outflows this year related to our exploration of strategic alternatives. We've been able to generate positive free cash flow during the pandemic by managing working capital aggressively, turning our receivables into cash. We became even more disciplined about collections in the COVID environment, working with our customers to reduce our receivables and staying disciplined with respect to payment terms. We continue to use trade receivables programs, including our European Securitization, to manage our working capital. We didn't repurchase any shares in the second quarter, so we continue to have $500 million of authorized share buyback capacity. We throttled back our planned capital expenditures dramatically at the start of the quarter, but have begun to reopen the spigot a bit as demand and new business opportunities have rebounded. We currently estimate that our gross CapEx will be $450 million to $475 million this year, which is up from our May estimate of around $400 million, but down about 26% from our pre-pandemic plans. And we estimate that as a result of our regular course asset sales, our net capital expenditures will be $250 million to $300 million this year. Even though financial markets have normalized significantly over the last four months, maintaining strong liquidity continues to be a top priority for us as an organization. We issued $1.15 billion of 6.25% five-year senior notes in April and May. The proceeds are part of our $2.3 billion cash balance at June 30. This cash, combined with available debt capacity under committed borrowing facilities, gives us total liquidity of $2.8 billion at quarter end. Our net leverage at June 30 was 3.5x adjusted EBITDA, which is in the middle of our targeted range of 3x to 4x. We have no significant debt maturities until mid-2022. Our liquidity position is strong. In the second quarter, our adjusted EBITDA was right in line with what you would expect based on the combination of our second quarter 2019 results, a 17% year-over-year reduction in revenue due to the pandemic, the 77% variable 23% fixed breakdown of our expenses and the nearly $50 million of COVID related costs we incurred. We've been seeing sequential improvement from month-to-month since April with that favorable trend continuing in July. Revenues in the first half of the month were down high single digits year-over-year. And we estimate that our COVID related costs will be $10 million to $25 million in Q3. Based on these conditions, we expect to generate at least $350 million of adjusted EBITDA, including COVID related costs in the third quarter. This means we're positioned to outperform the results that would be implied by a high single-digit year-over-year revenue decline and our mix of variable and fixed costs. This is because of benefits that we expect to realize in Q3 from operating initiatives, restructuring programs and other cost saving actions that we've implemented. On the cash flow front, with us having generated more than $200 million of free cash flow in the first half, we continue to be confident in our ability to deliver hundreds of millions of dollars of free cash flow this year. Lastly, COVID-19 clearly dominated the second quarter of 2020. Revenues bottomed in April and have been recovering ever since. Throughout the quarter we protected our employees, kept serving our customers and adjusted our variable costs to align with dramatic declines in demand. We also solidified our liquidity, continued to generate significant positive free cash flow, implemented cost saving actions that will benefit future quarters and invested in technology. As a result, we expect the third and fourth quarters to be much stronger than Q2, and we are enthusiastic about our longer term prospects as a leader in the markets we serve. With that, I'll turn things over to Matt."

            "content": "Thank you, operator. Good morning everyone. In addition to my remarks today, you will hear from David Wyshner, our Chief Financial Officer; Matt Fassler, our Chief Strategy Officer and also, for the Q&A portion of the call, we have Tavio Headley, our Senior Director of Investor Relations; Meghan Henson, our Chief Human Resources Officer; Ravi Tulsyan, our Treasurer and Kyle Wismans, SVP of FP&A. The second quarter was dominated by the severe challenges of COVID-19. Nevertheless, we did deliver better-than-expected revenue, adjusted-EPS, adjusted EBITDA and, notably, free cash flow. For us, the trough was in April in both North America and Europe. Since then, we've seen a recovery in Europe with a more recent rebound in North America, and all of our sites are open. Each month in the quarter showed sequential improvement across our operating regions. Organic revenue for the company as a whole has gone from being down 21% in April year-over-year to down just 10% in June, and we've continued to gain ground in July. The improvement has been broad-based in both transportation and logistics. In North American LTL for example, our tonnage per day was down 24% in April year-over-year, but down only 13% in June. We continue to regain tonnage in July. In Europe our LTL pallet count per day at the end of June was up from the trough in France by 49% and in Iberia by 44%. The U.K. was up 25% from the trough. And our European logistics business came back strong in the quarter, with a 7% increase in year-over-year revenue per day in the month of June. These are all positive trends going into the back half of the year. I also want to mention the three executive appointments we made this week. Eduardo Pelleissone is our new Chief Transformation Officer and Alex Santoro is Executive Vice President of Operations. These are two rare, talented operators who will work with our business leaders to turbocharge our profit improvement initiatives. We're excited to have them both onboard. I'm also extremely pleased that we have our first Chief Diversity Officer in LaQuenta Jacobs. LaQuenta has an impressive record as a champion of diversity at blue chip companies. She'll be leading initiatives that are high priorities for us, reporting directly to me. So to wrap it up, I'm proud of the extraordinary focus our organization has placed on keeping our employees safe throughout the pandemic while keeping supply chains moving for our customers. There are still a lot of unknowns with COVID, but our positioning is strong. For years we've been investing in our vision for the future of supply chains, including our e-commerce capabilities, intelligent automation of warehouses and customer solutions that are in high demand for outsourcing. These industry trends have been accelerated by the pandemic. Finally, I want to say again how grateful I am to our employees for their intense dedication in such unusual times. It's a privilege to lead Team XPO. And with that, I'll turn the presentation over to David. David. Operator: The next question coming from a line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. I see its 9:30. We apologise to those who didn't get a chance to ask a question, but we look forward to speaking to you off-line later today. Thank you very much. Talk to you again in three months. Have a great day!"

I will now turn the call over to Brad Jacobs. Mr. Jacobs, you may begin.\nBrad Jacobs: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everybody. I am joined virtually this morning by David Wyshner, our Chief Financial Officer; Meghan Henson, our Chief Human Resources Officer; and Matt Fassler, our Chief Strategy Officer. Also for the Q&A portion of the call, we have Tavio Headley, our Senior Director of Investor Relations; Ravi Tulsyan, our Treasurer; Kyle Wismans, SVP of Financial Planning and Analysis; and our newest addition, Kevin Sterling who has joined as VP of Strategy. Welcome to the team, Kevin. I want to start by expressing my profound appreciation to all the frontline workers at our company in our industry and across other professions who have kept society functioning during the pandemic. I am particularly grateful to our warehouse workers, dockworkers and drivers who provide an essential service to our customers. You will hear directly from Meghan about the actions we have taken to keep our people safe, then Matt will cover the quarter and some improvements we drove in the business and provide color around April, and David will wrap up the prepared remarks and then on to Q&A. Turning to the quarter, we had a strong January and a strong February. Then the pandemic sharply disrupted our end markets. It started with our European operations in early March and began to affect parts of our North American business later in the month. We quickly terminated our strategic review process and turned 100% of our focus to keeping our employees safe, our customers operational, and our balance sheet rock solid. We had $1.3 billion of liquidity as of quarter end and we added another $1.2 billion in April for total liquidity of $2.5 billion. We delivered $333 million of adjusted EBITDA on the quarter and expanded our EBITDA margin by 30 basis points. And I am proud that even in an economy on pause, we delivered $95 million of positive free cash flow in a quarter that\u2019s typically negative. We expect to generate hundreds of millions of dollars of free cash flow this year. Like all crises, this pandemic has a beginning of middle and an end. We\u2019re in the middle of it now and it will end. XPO Logistics will emerge far stronger than we were pre-COVID. Many of our core strengths position us for growth on the other side of the pandemic, including our proficiencies in e-commerce, advanced automation and data science and our focused, compassionate culture. Our billions of dollars of investment in these areas give us a head start on growth in the recovery. That\u2019s why, while I am a bear in the short-term, I am a bull in the medium-term and I am a mega bull for XPO in 2021 and beyond. With that, I will turn the presentation over to Meghan.\nMeghan Henson: Thanks Brad. I will start by emphasizing two key aspects of XPO\u2019s response to COVID-19: prevention and appreciation. The safety protocols we\u2019ve implemented are comprehensive and designed to prevent exposure to the virus in addition to dealing with it after the fact. We have procured enough PPE to safeguard our employees at work around the globe, including gloves, hand sanitizer, wipes, thermometers and masks. Inside our facilities, social distancing is our strongest defense. This includes holding shift meetings outdoors where employees can remain 6 feet apart, redesigning traffic flows and changing shift schedules, installing barriers between workstations and having only one chair per cable in break rooms. Our sites have regular proactive cleaning schedules. To encourage our employees to stay home when they are sick, we have added an additional 2 weeks of pandemic paid sick leave to our current paid time off in the U.S. and Canada. We have added 3 COVID-19 testing to our U.S. insurance policy and free access to telemedicine. And we have expanded mental health programs for all employees globally and their dependents. As soon as we know of a confirmed or presumptive case, we follow a tracing protocol and notify those who may have been exposed. Employees who are exposed are required to self-quarantine for 14 days. And when one of our people tests positive, we close the facility for deep cleaning using a team of certified specialists overseen by an industrial hygienist. When we shut down a site for deep cleaning, we send all of the employees home with full pay. We follow the guidelines of the World Health Organization, the CDC, government policies, and our own health and safety protocols to determine when we can safely resume work. In recognition of the contributions of our colleagues who are providing critical supply chain services, we have announced frontline appreciation pay for nearly 40,000 employees in the U.S. and Canada. Hourly employees in our warehouses receive an extra $2 per hour on top of their regular pay rate. Later this month, full-time employees working on our LTL service centers will receive a one-time bonus of $500 and part-time employees will receive a $250 bonus. I am proud of the work our people are doing around the world. We will continue to put their safety and well-being first. With that, I will turn the call over to Matt.\nMatt Fassler: Thanks, Meghan. I will review Q1 and how we are using our internal initiatives to optimize performance in this challenging backdrop and then discuss current trends. Starting with our transportation segment, our North American LTL business had another improvement in profitability despite softer demand. Tonnage per day declined by 6.4% year-over-year primarily due to subdued activity from our industrial customers. This has been the case for quite a while. Yield, excluding the impact of fuel, improved 2.6% year-over-year. Price increases on contract renewals remains healthy at 3.7%. Our proprietary pricing tools within LTL are helping us gauge elasticity for prospective bits aiding our yield profile. In addition, 66% of all local account RFPs in the quarter were automated, up from about 50% in Q4. Our technology is driving faster turnaround times and helping us win more new business. In fact, our new business won in LTL posted a double-digit increase as it has in each and every quarter over the past 2 years. Our adjusted operating ratio improved by 420 basis points to a Q1 record of 83.4%, excluding gains on sale of real estate, our adjusted OR improved by 320 basis points to 86.5%. This strong performance was the result of steady yield improvement and solid cost control driven by our profit improvement initiatives. Our XPO Smart workforce planning tools drove dock productivity, up 7% year-over-year to the best level we have seen since 2012. Also in Q1, we launched new capabilities for our line-haul optimization model. This helped us improve load factor by 5% and reduce our empty miles by 23%, so a win for both asset utilization and the environment. Moving on to freight brokerage, gross revenue declined by 5% year-over-year which was a sharp improvement from Q4. Our net revenue margin increased across \u2013 eased, that is, across freight brokerage, by just 40 basis points sequentially to 17.5%, but it fell 300 basis points year-over-year against the tough comparison as contractual rates declined and the spot market stabilized. Within freight brokerage, our truck brokerage loads per day increased by 9%, accelerating significantly from 1% growth in Q4. Like others in the industry, we experienced a surge in volume late in the quarter from customers and the consumer staples sector, both producers and retailers. This was related to meeting increased demand for food and dry goods as people stayed at home. Our XPO Connect digital freight marketplace continues to gain traction. We saw our carrier rep productivity improve by 16% in Q1, driven by an increase in automated transactions. Weekly active users hit a new weekly high in March and we launched new capabilities and our pricing algorithms that allowed us to improve our forecasting accuracy for truck brokerage by 16%. In our last mile operation, revenue declined 10% year-over-year in the quarter. Excluding postal injection, which we exited in the middle of the first quarter last year, growth in our core last mile heavy goods business accelerated to 9% year-over-year. All told, we had a standout quarter in last mile meeting increased customer demand for electronic and fitness equipment. We also benefited from the trend towards buying big and bulky goods online. We implemented new safety protocols for last mile deliveries in March, including curbside drop-off and PPE and social distancing during in-home installations. Turning to Europe, in our transportation business, Q1 revenue declined by 8.8% versus 2019, FX weighed on revenue by about 2 percentage points. We were tracking to plan into March when COVID began to impact France and Spain. We continue to hold numerous leadership positions across our transportation verticals, geographies and service lines in Europe. For example, we reinforced our status as the number one LTL provider in France and Spain and a top three LTL provider in the UK. Across our transportation segment, adjusted EBITDA fell by 4%, while adjusted EBITDA margin rose by 40 basis points to 10.3%. Moving on to our logistics segment, our revenue declined 4.3% in North America, reflecting the downsizing of business with our largest customer and our decision to exit some lower margin business. Consumer packaged goods was our strongest vertical. Our proprietary XPO Smart tools are driving productivity and cost efficiency in staffing in our warehouses. And I am pleased to report that XPO Direct operated solidly in the black as it passed its first anniversary. Our shared distribution model is resonating with brands who want to optimize their direct-to-consumer efforts and shippers looking to augment their e-commerce and omni-channel capabilities. Customers value supply chain flexibility now more than ever. We built XPO Direct to address that need. In Europe, logistics revenue declined by 3.5% year-over-year. FX had a negative impact of about 2.5 percentage points. E-commerce and food retail were our strongest verticals in European logistics. Our effort to drive margin improvement in European logistics, which is one of our 10 core profit improvement initiatives, continues to resonate. We reduced loss-makers and drove efficiencies throughout the business. Across our logistics segment as a whole, we have doubled our new business wins to the highest level we have seen since the third quarter of 2018. Since the pandemic we are seeing intense customer interest in surge management. We are meeting that need and in some cases converting these opportunities into longer term deals. Adjusted EBITDA for our logistics segment rose 7% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 8.4% from 7.6% a year ago. Moving down the income statement, interest expense was $72 million versus $71 million a year ago. Our GAAP effective tax rate rose to 30% from 27% a year ago. Our weighted average diluted share count was $103 million, about the same as Q4 compared with 117 million shares a year ago and down 25% from our peak in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our diluted earnings per share, was $0.20 versus $0.37 last year and our adjusted diluted EPS with $0.47 versus $0.51 in the prior year quarter. We remain up and operating across our lines of business in all of our major markets. The pressure on demand is influenced by regional stay-at-home mandates and varies by customer verticals. For example, we have seen pockets of strength in e-commerce, food and beverage and personal care. Our overall revenue in April declined in the low to mid 20s on a percentage basis, which we believe is in line with industry levels for our lines of business. We saw smaller declines in logistics, LTL tracked in line with our full company revenue performance and softer performance from the rest of our transportation segment. North American LTL yield was flat in April similar to March. Truck brokerage volumes eased sequentially from the surge the market experienced in late March, but notably margin dollars per load and net revenue margin have improved from Q1. This has not been a conventional slowdown in any sense. For many customers, it\u2019s been a shutdown. While we have been up and operating across our lines of business, some customers have temporarily closed their stores and factories. I mentioned France and Spain earlier. Our activity in those countries hit its lowest levels in early April and our transportation volumes are recovering modestly as these markets prepare to emerge from lockdown. Volumes have been bouncing along the bottom in the UK and the U.S. since mid-April. As industries and geographies reopen, we expect to see improvement. Against this backdrop, consider three important factors: first, 77% of our costs are variable and 23% are fixed. We have been aggressively addressing our costs. Some of our expense reductions are likely to endure post-pandemic, aiding our earnings power when the environment eventually normalizes. Our XPO Smart planning tools are helping us manage through the volatility on a real-time basis and our investments in LTL route optimization and supply chain automation are driving structural cost improvements. Second, as Meghan discussed, we are prioritizing the well-being of our people. We expect expenses related directly to these efforts of up to $50 million or more in the second quarter. And it\u2019s hard to imagine a better investment. Our people are the bedrock of XPO. Third, we dialed CapEx way back. We remain committed to a number of important growth investments. For instance, we are in the final stages of prepping our warehouse of the future with Nestl\u00e9, which will launch later this month and we are continuing to optimize our routing and LTL pickup and delivery and line-haul, two of the highest ROI opportunities across the company. XPO is built to withstand disruption and when we emerge from the pandemic, we will be even better positioned for success. For example, we are a leader in e-commerce logistics. E-commerce growth has accelerated globally and we expect that to continue after the pandemic. We expect to benefit as the number one outsourced e-fulfillment platform in Europe, the leading reverse logistics platform and the number one last mile platform in the U. S. for big and bulky goods. We envision more demand for logistics automation, where we're a leader in providing advanced solutions at scale and we've been applying this expertise straight through the depths of this downturn. We will see more value placed on data visibility by customers of all types who want more transparency in their supply chains. Our value here lies in our digital freight marketplace, our intelligent analytics, machine learning and our ongoing routing and pricing enhancements. Our cost structure will be leaner. We will remain focused on disciplined capital allocation as we have been since day one, seeking out the strongest risk-adjusted returns. We are a resilient organization. We have been there for our customers and our relationships with them we'll be stronger on the other side of the COVID curve. Now I'd like to turn the call over to David Wyshner our CFO.\nDavid Wyshner: Thanks Matt and good morning everyone. Today I would like to discuss our first quarter cash flow, our balance sheet and our liquidity, and then share some closing remarks. We generated $180 million of cash flow from operations in Q1, spent a $139 million on CapEx and received $54 million of proceeds from asset sales including our ongoing program of selling appreciated real estate. As a result we generated positive free cash flow of $95 million in the quarter versus a free cash flow use of $96 million in Q1 last year. As the scale of the COVID pandemic became clear in March, we aggressively managed working capital and focused on turning our receivables into cash. We became even more disciplined about collections and derived an incremental $72 million year-over-year benefit from our trade receivables programs in the quarter. As our revenue slowed in March it naturally brought down our receivables balance below the March 2019 level. We repurchased 1.7 million shares of our stock at a cost of $114 million in late February and early March under a trading plan that was put in place earlier in the quarter and which triggered when our share price declined fairly dramatically. We stopped buying back stock in mid March. We also throttled back our capital expenditures significantly and currently estimate that gross CapEx will be roughly $400 million this year which is down more than a third from our 2020 plan before the pandemic. As markets became increasingly volatile in March, maintaining strong liquidity became a top priority for us as an organization. In addition to the actions I just mentioned we drew $600 million on our ABL facility in March and ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $1.1 billion. That cash plus another $200 million of available ABL borrowing capacity brought our total liquidity at quarter end to $1.3 billion. In early April we added a $350 million credit facility to further strengthen our liquidity and in late April we issued $850 million of 6.25% five year senior notes. These financings gave us pro forma liquidity of $2.5 billion including $2 billion of cash as of March 31. We have no significant debt maturities until mid 2022 so we feel great about how we have fortified our already strong liquidity position. Our net leverage at quarter end was 2.95x which is just below the lower end of our targeted range of 3x to 4x adjusted EBITDA. So while XPO, like all companies and industries, is facing a highly unusual operating environment, we have the benefit of continuing to operate as an essential business and that gives us feet on the ground and momentum when the uncertainty subsides. We have an exceptionally strong balance sheet and our industry is a leading indicator, meaning that we will be at the forefront of the recovery when it comes. As you may know, I joined XPO in early March. I am happy to be part of a management team that is focused without flinching on keeping our employees safe and providing essential services to our customers in an unprecedented environment. I'm happy to be part of a business that is resilient both operationally and in its ability to generate cash and I am happy to be part of a global team that provides transportation and logistics solutions that are reliable, in demand and important. With that, we look forward to taking your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Wetherbee: Hey, good morning guys. Maybe starting on the transportation side, ex- LTL, if you think about sort of that segment, it appears on an EBIT basis-- I am not sure that\u2019s necessarily how you guys look at it, but on an EBIT basis, it looks like it was either breakeven or maybe slightly loss-making. Can you talk a little bit about sort of what was going on in the business there? Was that sort of the earlier impacts of COVID-related to the European piece of the transportation business? Was that related to sort of freight brokerage having a tougher March, because of the spike in TL rates? Can you just give us some color on sort of that piece of the business and maybe how that could be trending as an earlier indicator of recovery in 2Q?\nMatt Fassler: Sure, Chris. It\u2019s Matt. Three points to talk about there. First of all, the only place we really felt the impact of COVID early in Q1 in the U.S. was in intermodal. And that business is impacted \u2013 was impacted by the flow of freight in China, which as you know slowed down with the moderation in the pace of Chinese manufacturing as that country felt the early impact of COVID. So, we have a slower quarter in intermodal throughout \u2013 again, that was the only place in the U.S. we really saw it prior to early March. So that had an impact on that line. The second item to think about is within freight brokerage. Obviously, the entire industry has been \u2013 was experiencing lower net revenue margins year-over-year. That was a function primarily of the contractual rates continuing to come down and the spot market stabilized. As we indicated that margin dynamic did improved in April, but that\u2019s the reality that we saw in Q1. And third, as we discussed, we did see a slowing in Europe early to mid March kind of country by country, Spain and France being most significant for our transportation business among the countries that showed slowing earlier in the month, and that also weighed on results for that line item. We look at this on an EBITDA basis and the numbers on an EBITDA basis were solidly positive in each of those business units and for that segment of transportation as a whole. Those are the three items that we have moved transportation ex-LTL in Q1.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay. Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I appreciate that. And then maybe sort of a bigger picture question about free cash flow and leverage, so Brad, I know you have talked about several hundreds of millions of dollars of free cash flow generation this year. When you think about sort of the impact of the business in terms of EBITDA perspective, relative to the free cash generation, can you give us some current parameters maybe a little bit more specificity around free cash flow. Do you think you can de-lever through 2020, would that be an initiative for you guys?\nBrad Jacobs: Well, free cash flow \u2013 we\u2019ll generate hundreds of millions of dollars of free cash flow. We can\u2019t be more specific than that, because we don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t know how the pandemic is going to play out. We don\u2019t know if Europe, even though it\u2019s coming back really fast, really sharply, whether that will continue on that trajectory. We don\u2019t know if the United States, which has bottomed from our perspective, we see volumes bottomed, we see a lot of things stabilized. We don\u2019t see it getting better yet. So, we don\u2019t know how fast it\u2019s going to get better and how much it\u2019s going to get better. So, there are still a lot of imponderables here that we really don\u2019t know. In our models, in all scenarios, we should be generating hundreds of millions of dollars of free cash flow, though. In terms of leverage, we have the same parameters. We have always felt that 3x to 4x leverage is the right amount of leverage to not put the company at risk, but to improve the returns for the common shareholders. In this environment, there are some of our shareholders who would like us to shoot for a lower leverage target. Maybe we will. We will revisit that at the board. In terms of the ability to de-leverage, I think we will generate substantial free cash flow, but we don\u2019t have a firm handle on exactly what the EBITDA will be, so we don\u2019t know what the multiple will be on that.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay. Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Maybe just one quick one here, Brad, while I have you, you obviously stopped the strategic alternative exploration mid-quarter, which is understandable given the circumstances that we are in here. Can you talk just a little bit sort of how you think about the relative value of the business? Is that still something that is on the table once we get past, I just wanted to get a sense sort of conceptually how you think about the business as it stands right now from a valuation standpoint?\nBrad Jacobs: Well, the strategic review process is completely off the table. It\u2019s yesterday\u2019s news. We are not spending a minute on it today. In terms of the question about what do we think of the value of the company, we look at the value the company from a long-term perspective, not from what it\u2019s multiple of this particular quarter even this particular year, and we look at the cash flow generation ability over the next 5, 10 years, and we discount that. We think, by all parameters, the stock is trading at significant discount to its intrinsic value, but all we can do is focus on everything we can to improve the quality of the company, keep our people safe, maximize the revenue and the EBITDA and free cash flow and we think the multiple will take care of itself in due course.\nChris Wetherbee: Got it. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it.\nBrad Jacobs: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks, operator. Hi, everybody. Hi, Brad. Brad, there is really no history in terms of how XPO\u2019s earnings profile trends in a recession, you had a recession, kind of industrial recession in \u201815 and \u201816 but of course you were still building the company at that point. So in that context, I mean, I know you said 23% of the cost are fixed, which obviously implies that type of operating leverage in the business. Of course, it doesn\u2019t really work that way in the real world, it\u2019s not linear. So, I was just hoping maybe you or David or Matt or anybody can just help us really think about a hypothetical scenario, maybe that\u2019s kind of the better way to think about it? If we saw a 10% decline in the revenues of the company how should that translate to EBITDA declines given the variability in the cost structure as well as kind of the non-volume cost opportunity. Any color there I think would be really helpful?\nMatt Fassler: So, two points to make on that, number one, as we have built our detailed models based on our current experience, revenue trends and what we are seeing in the business, that 77% variable, 23% fixed cost mix is the right way to think about the business. And will likely take you to the proper outcomes of what earnings will look like under different revenue scenarios. Of course, we are working on our cost structure, we are attacking our cost structure. We are looking to take out obviously variable cost and that is happening. We are also looking to take fixed costs out of the business. But that formula that we have used historically is withstanding the test of reality and is the appropriate prism to think about as you build your model out for the current quarter. On top of that obviously, consider the pains that we are taking to care for our people and the costs associated with that. Obviously, we hope and expect that that is a transient cost and that that does not repeat that will be a function of the progress of the pandemic and we are hoping that that passes quickly. Consider two other things, one, this is a shutdown, this is not a slowdown, we have spoken in the past about what recessions would look like. There are customers in segments of industries that have shuttered their facilities for periods of time. That\u2019s unusual. And as the economy gets up and running again, we expect our business to slightly lead that and certainly move \u2013 and certainly move in concert with that. And this is just a moment in time. And as we move past Q2, we would expect that 77/23 formula really to work in our favor.\nAmit Mehrotra: Yes. And I just \u2013 I appreciate that, that\u2019s a very clear answer, but I just wanted to follow-up on the first quarter, you know revenues were down over $250 million and profits were only down \u2013 EBITDA was only down $10 million. So that\u2019s obviously -- are you saying like that number is really the good way to think about the annual performance this year and in all years and maybe there is going to be some volatility on the quarter, is that the right way to think about it?\nBrad Jacobs: Right now, the comments I made are specific to Q2. We obviously have different scenarios that we are modeling for the year, but we have the greatest visibility to Q2. Obviously, we have good visibility in April and we shared our revenues to-date with you from that perspective. Thinking about how Q2 is going to play out, we're thinking about that fixed/variable cost mix as the appropriate basis for modeling. We did a good job managing the business through the volatility that we saw at the end of Q1 and yes we generated operating leverage despite a modest revenue decline, but with the revenue declines that we're seeing in April, and it's a different order of magnitude because the world is in a very different place, you are going to see the math work out the way I discussed rather than reflective of the performance that we had in Q1, which against your point we are very proud of.\nAmit Mehrotra: Okay. And the last question very quickly for me can you talk about the automotive and aerospace exposure in North American logistics? I think you've got specific exposure on the 787 program for Boeing which obviously production is getting cut in half over time, but just talk about the exposure of those two end markets and the impact on the North American logistics market?\nBrad Jacobs: Auto -- we have mid-single digits of our revenue tied to auto. Auto has been way down. Many of our auto customers have been at zero. The good news is, if you talk to Ford or Toyota or Honda, they're all opening up in the next few weeks, so they are going to go from nothing to something, and we'll see how fast they ramp up and where they get up to on the peak, but it is going to be a lot better than nothing. In terms of Boeing, Boeing is a valued customer of ours. And we do two things for them. We do military and we do commercial. The military part of the business is strong and stable and the outlook is really positive. On the commercial side, there could be some lightness, there could be some decrease. It certainly won't go down to nothing. It'll go down somewhat, but not way, way, way down. It'll go down a little bit.\nAmit Mehrotra: Okay, I appreciate your time.\nBrad Jacobs: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer & Company. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks very much good morning in recent years XPO has really built up a big focus on ecommerce which seems to be accelerating in the current environment obviously there is a lot of end market pressure just to address but could you please speak to the end market that strength how they are performing in April And kind of at a total company level what percent of the company is seeing some good relative to the to the to the bad in this environment? Thanks.\nBrad Jacobs: Well, Scott, e-commerce saved us in April, frankly. It was our strongest performing vertical across the board. It was actually going up and most everything else was going down. Food and beverage was also strong but, if you take out the e-com and if you take out food and beverage, except for a few little specifics, all other parts of transportation logistics did not perform well from the middle of March till to the end of April. It's a great business to be in right now, because it's not a cyclical phenomenon, in our opinion, as much as a secular phenomenon. We expect some of these behavioral changes that are taking place during the pandemic to continue post-pandemic. We had 9% organic revenue growth in our last mile business in the first quarter and that's a standout, and the reason is people were inside and people were ordering exercise equipment online. People were ordering DIY and lawn and garden and home improvement from their homes. People ordering appliances and home electronics online, so that that growth of online is a big -- we are a big beneficiary of that. Of course in Europe we're the largest provider of e-fulfillment services for e-commerce and that's also been really positive recently. And then if you look at reverse logistics, and we do so many different diversified things in reverse and returns management around the globe, that's also a winner that\u2019s going against the trend here. I mean, omnichannel and so forth and so on. So, I think e-com is a good place to be right now and, fortunately, we have a good exposure to it. It's not the majority of our business though.\nScott Schneeberger: Okay thanks. And then with regard to the $700 million to $1 billion long term profit growth plan initiative could you just provide an update obviously there's a lot of focus on cost efficiencies in this environment so I am just curious what the look of that is right now and how meaningful that could be in 2020? Thanks.\nBrad Jacobs: The 10 levers are still very much on. Obviously we're prioritizing the health and the safety of employees over the 10 levers, but the 10 levers are still important for the financial health of our employees, and some of the initiatives are on kind of pause, but others are full speed ahead. So, the major projects and the biggest ones that are still full speed ahead are pricing algorithms, because every time we get pricing right, it optimizes our bottom line, because we don\u2019t lose business that we shouldn\u2019t lose and we get business that we should get and we don\u2019t leave money on the table unnecessarily. And in pricing, the pricing initiatives affect all of our business, all of our businesses involve pricing. The other lever that is growing, and it\u2019s growing in importance, is automation, particularly warehouse automation. One of the things that we had to focus on and deal within a way that no one focused on before was how do you run a warehouse with keeping 6-feet distancing between everybody? How do you run a cross dock facility with 6-feet distancing around everybody? In the warehouse, we are farther along on automation than we are in LTL, but even in LTL, some of the equipment, over time, can be automated for safety\u2019s sake, for efficiency\u2019s sake. In the warehouse, we are either the leader or one of the top two leaders in warehouse automation. And all of our robotics and our AI and our machine learning, it\u2019s all \u2013 we are doubling down on that. That\u2019s something that we are still spending money on and we feel good about spending money on that, because forget about the long-term, even in the medium-term, there is going to be a big return on that. Customers like it, our workers like it, frankly. Of the other levers, the Smart workforce planning tools, the labor management tools to enhance productivity, those are also full speed ahead. I am so happy that we had Smart rolled out to the majority of our locations, where we have workers prior to this pandemic, because we would have never been able to manage the headcount so accurately as we did. It would have been much more random. So, getting the right size of the staffing, getting the right blend between full-time and part-time, getting the right shift times and shift endings. Smart saved the day on that one. So, that\u2019s still full speed ahead. In LTL, we are still working on the P&D optimization. That\u2019s something that\u2019s very important. We are not \u2013 haven\u2019t stopped on that. We are still working on the line-haul optimization and, of course, the pricing opportunities there. When you look at the 10 levers, most of them are driven by technology. So, our tech team is all working from home and of course, a lot of them always work from home, that\u2019s a tech kind of thing. And they have been highly productive and highly focused on keeping progress made on these very, very important levers.\nScott Schneeberger: Great. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it. Stay well.\nBrad Jacobs: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ari Rosa with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nAri Rosa: Hey, good morning guys. So Brad, maybe you could talk about where you see opportunities to cut cost in this environment? Obviously, if revenues are contracting and you guys are looking to preserve some margin there, but are there opportunities to cut meaningfully into, whether the SG&A costs or costs at the individual segment level?\nBrad Jacobs: Yes, 77%, and rising, of our costs are variable. The two biggest categories within that 77%, Ari, are labor and purchased transportation. Those are the two big things that we spend lots of money on, billions of billions of dollars on. On the labor that -- we have a system that has labor go up when we have more volume and has labor go down when we don\u2019t have volume for them to do. So, that is a self-regulating cost control process that\u2019s been in place for a while and we just keep improving the technology that powers that every month. On the purchased transportation, similarly, it\u2019s fairly self-regulating, because if we don\u2019t, in our transportation business, have load count, if we don\u2019t have shipments coming in, where we don\u2019t go out and purchase third-party capacity, we don\u2019t add drivers, we don\u2019t add trucks. So, the model self corrects quite a bit, because of the way -- what we spend the money on.\nAri Rosa: Great. That makes a lot of sense. And then just my second question maybe a little bit a silly question but I'm curious to hear your take if you guys still are targeting hundreds of millions of dollars of free cash flow generation even in a downside scenario why do you guys have so much cash on hand and what are your intentions for that cash?\nBrad Jacobs: Well, when the pandemic hit. It was quite a shock to everyone, including us. And the first thought that went through our mind was, well, how do we protect our people? We have 100,000 people. How do we protect our people from this terrible virus? And that took up a large percentage of our efforts. We had to learn a lot of stuff. We had to learn all about hygiene and we had to learn about social distancing. We had to learn about training. We had to learn about PPE. There was a lot to learn immediately, quickly. So, our HR organization led that multi-discipline effort and that became a top priority after that. In terms of where we can allocate capital going forward, we would think about creating shareholder value by 1 of 4 things. Paying down debt, and pre-funding the 2022 maturities, for example. Or, CapEx where we see growth. We're still investing in CapEx. We have a wonderful joint venture with Nestl\u00e9, a 15-year joint venture, the warehouse of the future that's going to open up in the next few months. We're still investing in that. We still have a contract logistics businesses that are coming our way, either because goods came in from China and there's no demand for them, so people need storage. We are helping many, many customers with that. Or, customers who are reopening and coming back into business and they need contract logistic help. So, we are investing CapEx into that because we see a very defined and measurable and high return on those projects. The third category we look at in terms of capital allocation would be M&A. While it is not top of mind right now -- it's kind of difficult to buy a company over Zoom -- it is something we think about and something we're talking about and we are watching. And then the fourth category of capital allocation would be share repurchases. So, we want to always be looking at our stock and seeing if it makes more sense to buy back our stock or to do one of the other three things I just mentioned. All these three things require capital and the survival of the company was the thing that we thought about in the same breath as the survival of our employees. And, from a financial perspective, we wanted to load up on cash. It's hard to be -- it's hard to go broke when you have $2.5 billion of liquidity, I will put it like that. So, we had over $1 billion of liquidity in the quarter when we went out and we raised a high-yield bond offering and we did a couple transactions with some banks and now we have got $2 billion of cash in the bank, and we have $500 million of availability on various lines. So, we have $2.5 billion of liquidity and we're cash flow positive, so I feel that we've, from a financial perspective, done our duty to protect the company from another surprise, which could happen. We don't know if the virus is going to come back. We don't know if there is going to be a W. We don't know that. So, I feel we're protected by having $2.5 billion of liquidity, and it gives us flexibility and options and also gives us protection.\nAri Rosa: Sure. So, that makes a lot of sense and just a quick follow on in this environment would you consider share repurchases or and if not what would you have to see that would get you comfortable with going back to resuming share repurchases?\nBrad Jacobs: Well we've got about $500 million left on the repurchase program authorization, but it's not the only application of capital and we will have to be more disciplined -- even more disciplined than we always have been on stock buybacks, because there's more risk and uncertainty in the future. So, it's not the highest priority for us to go buy back shares, but I don\u2019t rule it out. And we would announce that retroactively, not prospectively. So, we would announce any share repurchases we did at the end of the quarter, not ahead of time.\nAri Rosa: Sure. Makes a lot of sense. Thanks for the time.\nBrad Jacobs: Thank you, Ari.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.\nBascome Majors: Yes. Brad, you said you are a mega-bull on XPO in 2021 and beyond I was hoping if we could flip some of the earlier questions about downside operating leverage. So to think about what the recovery might look like for you guys, how do you expect the model to perform as global freight and global economies recover? And if organic revenue growth returns to a reasonable longer term trend of GDP plus modestly, what kind of operating leverage should we expect to see on EBITDA out of that and should we see further leverage dropping from EBITDA out of free cash flow or if some of the working capital come back and CapEx come back and maybe mute that growth versus EBITDA? Thank you.\nBrad Jacobs: Bascome, I think the answer to all of those questions are we think the same thing we thought prior to the pandemic. And we look at 2020 as kind of a lost year for earnings growth. This is a year to stay strong, stay solid, stay safe, be well, protect our employees, protect the balance sheet, protect our relationships with customers and live to fight another day. And our base-case scenario is this all works itself out over the course of this year. In 2021, we look back at 2020 and go, whew, what a crazy year that was, but we are glad it\u2019s over with. And 2021, in that scenario that we think it\u2019s the base case scenario, should look pretty much like we thought 2020 was going to look like before the pandemic happened. So, we will see operating leverage from revenue growth transferring to EBITDA, transferring to free cash flow. We will see all the cross-selling opportunities. We will see all the opportunities to get more market share, because of our outsized exposure to fast-growing places in the industry, like e-commerce. We will see the fruit, as we have been seeing, of the billions and billions of dollars of investment we made in technology, into warehouse automation, into our digital freight marketplace and XPO Connect, all the projects I mentioned few minutes ago in LTL on pickup and delivery and line-haul and so forth.  I think we will come out of the crisis with a lower cost structure. I think that\u2019s partly because we have been rolling out our Smart labor tools and they have just been working very, very, very well. And I think it\u2019s because we just learned, as many companies have, not just in our industry, as many companies, how to work differently; how to work more leanly; how to reduce travel and entertainment cost; how to reduce the time costs of all this travelling, the big cost in time -- all the fatigue and getting sick and being out of the office. And so I think we are going to have a greater work from home population. And I think we will figure out ways to crack the nut on making sure that everyone working from home is just as focused and just as productive as they would be if they were in the office. Now, you won\u2019t be able to work from home if you work in the warehouse or if you are driving a truck. So, that parts of the business will look fairly the same, except there will be a little bit more automation.\nBascome Majors: Brad, thank you for that comprehensive answer. If I could add one more related to that, is anything expected to shift on the cash taxes front as we think about cash flow going forward or maybe any other cash flow items beyond the more obvious ones that we tend to look at? Thank you.\nMatt Fassler: Bascome, if our EBITDA and income are lower, our cash taxes will be lower as well. So, as we think about cash flow more broadly, we have spoken about our CapEx coming down from the original plan. Our cash taxes are likely to be lower than our original plan. Our working capital was very favorable in Q1. Working capital can be a source for the year, how it turns out for the year has a lot to do with where revenue is in the fourth quarter. If revenue is strong, it could be a use of cash. If revenue is softer, it would more likely be a source of cash. Those are the biggest moving pieces to think about for free cash flow.\nBascome Majors: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nAllison Landry: Good morning. Thanks. So I wanted to touch up on LTL, obviously a good performance on load tractor and solid yield. So if we assume Q2 is hopefully the bottom, maybe there is some at least some modest recovery in the back half and into next year. Is the $1 billion of EBITDA on the LTL segment still attainable by 2021 or should we sort of back up to your comment, Brad, that you just made a couple of minutes of ago that 2020 is kind of a lost year for growth? And does this also kind of get pushed out a year?\nBrad Jacobs: The answer is, Allison, I don't know. We have to see the timing of how all this plays out. We have a very clear path of action points in LTL which will steadily improve its margin and steadily improve EBITDA generation, will steadily improve its free cash flow generation and its returns. Timing of it, like with all our businesses, we -- it's really hard to nail it down. I mean, LTL a great quarter, by the way, in the first quarter. We had a record OR. It improved 420 basis points with real estate -- without real estate, 320 basis points excluding real estate. The operating income was up 32% on a year-over-year basis. I\u2019d call that a good quarter. There were many bright spots. We had lots of new business won, load factor was up 5.2%, dock productivity was up 8%. So, we're firing on all 8 cylinders in LTL. The problem is the industrial economy is not open for business yet. So, we have seen tonnage dramatically decrease, as the whole industry has. And tonnage has gone down as much as 20%, even a little bit more than 20%. That's the bad news. The good news is it's stabilized. It hit bottom. It found a bottom. There were weeks over the last couple of months where we were seeing -- we have about 60 metrics that we watch every morning and they\u2019re color coded, and almost all of them were red. Week after week, it was not very pleasant to watch those metrics. They started turning yellow and they started turning green, so they are stabilizing towards forecast. We used to do biweekly forecasts. We moved to weekly forecasts. We are doing daily forecasts now, and LTL is tracking to the forecast. So, I'm very confident in the management we have in LTL. I like our position in LTL. I love the projects that we are working on, they are really cutting edge. I have great confidence in them. I do believe we'll get to $1 billion of EBITDA and LTL, whether it's next year or the following year. It's too early to confidently predict that.\nAllison Landry: Okay. That's totally fair. Contract logistics, I would imagine that there are weren\u2019t any specific protections related to global pandemic but could you help us think through the contract structures and the built in protection are these enough to mitigate such severe revenue and demand declines and if you could remind the type of contract structures differ between Europe and North America? Thank you.\nMatt Fassler: Allison, it\u2019s Matt. We have lots of different contract structures, ranging from cost-plus to fixed/variable, which means there's a piece that's fixed and another portion that's volume-dependent, to purely transactional. Broadly speaking, the incrementals or decrementals that we expect to see in contract logistics in Q2 are on the better end of what we expect to see for the broader company, which is consistent with the kinds of protections that we have built into our contracts, which were not, to your point, designed exclusively for a global pandemic, but were designed with the intent of protecting us from the slow down. The slowdown in some verticals and for some customers and for some regions is more significant than what we would previously have contemplated, because we did not contemplate the cessation of business activities in regions or sectors, so that will have an impact, but the way the model was built, very big picture, is working. One other point. Our expectation, having spoken with the head of our European business yesterday, is that our European contract logistics volumes are going to get back pretty close to par, not quite there, but getting closer to that by the end of Q2. And we have good visibility on recovery, almost at benchmark levels, well before the end of the year. So, that is a very resilient business, so long as economies and customers are up and running in some form or fashion. So, that that that's an inkling of good news from European contract logistics.\nAllison Landry: Okay, perfect. Thank you, guys.\nBrad Jacobs: Thank you, Allison.\nOperator: Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to Jacobs for any further or closing remarks.\nBrad Jacobs: Thank you, operator, and thanks everyone for turning into our calls. And we will be seeing many of you in the upcoming conference season over video conference. We are looking forward to the time when it\u2019s safe for us to all see each other in person and to, where appropriate, shake hands or even give a hug and be back to normal. So, thank you for your support and talk to you in due course. Have a great day. Be safe.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Thanks, Meghan. I will review Q1 and how we are using our internal initiatives to optimize performance in this challenging backdrop and then discuss current trends. Starting with our transportation segment, our North American LTL business had another improvement in profitability despite softer demand. Tonnage per day declined by 6.4% year-over-year primarily due to subdued activity from our industrial customers. This has been the case for quite a while. Yield, excluding the impact of fuel, improved 2.6% year-over-year. Price increases on contract renewals remains healthy at 3.7%. Our proprietary pricing tools within LTL are helping us gauge elasticity for prospective bits aiding our yield profile. In addition, 66% of all local account RFPs in the quarter were automated, up from about 50% in Q4. Our technology is driving faster turnaround times and helping us win more new business. In fact, our new business won in LTL posted a double-digit increase as it has in each and every quarter over the past 2 years. Our adjusted operating ratio improved by 420 basis points to a Q1 record of 83.4%, excluding gains on sale of real estate, our adjusted OR improved by 320 basis points to 86.5%. This strong performance was the result of steady yield improvement and solid cost control driven by our profit improvement initiatives. Our XPO Smart workforce planning tools drove dock productivity, up 7% year-over-year to the best level we have seen since 2012. Also in Q1, we launched new capabilities for our line-haul optimization model. This helped us improve load factor by 5% and reduce our empty miles by 23%, so a win for both asset utilization and the environment. Moving on to freight brokerage, gross revenue declined by 5% year-over-year which was a sharp improvement from Q4. Our net revenue margin increased across \u2013 eased, that is, across freight brokerage, by just 40 basis points sequentially to 17.5%, but it fell 300 basis points year-over-year against the tough comparison as contractual rates declined and the spot market stabilized. Within freight brokerage, our truck brokerage loads per day increased by 9%, accelerating significantly from 1% growth in Q4. Like others in the industry, we experienced a surge in volume late in the quarter from customers and the consumer staples sector, both producers and retailers. This was related to meeting increased demand for food and dry goods as people stayed at home. Our XPO Connect digital freight marketplace continues to gain traction. We saw our carrier rep productivity improve by 16% in Q1, driven by an increase in automated transactions. Weekly active users hit a new weekly high in March and we launched new capabilities and our pricing algorithms that allowed us to improve our forecasting accuracy for truck brokerage by 16%. In our last mile operation, revenue declined 10% year-over-year in the quarter. Excluding postal injection, which we exited in the middle of the first quarter last year, growth in our core last mile heavy goods business accelerated to 9% year-over-year. All told, we had a standout quarter in last mile meeting increased customer demand for electronic and fitness equipment. We also benefited from the trend towards buying big and bulky goods online. We implemented new safety protocols for last mile deliveries in March, including curbside drop-off and PPE and social distancing during in-home installations. Turning to Europe, in our transportation business, Q1 revenue declined by 8.8% versus 2019, FX weighed on revenue by about 2 percentage points. We were tracking to plan into March when COVID began to impact France and Spain. We continue to hold numerous leadership positions across our transportation verticals, geographies and service lines in Europe. For example, we reinforced our status as the number one LTL provider in France and Spain and a top three LTL provider in the UK. Across our transportation segment, adjusted EBITDA fell by 4%, while adjusted EBITDA margin rose by 40 basis points to 10.3%. Moving on to our logistics segment, our revenue declined 4.3% in North America, reflecting the downsizing of business with our largest customer and our decision to exit some lower margin business. Consumer packaged goods was our strongest vertical. Our proprietary XPO Smart tools are driving productivity and cost efficiency in staffing in our warehouses. And I am pleased to report that XPO Direct operated solidly in the black as it passed its first anniversary. Our shared distribution model is resonating with brands who want to optimize their direct-to-consumer efforts and shippers looking to augment their e-commerce and omni-channel capabilities. Customers value supply chain flexibility now more than ever. We built XPO Direct to address that need. In Europe, logistics revenue declined by 3.5% year-over-year. FX had a negative impact of about 2.5 percentage points. E-commerce and food retail were our strongest verticals in European logistics. Our effort to drive margin improvement in European logistics, which is one of our 10 core profit improvement initiatives, continues to resonate. We reduced loss-makers and drove efficiencies throughout the business. Across our logistics segment as a whole, we have doubled our new business wins to the highest level we have seen since the third quarter of 2018. Since the pandemic we are seeing intense customer interest in surge management. We are meeting that need and in some cases converting these opportunities into longer term deals. Adjusted EBITDA for our logistics segment rose 7% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 8.4% from 7.6% a year ago. Moving down the income statement, interest expense was $72 million versus $71 million a year ago. Our GAAP effective tax rate rose to 30% from 27% a year ago. Our weighted average diluted share count was $103 million, about the same as Q4 compared with 117 million shares a year ago and down 25% from our peak in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our diluted earnings per share, was $0.20 versus $0.37 last year and our adjusted diluted EPS with $0.47 versus $0.51 in the prior year quarter. We remain up and operating across our lines of business in all of our major markets. The pressure on demand is influenced by regional stay-at-home mandates and varies by customer verticals. For example, we have seen pockets of strength in e-commerce, food and beverage and personal care. Our overall revenue in April declined in the low to mid 20s on a percentage basis, which we believe is in line with industry levels for our lines of business. We saw smaller declines in logistics, LTL tracked in line with our full company revenue performance and softer performance from the rest of our transportation segment. North American LTL yield was flat in April similar to March. Truck brokerage volumes eased sequentially from the surge the market experienced in late March, but notably margin dollars per load and net revenue margin have improved from Q1. This has not been a conventional slowdown in any sense. For many customers, it's been a shutdown. While we have been up and operating across our lines of business, some customers have temporarily closed their stores and factories. I mentioned France and Spain earlier. Our activity in those countries hit its lowest levels in early April and our transportation volumes are recovering modestly as these markets prepare to emerge from lockdown. Volumes have been bouncing along the bottom in the UK and the U.S. since mid-April. As industries and geographies reopen, we expect to see improvement. Against this backdrop, consider three important factors: first, 77% of our costs are variable and 23% are fixed. We have been aggressively addressing our costs. Some of our expense reductions are likely to endure post-pandemic, aiding our earnings power when the environment eventually normalizes. Our XPO Smart planning tools are helping us manage through the volatility on a real-time basis and our investments in LTL route optimization and supply chain automation are driving structural cost improvements. Second, as Meghan discussed, we are prioritizing the well-being of our people. We expect expenses related directly to these efforts of up to $50 million or more in the second quarter. And it's hard to imagine a better investment. Our people are the bedrock of XPO. Third, we dialed CapEx way back. We remain committed to a number of important growth investments. For instance, we are in the final stages of prepping our warehouse of the future with Nestle\u0301, which will launch later this month and we are continuing to optimize our routing and LTL pickup and delivery and line-haul, two of the highest ROI opportunities across the company. XPO is built to withstand disruption and when we emerge from the pandemic, we will be even better positioned for success. For example, we are a leader in e-commerce logistics. E-commerce growth has accelerated globally and we expect that to continue after the pandemic. We expect to benefit as the number one outsourced e-fulfillment platform in Europe, the leading reverse logistics platform and the number one last mile platform in the U. S. for big and bulky goods. We envision more demand for logistics automation, where we're a leader in providing advanced solutions at scale and we've been applying this expertise straight through the depths of this downturn. We will see more value placed on data visibility by customers of all types who want more transparency in their supply chains. Our value here lies in our digital freight marketplace, our intelligent analytics, machine learning and our ongoing routing and pricing enhancements. Our cost structure will be leaner. We will remain focused on disciplined capital allocation as we have been since day one, seeking out the strongest risk-adjusted returns. We are a resilient organization. We have been there for our customers and our relationships with them we'll be stronger on the other side of the COVID curve. Now I'd like to turn the call over to David Wyshner our CFO. Sure, Chris. It's Matt. Three points to talk about there. First of all, the only place we really felt the impact of COVID early in Q1 in the U.S. was in intermodal. And that business is impacted \u2013 was impacted by the flow of freight in China, which as you know slowed down with the moderation in the pace of Chinese manufacturing as that country felt the early impact of COVID. So, we have a slower quarter in intermodal throughout \u2013 again, that was the only place in the U.S. we really saw it prior to early March. So that had an impact on that line. The second item to think about is within freight brokerage. Obviously, the entire industry has been \u2013 was experiencing lower net revenue margins year-over-year. That was a function primarily of the contractual rates continuing to come down and the spot market stabilized. As we indicated that margin dynamic did improved in April, but that's the reality that we saw in Q1. And third, as we discussed, we did see a slowing in Europe early to mid March kind of country by country, Spain and France being most significant for our transportation business among the countries that showed slowing earlier in the month, and that also weighed on results for that line item. We look at this on an EBITDA basis and the numbers on an EBITDA basis were solidly positive in each of those business units and for that segment of transportation as a whole. Those are the three items that we have moved transportation ex-LTL in Q1. So, two points to make on that, number one, as we have built our detailed models based on our current experience, revenue trends and what we are seeing in the business, that 77% variable, 23% fixed cost mix is the right way to think about the business. And will likely take you to the proper outcomes of what earnings will look like under different revenue scenarios. Of course, we are working on our cost structure, we are attacking our cost structure. We are looking to take out obviously variable cost and that is happening. We are also looking to take fixed costs out of the business. But that formula that we have used historically is withstanding the test of reality and is the appropriate prism to think about as you build your model out for the current quarter. On top of that obviously, consider the pains that we are taking to care for our people and the costs associated with that. Obviously, we hope and expect that that is a transient cost and that that does not repeat that will be a function of the progress of the pandemic and we are hoping that that passes quickly. Consider two other things, one, this is a shutdown, this is not a slowdown, we have spoken in the past about what recessions would look like. There are customers in segments of industries that have shuttered their facilities for periods of time. That's unusual. And as the economy gets up and running again, we expect our business to slightly lead that and certainly move \u2013 and certainly move in concert with that. And this is just a moment in time. And as we move past Q2, we would expect that 77/23 formula really to work in our favor. Bascome, if our EBITDA and income are lower, our cash taxes will be lower as well. So, as we think about cash flow more broadly, we have spoken about our CapEx coming down from the original plan. Our cash taxes are likely to be lower than our original plan. Our working capital was very favorable in Q1. Working capital can be a source for the year, how it turns out for the year has a lot to do with where revenue is in the fourth quarter. If revenue is strong, it could be a use of cash. If revenue is softer, it would more likely be a source of cash. Those are the biggest moving pieces to think about for free cash flow. Allison, it's Matt. We have lots of different contract structures, ranging from cost-plus to fixed/variable, which means there's a piece that's fixed and another portion that's volume-dependent, to purely transactional. Broadly speaking, the incrementals or decrementals that we expect to see in contract logistics in Q2 are on the better end of what we expect to see for the broader company, which is consistent with the kinds of protections that we have built into our contracts, which were not, to your point, designed exclusively for a global pandemic, but were designed with the intent of protecting us from the slow down. The slowdown in some verticals and for some customers and for some regions is more significant than what we would previously have contemplated, because we did not contemplate the cessation of business activities in regions or sectors, so that will have an impact, but the way the model was built, very big picture, is working. One other point. Our expectation, having spoken with the head of our European business yesterday, is that our European contract logistics volumes are going to get back pretty close to par, not quite there, but getting closer to that by the end of Q2. And we have good visibility on recovery, almost at benchmark levels, well before the end of the year. So, that is a very resilient business, so long as economies and customers are up and running in some form or fashion. So, that that that's an inkling of good news from European contract logistics."

            "name": "Meghan Henson",
            "content": "Thanks Brad. I will start by emphasizing two key aspects of XPO's response to COVID-19: prevention and appreciation. The safety protocols we've implemented are comprehensive and designed to prevent exposure to the virus in addition to dealing with it after the fact. We have procured enough PPE to safeguard our employees at work around the globe, including gloves, hand sanitizer, wipes, thermometers and masks. Inside our facilities, social distancing is our strongest defense. This includes holding shift meetings outdoors where employees can remain 6 feet apart, redesigning traffic flows and changing shift schedules, installing barriers between workstations and having only one chair per cable in break rooms. Our sites have regular proactive cleaning schedules. To encourage our employees to stay home when they are sick, we have added an additional 2 weeks of pandemic paid sick leave to our current paid time off in the U.S. and Canada. We have added 3 COVID-19 testing to our U.S. insurance policy and free access to telemedicine. And we have expanded mental health programs for all employees globally and their dependents. As soon as we know of a confirmed or presumptive case, we follow a tracing protocol and notify those who may have been exposed. Employees who are exposed are required to self-quarantine for 14 days. And when one of our people tests positive, we close the facility for deep cleaning using a team of certified specialists overseen by an industrial hygienist. When we shut down a site for deep cleaning, we send all of the employees home with full pay. We follow the guidelines of the World Health Organization, the CDC, government policies, and our own health and safety protocols to determine when we can safely resume work. In recognition of the contributions of our colleagues who are providing critical supply chain services, we have announced frontline appreciation pay for nearly 40,000 employees in the U.S. and Canada. Hourly employees in our warehouses receive an extra $2 per hour on top of their regular pay rate. Later this month, full-time employees working on our LTL service centers will receive a one-time bonus of $500 and part-time employees will receive a $250 bonus. I am proud of the work our people are doing around the world. We will continue to put their safety and well-being first. With that, I will turn the call over to Matt."

            "name": "David Wyshner",
            "content": "Thanks Matt and good morning everyone. Today I would like to discuss our first quarter cash flow, our balance sheet and our liquidity, and then share some closing remarks. We generated $180 million of cash flow from operations in Q1, spent a $139 million on CapEx and received $54 million of proceeds from asset sales including our ongoing program of selling appreciated real estate. As a result we generated positive free cash flow of $95 million in the quarter versus a free cash flow use of $96 million in Q1 last year. As the scale of the COVID pandemic became clear in March, we aggressively managed working capital and focused on turning our receivables into cash. We became even more disciplined about collections and derived an incremental $72 million year-over-year benefit from our trade receivables programs in the quarter. As our revenue slowed in March it naturally brought down our receivables balance below the March 2019 level. We repurchased 1.7 million shares of our stock at a cost of $114 million in late February and early March under a trading plan that was put in place earlier in the quarter and which triggered when our share price declined fairly dramatically. We stopped buying back stock in mid March. We also throttled back our capital expenditures significantly and currently estimate that gross CapEx will be roughly $400 million this year which is down more than a third from our 2020 plan before the pandemic. As markets became increasingly volatile in March, maintaining strong liquidity became a top priority for us as an organization. In addition to the actions I just mentioned we drew $600 million on our ABL facility in March and ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $1.1 billion. That cash plus another $200 million of available ABL borrowing capacity brought our total liquidity at quarter end to $1.3 billion. In early April we added a $350 million credit facility to further strengthen our liquidity and in late April we issued $850 million of 6.25% five year senior notes. These financings gave us pro forma liquidity of $2.5 billion including $2 billion of cash as of March 31. We have no significant debt maturities until mid 2022 so we feel great about how we have fortified our already strong liquidity position. Our net leverage at quarter end was 2.95x which is just below the lower end of our targeted range of 3x to 4x adjusted EBITDA. So while XPO, like all companies and industries, is facing a highly unusual operating environment, we have the benefit of continuing to operate as an essential business and that gives us feet on the ground and momentum when the uncertainty subsides. We have an exceptionally strong balance sheet and our industry is a leading indicator, meaning that we will be at the forefront of the recovery when it comes. As you may know, I joined XPO in early March. I am happy to be part of a management team that is focused without flinching on keeping our employees safe and providing essential services to our customers in an unprecedented environment. I'm happy to be part of a business that is resilient both operationally and in its ability to generate cash and I am happy to be part of a global team that provides transportation and logistics solutions that are reliable, in demand and important. With that, we look forward to taking your questions."

            "name": "Brad Jacobs",
            "content": "Thank you, operator. Good morning, everybody. I am joined virtually this morning by David Wyshner, our Chief Financial Officer; Meghan Henson, our Chief Human Resources Officer; and Matt Fassler, our Chief Strategy Officer. Also for the Q&A portion of the call, we have Tavio Headley, our Senior Director of Investor Relations; Ravi Tulsyan, our Treasurer; Kyle Wismans, SVP of Financial Planning and Analysis; and our newest addition, Kevin Sterling who has joined as VP of Strategy. Welcome to the team, Kevin. I want to start by expressing my profound appreciation to all the frontline workers at our company in our industry and across other professions who have kept society functioning during the pandemic. I am particularly grateful to our warehouse workers, dockworkers and drivers who provide an essential service to our customers. You will hear directly from Meghan about the actions we have taken to keep our people safe, then Matt will cover the quarter and some improvements we drove in the business and provide color around April, and David will wrap up the prepared remarks and then on to Q&A. Turning to the quarter, we had a strong January and a strong February. Then the pandemic sharply disrupted our end markets. It started with our European operations in early March and began to affect parts of our North American business later in the month. We quickly terminated our strategic review process and turned 100% of our focus to keeping our employees safe, our customers operational, and our balance sheet rock solid. We had $1.3 billion of liquidity as of quarter end and we added another $1.2 billion in April for total liquidity of $2.5 billion. We delivered $333 million of adjusted EBITDA on the quarter and expanded our EBITDA margin by 30 basis points. And I am proud that even in an economy on pause, we delivered $95 million of positive free cash flow in a quarter that's typically negative. We expect to generate hundreds of millions of dollars of free cash flow this year. Like all crises, this pandemic has a beginning of middle and an end. We're in the middle of it now and it will end. XPO Logistics will emerge far stronger than we were pre-COVID. Many of our core strengths position us for growth on the other side of the pandemic, including our proficiencies in e-commerce, advanced automation and data science and our focused, compassionate culture. Our billions of dollars of investment in these areas give us a head start on growth in the recovery. That's why, while I am a bear in the short-term, I am a bull in the medium-term and I am a mega bull for XPO in 2021 and beyond. With that, I will turn the presentation over to Meghan. Well, free cash flow \u2013 we'll generate hundreds of millions of dollars of free cash flow. We can't be more specific than that, because we don't know. We don't know how the pandemic is going to play out. We don't know if Europe, even though it's coming back really fast, really sharply, whether that will continue on that trajectory. We don't know if the United States, which has bottomed from our perspective, we see volumes bottomed, we see a lot of things stabilized. We don't see it getting better yet. So, we don't know how fast it's going to get better and how much it's going to get better. So, there are still a lot of imponderables here that we really don't know. In our models, in all scenarios, we should be generating hundreds of millions of dollars of free cash flow, though. In terms of leverage, we have the same parameters. We have always felt that 3x to 4x leverage is the right amount of leverage to not put the company at risk, but to improve the returns for the common shareholders. In this environment, there are some of our shareholders who would like us to shoot for a lower leverage target. Maybe we will. We will revisit that at the board. In terms of the ability to de-leverage, I think we will generate substantial free cash flow, but we don't have a firm handle on exactly what the EBITDA will be, so we don't know what the multiple will be on that. Well, the strategic review process is completely off the table. It's yesterday's news. We are not spending a minute on it today. In terms of the question about what do we think of the value of the company, we look at the value the company from a long-term perspective, not from what it's multiple of this particular quarter even this particular year, and we look at the cash flow generation ability over the next 5, 10 years, and we discount that. We think, by all parameters, the stock is trading at significant discount to its intrinsic value, but all we can do is focus on everything we can to improve the quality of the company, keep our people safe, maximize the revenue and the EBITDA and free cash flow and we think the multiple will take care of itself in due course. Thank you. Right now, the comments I made are specific to Q2. We obviously have different scenarios that we are modeling for the year, but we have the greatest visibility to Q2. Obviously, we have good visibility in April and we shared our revenues to-date with you from that perspective. Thinking about how Q2 is going to play out, we're thinking about that fixed/variable cost mix as the appropriate basis for modeling. We did a good job managing the business through the volatility that we saw at the end of Q1 and yes we generated operating leverage despite a modest revenue decline, but with the revenue declines that we're seeing in April, and it's a different order of magnitude because the world is in a very different place, you are going to see the math work out the way I discussed rather than reflective of the performance that we had in Q1, which against your point we are very proud of. Auto -- we have mid-single digits of our revenue tied to auto. Auto has been way down. Many of our auto customers have been at zero. The good news is, if you talk to Ford or Toyota or Honda, they're all opening up in the next few weeks, so they are going to go from nothing to something, and we'll see how fast they ramp up and where they get up to on the peak, but it is going to be a lot better than nothing. In terms of Boeing, Boeing is a valued customer of ours. And we do two things for them. We do military and we do commercial. The military part of the business is strong and stable and the outlook is really positive. On the commercial side, there could be some lightness, there could be some decrease. It certainly won't go down to nothing. It'll go down somewhat, but not way, way, way down. It'll go down a little bit. Thank you. Well, Scott, e-commerce saved us in April, frankly. It was our strongest performing vertical across the board. It was actually going up and most everything else was going down. Food and beverage was also strong but, if you take out the e-com and if you take out food and beverage, except for a few little specifics, all other parts of transportation logistics did not perform well from the middle of March till to the end of April. It's a great business to be in right now, because it's not a cyclical phenomenon, in our opinion, as much as a secular phenomenon. We expect some of these behavioral changes that are taking place during the pandemic to continue post-pandemic. We had 9% organic revenue growth in our last mile business in the first quarter and that's a standout, and the reason is people were inside and people were ordering exercise equipment online. People were ordering DIY and lawn and garden and home improvement from their homes. People ordering appliances and home electronics online, so that that growth of online is a big -- we are a big beneficiary of that. Of course in Europe we're the largest provider of e-fulfillment services for e-commerce and that's also been really positive recently. And then if you look at reverse logistics, and we do so many different diversified things in reverse and returns management around the globe, that's also a winner that's going against the trend here. I mean, omnichannel and so forth and so on. So, I think e-com is a good place to be right now and, fortunately, we have a good exposure to it. It's not the majority of our business though. The 10 levers are still very much on. Obviously we're prioritizing the health and the safety of employees over the 10 levers, but the 10 levers are still important for the financial health of our employees, and some of the initiatives are on kind of pause, but others are full speed ahead. So, the major projects and the biggest ones that are still full speed ahead are pricing algorithms, because every time we get pricing right, it optimizes our bottom line, because we don't lose business that we shouldn't lose and we get business that we should get and we don't leave money on the table unnecessarily. And in pricing, the pricing initiatives affect all of our business, all of our businesses involve pricing. The other lever that is growing, and it's growing in importance, is automation, particularly warehouse automation. One of the things that we had to focus on and deal within a way that no one focused on before was how do you run a warehouse with keeping 6-feet distancing between everybody? How do you run a cross dock facility with 6-feet distancing around everybody? In the warehouse, we are farther along on automation than we are in LTL, but even in LTL, some of the equipment, over time, can be automated for safety's sake, for efficiency's sake. In the warehouse, we are either the leader or one of the top two leaders in warehouse automation. And all of our robotics and our AI and our machine learning, it's all \u2013 we are doubling down on that. That's something that we are still spending money on and we feel good about spending money on that, because forget about the long-term, even in the medium-term, there is going to be a big return on that. Customers like it, our workers like it, frankly. Of the other levers, the Smart workforce planning tools, the labor management tools to enhance productivity, those are also full speed ahead. I am so happy that we had Smart rolled out to the majority of our locations, where we have workers prior to this pandemic, because we would have never been able to manage the headcount so accurately as we did. It would have been much more random. So, getting the right size of the staffing, getting the right blend between full-time and part-time, getting the right shift times and shift endings. Smart saved the day on that one. So, that's still full speed ahead. In LTL, we are still working on the P&D optimization. That's something that's very important. We are not \u2013 haven't stopped on that. We are still working on the line-haul optimization and, of course, the pricing opportunities there. When you look at the 10 levers, most of them are driven by technology. So, our tech team is all working from home and of course, a lot of them always work from home, that's a tech kind of thing. And they have been highly productive and highly focused on keeping progress made on these very, very important levers. Thank you. Yes, 77%, and rising, of our costs are variable. The two biggest categories within that 77%, Ari, are labor and purchased transportation. Those are the two big things that we spend lots of money on, billions of billions of dollars on. On the labor that -- we have a system that has labor go up when we have more volume and has labor go down when we don't have volume for them to do. So, that is a self-regulating cost control process that's been in place for a while and we just keep improving the technology that powers that every month. On the purchased transportation, similarly, it's fairly self-regulating, because if we don't, in our transportation business, have load count, if we don't have shipments coming in, where we don't go out and purchase third-party capacity, we don't add drivers, we don't add trucks. So, the model self corrects quite a bit, because of the way -- what we spend the money on. Well, when the pandemic hit. It was quite a shock to everyone, including us. And the first thought that went through our mind was, well, how do we protect our people? We have 100,000 people. How do we protect our people from this terrible virus? And that took up a large percentage of our efforts. We had to learn a lot of stuff. We had to learn all about hygiene and we had to learn about social distancing. We had to learn about training. We had to learn about PPE. There was a lot to learn immediately, quickly. So, our HR organization led that multi-discipline effort and that became a top priority after that. In terms of where we can allocate capital going forward, we would think about creating shareholder value by 1 of 4 things. Paying down debt, and pre-funding the 2022 maturities, for example. Or, CapEx where we see growth. We're still investing in CapEx. We have a wonderful joint venture with Nestle\u0301, a 15-year joint venture, the warehouse of the future that's going to open up in the next few months. We're still investing in that. We still have a contract logistics businesses that are coming our way, either because goods came in from China and there's no demand for them, so people need storage. We are helping many, many customers with that. Or, customers who are reopening and coming back into business and they need contract logistic help. So, we are investing CapEx into that because we see a very defined and measurable and high return on those projects. The third category we look at in terms of capital allocation would be M&A. While it is not top of mind right now -- it's kind of difficult to buy a company over Zoom -- it is something we think about and something we're talking about and we are watching. And then the fourth category of capital allocation would be share repurchases. So, we want to always be looking at our stock and seeing if it makes more sense to buy back our stock or to do one of the other three things I just mentioned. All these three things require capital and the survival of the company was the thing that we thought about in the same breath as the survival of our employees. And, from a financial perspective, we wanted to load up on cash. It's hard to be -- it's hard to go broke when you have $2.5 billion of liquidity, I will put it like that. So, we had over $1 billion of liquidity in the quarter when we went out and we raised a high-yield bond offering and we did a couple transactions with some banks and now we have got $2 billion of cash in the bank, and we have $500 million of availability on various lines. So, we have $2.5 billion of liquidity and we're cash flow positive, so I feel that we've, from a financial perspective, done our duty to protect the company from another surprise, which could happen. We don't know if the virus is going to come back. We don't know if there is going to be a W. We don't know that. So, I feel we're protected by having $2.5 billion of liquidity, and it gives us flexibility and options and also gives us protection. Well we've got about $500 million left on the repurchase program authorization, but it's not the only application of capital and we will have to be more disciplined -- even more disciplined than we always have been on stock buybacks, because there's more risk and uncertainty in the future. So, it's not the highest priority for us to go buy back shares, but I don't rule it out. And we would announce that retroactively, not prospectively. So, we would announce any share repurchases we did at the end of the quarter, not ahead of time. Thank you, Ari. Bascome, I think the answer to all of those questions are we think the same thing we thought prior to the pandemic. And we look at 2020 as kind of a lost year for earnings growth. This is a year to stay strong, stay solid, stay safe, be well, protect our employees, protect the balance sheet, protect our relationships with customers and live to fight another day. And our base-case scenario is this all works itself out over the course of this year. In 2021, we look back at 2020 and go, whew, what a crazy year that was, but we are glad it's over with. And 2021, in that scenario that we think it's the base case scenario, should look pretty much like we thought 2020 was going to look like before the pandemic happened. So, we will see operating leverage from revenue growth transferring to EBITDA, transferring to free cash flow. We will see all the cross-selling opportunities. We will see all the opportunities to get more market share, because of our outsized exposure to fast-growing places in the industry, like e-commerce. We will see the fruit, as we have been seeing, of the billions and billions of dollars of investment we made in technology, into warehouse automation, into our digital freight marketplace and XPO Connect, all the projects I mentioned few minutes ago in LTL on pickup and delivery and line-haul and so forth.  I think we will come out of the crisis with a lower cost structure. I think that's partly because we have been rolling out our Smart labor tools and they have just been working very, very, very well. And I think it's because we just learned, as many companies have, not just in our industry, as many companies, how to work differently; how to work more leanly; how to reduce travel and entertainment cost; how to reduce the time costs of all this travelling, the big cost in time -- all the fatigue and getting sick and being out of the office. And so I think we are going to have a greater work from home population. And I think we will figure out ways to crack the nut on making sure that everyone working from home is just as focused and just as productive as they would be if they were in the office. Now, you won't be able to work from home if you work in the warehouse or if you are driving a truck. So, that parts of the business will look fairly the same, except there will be a little bit more automation. The answer is, Allison, I don't know. We have to see the timing of how all this plays out. We have a very clear path of action points in LTL which will steadily improve its margin and steadily improve EBITDA generation, will steadily improve its free cash flow generation and its returns. Timing of it, like with all our businesses, we -- it's really hard to nail it down. I mean, LTL a great quarter, by the way, in the first quarter. We had a record OR. It improved 420 basis points with real estate -- without real estate, 320 basis points excluding real estate. The operating income was up 32% on a year-over-year basis. I'd call that a good quarter. There were many bright spots. We had lots of new business won, load factor was up 5.2%, dock productivity was up 8%. So, we're firing on all 8 cylinders in LTL. The problem is the industrial economy is not open for business yet. So, we have seen tonnage dramatically decrease, as the whole industry has. And tonnage has gone down as much as 20%, even a little bit more than 20%. That's the bad news. The good news is it's stabilized. It hit bottom. It found a bottom. There were weeks over the last couple of months where we were seeing -- we have about 60 metrics that we watch every morning and they're color coded, and almost all of them were red. Week after week, it was not very pleasant to watch those metrics. They started turning yellow and they started turning green, so they are stabilizing towards forecast. We used to do biweekly forecasts. We moved to weekly forecasts. We are doing daily forecasts now, and LTL is tracking to the forecast. So, I'm very confident in the management we have in LTL. I like our position in LTL. I love the projects that we are working on, they are really cutting edge. I have great confidence in them. I do believe we'll get to $1 billion of EBITDA and LTL, whether it's next year or the following year. It's too early to confidently predict that. Thank you, Allison. Thank you, operator, and thanks everyone for turning into our calls. And we will be seeing many of you in the upcoming conference season over video conference. We are looking forward to the time when it's safe for us to all see each other in person and to, where appropriate, shake hands or even give a hug and be back to normal. So, thank you for your support and talk to you in due course. Have a great day. Be safe."

I will now turn the call over to Brad Jacobs. Mr. Jacobs, you may now begin.   \nBrad Jacobs:\n : Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our call. With me today in Greenwich are Ravi Tulsyan, our CFO; Matt Fassler, our Chief Strategy Officer; Mario Harik, our CIO and acting President of LTL; and Drew Wilkerson, President of North American Transportation.    Yesterday, we reported a fourth quarter that delivered a number of record results. The company as a whole performed well. We grew revenue by 14% year-over-year to $3.4 billion, which was the highest revenue of any quarter in our history. We generated adjusted EBITDA that was a solid beat versus our fourth quarter guidance, and we beat on full year EBITDA as well. We also reported the highest adjusted diluted EPS of any quarter in our history, again, significantly higher than expectations.    Our growth was led by our 2 largest businesses: North American LTL and truck brokerage. In LTL, we delivered record fourth quarter revenue and record year-over-year growth in yield. Our adjusted operating ratio in the quarter degraded year-over-year, which was expected, given some third quarter challenges within our network. But the negative trend bottomed out in October when we launched our LTL action plan with Mario at the helm.    Our plan had an immediate impact on our year-over-year performance. We reduced the erosion in our operating ratio and improved our volume trend as the quarter progressed. Importantly, we expect our year-over-year adjusted operating ratio ex real estate to inflect positive midyear and generate over 100 basis points of improvement in 2022.    In truck brokerage, we had another quarter of outstanding growth, with load count increasing to record levels for the third consecutive quarter. The biggest tailwind driving our volume is XPO Connect, our digital brokerage platform. Shipper and carrier adoption of Connect is growing extremely fast.    In December, we exceeded 600,000 cumulative driver downloads of the platform's mobile app, which is good news for customers, because they want digital access to as many carriers as possible. In the fourth quarter, weekly carrier usage on XPO Connect was up year-over-year by 74%.    So in sum, a good fourth quarter with great traction going into 2022. The full year guidance we issued yesterday reflects our expectation of strong earnings growth this year. The midpoint of our guidance range for 2022 adjusted EBITDA reflects 11% growth versus 2021, and the midpoint for adjusted diluted EPS reflects 22% growth.    Our LTL action plan is moving our adjusted operating ratio in the right direction. We still expect to generate at least $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA in LTL this year. And our truck brokerage revenue is growing at a pace that's 3x faster than industry growth. Finally, we remain committed to deleveraging toward a net leverage ratio of 1 to 2x by the first half of next year. This will be a key milestone in achieving an investment-grade rating.    We're intent on being best-in-class in every aspect of our business, and we're confident of continuing to deliver superior shareholder value.    Now I'll hand it over to Ravi to discuss our results and our balance sheet. Ravi?   \nRavi Tulsyan:\n : Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our fourth quarter and full year results, our balance sheet and liquidity and our outlook for 2022. I'll start with the fourth quarter, where we delivered strong year-over-year growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS.    Revenue in the quarter was a record $3.4 billion, up 14% year-over-year. The net impact of fuel prices and FX contributed 3 points to this growth. Organic revenue growth for the quarter was 11%. We grew adjusted EBITDA by 12% to a Q4 record of $323 million. This reflects strong growth and execution in our brokerage and other services segment.    Looking at a 2-year stack, adjusted EBITDA was up 25% on a pro forma basis. Our adjusted earnings per diluted share for the quarter was $1.34, which was up from $0.53 from a year ago, an increase of over 150%. This increase was primarily driven by higher adjusted EBITDA, lower interest expense and a lower tax rate.    We generated $98 million of cash flow from continuing operations, spent $101 million on gross CapEx and received $60 million of proceeds from asset sales. As a result, our free cash flow was $57 million, which was at the high end of our expectations.    For the full year 2021, we delivered revenue of $12.8 billion, a year-over-year increase of 26%. Adjusted EBITDA for the year was $1.24 billion, reflecting growth of 46%. We more than quadrupled our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations to $4.30 compared to $1.01 from a year ago. We generated free cash flow of $475 million, an increase of over $200 million year-over-year, representing a free cash conversion rate on net income of 97%.    Our cash balance at December 31 was $260 million. This cash, combined with available debt capacity under committed borrowing facilities, gave us $1.3 billion of liquidity at year-end. We had no borrowings outstanding under our ABL facility. Maintaining strong liquidity remains a top priority for us.    We reduced our gross debt by approximately $3 billion in the year, and we have no significant debt maturities until 2025. Our 2021 net leverage at year-end was 2.7x adjusted EBITDA. Our plan is to continue to delever our balance sheet through free cash flow generation and adjusted EBITDA growth. Our progress on deleveraging is important in the context of our commitment to achieve an investment-grade rating.    Turning to the guidance we issued yesterday after market close. Our full year guidance for adjusted EBITDA is $1.36 billion to $1.4 billion. This guide assumes gains from real estate sales of approximately $50 million versus $62 million in 2021. Our current plan is to execute real estate sales in the second half of the year, and these sales will primarily consist of excess land that does not fit our long-term needs.    On the cash flow front, our outlook is for full year free cash flow of $400 million to $450 million. We expect full year growth CapEx to be $500 million to $550 million and net CapEx to be $425 million to $475 million. This significant year-over-year increase in growth CapEx reflects our plan to make growth investments in our LTL business.    Our full year guidance for depreciation and amortization expense is approximately $400 million, and we expect interest expense of $170 million to $180 million. We expect our full year tax rate to be 24% to 25%.    Our average diluted common share count for the year is expected to be approximately 117 million, and our outlook for full year adjusted EPS is $5 to $5.45. For the first quarter, we expect our adjusted EBITDA to be $280 million to $285 million. This guidance assumes no real estate sales in the quarter versus $17 million in the same period a year ago.    In conclusion, we are continuing to execute on our strategy of driving shareholder value as a pure-play transportation company, and we are excited about our prospects for 2022.    I will now turn things over to Matt.   \nMatthew Jeremy Fassler:\n : Thanks, Ravi. I'll review our fourth quarter operating results, starting with our North American LTL segment. We grew revenue by 10% year-over-year to a fourth quarter record of $1 billion. Excluding fuel, we grew revenue by 4% year-over-year. We had a 4.9% year-over-year decline in tonnage per day, reflecting the impact of the short-term embargoes we utilized to optimize network flow. When the embargoes were in place in October and November, our tonnage trends lagged typical seasonality, then with the embargoes lifted, we outperformed typical seasonality in December and January, despite headwinds from Omicron and weather.    During the quarter, we saw evidence of industrial verticals regaining momentum. Given the amount of industrial and our LTL mix, this bodes well for demand for our services in 2022. Yield, excluding fuel, outperformed typical seasonality in each month of the quarter. And for the quarter as a whole, year-over-year, yield increased 11%. This was nearly twice our previous record increase set in the third quarter.    Revenue per shipment for the quarter, excluding fuel, also grew 11%. The LTL pricing environment remains firm, and we're driving yield with our own company-specific pricing initiatives.    Our LTL-adjusted operating ratio for the quarter was 84%. Excluding real estate gains, our adjusted operating ratio was 87.5%, which was 300 basis points higher than the fourth quarter a year ago. The biggest drivers of the OR degradation were the embargoes I mentioned earlier, which impacted volume, and the higher cost of purchased transportation. We expect to realize a favorable trend in our operating ratio as our network efficiency continues to improve and we bring new equipment and drivers into our organization.    In our brokerage and other services segment, we grew revenue by 17% to a record $2.4 billion and increased adjusted EBITDA by 29% to a record $161 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the segment expanded by 70 basis points to 6.7% from 6% the prior year. The largest revenue and profit driver in this segment is our North American truck brokerage business, which had an outstanding fourth quarter. We increased our brokerage loads per day by 22% versus a year ago or 50% on a 2-year basis. Fourth quarter revenue rose 36% year-over-year or 136% on a 2-year basis. Margin dollars rose 10% against a tough comp and rose 86% on a 2-year basis. On a sequential basis, margin dollars in the fourth quarter were 29% higher than in Q3.    Our truck brokerage growth reflects a strong market, our unique technology proposition and our close ties with key enterprise customers. Drew will speak more about these drivers in a minute.    Finally, I want to share a couple of notable awards. XPO was named one of America's Best Employers for 2022 by Forbes and one of America's Most Responsible Companies by Newsweek. We were also a Best Place To Work on the Disability Equality Index and a Top Company for Women to Work For in Transportation by the Women in Trucking Association.    Now I'll turn it over to Mario for his comments on North American LTL.   \nMario A. Harik:\n : Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. LTL has made a lot of progress since our third quarter call. I'll start with the 5 points of our action plan we began executing in October.    One major objective was to achieve better network flow, and our plan had an immediate impact. We started with selective strategic embargoes to rebalance the network. By November, we had cleared out the third quarter backlog. This improved our on-time transit sharply from the end of the third quarter to the end of the fourth quarter, along with other service metrics.    Second is pricing and yield. The record 11% year-over-year increase in yield, ex fuel, we reported is a result of multiple initiatives we have underway. We pulled our 5.9% general rate increase forward from the typical January timing to early November. We\u2019re also making sure we get paid for services that give customers added value, like equipment in detention and freight that requires special handling.    And then there's our pricing technology. This is our single biggest opportunity to drive yield. We've developed proprietary pricing tools that make sure we charge a fair price.    The third part of our plan is our in-house driver schools. This is a huge advantage in the driver shortage. We graduated approximately 900 new drivers last year, which is more than twice the number of graduates we had in 2019. Our goal is to double that number again this year to about 1,800 drivers.    Fourth, on the equipment side, we added a second production line to our trailer manufacturing facility in Arkansas. We're on track to double our trailer output this year.    The fifth part of our plan has to do with expanding our footprint to drive growth and network efficiencies. We plan to add 900 net new doors to our network by year-end 2023. This equates to about 6% increase in doors from the start of the plan. So far, we've opened terminals in Chicago Heights in October and in Wisconsin and Arkansas in January. We're also opening 4 new fleet maintenance shops this quarter.    Now I want to take a deeper dive into our LTL technology and the new developments we're rolling out. The pricing tools I mentioned are part of the new pricing platform we just deployed. This platform does the heavy lifting in analyzing shipping data so our LTL pricing experts can be much more productive with contract negotiations. These tools have reduced manual data processing by as much as 80%. And we now have the ability to mine historical RFP data as a seamless lead generation tool for sales. We'll continue to enhance this platform going forward.    We've also made inroads in dynamic pricing, which allows us to update customer rates on certain loads in real time to incentivize them to give the business to us. And we launched an automated process that onboards customers immediately to dynamic pricing, which shortens the contract negotiation cycle.    The other areas ripe for tech innovation in LTL are our linehaul and dock operations. Between now and midyear, we'll be launching new tools to help further optimize how we load our trailers. These tools are designed to increase direct trips, which utilize our trucks and drivers more efficiently, and they\u2019ll improve dock productivity.    In other recent tech launches, we completed the rollout of new planning software on our pickup and delivery platform, and we'll complete a rollout of new dispatch tools by midyear. And we'll start deploying new digital tools for customer self-service and new visibility into multi-pallet shipments. We're continuing to make it easy for our customers to do business with XPO.    So as you can see, we have a lot happening on the technology front and a lot more opportunity going forward, as well as the tangible goals we set for 2022. We expect to generate at least $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA in LTL this year. Our entire team is committed to delivering on this goal. We also expect to deliver more than 100 basis points of full year improvement in our adjusted operating ratio, excluding real estate gains.    Here's how the dots will connect between where we are today and our goal this year. In the first quarter, we project about 200 basis points of degradation in our adjusted operating ratio, ex real estate, year-over-year. From there, we'll continue to reduce the erosion and reach the inflection point midyear. We'll improve our adjusted operating ratio in the second half, putting us on track for more than 100 basis points of improvement for the full year.    We know exactly what it takes to hit these marks. The comprehensive action plan we're executing should unlock more LTL revenue and margin growth going forward.    In 2021, when our company-wide return on invested capital was 32%, our ROIC from LTL was even higher. We're on track to nearly triple our adjusted EBITDA this year since acquiring this business in 2015. And it's a cash engine. Over the last 6 years, we've generated more than $3 billion of net cash from LTL alone.    Now we're going to invest more of our LTL operating cash flow into the business to accelerate its growth. This year, our LTL growth CapEx will be 8% to 9% of revenue, covering investments in fleet, facilities and technology. That compares to 5% of revenue last year.    That gives you a high-level view of the many tactical actions we're taking to drive revenue and margin growth and return to year-over-year improvement in our operating ratio.    We're off to a strong start. We generated sequential operating ratio improvement through the fourth quarter, with December being the strongest month. In January, tonnage remained stronger than typical seasonality. We're seeing major improvements in our service metrics, along with improvements in customer satisfaction and employee satisfaction. We believe strongly in this business. We are on the right track, and our plan is working.    Now Drew is going to cover truck brokerage, and then we'll go to Q&A. Drew?   \nDrew M. Wilkerson:\n : Thanks, Mario. North American truck brokerage had another phenomenal quarter, the latest in a long history of outperforming the market. Over the last 9 years, from 2013 through 2021, we delivered a revenue CAGR of 27%, which is 3x the industry CAGR of 9%. There were some compelling trends underpinning our growth in 2021.    For the full year, the number of customers who generated over $1 million of revenue with us increased by 48% versus the prior year. We grew volume with our top 20 customers by 35%. These large, sticky relationships are the bedrock of our customer base. And overall, we served over 2,200 customers who were not in our customer base a year earlier.    Another reason we're getting outsized growth is our XPO Connect digital platform. We have first-mover advantage with proprietary brokerage automation dating back to the inception of XPO in 2011. That's when we first envisioned industry demand for a fully automated service for transportation procurement.    XPO Connect is continuing to grow super fast. In the fourth quarter, the number of customers registered on the platform was up 41% year-over-year, and registered carriers were up 38%. This technology is a great lever to attract and retain customers and also carriers, which is critical when the market is tight. 79% of the carriers who do business with us on XPO Connect returned to the platform within 30 days.    XPO Connect is a powerful growth engine, but it's not the only advantage we have with our proprietary technology. We also created dynamic pricing algorithms that we use with customers and carriers. The algorithms leverage automation and machine learning to generate real-time pricing for every transportation lane at any given day and time.    Customers of all sizes increasingly want access to our pricing tools. In the fourth quarter, the number of transactions driven by APIs and other integrations was 2.7x higher year-over-year, and 70% of our loads in the quarter were created or covered digitally.    The bottom line is we have a lot of runway to continue to take market share, and we're doing it profitably. The $440 billion total addressable truckload market in North America is shifting towards brokers, in part because companies are rethinking their supply chains and want flexible capacity with lower risk. We\u2019ve positioned our business to capture this opportunity at any point in the cycle.    In the current environment, truckload demand is strong and capacity is constrained, primarily due to equipment shortages and driver shortages. We offer a best-in-class combination of lane density, technology, experience and scale, with access to over 1 million trucks, and the headcount we added during the pandemic increases our capacity for growth.    These are significant advantages in expanding our business. That was true in 2021, and we saw it again in January, when we realized strong year-over-year volume growth again in January. We expect to generate double-digit volume growth in 2022 and going forward.    With that, we'll go to Q&A and take your questions. Operator?   \n :\nOperator:\n : (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup.   \nChristian F. Wetherbee:\n : Maybe we could start on the LTL side. Was curious about the operating ratio progression as we think about 2022. So I know down 200 in the first quarter and positive in the back half. How do you think about 2Q and maybe sort of how that cadence kind of plays out? Clearly, the comps are a little easier in the back half of the year. So getting to that 100 on a full year basis will be supported by improvement then. But I guess I wanted to again get a sense of what you think the shape of the first half will be.   \nMario A. Harik:\n : Yes. Sure thing, Chris. This is Mario. So when we think about the cadence, so first starting with the first quarter. We expect a 200 basis point OR degradation in that quarter, which is sequentially better by 100 basis points from the 300 points degradation we had in the fourth quarter. And we'll drive that OR improvement starting with volume.    So we had 4.9% volume decline in the fourth quarter, and we expect a low single-digit decline in the first quarter. And both, when we think about the exit run rate from the fourth quarter, both in December and January, we outpaced typical seasonality on volume despite the Omicron and weather in the first part of the quarter here.    Now the next step from there would be on the cost side. So we already have seen improvement in labor efficiencies as we cleared the backlogs with the embargoes, and we're going to expect that to continue through the course of the year. And however, that was offset in the first quarter, at least, with higher purchased transportation costs that will carry through the first half of the year, because we typically reset our PT costs in the spring time frame.    Now from a yield standpoint, we continue to expect yield to be very strong for the year, starting with the first quarter. So for the first quarter, we expect yield to be up in the high single digits, which is still reflecting obviously the strong underlying environment, but also the actions we are taking, offset by weight per shipment being higher for us typically in the first quarter. So that's the dynamic of Q1 of the 200 point deterioration.    Now as we go through the year, we expect to get to an inflection by midyear on OR and then get back to positive improvement on a full quarter basis in the back half for a total OR improvement of more than 100 basis points for the full year.    But net-net, if you think how we get there, one, volume, we keep on increasing, yield would remain strong for the course of the year in the high single digits, obviously, with Q4 being slightly softer given where we were in Q4 of last year. And then costs would normalize, where some of the cost headwinds will turn into tailwinds as we get into the back half of the year.   \nChristian F. Wetherbee:\n : Okay. So it sounds like 2Q is kind of in that flattish type of range. Is that reasonable to assume? Or is that sort of part of how you think about the cadence?   \nMario A. Harik:\n : Yes. So that's in the ZIP code, Chris.    Christian F. Wetherbee Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate that. And then just a quick follow-up in terms of the growth of the door count in 2022. I know you're targeting 6% over a 2-year basis. I want to get a sense of how quickly do you start to see ramping up that capacity? I know you've opened some facilities. I guess I want to get a sense of maybe how you see it playing out in the context of that OR progression we just talked about.   \nMario A. Harik:\n : Overall, from adding capacity, we think about the ramp from once we add a door to be roughly in the 6-month time frame. But also there's a dynamic. When we think about adding doors, that's a combination of both getting volume in certain markets, but also getting linehaul efficiency in certain markets in terms of our freight -- what we call freight assembly centers, or where we break freight and rebuild trailers for customers as freight flows through the network. But typically, for the business case, our ramp process is around a 6-month time frame.    Now we expect from the doors to add in 2022 to roughly have about 1% of revenue or $40 million worth of additional revenue from these doors. And obviously, that would accelerate going into 2023 as we keep on adding terminals and doors.   \nOperator:\n : The next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research.   \nScott H. Group:\n : I want to ask another on the LTL margin. I just want to think more sequentially. So the guidance implies that you outperform seasonality pretty meaningfully in second quarter and the rest of the year. I guess, why didn't we see any of this in the fourth quarter when pricing was accelerating so sharply? And I guess, what change is starting in 2Q to get there? And maybe just along those lines, you mentioned something about cost headwinds turning into tailwinds. Are you thinking that PT becomes a tailwind in the back half?   \nMario A. Harik:\n : Yes. Let me start first with the Q2...   \nScott H. Group:\n : Purchased transportation, sorry.   \nMario A. Harik:\n : Yes, you got it, Scott. So let's start first with the fourth quarter. So there were 2 drivers for the Q4 decline beyond the numbers we discussed last time. One was that we obviously implemented our strategic embargoes and metered the amount of volume we're getting in the network to improve network flow. And we extended these embargoes through November because they substantially improved network flow. And now obviously, that increases costs and lower volume, which is short-term pain for long-term benefit of having better network flow.    And also in the back half of the quarter, we saw that third-party linehaul rates went up and have since stabilized. Now when you think about the improvements or the benefits from improved network flow, they include obviously reducing the backlog, and we reduced that down to target levels. Service has improved sharply versus the third quarter. Customer satisfaction has jumped in both internal and third-party surveys as well as -- typically, network improvements are the precursor for OR improvements.    Now more importantly, for the fourth quarter, when you think about the progression, October was the low point of OR degradation, and December was the best month for the quarter. And again, we see that kind of inflecting as we get to the midyear.    Now when we think through the course of the year, there are 3 main drivers for OR. So the first one is volume, which is typically backed by capacity. Second is pricing. And then third is operational efficiency that ties to cost.    And now starting with volume, as I mentioned earlier, we've seen that acceleration of volume, which outpaced typical seasonality in both December and January. And we expect volume to continue to accelerate through the course of the year.    As we mentioned in our 5-point action plan, we're building to add more capacity to the network to allow us to handle more volume. We're graduating and hiring more drivers from our schools. We've doubled the trailer production capacity in our in-house manufacturing facility. We're adding more tractors, starting here in the first quarter, having great discussions with our OEMs. And we're also adding more doors progressively through the year.    We're also investing in our sales force. So we're dedicating some of our strategic centers to LTL, and we're seeing more business either enter or return to our network, as well. So the volume is going to accelerate through the course of the year as we go forward.    On the pricing side, so I'd say a similar dynamic in terms of pricing staying strong for the full year, being in that high single-digit range is what we expect. And we are also contemplating a potential additional GRI for local accounts in the first half, depending on what's happening in the pricing environment.    And then finally, on the cost side, as I said earlier, the headwinds would flip into tailwinds because we would be cycling through purchased transportation costs in the back half, but also as we build efficiency back from a labor perspective and all the other cost categories, that would turn to a lower increase in the back half. But net-net, I mean, obviously, it will be more than 100 basis point improvement for the full year, for a record OR for the year.   \nScott H. Group:\n : Okay. And then just a second question. The brokerage, other operating margins were really strong in Q4. It doesn't look like the guidance implies that this continues. So maybe just some thoughts on the brokerage op margin -- brokerage and other op margins this year. And maybe as long as we're talking on this segment, any update, Brad, on potential asset sales here?   \nDrew M. Wilkerson:\n : So I'll kick it off. As we said, we saw extremely strong trends in January of taking volume. If you look back to the fourth quarter, volume was up 22% on a year-over-year basis. But we also saw over the last 2 years, our loads per day was up 50%. Our net revenue per load was up 50%, and our net revenue more than doubled.    So we're continuing to take share, and we're confident that we'll still be able to do that for 3 main reasons. One is our technology. If you look at our technology, it's focused on customers, the carriers we work with and our people. The customers that we work with, our technology helps them make transportation decisions on what mode they should be shipping, when they should be shipping. It even does little things of give them updates if there's an alert on any sort of delay. It also helps, on the carrier side that we're working with, it's very sticky. And we see that because 79% of the carriers returned to us on XPO Connect within 30 days. And then we're continuing to see it within our employees. As you look over the last 5 years, our headcount is up 38%, and our loads are up 66%.    The second piece is our customers. We have strong relationships with a lot of the top companies in the country. And this has helped drive growth. If you look at our volume growth with our top customers, our top 20 customers, it\u2019s up 35%. Those same customers serve as a reference point. And you see that, for us, as our customers who do $1 million in business with us is up 48%, and we brought on 2,200 new customers. We've got a strong sales force and a lot of momentum.    The last piece is are people. Our people have their ear to the ground. We've got some of the best operators in the business. They've got a proven track record. Director level and above has been with us for 8 years on average. That allows us to create strong, sticky relationships with our customers.    So because of those 3 things, I'm confident that we're going to continue to take market share, and we're going to do it profitably.   \nBrad Jacobs:\n : Scott, on the asset sale question you had, we're not going to comment on any possible strategic initiatives we have going on. But thank you for the question.   \nOperator:\n : Next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.   \nBrandon Robert Oglenski:\n : So I wanted to talk about the ability to grow in LTL. Because I think if I look historically here, the name of the game has been margin improvement through -- for better or worse, shrinking the business, getting better mix, focusing on price and those customers that fit the network better, I think. And I understand now. Can you talk to us in the context of what seems to be a very expanded CapEx budget? Because I'm showing growth CapEx here in the last few years maybe $300 million to $330 million and obviously stepping up quite a bit to $500 million to $550 million this year.   \nMatthew Jeremy Fassler:\n : Sure, Scott \u2014 sorry, Brandon. Sure, Brandon. Yes, we are going to ramp up LTL CapEx substantially. We're going to be going from roughly 5% of revenue in 2021 to 8% to 9% of revenue in 2022. Some of that is, in fact, for new facilities. We spoke about opening 900 doors over the next 2 years by the end of 2023. Some of it is for equipment as we continue to replenish our fleet.    We generate exceptional returns on capital in LTL. Our company-wide return on capital was 32%. LTL is higher than that. We know that we can get a strong return on that level of investment, hence the decision to allocate more capital to this business. So we're confident, we have line of sight on all of the spending areas, both real estate and equipment.   \nBrandon Robert Oglenski:\n : Well, I guess, Matt, maybe if I can rephrase the question, and be more direct. Was it a lack of capital reinvestment in the past few years that limited growth in the segment?   \nMario A. Harik:\n : Yes. Overall, it was more of a strategy. So when we think about our focus since we bought Con-way back in 2015 has been on expanding margins and the profits. And this allowed us to get to a higher ROIC. But in that business, we nearly tripled EBITDA with $1 billion this year since we bought that business and improved OR by 910 basis points.    Now that we're inflecting towards the growth strategy, it goes back to part of it is obviously adding more doors to the network, the 900 doors that Matt just mentioned, expanding the size of our fleet by doubling the trailer production and our manufacturing facility and adding more tractors, and also adding more people to be able to move the freight, both in drivers and dock workers. So it's a -- so we're leaning more towards now adding more capacity to the network, so we can grow from a volume and top line perspective.   \nOperator:\n : Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies.   \nHamzah Mazari:\n : Brad, I just wanted to ask 2 questions, and then I'll turn it over. Just questions we've been hearing more frequently from investors given your recent stock sale. One, I guess, are you planning to exit XPO? And then two, should we expect to see you sell more shares in the future? And I'll leave it there.   \nBrad Jacobs:\n : They're fair questions. Let me be very clear about it. I have no plans to leave XPO. I'm extremely proud of what we're accomplishing here, and I'm super excited about the many, many opportunities that we have to create significant shareholder value, both tactically and strategically.    And regarding the stock sales, I still own about 11% of the company, and I'm very bullish about the company's prospects. But that said, I've owned these shares for over a decade, and I probably will sell some more shares at some time in the future.    But I have no plans to leave the company in the foreseeable future. To the contrary, I'm very much all in and highly focused. Does that answer what you're asking?   \nHamzah Mazari:\n : Yes, perfect. Appreciate it. I'll turn it over.   \nOperator:\n : Our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.   \nAllison Ann Marie Poliniak-Cusic:\n : First on brokerage, you seem pretty confident that double-digit growth will persist after '22. Could you help us maybe think of that growth algorithm for that going forward? Is it mainly the market share that you were trying to articulate before?   \nDrew M. Wilkerson:\n : Yes, it is the market share. And the brokerage space -- the trucking space is $440 billion. Brokerage has about $80 billion of that, and brokers are continuing to take share. Our customers want to use brokers because they've got flexible capacity that they can scale up or down based on what's going on in the market. And we've got a proven track record, if you look at the last 9 years of the industry CAGR being at 9% and our growth rate being at 27%. We've got a proven track record of being able to deliver on that result. As I mentioned earlier, we've got a strong sales team and a great pipeline for going forward.   \nAllison Ann Marie Poliniak-Cusic:\n : Great. And then just on the technology for LTL, a lot of initiatives being put in place there. Is there a way to think of the contribution from those initiatives, whether it's price or customer share or productivity and efficiencies that you're expecting to drive from some of these initiatives? Just any color there?   \nMario A. Harik:\n : You got it, Allison. So it's a combination of all of the above. So obviously, when we think about pricing technology, it's about improving on yield. And as I said in my prepared remarks, where the new platform allows us to reduce manual data processing by 80%, enabling our pricing experts to spend more time analyzing account performance and negotiating along with sales. And it also enables us to use historical RFPs as a lead gen tool for sales. So that ties to adding more volume to the network by driving, again, more and more leads.    Similar thing on dynamic pricing, that allows us to be able to get a combination of yield and volume, where we can flex that lever based on where we need the volume versus where we want the yield.    On the efficiency side, I mentioned areas around linehaul and dock ops, and this all goes back to efficiency. That efficiency, in that case, by building more direct trailers to destination, which we call it, technically, head hauls. It used rehandle for better dock productivity across our docks. It also improves our linehaul operation there.    And all the technology goes back to customer experience. I mentioned our new web experience for customers and better visibility all the way down to the piece level. So if you have a multi-skid shipment, being able to give customers visibility all the way down to the pallet level or -- this ties back more to customer satisfaction. So it's a combination of improvement in yield, improvement in volume, improvement in efficiency and customer sat.   \nOperator:\n : The next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan.   \nBrian Patrick Ossenbeck:\n : Just wanted to come back to the cadence of the OR throughout the year. And is there any way you can kind of split that between contributions you would think they're coming from the market and pricing and things you just mentioned in terms of that are more XPO specific, that you got more visibility and line of sight. And within that, can you just give some context in terms of how pulling forward the GRI was handled in the market?   \nMatthew Jeremy Fassler:\n : I'll do the first part, Brian. And I'll just harken back to the color that Mario gave. We expect the OR improvement to progress through the year due to a combination of volume improvement and, over the course of the year, improvement on the cost front, with pricing being a relatively constant positive. To the extent that we're looking at volume at cost, those are idiosyncratic opportunities for XPO, both to improve from where we are, going forward and also as we're cycling some of the issues that we experienced in the second half of last year. And I'll give it to Mario for a discussion of the GRI.   \nMario A. Harik:\n : Yes. Overall, on the GRI side, I mean, it's a firm pricing environment when it comes to LTL. So the feedback we've gotten from customer hasn't been -- we haven't seen any pushback in the market. And we pulled back our GRI from the typical January time frame to November. But overall, the feedback has been good from customers.    Now when we go to this year, we are contemplating doing a second GRI for our local accounts in the first half of the year, but depending on how the market progresses through the course of the year. And usually, GRIs for us, they impact one segment of our customers, which is our local account business, but not all customers, which is roughly around 20% to 25% of the business.   \nBrian Patrick Ossenbeck:\n : Okay, Mario. A question for Drew then on the brokerage side. We hear a lot about automation and what's no-touch and what's created digitally. So I don't know if you can add some context to your 70%, where you think that stands versus the competition in your view? And what sort of customers are you really attracting and retaining with those types of abilities and capabilities?   \nDrew M. Wilkerson:\n : Yes. So the 70% are created or covered digitally. That's a number that we're extremely proud of. If you look at our API integrations with our customers, that is up 2.7x on a year-over-year basis. The types of customers that are using this is all types of customers. It's very sticky with our large customers. They are attracted to the API integrations that we offer, but also our smaller customers are logging on, and they're using XPO Connect on a daily basis. And again, that helps them make the best transportation decisions possible. It tells them what mode they should be shipping, when they should be shipping. So we're seeing it across all of our customer base.   \nOperator:\n : The next question is from the line of Jack Atkins with Stephens.   \nJack Lawrence Atkins:\n : I guess this one is for Mario. I guess I'm a little surprised that you're not expecting a bit more than the 100 basis points or so of OR improvement in 2022, given that's probably going to lag your peers' performance this year. And your comps are arguably much easier given the underperformance over the last 2 years.    So I guess, Mario, a bigger picture question. Do you feel like maybe there's something more structural going on within your LTL assets? Why can't you see a more substantial improvement in operating ratio this year? And do you feel like that 5-point plan you outlined 3 months ago was really going to be enough to get the business back on track?   \nMario A. Harik:\n : Thanks, Jeff. So let me first talk about the structural piece of our LTL business. We have more than 290 terminals with 21,000 fantastic people who cover 99% of all ZIP codes. And that team has moved 18 billion pounds of freight for 25,000 customers in 2021. So there's nothing structurally wrong with this business.    And I went back to what I said earlier. Since we acquired the LTL business from Con-way, or the Con-way acquisition, we nearly are on track to triple EBITDA by this year and improve our OR by 910 basis points, and that\u2019s with generating net cash of $3 billion. So there's -- again, there's nothing structurally wrong here.    We did make the mistake in the third quarter of last year to in-source third-party linehaul. Our network flows temporarily deteriorated. Our costs went up due to the efficiencies associated with that, and we implemented the 5-point action plan, starting with strategic embargoes. This allow us to -- where we effectively lowered tonnage to allow us to tier the backlogs in our network and get back to having much more improved network flow.    We believe this is a temporary phenomenon. It's not something that will repeat. And we're focused on customer service, on pricing, on tonnage and ops execution. And we're planning on delivering $1 billion of EBITDA this year.    So when we think about it overall, it's a strong plan. It's a plan that ties back to adding more capacity, investing more in the business, pivoting towards growth and then servicing 25,000 \u2014 and hopefully more in the future \u2014 fantastic customers.   \nJack Lawrence Atkins:\n : Okay. Got it. And then for my follow-up question, I would love to kind of get your thoughts on the intermodal market. It's not a business that we hear you talk much about, but we're seeing a number of your IMC competitors making some interesting moves in terms of shifting rail partners and adding additional containers and investing in their businesses with intermodal. How are you thinking about the intermodal market and XPO's position within that as we look forward?   \nDrew M. Wilkerson:\n : The intermodal market was strong. We continue to take -- we continued our recovery there. And if you look at the congestions and the equipment shortage, our organic revenue was up 38% on a year-over-year basis. You saw our GM per load skyrocket. We are investing in containers as you look into 2022. And we expect to be able to continue to grow on intermodal, but also on our drayage side.    Our drayage side complements intermodal. And when you think about it, one of the reasons that they marry so well together is because we have a presence at every single major U.S. port. So we're very excited about the intermodal market, and it was a strong performer for us in the fourth quarter.   \nOperator:\n : Our next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank.   \nAmit Singh Mehrotra:\n : Mario, I just want to go back to the first couple of questions on the cadence of the operating ratio. And I just want to make sure we're on the same page in terms of the numbers that we're -- because there's a lot of operating ratios adjusted, unadjusted.    If I look at the first quarter, it looks like you guys are guiding to an 86.3% OR for the first quarter. And if you're kind of flattish in the second quarter, that implies a jump in the OR, or an improvement in the OR, to 81.1%.    So first, are those numbers correct? Second, it implies an over 500 basis point improvement in the operating ratio of the second quarter, which is a huge number, I think, would support a lot of the initiatives that you're talking about, but I just want to make sure that, that expectation is well calibrated.   \nMario A. Harik:\n : So overall, Amit, when we think about the OR cadence for the year, so for the first quarter, we expect a 200 points deterioration, and that would take us from the 84.3% to 86.3%. Now in terms of the second quarter, we're expecting the inflection to be OR positive by midyear. Now obviously, we haven't given specific guidance for the second quarter, but it would be in the ZIP code of what you mentioned. But that's kind of how we think about the cadence and then going over to improvement in the back half of the year.   \nAmit Singh Mehrotra:\n : Okay. So -- and the full year guidance, just on 100 basis points, is against an 84.3%. So you're really forecasting an 83.3% or better OR for the full year, which is obviously a great outcome given the starting point of 86.3%, but I just want to make sure that we're on the same page in terms of the numbers.   \nMario A. Harik:\n : That's correct for the full year, which is more than 100 basis points of OR improvement with the sequential improvement going obviously from the 200 deterioration in the first quarter, inflection midpoint, to a full year of more than 100 basis points.   \nAmit Singh Mehrotra:\n : Okay. That's very helpful. And then the other question I had, I think it goes back to Brandon's question on capacity. So I guess, very simply, why do you guys need more capacity? Because if I look at the operating metrics in 2021, XPO LTL did 9,000 fewer shipments per day than it did all the way back in 2012, with basically the same footprint. And so I'm just wondering why do you need more doors? Why are more doors part of the problem? Why are they part of the solution? And maybe it's just as simple as kind of more targeted doors to relieve some of the pressure. But just give us a sense of why you need more capacity in the context of these -- of how shipments have trended over the last decade or so.   \nBrad Jacobs:\n : Thanks for the question, Amit. It's Brad. It's really simple. We've got a very high ROIC in this business. We've been running it for OR improvement. We've succeeded at that overall. We improved OR by 910 basis points. We're now going to continue to focus on OR. But in addition to that, grow the top line. In order to grow the top line, we're going to invest in more trucks. We're going to invest in more doors. We're going to invest in more people.   \nAmit Singh Mehrotra:\n : Yes. I understand that. But like the question is you have 9,000 fewer shipments per day than you did back in 2012. So doors and capacity is not the issue. It's maybe something else, unless I'm mistaken.   \nMatthew Jeremy Fassler:\n : Amit, it's Matt. There's 2 points -- 2 additional points to make. One of them is while we do have coverage across the entire country, as Mario said earlier, we cover 99% of the country, there are selected markets where we know we have the opportunity for additional volume by putting in incremental doors.    The second point is that we have ongoing opportunity to optimize our linehaul network. And when we think about where we put those doors, we're thinking not only about the P&D side and that opportunity for incremental business, but also the opportunity to smooth out our linehaul network.    And Mario, I think, has an additional comment on that.   \nMario A. Harik:\n : Yes. And also, Amit, I'll tell you, a lot of it also goes back to customer feedback. And I've spent a lot of time with customers since I've taken over this role. And with my time with customers, for example, one of the markets we want to expand the number of doors in is Southern California, where I recently met with one of our large customers. And their immediate feedback was, sign us up; as soon -- we're going to -- as soon as you open up the new terminal there, we want to be first in line to tap into that capacity.    So although across the network, we have 15% extra capacity, we're seeing more demand in certain markets where there are pinch points for us, where we don't have enough doors to be able to support all the customer demand we're seeing there. So by expanding the network in those specific markets, we can effectively better service our customers and get more volume in those markets.    And as Matt said, on the linehaul side, a lot of these -- so take, for example, the market like Atlanta, which is one of the major areas of the South and it's also the gateway into the Florida region, as well, from a linehaul standpoint. So you think about that market expanding in it, gives us both the linehaul capacity and the local steady operation capacity, as well.   \nAmit Singh Mehrotra:\n : Got it. And I know I'm asking more here with one additional question. But hopefully, you allow me to. Brad, last quarter, in the third quarter transcript, you used the word \u201cnon-core\u201d to describe some businesses with the XPO. I don't think I've ever heard you use the word \u201cnon-core\u201d when describing any business at XPO over the last 10 years. And so I don't know if that was a deliberate distinction. If you can just expand on what businesses you think are noncore, why you think they're noncore? Because obviously, the company spun off GXO, that's been a huge success. Just trying to understand if you're happy with the way XPO is today? Or if we should read into something in terms of calling -- characterizing some businesses as actually noncore?   \nBrad Jacobs:\n : I'm very happy with what XPO is today, but I'm also always looking for ways to create more shareholder value, and that's our mission in life, and we'll always be open-minded about that.    The stock -- we're accomplishing a lot of great stuff, but the stock is trading at 7-point-something times EBITDA and 12-point-something times on a PE basis, which are quite significant discounts to the market.    So we've heard suggestions for various strategic alternatives and asset sales, and we're not going to comment on any of that publicly. And there's a rationale for keeping all of our lines of business. They're good businesses. The numbers are up and to the right. There's also a rationale for divesting some of our lines of business. We could take the proceeds. We could pay down debt. We make this investment grade faster. We\u2019d become more of a pure-play, which, as you've seen with the spin, investors like pure-plays. So I'm very happy that we have multiple, numerous alternatives to create shareholder value.   \nOperator:\n : The next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS.   \nThomas Richard Wadewitz:\n : I know you've had a lot on LTL, but I guess that's an important topic. So I wanted to ask a little bit more about the path. Do you think -- I guess, in terms of network efficiency, is the capacity add really a key factor that builds? I know you talked about drivers, trailers, some additional doors. Is that a key driver for improving fluidity and productivity? Or is that the wrong way to look at it?   \nMario A. Harik:\n : It's a combination of both. But for the most part, it's positioning capacity for getting more market share or getting more volume. So overall, if you think about -- let's talk about capacity from a real estate perspective.    So today, we have excess capacity of roughly around 15% across the network. However, some markets have pinch points where we don't have enough capacity or enough doors. I mentioned earlier, for example, the Southern California market, where we see obviously both high demand on imports. But at the same time, it's a high consumer market as well. So when we think about it from a doors perspective, it's a combination of adding more doors to handle more freight, but also adding more doors to handle more fluidity in the linehaul network and breaking points where we need more of that capacity moving forward.    On the equipment side and the people side, obviously, it's mostly focused on getting more volume. The more trailers you have, the more trucks you have, the more people you have, you can effectively move more freight for customers.    Now a lot of the plan on the real estate side, you also have to think through that there's a 6-month ramp for any real estate -- or any set of doors that we add in terms of ramping into the volume. So a lot of the benefits would be in 2023 and beyond as we think about adding those doors over the course of the year. And then obviously, we'll get the margin benefit through the course of the year as well from the ones we add this year.   \nThomas Richard Wadewitz:\n : You've talked a fair bit about tonnage growth, that that's become more important lever for you. I don't think I've heard a comment on the call of what the right ballpark is for how much tonnage growth you would expect this year. So I don't know if you have a thought on that.    And then I guess, just shifting gears to tonnage growth, is tonnage growth a key lever for the margin improvement? Or is that really more just shift to another gear, and that helps on top line growth? Because I guess if you look at some LTL models, it does seem tonnage growth is key to the margin. But obviously, it could be a stronger top line or it could be that and a margin driver.   \nMario A. Harik:\n : It's a combination of both. So when we think about, again, delivering on the margin improvements, it's driven by volume, pricing and operational efficiency or cost. So our plan includes the volume growth through the course of the year. However, it's a low single-digit volume growth assumption for the full year that obviously starts with being down low single digits in the first quarter, which is obviously seasonally better than where we were in the fourth quarter and then would ramp through the course of the year for a full year low single-digit improvement in volume.    Now, also volume -- so not only there's a flow-through of EBITDA from the volume itself, but there's also the fixed cost leverage that you get by adding more volume to the network. But when you think about margin improvement, it's a combination of volume, pricing and operational efficiency to drive that.   \nBrad Jacobs:\n : Thank you. The hour went by fast, but it's over. So let me conclude by saying we have a ton of momentum in LTL. The year is off to a very good start. Our action plan is working. We expect to generate at least $1 billion of LTL EBITDA this year and more than 100 basis points OR improvement.    In truck brokerage, we continue to perform at best-in-class levels. In Q4, we grew loads at 22%. And over the last 8 years, our truck brokerage growth rate has been 3x the industry\u2019s, and we expect to continue to significantly outperform going forward.    On the balance sheet, we're on track to reduce leverage to 1 to 2x by the first half of next year, and we're determined to close the significant valuation gap of our stock versus our peers.    So thank you, and we look forward to seeing you at the upcoming conferences. Have a great day.   \nOperator:\n : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

            "name": "Brad Jacobs",
            "content": ":Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our call. With me today in Greenwich are Ravi Tulsyan, our CFO; Matt Fassler, our Chief Strategy Officer; Mario Harik, our CIO and acting President of LTL; and Drew Wilkerson, President of North American Transportation.    Yesterday, we reported a fourth quarter that delivered a number of record results. The company as a whole performed well. We grew revenue by 14% year-over-year to $3.4 billion, which was the highest revenue of any quarter in our history. We generated adjusted EBITDA that was a solid beat versus our fourth quarter guidance, and we beat on full year EBITDA as well. We also reported the highest adjusted diluted EPS of any quarter in our history, again, significantly higher than expectations.    Our growth was led by our 2 largest businesses: North American LTL and truck brokerage. In LTL, we delivered record fourth quarter revenue and record year-over-year growth in yield. Our adjusted operating ratio in the quarter degraded year-over-year, which was expected, given some third quarter challenges within our network. But the negative trend bottomed out in October when we launched our LTL action plan with Mario at the helm.    Our plan had an immediate impact on our year-over-year performance. We reduced the erosion in our operating ratio and improved our volume trend as the quarter progressed. Importantly, we expect our year-over-year adjusted operating ratio ex real estate to inflect positive midyear and generate over 100 basis points of improvement in 2022.    In truck brokerage, we had another quarter of outstanding growth, with load count increasing to record levels for the third consecutive quarter. The biggest tailwind driving our volume is XPO Connect, our digital brokerage platform. Shipper and carrier adoption of Connect is growing extremely fast.    In December, we exceeded 600,000 cumulative driver downloads of the platform's mobile app, which is good news for customers, because they want digital access to as many carriers as possible. In the fourth quarter, weekly carrier usage on XPO Connect was up year-over-year by 74%.    So in sum, a good fourth quarter with great traction going into 2022. The full year guidance we issued yesterday reflects our expectation of strong earnings growth this year. The midpoint of our guidance range for 2022 adjusted EBITDA reflects 11% growth versus 2021, and the midpoint for adjusted diluted EPS reflects 22% growth.    Our LTL action plan is moving our adjusted operating ratio in the right direction. We still expect to generate at least $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA in LTL this year. And our truck brokerage revenue is growing at a pace that's 3x faster than industry growth. Finally, we remain committed to deleveraging toward a net leverage ratio of 1 to 2x by the first half of next year. This will be a key milestone in achieving an investment-grade rating.    We're intent on being best-in-class in every aspect of our business, and we're confident of continuing to deliver superior shareholder value.    Now I'll hand it over to Ravi to discuss our results and our balance sheet. Ravi? :Scott, on the asset sale question you had, we're not going to comment on any possible strategic initiatives we have going on. But thank you for the question. :They're fair questions. Let me be very clear about it. I have no plans to leave XPO. I'm extremely proud of what we're accomplishing here, and I'm super excited about the many, many opportunities that we have to create significant shareholder value, both tactically and strategically.    And regarding the stock sales, I still own about 11% of the company, and I'm very bullish about the company's prospects. But that said, I've owned these shares for over a decade, and I probably will sell some more shares at some time in the future.    But I have no plans to leave the company in the foreseeable future. To the contrary, I'm very much all in and highly focused. Does that answer what you're asking? :Thanks for the question, Amit. It's Brad. It's really simple. We've got a very high ROIC in this business. We've been running it for OR improvement. We've succeeded at that overall. We improved OR by 910 basis points. We're now going to continue to focus on OR. But in addition to that, grow the top line. In order to grow the top line, we're going to invest in more trucks. We're going to invest in more doors. We're going to invest in more people. :I'm very happy with what XPO is today, but I'm also always looking for ways to create more shareholder value, and that's our mission in life, and we'll always be open-minded about that.    The stock -- we're accomplishing a lot of great stuff, but the stock is trading at 7-point-something times EBITDA and 12-point-something times on a PE basis, which are quite significant discounts to the market.    So we've heard suggestions for various strategic alternatives and asset sales, and we're not going to comment on any of that publicly. And there's a rationale for keeping all of our lines of business. They're good businesses. The numbers are up and to the right. There's also a rationale for divesting some of our lines of business. We could take the proceeds. We could pay down debt. We make this investment grade faster. We'd become more of a pure-play, which, as you've seen with the spin, investors like pure-plays. So I'm very happy that we have multiple, numerous alternatives to create shareholder value. :Thank you. The hour went by fast, but it's over. So let me conclude by saying we have a ton of momentum in LTL. The year is off to a very good start. Our action plan is working. We expect to generate at least $1 billion of LTL EBITDA this year and more than 100 basis points OR improvement.    In truck brokerage, we continue to perform at best-in-class levels. In Q4, we grew loads at 22%. And over the last 8 years, our truck brokerage growth rate has been 3x the industry's, and we expect to continue to significantly outperform going forward.    On the balance sheet, we're on track to reduce leverage to 1 to 2x by the first half of next year, and we're determined to close the significant valuation gap of our stock versus our peers.    So thank you, and we look forward to seeing you at the upcoming conferences. Have a great day."

            "name": "Mario A. Harik",
            "content": ":Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. LTL has made a lot of progress since our third quarter call. I'll start with the 5 points of our action plan we began executing in October.    One major objective was to achieve better network flow, and our plan had an immediate impact. We started with selective strategic embargoes to rebalance the network. By November, we had cleared out the third quarter backlog. This improved our on-time transit sharply from the end of the third quarter to the end of the fourth quarter, along with other service metrics.    Second is pricing and yield. The record 11% year-over-year increase in yield, ex fuel, we reported is a result of multiple initiatives we have underway. We pulled our 5.9% general rate increase forward from the typical January timing to early November. We're also making sure we get paid for services that give customers added value, like equipment in detention and freight that requires special handling.    And then there's our pricing technology. This is our single biggest opportunity to drive yield. We've developed proprietary pricing tools that make sure we charge a fair price.    The third part of our plan is our in-house driver schools. This is a huge advantage in the driver shortage. We graduated approximately 900 new drivers last year, which is more than twice the number of graduates we had in 2019. Our goal is to double that number again this year to about 1,800 drivers.    Fourth, on the equipment side, we added a second production line to our trailer manufacturing facility in Arkansas. We're on track to double our trailer output this year.    The fifth part of our plan has to do with expanding our footprint to drive growth and network efficiencies. We plan to add 900 net new doors to our network by year-end 2023. This equates to about 6% increase in doors from the start of the plan. So far, we've opened terminals in Chicago Heights in October and in Wisconsin and Arkansas in January. We're also opening 4 new fleet maintenance shops this quarter.    Now I want to take a deeper dive into our LTL technology and the new developments we're rolling out. The pricing tools I mentioned are part of the new pricing platform we just deployed. This platform does the heavy lifting in analyzing shipping data so our LTL pricing experts can be much more productive with contract negotiations. These tools have reduced manual data processing by as much as 80%. And we now have the ability to mine historical RFP data as a seamless lead generation tool for sales. We'll continue to enhance this platform going forward.    We've also made inroads in dynamic pricing, which allows us to update customer rates on certain loads in real time to incentivize them to give the business to us. And we launched an automated process that onboards customers immediately to dynamic pricing, which shortens the contract negotiation cycle.    The other areas ripe for tech innovation in LTL are our linehaul and dock operations. Between now and midyear, we'll be launching new tools to help further optimize how we load our trailers. These tools are designed to increase direct trips, which utilize our trucks and drivers more efficiently, and they'll improve dock productivity.    In other recent tech launches, we completed the rollout of new planning software on our pickup and delivery platform, and we'll complete a rollout of new dispatch tools by midyear. And we'll start deploying new digital tools for customer self-service and new visibility into multi-pallet shipments. We're continuing to make it easy for our customers to do business with XPO.    So as you can see, we have a lot happening on the technology front and a lot more opportunity going forward, as well as the tangible goals we set for 2022. We expect to generate at least $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA in LTL this year. Our entire team is committed to delivering on this goal. We also expect to deliver more than 100 basis points of full year improvement in our adjusted operating ratio, excluding real estate gains.    Here's how the dots will connect between where we are today and our goal this year. In the first quarter, we project about 200 basis points of degradation in our adjusted operating ratio, ex real estate, year-over-year. From there, we'll continue to reduce the erosion and reach the inflection point midyear. We'll improve our adjusted operating ratio in the second half, putting us on track for more than 100 basis points of improvement for the full year.    We know exactly what it takes to hit these marks. The comprehensive action plan we're executing should unlock more LTL revenue and margin growth going forward.    In 2021, when our company-wide return on invested capital was 32%, our ROIC from LTL was even higher. We're on track to nearly triple our adjusted EBITDA this year since acquiring this business in 2015. And it's a cash engine. Over the last 6 years, we've generated more than $3 billion of net cash from LTL alone.    Now we're going to invest more of our LTL operating cash flow into the business to accelerate its growth. This year, our LTL growth CapEx will be 8% to 9% of revenue, covering investments in fleet, facilities and technology. That compares to 5% of revenue last year.    That gives you a high-level view of the many tactical actions we're taking to drive revenue and margin growth and return to year-over-year improvement in our operating ratio.    We're off to a strong start. We generated sequential operating ratio improvement through the fourth quarter, with December being the strongest month. In January, tonnage remained stronger than typical seasonality. We're seeing major improvements in our service metrics, along with improvements in customer satisfaction and employee satisfaction. We believe strongly in this business. We are on the right track, and our plan is working.    Now Drew is going to cover truck brokerage, and then we'll go to Q&A. Drew? :Yes. Sure thing, Chris. This is Mario. So when we think about the cadence, so first starting with the first quarter. We expect a 200 basis point OR degradation in that quarter, which is sequentially better by 100 basis points from the 300 points degradation we had in the fourth quarter. And we'll drive that OR improvement starting with volume.    So we had 4.9% volume decline in the fourth quarter, and we expect a low single-digit decline in the first quarter. And both, when we think about the exit run rate from the fourth quarter, both in December and January, we outpaced typical seasonality on volume despite the Omicron and weather in the first part of the quarter here.    Now the next step from there would be on the cost side. So we already have seen improvement in labor efficiencies as we cleared the backlogs with the embargoes, and we're going to expect that to continue through the course of the year. And however, that was offset in the first quarter, at least, with higher purchased transportation costs that will carry through the first half of the year, because we typically reset our PT costs in the spring time frame.    Now from a yield standpoint, we continue to expect yield to be very strong for the year, starting with the first quarter. So for the first quarter, we expect yield to be up in the high single digits, which is still reflecting obviously the strong underlying environment, but also the actions we are taking, offset by weight per shipment being higher for us typically in the first quarter. So that's the dynamic of Q1 of the 200 point deterioration.    Now as we go through the year, we expect to get to an inflection by midyear on OR and then get back to positive improvement on a full quarter basis in the back half for a total OR improvement of more than 100 basis points for the full year.    But net-net, if you think how we get there, one, volume, we keep on increasing, yield would remain strong for the course of the year in the high single digits, obviously, with Q4 being slightly softer given where we were in Q4 of last year. And then costs would normalize, where some of the cost headwinds will turn into tailwinds as we get into the back half of the year. :Yes. So that's in the ZIP code, Chris.    Christian F. Wetherbee Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate that. And then just a quick follow-up in terms of the growth of the door count in 2022. I know you're targeting 6% over a 2-year basis. I want to get a sense of how quickly do you start to see ramping up that capacity? I know you've opened some facilities. I guess I want to get a sense of maybe how you see it playing out in the context of that OR progression we just talked about. :Overall, from adding capacity, we think about the ramp from once we add a door to be roughly in the 6-month time frame. But also there's a dynamic. When we think about adding doors, that's a combination of both getting volume in certain markets, but also getting linehaul efficiency in certain markets in terms of our freight -- what we call freight assembly centers, or where we break freight and rebuild trailers for customers as freight flows through the network. But typically, for the business case, our ramp process is around a 6-month time frame.    Now we expect from the doors to add in 2022 to roughly have about 1% of revenue or $40 million worth of additional revenue from these doors. And obviously, that would accelerate going into 2023 as we keep on adding terminals and doors. :Yes. Let me start first with the Q2... :Yes, you got it, Scott. So let's start first with the fourth quarter. So there were 2 drivers for the Q4 decline beyond the numbers we discussed last time. One was that we obviously implemented our strategic embargoes and metered the amount of volume we're getting in the network to improve network flow. And we extended these embargoes through November because they substantially improved network flow. And now obviously, that increases costs and lower volume, which is short-term pain for long-term benefit of having better network flow.    And also in the back half of the quarter, we saw that third-party linehaul rates went up and have since stabilized. Now when you think about the improvements or the benefits from improved network flow, they include obviously reducing the backlog, and we reduced that down to target levels. Service has improved sharply versus the third quarter. Customer satisfaction has jumped in both internal and third-party surveys as well as -- typically, network improvements are the precursor for OR improvements.    Now more importantly, for the fourth quarter, when you think about the progression, October was the low point of OR degradation, and December was the best month for the quarter. And again, we see that kind of inflecting as we get to the midyear.    Now when we think through the course of the year, there are 3 main drivers for OR. So the first one is volume, which is typically backed by capacity. Second is pricing. And then third is operational efficiency that ties to cost.    And now starting with volume, as I mentioned earlier, we've seen that acceleration of volume, which outpaced typical seasonality in both December and January. And we expect volume to continue to accelerate through the course of the year.    As we mentioned in our 5-point action plan, we're building to add more capacity to the network to allow us to handle more volume. We're graduating and hiring more drivers from our schools. We've doubled the trailer production capacity in our in-house manufacturing facility. We're adding more tractors, starting here in the first quarter, having great discussions with our OEMs. And we're also adding more doors progressively through the year.    We're also investing in our sales force. So we're dedicating some of our strategic centers to LTL, and we're seeing more business either enter or return to our network, as well. So the volume is going to accelerate through the course of the year as we go forward.    On the pricing side, so I'd say a similar dynamic in terms of pricing staying strong for the full year, being in that high single-digit range is what we expect. And we are also contemplating a potential additional GRI for local accounts in the first half, depending on what's happening in the pricing environment.    And then finally, on the cost side, as I said earlier, the headwinds would flip into tailwinds because we would be cycling through purchased transportation costs in the back half, but also as we build efficiency back from a labor perspective and all the other cost categories, that would turn to a lower increase in the back half. But net-net, I mean, obviously, it will be more than 100 basis point improvement for the full year, for a record OR for the year. :Yes. Overall, it was more of a strategy. So when we think about our focus since we bought Con-way back in 2015 has been on expanding margins and the profits. And this allowed us to get to a higher ROIC. But in that business, we nearly tripled EBITDA with $1 billion this year since we bought that business and improved OR by 910 basis points.    Now that we're inflecting towards the growth strategy, it goes back to part of it is obviously adding more doors to the network, the 900 doors that Matt just mentioned, expanding the size of our fleet by doubling the trailer production and our manufacturing facility and adding more tractors, and also adding more people to be able to move the freight, both in drivers and dock workers. So it's a -- so we're leaning more towards now adding more capacity to the network, so we can grow from a volume and top line perspective. :You got it, Allison. So it's a combination of all of the above. So obviously, when we think about pricing technology, it's about improving on yield. And as I said in my prepared remarks, where the new platform allows us to reduce manual data processing by 80%, enabling our pricing experts to spend more time analyzing account performance and negotiating along with sales. And it also enables us to use historical RFPs as a lead gen tool for sales. So that ties to adding more volume to the network by driving, again, more and more leads.    Similar thing on dynamic pricing, that allows us to be able to get a combination of yield and volume, where we can flex that lever based on where we need the volume versus where we want the yield.    On the efficiency side, I mentioned areas around linehaul and dock ops, and this all goes back to efficiency. That efficiency, in that case, by building more direct trailers to destination, which we call it, technically, head hauls. It used rehandle for better dock productivity across our docks. It also improves our linehaul operation there.    And all the technology goes back to customer experience. I mentioned our new web experience for customers and better visibility all the way down to the piece level. So if you have a multi-skid shipment, being able to give customers visibility all the way down to the pallet level or -- this ties back more to customer satisfaction. So it's a combination of improvement in yield, improvement in volume, improvement in efficiency and customer sat. :Yes. Overall, on the GRI side, I mean, it's a firm pricing environment when it comes to LTL. So the feedback we've gotten from customer hasn't been -- we haven't seen any pushback in the market. And we pulled back our GRI from the typical January time frame to November. But overall, the feedback has been good from customers.    Now when we go to this year, we are contemplating doing a second GRI for our local accounts in the first half of the year, but depending on how the market progresses through the course of the year. And usually, GRIs for us, they impact one segment of our customers, which is our local account business, but not all customers, which is roughly around 20% to 25% of the business. :Thanks, Jeff. So let me first talk about the structural piece of our LTL business. We have more than 290 terminals with 21,000 fantastic people who cover 99% of all ZIP codes. And that team has moved 18 billion pounds of freight for 25,000 customers in 2021. So there's nothing structurally wrong with this business.    And I went back to what I said earlier. Since we acquired the LTL business from Con-way, or the Con-way acquisition, we nearly are on track to triple EBITDA by this year and improve our OR by 910 basis points, and that's with generating net cash of $3 billion. So there's -- again, there's nothing structurally wrong here.    We did make the mistake in the third quarter of last year to in-source third-party linehaul. Our network flows temporarily deteriorated. Our costs went up due to the efficiencies associated with that, and we implemented the 5-point action plan, starting with strategic embargoes. This allow us to -- where we effectively lowered tonnage to allow us to tier the backlogs in our network and get back to having much more improved network flow.    We believe this is a temporary phenomenon. It's not something that will repeat. And we're focused on customer service, on pricing, on tonnage and ops execution. And we're planning on delivering $1 billion of EBITDA this year.    So when we think about it overall, it's a strong plan. It's a plan that ties back to adding more capacity, investing more in the business, pivoting towards growth and then servicing 25,000 \u2014 and hopefully more in the future \u2014 fantastic customers. :So overall, Amit, when we think about the OR cadence for the year, so for the first quarter, we expect a 200 points deterioration, and that would take us from the 84.3% to 86.3%. Now in terms of the second quarter, we're expecting the inflection to be OR positive by midyear. Now obviously, we haven't given specific guidance for the second quarter, but it would be in the ZIP code of what you mentioned. But that's kind of how we think about the cadence and then going over to improvement in the back half of the year. :That's correct for the full year, which is more than 100 basis points of OR improvement with the sequential improvement going obviously from the 200 deterioration in the first quarter, inflection midpoint, to a full year of more than 100 basis points. :Yes. And also, Amit, I'll tell you, a lot of it also goes back to customer feedback. And I've spent a lot of time with customers since I've taken over this role. And with my time with customers, for example, one of the markets we want to expand the number of doors in is Southern California, where I recently met with one of our large customers. And their immediate feedback was, sign us up; as soon -- we're going to -- as soon as you open up the new terminal there, we want to be first in line to tap into that capacity.    So although across the network, we have 15% extra capacity, we're seeing more demand in certain markets where there are pinch points for us, where we don't have enough doors to be able to support all the customer demand we're seeing there. So by expanding the network in those specific markets, we can effectively better service our customers and get more volume in those markets.    And as Matt said, on the linehaul side, a lot of these -- so take, for example, the market like Atlanta, which is one of the major areas of the South and it's also the gateway into the Florida region, as well, from a linehaul standpoint. So you think about that market expanding in it, gives us both the linehaul capacity and the local steady operation capacity, as well. :It's a combination of both. But for the most part, it's positioning capacity for getting more market share or getting more volume. So overall, if you think about -- let's talk about capacity from a real estate perspective.    So today, we have excess capacity of roughly around 15% across the network. However, some markets have pinch points where we don't have enough capacity or enough doors. I mentioned earlier, for example, the Southern California market, where we see obviously both high demand on imports. But at the same time, it's a high consumer market as well. So when we think about it from a doors perspective, it's a combination of adding more doors to handle more freight, but also adding more doors to handle more fluidity in the linehaul network and breaking points where we need more of that capacity moving forward.    On the equipment side and the people side, obviously, it's mostly focused on getting more volume. The more trailers you have, the more trucks you have, the more people you have, you can effectively move more freight for customers.    Now a lot of the plan on the real estate side, you also have to think through that there's a 6-month ramp for any real estate -- or any set of doors that we add in terms of ramping into the volume. So a lot of the benefits would be in 2023 and beyond as we think about adding those doors over the course of the year. And then obviously, we'll get the margin benefit through the course of the year as well from the ones we add this year. :It's a combination of both. So when we think about, again, delivering on the margin improvements, it's driven by volume, pricing and operational efficiency or cost. So our plan includes the volume growth through the course of the year. However, it's a low single-digit volume growth assumption for the full year that obviously starts with being down low single digits in the first quarter, which is obviously seasonally better than where we were in the fourth quarter and then would ramp through the course of the year for a full year low single-digit improvement in volume.    Now, also volume -- so not only there's a flow-through of EBITDA from the volume itself, but there's also the fixed cost leverage that you get by adding more volume to the network. But when you think about margin improvement, it's a combination of volume, pricing and operational efficiency to drive that."

            "name": "Ravi Tulsyan",
            "content": ":Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our fourth quarter and full year results, our balance sheet and liquidity and our outlook for 2022. I'll start with the fourth quarter, where we delivered strong year-over-year growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS.    Revenue in the quarter was a record $3.4 billion, up 14% year-over-year. The net impact of fuel prices and FX contributed 3 points to this growth. Organic revenue growth for the quarter was 11%. We grew adjusted EBITDA by 12% to a Q4 record of $323 million. This reflects strong growth and execution in our brokerage and other services segment.    Looking at a 2-year stack, adjusted EBITDA was up 25% on a pro forma basis. Our adjusted earnings per diluted share for the quarter was $1.34, which was up from $0.53 from a year ago, an increase of over 150%. This increase was primarily driven by higher adjusted EBITDA, lower interest expense and a lower tax rate.    We generated $98 million of cash flow from continuing operations, spent $101 million on gross CapEx and received $60 million of proceeds from asset sales. As a result, our free cash flow was $57 million, which was at the high end of our expectations.    For the full year 2021, we delivered revenue of $12.8 billion, a year-over-year increase of 26%. Adjusted EBITDA for the year was $1.24 billion, reflecting growth of 46%. We more than quadrupled our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations to $4.30 compared to $1.01 from a year ago. We generated free cash flow of $475 million, an increase of over $200 million year-over-year, representing a free cash conversion rate on net income of 97%.    Our cash balance at December 31 was $260 million. This cash, combined with available debt capacity under committed borrowing facilities, gave us $1.3 billion of liquidity at year-end. We had no borrowings outstanding under our ABL facility. Maintaining strong liquidity remains a top priority for us.    We reduced our gross debt by approximately $3 billion in the year, and we have no significant debt maturities until 2025. Our 2021 net leverage at year-end was 2.7x adjusted EBITDA. Our plan is to continue to delever our balance sheet through free cash flow generation and adjusted EBITDA growth. Our progress on deleveraging is important in the context of our commitment to achieve an investment-grade rating.    Turning to the guidance we issued yesterday after market close. Our full year guidance for adjusted EBITDA is $1.36 billion to $1.4 billion. This guide assumes gains from real estate sales of approximately $50 million versus $62 million in 2021. Our current plan is to execute real estate sales in the second half of the year, and these sales will primarily consist of excess land that does not fit our long-term needs.    On the cash flow front, our outlook is for full year free cash flow of $400 million to $450 million. We expect full year growth CapEx to be $500 million to $550 million and net CapEx to be $425 million to $475 million. This significant year-over-year increase in growth CapEx reflects our plan to make growth investments in our LTL business.    Our full year guidance for depreciation and amortization expense is approximately $400 million, and we expect interest expense of $170 million to $180 million. We expect our full year tax rate to be 24% to 25%.    Our average diluted common share count for the year is expected to be approximately 117 million, and our outlook for full year adjusted EPS is $5 to $5.45. For the first quarter, we expect our adjusted EBITDA to be $280 million to $285 million. This guidance assumes no real estate sales in the quarter versus $17 million in the same period a year ago.    In conclusion, we are continuing to execute on our strategy of driving shareholder value as a pure-play transportation company, and we are excited about our prospects for 2022.    I will now turn things over to Matt."

            "content": ":Thanks, Ravi. I'll review our fourth quarter operating results, starting with our North American LTL segment. We grew revenue by 10% year-over-year to a fourth quarter record of $1 billion. Excluding fuel, we grew revenue by 4% year-over-year. We had a 4.9% year-over-year decline in tonnage per day, reflecting the impact of the short-term embargoes we utilized to optimize network flow. When the embargoes were in place in October and November, our tonnage trends lagged typical seasonality, then with the embargoes lifted, we outperformed typical seasonality in December and January, despite headwinds from Omicron and weather.    During the quarter, we saw evidence of industrial verticals regaining momentum. Given the amount of industrial and our LTL mix, this bodes well for demand for our services in 2022. Yield, excluding fuel, outperformed typical seasonality in each month of the quarter. And for the quarter as a whole, year-over-year, yield increased 11%. This was nearly twice our previous record increase set in the third quarter.    Revenue per shipment for the quarter, excluding fuel, also grew 11%. The LTL pricing environment remains firm, and we're driving yield with our own company-specific pricing initiatives.    Our LTL-adjusted operating ratio for the quarter was 84%. Excluding real estate gains, our adjusted operating ratio was 87.5%, which was 300 basis points higher than the fourth quarter a year ago. The biggest drivers of the OR degradation were the embargoes I mentioned earlier, which impacted volume, and the higher cost of purchased transportation. We expect to realize a favorable trend in our operating ratio as our network efficiency continues to improve and we bring new equipment and drivers into our organization.    In our brokerage and other services segment, we grew revenue by 17% to a record $2.4 billion and increased adjusted EBITDA by 29% to a record $161 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the segment expanded by 70 basis points to 6.7% from 6% the prior year. The largest revenue and profit driver in this segment is our North American truck brokerage business, which had an outstanding fourth quarter. We increased our brokerage loads per day by 22% versus a year ago or 50% on a 2-year basis. Fourth quarter revenue rose 36% year-over-year or 136% on a 2-year basis. Margin dollars rose 10% against a tough comp and rose 86% on a 2-year basis. On a sequential basis, margin dollars in the fourth quarter were 29% higher than in Q3.    Our truck brokerage growth reflects a strong market, our unique technology proposition and our close ties with key enterprise customers. Drew will speak more about these drivers in a minute.    Finally, I want to share a couple of notable awards. XPO was named one of America's Best Employers for 2022 by Forbes and one of America's Most Responsible Companies by Newsweek. We were also a Best Place To Work on the Disability Equality Index and a Top Company for Women to Work For in Transportation by the Women in Trucking Association.    Now I'll turn it over to Mario for his comments on North American LTL. :Sure, Scott \u2014 sorry, Brandon. Sure, Brandon. Yes, we are going to ramp up LTL CapEx substantially. We're going to be going from roughly 5% of revenue in 2021 to 8% to 9% of revenue in 2022. Some of that is, in fact, for new facilities. We spoke about opening 900 doors over the next 2 years by the end of 2023. Some of it is for equipment as we continue to replenish our fleet.    We generate exceptional returns on capital in LTL. Our company-wide return on capital was 32%. LTL is higher than that. We know that we can get a strong return on that level of investment, hence the decision to allocate more capital to this business. So we're confident, we have line of sight on all of the spending areas, both real estate and equipment. :I'll do the first part, Brian. And I'll just harken back to the color that Mario gave. We expect the OR improvement to progress through the year due to a combination of volume improvement and, over the course of the year, improvement on the cost front, with pricing being a relatively constant positive. To the extent that we're looking at volume at cost, those are idiosyncratic opportunities for XPO, both to improve from where we are, going forward and also as we're cycling some of the issues that we experienced in the second half of last year. And I'll give it to Mario for a discussion of the GRI. :Amit, it's Matt. There's 2 points -- 2 additional points to make. One of them is while we do have coverage across the entire country, as Mario said earlier, we cover 99% of the country, there are selected markets where we know we have the opportunity for additional volume by putting in incremental doors.    The second point is that we have ongoing opportunity to optimize our linehaul network. And when we think about where we put those doors, we're thinking not only about the P&D side and that opportunity for incremental business, but also the opportunity to smooth out our linehaul network.    And Mario, I think, has an additional comment on that."

            "content": ":Thanks, Mario. North American truck brokerage had another phenomenal quarter, the latest in a long history of outperforming the market. Over the last 9 years, from 2013 through 2021, we delivered a revenue CAGR of 27%, which is 3x the industry CAGR of 9%. There were some compelling trends underpinning our growth in 2021.    For the full year, the number of customers who generated over $1 million of revenue with us increased by 48% versus the prior year. We grew volume with our top 20 customers by 35%. These large, sticky relationships are the bedrock of our customer base. And overall, we served over 2,200 customers who were not in our customer base a year earlier.    Another reason we're getting outsized growth is our XPO Connect digital platform. We have first-mover advantage with proprietary brokerage automation dating back to the inception of XPO in 2011. That's when we first envisioned industry demand for a fully automated service for transportation procurement.    XPO Connect is continuing to grow super fast. In the fourth quarter, the number of customers registered on the platform was up 41% year-over-year, and registered carriers were up 38%. This technology is a great lever to attract and retain customers and also carriers, which is critical when the market is tight. 79% of the carriers who do business with us on XPO Connect returned to the platform within 30 days.    XPO Connect is a powerful growth engine, but it's not the only advantage we have with our proprietary technology. We also created dynamic pricing algorithms that we use with customers and carriers. The algorithms leverage automation and machine learning to generate real-time pricing for every transportation lane at any given day and time.    Customers of all sizes increasingly want access to our pricing tools. In the fourth quarter, the number of transactions driven by APIs and other integrations was 2.7x higher year-over-year, and 70% of our loads in the quarter were created or covered digitally.    The bottom line is we have a lot of runway to continue to take market share, and we're doing it profitably. The $440 billion total addressable truckload market in North America is shifting towards brokers, in part because companies are rethinking their supply chains and want flexible capacity with lower risk. We've positioned our business to capture this opportunity at any point in the cycle.    In the current environment, truckload demand is strong and capacity is constrained, primarily due to equipment shortages and driver shortages. We offer a best-in-class combination of lane density, technology, experience and scale, with access to over 1 million trucks, and the headcount we added during the pandemic increases our capacity for growth.    These are significant advantages in expanding our business. That was true in 2021, and we saw it again in January, when we realized strong year-over-year volume growth again in January. We expect to generate double-digit volume growth in 2022 and going forward.    With that, we'll go to Q&A and take your questions. Operator?   :Operator::(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. :So I'll kick it off. As we said, we saw extremely strong trends in January of taking volume. If you look back to the fourth quarter, volume was up 22% on a year-over-year basis. But we also saw over the last 2 years, our loads per day was up 50%. Our net revenue per load was up 50%, and our net revenue more than doubled.    So we're continuing to take share, and we're confident that we'll still be able to do that for 3 main reasons. One is our technology. If you look at our technology, it's focused on customers, the carriers we work with and our people. The customers that we work with, our technology helps them make transportation decisions on what mode they should be shipping, when they should be shipping. It even does little things of give them updates if there's an alert on any sort of delay. It also helps, on the carrier side that we're working with, it's very sticky. And we see that because 79% of the carriers returned to us on XPO Connect within 30 days. And then we're continuing to see it within our employees. As you look over the last 5 years, our headcount is up 38%, and our loads are up 66%.    The second piece is our customers. We have strong relationships with a lot of the top companies in the country. And this has helped drive growth. If you look at our volume growth with our top customers, our top 20 customers, it's up 35%. Those same customers serve as a reference point. And you see that, for us, as our customers who do $1 million in business with us is up 48%, and we brought on 2,200 new customers. We've got a strong sales force and a lot of momentum.    The last piece is are people. Our people have their ear to the ground. We've got some of the best operators in the business. They've got a proven track record. Director level and above has been with us for 8 years on average. That allows us to create strong, sticky relationships with our customers.    So because of those 3 things, I'm confident that we're going to continue to take market share, and we're going to do it profitably. :Yes, it is the market share. And the brokerage space -- the trucking space is $440 billion. Brokerage has about $80 billion of that, and brokers are continuing to take share. Our customers want to use brokers because they've got flexible capacity that they can scale up or down based on what's going on in the market. And we've got a proven track record, if you look at the last 9 years of the industry CAGR being at 9% and our growth rate being at 27%. We've got a proven track record of being able to deliver on that result. As I mentioned earlier, we've got a strong sales team and a great pipeline for going forward. :Yes. So the 70% are created or covered digitally. That's a number that we're extremely proud of. If you look at our API integrations with our customers, that is up 2.7x on a year-over-year basis. The types of customers that are using this is all types of customers. It's very sticky with our large customers. They are attracted to the API integrations that we offer, but also our smaller customers are logging on, and they're using XPO Connect on a daily basis. And again, that helps them make the best transportation decisions possible. It tells them what mode they should be shipping, when they should be shipping. So we're seeing it across all of our customer base. :The intermodal market was strong. We continue to take -- we continued our recovery there. And if you look at the congestions and the equipment shortage, our organic revenue was up 38% on a year-over-year basis. You saw our GM per load skyrocket. We are investing in containers as you look into 2022. And we expect to be able to continue to grow on intermodal, but also on our drayage side.    Our drayage side complements intermodal. And when you think about it, one of the reasons that they marry so well together is because we have a presence at every single major U.S. port. So we're very excited about the intermodal market, and it was a strong performer for us in the fourth quarter."

        "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to the XPO Logistics Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call and Webcast. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Brad Jacobs. Please go ahead.\nBrad Jacobs: Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining our call. With me today in Greenwich are Ravi Tulsyan, our CFO; Matt Fassler, our Chief Strategy Officer; and Mario Harik, our CIO and acting President of LTL. We also have Drew Wilkerson, who leads our North American transportation group, joining us for Q&A. As you saw from our press release, the company overall had an excellent third quarter. We beat expectations for revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow, and raised our full year guidance by more than the beat. We now have 2 reporting segments following the spin-off of GXO. The largest service offering in our Brokerage and Other Services segment is North American truck brokerage, which had another remarkable quarter. Our North American LTL segment had mixed results, and we're actively course-correcting. Highlights of the quarter company-wide include a year-over-year increase in revenue of 22%. We also grew adjusted EBITDA, excluding real estate, by 25%. Our revenue was the highest of any quarter in our history, and our adjusted EBITDA was a third quarter record, marking the fifth consecutive quarter we've raised the bar on this metric. In North American truck brokerage, we continue to significantly outperform the market in growth of gross revenue, net revenue and volume. Year-over-year, we grew volume with our top 20 customers in total by 45%. We also significantly increased productivity, growing loads at nearly twice the rate of headcount. The largest driver of this productivity is our technology, specifically our XPO Connect digital brokerage platform, which continues to have very high levels of industry adoption. Matt will give you the growth numbers behind XPO Connect, including the number of carriers we have on the platform and the carrier usage, customer count and cumulative downloads. In LTL, we delivered record third quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA ex real estate gains and our strongest yield growth yet, up 6% ex fuel. But our adjusted operating ratio ex real estate eroded by 190 basis points year-over-year. Mario will cover this in detail later on the call. Many of you know Mario from his 10 years with XPO. He's one of the most talented executives I've ever worked with, and one of the first leaders I hired at the company. Mario and I have worked shoulder to shoulder on every major project since. Today, he'll talk about the 5-point action plan we've taken to return to our trajectory in LTL of significant multiyear operating ratio improvement. This includes how we're addressing shortages of equipment and labor using XPO-specific capabilities like trailer manufacturing and in-house driver schools. We're also moving to the next phase of our strategy in LTL for shareholder value creation. Over the next 12 to 24 months, we plan to add approximately 900 doors to our LTL network, which equates to about 6% more doors than we have now. We believe these targeted investments will enhance network-wide operating efficiency and support future revenue growth. And notably, our LTL segment has superlative return on invested capital, making it an ideal use of shareholder resources. We continue to target at least $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA in LTL in 2022. In conclusion, we delivered a number of key financial achievements in the quarter company-wide and in each of our segments. And once again, we raised our guidance for full year 2021. Finally, we were delighted to pay down $1.5 billion of debt in the quarter, moving us closer to our goal of an investment-grade rating. I'll now hand over to Ravi to discuss our results and our balance sheet.\nRavi Tulsyan: Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our third quarter results, our balance sheet and liquidity and our updated outlook for 2021. In the third quarter, we delivered strong year-over-year growth in both revenue and adjusted EBITDA, with both results coming in higher than expectations. We generated revenue of $3.27 billion, which was a year-over-year increase of more than 22%. Fuel prices contributed 3 points to growth, resulting in organic growth of 19%. The impact of FX was not material in the quarter. We grew adjusted EBITDA by almost 15% to $307 million. Pro forma for spin-off, this was a third quarter record for us, and it reflects strong growth and execution in our Brokerage and Other Services segment. Excluding real estate gains, our year-over-year adjusted EBITDA growth was 25%. For the quarter, our adjusted EBITDA margin, excluding gains from real estate sales, was 9.2%, an improvement of 20 basis points year-over-year. Both of our segments, Brokerage and Other Services and North American LTL, contributed to our growth. In our brokerage segment, adjusted EBITDA increased by 46% in the third quarter. And in our LTL segment, adjusted EBITDA, excluding gains from real estate, was up year-over-year by 2%. Operating conditions in the quarter were favorable, with robust consumer activity and an ongoing rebound in the industrial sector, as well as a firm pricing environment. This was partially offset by cost pressures, especially on the purchased transportation line and by the impact of labor and equipment shortages. Matt will provide additional color on our segment performance in a few minutes. Our adjusted earnings were $0.94 per diluted share, which was up from $0.42 per diluted share from a year ago, an increase of 124%. This year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher EBITDA, lower interest expense and lower tax rate. We generated $250 million of cash flow from continuing operations, spent $77 million on gross CapEx and received $12 million of proceeds from asset sales. As a result, our free cash flow was a very robust $185 million. This exceeded our expectations for the quarter, driven by strong earnings as well as CapEx and working capital timing that worked in our favor. We are executing our strategy of driving shareholder value as a pure-play transportation company. On a trailing 12-month basis, total company return on invested capital was 33%, with the North American LTL segment above that. Given this return profile, we are increasing our CapEx in LTL, primarily with plans to add additional doors and purchase equipment to support expanded door capacity. Our cash balance at September 30 was $254 million after paying down $1.5 billion of debt in the quarter. This cash, combined with available debt capacity under committed borrowing facilities, gave us over $1.2 billion of liquidity at quarter end. We had no borrowing outstanding under our ABL facility. Maintaining strong liquidity will continue to be a top priority for us. Our net leverage at September 30 was 2.8x adjusted EBITDA for the last 12 months. Following the spin-off of GXO, we used the $794 million dividend from GXO and $384 million in net proceeds from our equity offering, along with cash on hand, to repay all our outstanding senior notes due in 2023 and 2024, a total redemption of over $1.5 billion. For the full year, we have reduced our gross debt by approximately $3 billion. We have begun to benefit from lower interest expense this year, and our interest expense will decline by another $60 million on a year-over-year basis for 2022. We now have no significant debt maturities until 2025. We'll continue to delever our balance sheet through free cash flow generation and adjusted EBITDA growth. Our progress on deleveraging is important in the context of our target to achieve net leverage in the range of 1x to 2x adjusted EBITDA by the first half of 2023 and our commitment to achieve an investment-grade rating. Turning to the outlook we issued yesterday after market close. We updated our full year guidance in light of our strong third quarter results and the favorable economic trends we see today. Our outlook assumes this trend will continue, and the market impacts of labor and equipment shortages don't get worse. The raise in our full year adjusted EBITDA includes a fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA target of $300 million to $305 million. On the cash flow front, our new outlook is for full year free cash flow of $425 million to $475 million. We expect gross CapEx to be $375 million to $400 million and net CapEx to be $250 million to $275 million for the year. The updated full year pro forma depreciation and amortization guidance is $390 million to $395 million, and there is no change to pro forma interest expense of approximately $200 million. We expect our reported interest expense for the year to be approximately $230 million. Our full year tax rate is now expected to be 24% to 26%, which is an increase of 1% versus our previous guidance, driven by discrete items and nondeductible expenses. Our average share count forecast for the year remains unchanged at approximately 114 million diluted common shares, and we expect to end the year at approximately 116 million diluted common shares. The full year adjusted EPS guidance on a pro forma basis is now $4.15 to $4.25. The change in our adjusted EPS range reflects higher EBITDA and an increase in tax rate. In conclusion, we had a transformative third quarter with the spin-off of our logistics segment, and we are enthusiastic about our prospects as a transportation leader in the markets we serve. I will now turn things over to Matt.\nMatt Fassler: Thanks, Ravi. I'll review our third quarter operating results, starting with North American LTL. We grew revenue by 15% year-over-year. Excluding fuel, we grew revenue by 10% year-over-year. We grew tonnage per day by 3% year-over-year. Our tonnage trends tracked typical seasonality in July and August, but trailed in September. Our rate per shipment increased 4% year-over-year, with the increase broad-based across verticals. Shipments fell slightly by 0.6% year-over-year. Our retail and e-commerce vertical was strong, reflecting a strong consumer economy and our expanding footprint in the consumer space. Our 1- to 2-day service offering is attractive to consumer-facing verticals. We see substantial room for further recovery in industrial and especially in automotive, though tonnage did rise nominally in both of these verticals. The pricing environment remained firm. Yield, excluding fuel, rose 6% year-over-year. This is our biggest year-over-year yield improvement since we acquired Con-way in 2015. Price increases on contract renewals were 8%, consistent with Q2. Revenue per shipment, excluding fuel, grew 10%. This reflected the increases that we saw in both yield and weight per shipment. Our LTL adjusted operating ratio was 83.9%. Excluding real estate gains, our adjusted OR was 84.4%, which was 190 basis points higher than the third quarter a year ago. The erosion in adjusted OR mirrored the impact of the higher cost of purchased transportation, which, when measured as a percent of revenue, increased about 200 basis points year-over-year. This increase was driven largely by higher truckload rates. In fact, we reduced our use of third-party transportation year-over-year, as we have for some time. In-sourcing this volume in an environment constrained by shortages of labor and equipment impacted our efficiency. We've already taken steps to address this dynamic going forward. Also, through a number of pricing actions, our yield growth in October accelerated meaningfully. Mario will offer additional details on our strategic plans for LTL. We have enormous opportunity for outsized growth in the years ahead. With the spin, we've allocated our lines of business other than North American LTL into a new segment, Brokerage and Other Services. North American truck brokerage is our largest revenue and profit driver among our lines of business in this segment. Our third quarter truck brokerage results were outstanding as we gained share and delivered outsized profit improvement. Our loads per day increased by 37% versus a year ago, holding steady with our growth in the second quarter. And once again, we sharply outpaced the market. On a year-over-year basis, we generated a 62% increase in both revenue and net revenue. Net revenue per load increased 18% year-on-year. The truckload market remains exceptionally tight as shippers seek capacity and visibility to their freight movements. Our digital brokerage platform, XPO Connect, is helping us drive tremendous volume at excellent margins. Carrier and customer adoption of XPO Connect continues to surge. We exceeded 550,000 cumulative downloads of our Drive XPO mobile app as of the third quarter, nearly tripling the cumulative number of downloads year-over-year. We topped 90,000 registered carrier accounts on the platform, up 37% year-over-year. Average weekly usage by carriers more than doubled, and the number of customer accounts on the platform more than tripled. Our North American truck brokerage profitability was very strong, and we leveraged our 62% net revenue growth into stronger adjusted EBITDA growth in brokerage. Looking at overall segment results from brokerage and other services, revenue rose 27%, while adjusted EBITDA rose 46%. The adjusted EBITDA margin for this segment rose to 5.8% from 5.1% a year ago. I want to mention a couple of recognitions that are particularly gratifying. We were recently named a top company for women to work for by the Women in Trucking Association, and we received both the Ford Excellence Award for treating customers like family and an award from Ulta Beauty for commitment to continuous improvement. Now, I'll turn it over to Mario for a further discussion of North American LTL.\nMario Harik: Thanks, Matt. I'm going to focus my comments on 2 areas of LTL, where we're bringing a lot of fresh initiatives to the table. One is the action plan we began executing in October and the other is our strategy to accelerate growth going forward by making targeted investments in the business. As you know, we had some year-over-year erosion in our operating ratio, despite reporting our highest third quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA ex real estate. I want to be clear that we know exactly why we fell short on our operating ratio, and we're taking a number of specific actions to get it back on track. I'll walk you through it. As you know, we've had an ongoing strategy of in-sourcing third-party linehaul transportation to use our own capacity. This strategy has worked well for us for years, but the third quarter was a tough time to be in-sourcing, particularly given the ongoing labor and equipment shortages. This impacted our network efficiency and reduced the amount of available capacity. Short-term, we'll be taking a more balanced approach to our linehaul needs. We understand the problem, and we own the solution. I took over as acting President in October, and we immediately began executing on a 5-point action plan. All of our initiatives are underway. First, we\u2019re improving network flow with selective embargoes, where we limit the freight we accept at certain terminals for short periods of time. We're working one-on-one with those terminal teams to clear the way for more volume. The short-term cost is embedded in our guidance. Second, we're driving multiple pricing initiatives to improve yield, capitalizing on the firm industry pricing environment. For example, we pulled forward the general rate increase from January to November. That's a 5.9% increase that went into effect at the beginning of this week. And we're instituting accessorials to enforce appropriate charges for trailers that get detained at their drop-off points. The same holds true for loads that require special handling, like oversized freight or irregular dimensions. If the nature of the freight means we can\u2019t fully optimize our trailer, we'll get paid more for that. Our pricing actions are already paying dividends, and we saw strong yield performance in October. Third, we're ramping up the attendance at our XPO driver training schools to help mitigate the driver shortage. This year, we'll have 800 graduates in the U.S., and we're targeting more than double that number next year. And fourth, on the equipment side, we have an XPO-specific solution to our most immediate need, which is trailers. We have a major edge here and it\u2019s going to get bigger starting in 2022. We're investing to significantly increase our production capacity at our company-owned trailer manufacturing facility in Arkansas. We expect to nearly double the number of units produced in 2022. And fifth, as Brad mentioned, while all these initiatives are underway, we're also embarking on a 2-year plan to expand our U.S. network by about 900 doors or approximately 6%. Over the next 12 to 24 months, we'll make strategic investments in the business and our top 10 metro markets. We'll add doors across the network where they can improve our operating efficiency and grow our revenue and yield while benefiting as many customers as possible. We're in the middle of the planning process, so we'll have more color on this when we give you our outlook next quarter. We expect to add at least half of the 900 doors in 2022. That covers the plan we launched in October and our strategic investments in the business, and we will continue to focus on rolling out new technology to drive value in LTL. LTL pricing is front and center in our tech agenda. It's our biggest opportunity to accelerate yield in the long-term. We're building out our data-driven tools to optimize rates for small accounts, and we use elasticity models to identify the best pricing. Another big opportunity is network optimization and linehaul, where our annual spend is about $1.1 billion ex fuel. Our goal is to reduce the number of miles required to process a given amount of volume in our network. And we're automating the load-building process to get higher trailer utilization. The next area is pickup and delivery, where we launched new planning tools earlier this year and have upcoming launches of new dispatch tools and dynamic routing enhancements. Our goal is to increase the number of stops per route and the average volume per route. Our other big focus is dock productivity. Our XPO Smart productivity tools are in place across our network, and they have had an immediate positive impact that should gain traction when the labor market settles down. Another area where we can enhance dock productivity is through door planning, which is how we position trailers on the dock to minimize worker movements. We have additional developments underway for LTL on the technology front, including a new web portal a new API features for our customers. And finally, you may have seen the recent press coverage of our new hub in Chicago Heights. This terminal has significantly increased our capacity in a key metro area, and it will drive efficiencies across our network. It's a state-of-the-art facility with 264 doors and 150,000 square feet, and it employs around 250 people. All of our drivers are held to strict safety standards, but I\u2019ll mentioned that 25 of the drivers based in Chicago Heights have an amazing safety track record of driving either 1 million or 2 million miles accident-free. More doors mean more top-line growth, more efficiencies and more yields flowing to the bottom line for our shareholders. This is the same strategy that's driving our capital investment plan moving forward. Our North American LTL business delivers a high return on invested capital, and we're extremely bullish about this opportunity to unlock more potential. I'll close with a personal comment. I've spent a lot of time in the field over the last month, and it's very exciting to work in the trenches with our first-class LTL organization. I'm impressed by how deeply this team cares about serving our customers and how quickly they\u2019ve embraced our action plan. These are the folks with their ear to the ground, and there's a lot of positive energy driving the future of this business. As we take actions to course correct our network, in the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted operating ratio to track typical seasonal trends. This implies year-over-year erosion, similar to or slightly greater than what we saw in the third quarter. We expect to inflect back toward year-over-year improvement in the first half of 2022. We look forward to driving significant positive developments in LTL in the coming year. We're continuing to target at least $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA in 2022. And we have a strong conviction that we'll generate hundreds of additional basis points of improvement in our operating ratio in the long-term. With that, we're going to take your questions. Operator, please open the line.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Hamzah Mazari from Jefferies.\nHamzah Mazari: My first question, I'd just like to address some of these to Mario. I guess, what exactly went wrong in Q3 in LTL? I know it's OR related, and you gave some color. But just as part of that, do you think you underperformed your peers in the quarter? And then you mentioned some of the strategic plan going forward. Maybe just some more color on that in terms of the confidence level on that and the execution risk on that strategic plan going forward.\nMario Harik: Yes. Thanks, Hamzah. So when we look at the third quarter, despite having a record EBITDA and revenue, we underperformed on OR, so we had erosion of 190 basis points versus a lot of our peers that had improvements in their OR. Now I mentioned in the opening remarks that we, as a carrier, have a higher dependency on purchased transportation. So these are -- we call them internally highway subservice miles, where last year in Q3, we had roughly 26% of our miles were highway subservice. And we continued a long-term strategy to in-source highway subservice, which has fared well for us in the past, but it was a tough time to do this in a quarter where you have obviously labor shortages and equipment shortages, which put pressure on our linehaul network, and that caused our network to become less efficient, and the network flow was not as efficient as we would have liked it to be, which effectively increases the cost of being able to fulfill the service we expect. And it also reduced the amount of capacity we have in the network. So, when you combine these things, we -- this is kind of where we saw that OR erosion. Now, we have an action plan, as I mentioned in the opening remarks. It's a 5-point action plan to address this issue. Number one, it's around the strategic embargoes, where for a selective number of sites, we meter the amount of freight that we are getting from our customers in those sites to improve the network flow. And we've seen great results so far; great feedback from the field. I\u2019ve been spending a lot of time in our terminals over the last month, and it\u2019s good to see the impact that this is having in our operation. The second area is around yield. Although we had record yield in the quarter, which is a 6% year-over-year improvement, and it accelerated from 4.5% in Q2, it still needed to be higher. We didn't move as quickly as we should have on raising prices on our customers, and we are taking action on this. So, we already are seeing a very nice improvement in October of our yield performance. And the actions we took there, one was on contract renewals. We've seen a higher percentage on yield improvement there. We are charging our customers accessorials when they detain our trailers, so we can get more of that equipment back into our fleet. We are also charging them whenever they are shipping something that is irregular or long or doesn't fit our network and doesn't allow us to optimize our trailers as well. And then we pulled our general rate increase from early next year -- usually we do it in Q1 -- to this Monday to also capitalize on the local accounts, getting more yield improvement there. Now, the third area has really 3 components to it, which is adding capacity to our network. So when we think about capacity, it's about drivers, it's about equipment and it's about physical terminals, so doors and actual -- the physical space where we move the goods. On the driver side, we have a competitive edge with our driver school, and we're investing more into these driver schools where, this year, we're going to graduate roughly double the number of drivers we had done in 2019. And we are looking to further double that number going into 2022. So that's going to be a solution for us to add more drivers to our driver ranks and help counter some of the driver shortages we're seeing in the industry. On the equipment side, our biggest need is around trailers. So when you have inefficiency in your network, effectively, you need more trailer space to be able to -- and when you in-source also purchased transportation, you need more trailers. And we \u2013 I was in our Searcy, Arkansas facility last week, and we're investing more CapEx, adding more production lines to be able to double the production of trailers going into 2022, as well. And the last aspect of the action plan, which is more of a medium- to long-term growth strategy, is focused on adding doors in the markets where we are seeing higher demand from our customers. These are typically the key metro markets, and then investing in the physical footprint of adding terminals and expanding terminals from a doors perspective, and we're adding roughly 6% more doors than what we have today in the network over the next 12 to 24 months, so we can handle more of our customers' freight and capitalize on the hot market we're seeing in LTL. But that hopefully gives you a good color on what happened one in Q3, the action plans we're taking to course-correct that moving forward and pivoting toward the growth strategy, as well.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Amit Mehrotra from Deutsche Bank.\nAmit Mehrotra: Brad, on the LTL business, I'm not so focused on where we've been. I think the results are pretty clear, but I'm really focused on where we're going. And so what I'm trying to understand is the level of urgency in the organization, the level of urgency in your mind to get the LTL business back on a better trajectory. And is it fair to say that 3Q results is a bit of a kind of watershed moment for the company to kind of change course on the LTL business? So that's kind of the first question. And just separately, the M&A market is very, very hot right now, as you know better than anybody. There's obviously several deals in the space in the recent weeks and months and quarters. How do you, in your mind, balance kind of the benefit of retaining businesses outside of brokerage and LTL with the potential benefits to accelerate the deleveraging of the balance sheet, which is obviously one of the key strategic priorities?\nBrad Jacobs: On the second question, the M&A, while I don't want to get into specifics of what we may or may not be doing on non-core parts of the business, to answer your question, the obvious advantage, if we chose to go that path is it would accelerate our getting to our goal of becoming investment grade. I was very happy that we paid down $1.5 billion of debt this quarter. That was a real good move toward getting investment grade, but we have more ways to go. So if we chose to go down that path, it would just accelerate it. With respect to your first question, we listen to our shareholders, and we listen to them very closely. Sometimes, we hear most of what they say, not all of what they say. So, we heard 2 things that investors told us over the last year. One was reduce your debt. So, we're making huge progress on that. Second was simplify the business model. The spin accomplished that. So, I think we heard those 2 things, loud and clear, and we acted on them. The third point, I don't know if we heard it so well, which was you need to grow your LTL business -- not just sweat the assets and grow the margin and get great returns on capital, but grow top line. So, we have heard that now, and that is something we are going to do. Now, with respect to the third quarter, I would say this: Even great companies stumble now and then. And we certainly did not stumble company-wide. We beat and we raised. So, I rest my case there. We certainly did not stumble in Europe. The numbers were great. It would be very difficult to make an argument that we stumbled in truck brokerage, since we have industry-leading results there. We stumbled in LTL. We were focused on other things and didn't keep our eye on the ball there. We do have our arms around the issues there. We have been intensely focusing on this in the last 3 or 4 weeks, and we will continue to intensely focus on this. With respect to your question about what's the level of urgency, we love solving problems -- that's how we create alpha. We have a tremendous track record of creating significant shareholder value over the long-term for our investors. And we will course-correct this LTL with a great level of urgency, and I'm confident we will.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Todd Fowler from KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nTodd Fowler: Brad, to the last point on looking for growth within the LTL business. How do we balance or how do we think about some of the near-term actions and the impact on tonnage and what that means for growth here in the near term? And then can you also speak to service metrics during this time period? Were you able to maintain service? Or did service suffer as you went through some of the actions to basically free up some of the network fluidity?\nBrad Jacobs: Well, Todd, I think service levels for the entire industry, not just the LTL industry, but globally, transportation, wasn't functioning at peak efficiency in recent months due to the significant upsurge in volume, yet the shortages of labor and equipment, and we were not immune to that either. With respect to what the short-term impacts will be on tonnage, the embargoes that we do selectively, they slow down tonnage a little bit here and there. The raising yield, okay, there's some elasticity on that. But overall, you'll see in the coming quarters a shift to growing the revenue line -- not immediately, but you will see that shift slowly and steadily growing the revenue line. And you'll see us investing more in CapEx, and you'll see us be more aggressive on raising rates. You'll see us being more aggressive on enforcing accessorials. So, there\u2019s a whole slew of initiatives we've got in place, and Mario summarized the top ones, that will allow us to regain our position in LTL.\nTodd Fowler: So Brad, you're saying that any deterioration in the service metrics would be consistent maybe with the industry? Is this kind of the comment that you're making?\nBrad Jacobs: I don't see the service metrics for the competition, so it's hard to compare them. But I would say that the industry as a whole suffered as a result of the shortages of equipment, shortages of labor and the big influxes of volumes. And in a network business, in that part of the transportation supply chain, that suffers a little bit more because it's a network -- you tickle it here and it laughs there; you pinch it here and it cries there. I will say that we've got 25,000 loyal customers in LTL, and customers choose carriers that meet their service expectations.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Chris Wetherbee from Citi.\nChristian Wetherbee: I wanted to get a sense of what you think the capacity of the network is today. So I understand you're adding 900 doors, which is about 6% of the capacity. I look back a few years, you guys are down in terms of tonnage, about 6% from where you were in 2017. So I just want to get a sense of maybe where you think the capacity is today. And then was this just simply the linehaul piece that was the constraint in the quarter, that you didn't see the sort of sequential uptick in September in terms of tonnage that your peers did? So I just want to make sure I understand sort of the dynamics around capacity. And what do you think this will actually drive in terms of the next 24 months as you roll out these new doors?\nMario Harik: You got it, Chris. This is Mario. When we think about excess capacity, we roughly have about 15% excess capacity when it comes to the terminal footprint. However, it's not evenly distributed. And so there are pinch points in certain markets, and when we think about our plan going into next year, opening up the additional 6% of doors, we are looking at metro markets where we are seeing higher demand from our customers. And we already cover more than 99% of the zip codes in the country, so we have line of sight to the demand in the many of these markets. And in those markets where we do have pinch points is where we're going to either opening terminals or adding doors as we head into 2022. Now the physical capacity is one aspect. However, obviously, the 2 other aspects of capacity are drivers and equipment. And as we all know, the driver shortage has been impacting our industry significantly, and this is where we are doubling down on both our recruiting efforts and our driver schools to graduate more drivers to fill the gap there on the short term. Now the second part of your question on linehaul. So typically, the way linehaul works, when you in-source purchased transportation, you effectively break one longer haul that you're doing with a third-party carrier into smaller hops in the network. So when you have a driver shortage in some parts of these segments, effectively, you add to either linehaul miles, where you are diverting trailers to another facility, or you add cost on rehandling on the dock as well. So that's the dynamic when you have an imbalance in the driver -- when you have a driver shortage and you have an imbalance. And while we kept on in-sourcing purchased transportation, that impacted our capacity in certain markets where we didn't have enough capacity to meet our customer demand.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate that, Mario. And then in terms of some of the actions you're doing, you said that you're metering volume coming in. You said in October, there was, I think, a positive response, generally speaking, probably to network fluidity is the point that you were making. Can you give us a sense if you can see tonnage growth in the short run as you're going through this process? I'm thinking specifically about 4Q. I don't know if you want to give us an update on where tonnage was in October. But I want to get a sense of do you think that you could still grow tonnage while you're going through the short-term fix to the network.\nMario Harik: Yes. I'll give you color kind of what early in the quarter looks like. So one on the yield side, the pricing actions we have taken have shown a very nice acceleration of yield improvement year-over-year in October. However, tonnage with the embargo actions we've taken to meter some of the freight, and as we take this corrective action, we would expect tonnage to be soft in the fourth quarter as we are taking those corrective actions. And when we look going into next year, as we clear the way for more volume and add more of that capacity on the driver side then on the trailer side, we expect to have an inflection point in the first half of the year on both OR improvement and volume improvement as well.\nOperator: Your next question today is coming from Jordan Alliger from Goldman Sachs.\nJordan Alliger: Just a couple of questions. One, can you talk about your strategy of using purchased transport going forward, since that seemed to be a bit of an issue in the quarter? Is that, at least in the near term, expected to increase? And then, in terms of the inflection on OR, to get to that $1 billion EBITDA number, what sort of improvement are you currently contemplating next year?\nMario Harik: Yes. So let's start with the first part of the question on purchased transportation. So on the short-term, and this goes from this quarter -- Q4 and going into Q1 \u2013 we are taking a more balanced approach on purchased transportation. So, we are analyzing on a lane-by-lane basis. We all know what's happening in the truckload market rates. So, these rates have gone significantly up. So, we are going lane-by-lane and analyzing what could be the cost to outsource that to a third-party versus using our own drivers for it, and tying it back to the demand we're seeing from our customers in those markets. So, on the short-term, we're going to take a more balanced approach on purchased transportation that leans towards adding more purchased transportation, if the rates are right and depending on which lanes we can get a good rate. So as an example, if you look at outbound from Southern California today, the rates are just completely out of typical market norm, given the tightness we're seeing in that market. However, other parts of the country, like in the Midwest or the Northeast, you would have much more desirable rates on the truckload side. On the long-term, our strategy to in-source purchased transportation will continue. So, as we clear the way to adding more drivers and more equipment, we do believe that we want to handle more of the linehaul network on our own equipment with our own drivers, but that's going to be back on the long-term strategy. Now in the -- going back to our guidance \u2013- or, our targets for next year, we are targeting at least $1 billion of EBITDA for the full year 2022. When it comes to OR, we will give more color on that going into the next \u2013- so, on the next earnings call, we'll give a bit more color on what we expect on the OR improvement for the year to hit that number.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski: I know we've had a lot of focus on LTL, but can we talk about the brokerage business and some of the efficiencies that you guys are seeing there? I think a lot of it is being driven by your XPO Connect app. And can you talk about the sustainability of brokerage earnings going into next year, just given that we have such elevated rates on the trucking side, like can this earnings base be maintained? Or do we need to think that, that could reset?\nDrew Wilkerson: Brandon, this is Drew. On XPO Connect, we started it over 10 years ago, and we had 3 things in mind. The first thing was our customers. And so, when we built this for our customers, we really wanted to be able to give them massive amounts of data to help them make the best transportation decisions possible. When you look at the vendors, or the carriers, we want to be easy to do business with, and that's something that shows, because on a 30-day run, 77% of our carriers are likely to come back to us. And the last piece was for the employees. We continue to see improvement with our employees and the productivity off of them. If you look at the volume over the last 5 years, it's increased 60%. And we have added less than half of that \u2013- or, about half of that on headcount. So our volume continues to outpace headcount overall. As far as the sustainability on the market, I don't think anybody has got a crystal ball for where the market is going. I can tell you right now, we are confident that we will continue to take share overall. We've proven that we can take share in a tight market or in a loose market, and we've got a great group of proven Operator s who, on average, our director level and above have with XPO for over 8 years. And so that team has had success in both a tight market and a loose market, and we're confident that we'll continue to do both. We have very strong relationships with our customers. That's evidenced by growing volume 37% on a year-over-year basis. And with our top 20 customers, they depended on us in the tightest capacity we've seen and grew volume 45% on a year-over-year basis.\nOperator: Your next question today is coming from Jason Seidl from Cowen.\nJason Seidl: I hate to go back to LTL here, but I'm going to give it a go. Just wanted to think about sort of 3Q to 4Q. You sort of laid out some of your OR targets. I'm surprised we're not going to see, I think, a little bit more sequential improvement, only because you are pulling up your GRI, which is 5.9%. And then you have pretty strong rate increases there that you had in the previous quarter of 8%. What should we think about the puts and takes for the OR for at least the near term? I understand the long-term plan.\nMario Harik: Yes. So going -- when you look at OR going into Q4, so we expect the fourth quarter to have typical seasonal trends coming from Q3, which again will make the year-over-year erosion similar or slightly greater to what we saw in Q3. Now the dynamics of the quarter, as you said, so we're seeing already a very nice improvement for yield in October based on the actions that we have taken so far, on all the things I mentioned earlier on with accessorials, with the higher contract renewals, with all the different pieces there. However, with the embargoes we implemented in October, that effectively created a drag for us in October when it comes to volume. So the dynamic of the quarter will be you would see higher yield, you would see softer volume, and that will contribute to what our OR target looks like for the quarter.\nJason Seidl: Okay. So it's going to be more on the embargo side. And on your GRI, you're really the first person I've seen to push the GRI into November. FedEx freight came out, but there's -- their GRI, not some of the surcharges, is not taking place until January. Do you think that you could suffer some on the tonnage area with that? Or do you think that the market is just so hot it's not going to matter?\nMario Harik: Listen, when we look at the current market, it's a pretty firm pricing market. So there is more demand in the market than there is capacity in the market. And then we believe -- the way the GRI works for us, it impacts our local accounts. And we also have spent a lot of time with our sales team to get that feedback on where we need to be. And we felt that, that was the right action to take. We haven't, so far, heard any pushback or negative feedback from customers. They understand that in this market, there's cost inflation in terms of driver wages and getting equipment and all the things that they see in their supply chains. So it's been pretty well received so far.\nJason Seidl: Mario, if I could sneak one more in here. Vaccine mandate, wanted to get your thoughts on that. I don't know if Brad wants to chime in as well. That's a pretty hot topic in the trucking market. Obviously, the ATA has pitched the administration that the industry should get an exemption. I, of course, agree wholeheartedly with them, but I would love to hear your thoughts on that.\nBrad Jacobs: My personal opinion is everyone should get vaccinated. I think the evidence is very clear that people who are vaccinated get infected less. And when they do get infected less, they get hospitalized less than nonvaccinated people. And for sure, the data shows that if you're vaccinated, you die less. So there's very compelling reasons to get vaccinated. Having said that, there's a lot of resistance from a lot of people to get vaccinated. And one, the government needs to take into consideration the practical ramifications of policy. And in the trucking industry, in particular, there's probably a little bit higher percentage of people who are anti-vaxxers, so to speak. And if that policy went in right away, it probably would not, short-term at least, have a good effect. You'd see a lot of labor leave the market. So, that's my overall view.\nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley.\nRavi Shanker: Mario, maybe if I can start with you. A, congratulations on the new role. B, when you look at the old hat you were wearing, or maybe the current hat as a CIO, I think a lot of the opportunity on the tech side was in LTL. But now that you've actually got under the hood of the LTL business and got your hands dirty, if you will, are you seeing any incremental opportunities on the tech side that make you excited about what you can do with the LTL business?\nMario Harik: Yes. First, thanks, Ravi. And as you said, I've been very involved in our LTL business in all the technology initiatives that we have been rolling out. And if you go back over the last 5 years, we've improved our operating ratio by 1,000 basis points and nearly tripled the profitability of this business, and tech had a big component to play in that. Now going forward, I mean, obviously, in the role of running the business, I have much more impact in terms of accelerating some of these initiatives and getting them out in the field on the medium to long run. And if I break it down, the biggest opportunity continues to be in pricing, where pricing is all about using price elasticity to better understand where customers are willing to pay in a high elasticity model with a firm pricing environment. And to give you an example, in our brokerage business where we've had 10 years of experience using machine learning to optimize pricing, you can see that evident in how well we price and the margins that we are getting on that business as well. So we continue to believe there's a lot of opportunity in pricing and improving technology there. The second area is around linehaul. When we think about linehaul, there's roughly $1.1 billion worth of spend ex fuel, and it's an area that the more -- so 1% improvement, obviously, is $11 million of EBITDA. And we have improved, we already have good technology there, and we're going to continue to improve that. A lot of it is optimizing the load building process and where we put, for example, freight within a trailer to reduce the amount of rehandles we're seeing in the network as an example there. The third area is around pick up in delivery. We launched new planning tools earlier this year. These were tools that allowed our planners -- it's all web-based, just beautiful-looking user interfaces, easy to use, and that helps our planners do a better job in their P&D routes. And we're in the process now of launching our new dispatch tools and then, going into next year, launching additional route enhancements that would allow us to increase the amount of weight we're putting in a certain trip or increase the number of stops on a certain trip as well. And then the next area is around dock productivity. So as I mentioned in my opening remarks, Smart is already deployed in all of our terminals. And Smart allows us to make sure we have the right amount of dock workers for the amount of work that we need to do. And we're also now launching a new technology that allows us to better position trailers on the docks, so we can minimize worker movements between the doors, so we can improve efficiency by minimizing travel on the dock as well. Then finally, with customers. I spend a lot of time with customers. A lot of their feedback is -- we are launching new API technology that is making our integration with customers go easier. A new web portal, we're currently in pilot. We're very excited about it, and we're getting great feedback from customers on it. So we're definitely accelerating the tech agenda. And similar to what we've done in brokerage of getting outsized results driven by technology. We believe that the LTL business will continue to use tech to better optimize the business.\nRavi Shanker: Very helpful. And maybe a quick follow-up to Brad. Brad, increasing resource allocation to LTL makes a lot of sense given the fundamentals of that business. But what about the brokerage business? Obviously, you guys are firing on all cylinders there. What's your strategy to resource allocation there? Is it more of a milk the cycle for its worth? Or do you feel that there's real share gain and growth potential there in the long-term?\nBrad Jacobs: I think we will continue to take share. I think the investments we've made in XPO Connect over the last decade have been consistently paying off, and we've been outperforming the market and outperforming the market in brokerage by a significant amount. If you look in this particular quarter, our loads are up 37%. And if you look at the volume from our top 20 customers, it's up 45% year-over-year. If you look at our net revenue, it was up 62%. And you look at XPO Connect specifically, year-over-year carrier is up 37%. Carrier usage has doubled. Customer count is up 3x year-over-year. You look at the API-driven transactions, they're up fivefold year-over-year. So XPO Connect is working very, very well, and that's enabling us to meet customer demands, to meet them where they want to transact with us. So XPO Connect is very, very sticky. And 77% of the carriers who do business with us on Connect, come back within 30 days and do more business with us. So it's a virtuous cycle. Now with respect to your question about allocating resources. In terms of CapEx, truck brokerage doesn't need much CapEx. It's really just the IT and some of the overhead, which is really not even CapEx, it\u2019s OpEx. So it just doesn't need a lot of CapEx. The real place we're going to put CapEx in is going to be on LTL, so that we can do what our shareholders have told us, which is to grow, grow in LTL. For that, we've got to invest in it. So that's what we'll do.\nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Tom Wadewitz from UBS.\nTom Wadewitz: Wanted to ask, I guess, to start with on -- I know you've had a lot on LTL, but what do you think changed sequentially? Was it -- I want to understand it a little bit better. Was it the labor attrition picked up? I guess, in terms of the change on linehaul, I mean, were you at 26% outsourced linehaul in the second quarter and then you went to 24% kind of too quickly. I mean it seems like a number of things that are kind of intertwined. And I think I'm just trying to understand partly what is just the macro is a lot tougher, which, obviously, you work harder to improve, but the macro -- the labor market may not improve. So I wanted to see if you could give some more perspective on really what changed sequentially second quarter versus third in LTL?\nMario Harik: Yes. You got it. So as I mentioned earlier, as we had the long-term strategy to in-source our purchased transportation, but when we think through the summer, especially with the COVID variant picking up and the driver shortage, effectively, that wasn't the right time. It was a tough time to be in-sourcing purchased transportation. So we -- when we in-source that, we effectively move drivers in our network between city and linehaul operations, but there wasn't enough drivers given the shortage. So it was too quick of a move in a market where you have a driver shortage. So moving forward, as we pivot from that, so one, we're going to take a more balanced approach to look at -- depending on the rate for certain HSS lanes, or purchased transportation lanes, we're going to make the right decision for the business on the short term. And also we\u2019re accelerating our driver hiring. Now I mentioned driver schools earlier on. If we look -- obviously, when we think about hiring drivers, that includes both hiring externally as well as internally. And this is where we're doubling down on both of these. I mentioned already doubling the number of drivers we're getting from our driver schools this year versus '19, obviously, and it was roughly 6x what it was versus last year and doubling that going to next year. And we're also doubling down on our efforts where we're adding -- increasing the size of our recruiting team. We're using social media. We're adding benefits for -- between referrals or starting bonuses in some markets for drivers to capture that portion of it. Now for us -- but going back to Q3, September really was the pivot point where we've seen the threshold of drivers versus how much we had in-sourced on purchased transportation hit a bottleneck that caused the network to become inefficient. And when that happened, we effectively didn't have enough capacity to pick up customers\u2019 freight and that created cost inefficiencies in the network as well.\nTom Wadewitz: What was -- how much did the linehaul outsource -- or excuse me, in-source increase 2Q to 3Q?\nMario Harik: So on a Q3 basis, it was 26% to 24%, and it was roughly around the same in terms of year-over-year in Q2 as well.\nTom Wadewitz: Okay. That makes sense. Can you offer any quick thoughts on just what your macro assumptions are for the $1 billion EBITDA in LTL in 2022? Is it like, labor market wise, do you assume stability? Or do you assume some help that the labor market eases a bit to get to that significant improvement in 2022?\nMatt Fassler: It's Matt. In the short run, we expect the macro conditions that we see today, including all of the realities that we see in terms of labor and capacity. We do assume that, over the course of 2022, there's some normalization on both of those fronts. But to be clear, the key to us getting to those numbers, we understand, is achieving the goals that we've set in the 5-point action plan, particularly with relationship to network efficiency and network flow in the short run and achieving the results that we expect on head count and equipment from the initiatives that we outlined earlier.\nOperator: We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments.\nBrad Jacobs: Thank you. So I'll leave you with 4 points. In LTL in the third quarter, it obviously was not our finest hour. However, we have our arms around the issue, and we're dealing with it with great urgency, and I'm confident that we will achieve our goals there. In terms of truck brokerage, we're just continuing to kill it in truck brokerage. The tech investments over the last decade are clearly paying off. The biggest -- the third point I'd point out is the pricing environment. Inflation is not a good thing for consumers, but it's not necessarily a bad thing for companies within the supply chain, assuming you can raise your pricing in excess of your price inflation, which we should be able to do. So we should be benefiting from the firm pricing environment, and we've seen ourselves be able to execute that in Europe. We've seen ourselves being able to execute that in brokerage and all the lines of business within brokerage. And we are now going to push the pedal to the metal on exerting pricing power in LTL. And the fourth point I would end with is, I'm just very delighted that we paid off $1.5 billion of debt in the quarter, and we've made great progress towards our goal of becoming investment grade. So with that, I thank everyone for participating in this call, and we'll be talking to you all in due course. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

            "content": "Brandon, this is Drew. On XPO Connect, we started it over 10 years ago, and we had 3 things in mind. The first thing was our customers. And so, when we built this for our customers, we really wanted to be able to give them massive amounts of data to help them make the best transportation decisions possible. When you look at the vendors, or the carriers, we want to be easy to do business with, and that's something that shows, because on a 30-day run, 77% of our carriers are likely to come back to us. And the last piece was for the employees. We continue to see improvement with our employees and the productivity off of them. If you look at the volume over the last 5 years, it's increased 60%. And we have added less than half of that \u2013- or, about half of that on headcount. So our volume continues to outpace headcount overall. As far as the sustainability on the market, I don't think anybody has got a crystal ball for where the market is going. I can tell you right now, we are confident that we will continue to take share overall. We've proven that we can take share in a tight market or in a loose market, and we've got a great group of proven Operator s who, on average, our director level and above have with XPO for over 8 years. And so that team has had success in both a tight market and a loose market, and we're confident that we'll continue to do both. We have very strong relationships with our customers. That's evidenced by growing volume 37% on a year-over-year basis. And with our top 20 customers, they depended on us in the tightest capacity we've seen and grew volume 45% on a year-over-year basis."

            "name": "Ravi Tulsyan",
            "content": "Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our third quarter results, our balance sheet and liquidity and our updated outlook for 2021. In the third quarter, we delivered strong year-over-year growth in both revenue and adjusted EBITDA, with both results coming in higher than expectations. We generated revenue of $3.27 billion, which was a year-over-year increase of more than 22%. Fuel prices contributed 3 points to growth, resulting in organic growth of 19%. The impact of FX was not material in the quarter. We grew adjusted EBITDA by almost 15% to $307 million. Pro forma for spin-off, this was a third quarter record for us, and it reflects strong growth and execution in our Brokerage and Other Services segment. Excluding real estate gains, our year-over-year adjusted EBITDA growth was 25%. For the quarter, our adjusted EBITDA margin, excluding gains from real estate sales, was 9.2%, an improvement of 20 basis points year-over-year. Both of our segments, Brokerage and Other Services and North American LTL, contributed to our growth. In our brokerage segment, adjusted EBITDA increased by 46% in the third quarter. And in our LTL segment, adjusted EBITDA, excluding gains from real estate, was up year-over-year by 2%. Operating conditions in the quarter were favorable, with robust consumer activity and an ongoing rebound in the industrial sector, as well as a firm pricing environment. This was partially offset by cost pressures, especially on the purchased transportation line and by the impact of labor and equipment shortages. Matt will provide additional color on our segment performance in a few minutes. Our adjusted earnings were $0.94 per diluted share, which was up from $0.42 per diluted share from a year ago, an increase of 124%. This year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher EBITDA, lower interest expense and lower tax rate. We generated $250 million of cash flow from continuing operations, spent $77 million on gross CapEx and received $12 million of proceeds from asset sales. As a result, our free cash flow was a very robust $185 million. This exceeded our expectations for the quarter, driven by strong earnings as well as CapEx and working capital timing that worked in our favor. We are executing our strategy of driving shareholder value as a pure-play transportation company. On a trailing 12-month basis, total company return on invested capital was 33%, with the North American LTL segment above that. Given this return profile, we are increasing our CapEx in LTL, primarily with plans to add additional doors and purchase equipment to support expanded door capacity. Our cash balance at September 30 was $254 million after paying down $1.5 billion of debt in the quarter. This cash, combined with available debt capacity under committed borrowing facilities, gave us over $1.2 billion of liquidity at quarter end. We had no borrowing outstanding under our ABL facility. Maintaining strong liquidity will continue to be a top priority for us. Our net leverage at September 30 was 2.8x adjusted EBITDA for the last 12 months. Following the spin-off of GXO, we used the $794 million dividend from GXO and $384 million in net proceeds from our equity offering, along with cash on hand, to repay all our outstanding senior notes due in 2023 and 2024, a total redemption of over $1.5 billion. For the full year, we have reduced our gross debt by approximately $3 billion. We have begun to benefit from lower interest expense this year, and our interest expense will decline by another $60 million on a year-over-year basis for 2022. We now have no significant debt maturities until 2025. We'll continue to delever our balance sheet through free cash flow generation and adjusted EBITDA growth. Our progress on deleveraging is important in the context of our target to achieve net leverage in the range of 1x to 2x adjusted EBITDA by the first half of 2023 and our commitment to achieve an investment-grade rating. Turning to the outlook we issued yesterday after market close. We updated our full year guidance in light of our strong third quarter results and the favorable economic trends we see today. Our outlook assumes this trend will continue, and the market impacts of labor and equipment shortages don't get worse. The raise in our full year adjusted EBITDA includes a fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA target of $300 million to $305 million. On the cash flow front, our new outlook is for full year free cash flow of $425 million to $475 million. We expect gross CapEx to be $375 million to $400 million and net CapEx to be $250 million to $275 million for the year. The updated full year pro forma depreciation and amortization guidance is $390 million to $395 million, and there is no change to pro forma interest expense of approximately $200 million. We expect our reported interest expense for the year to be approximately $230 million. Our full year tax rate is now expected to be 24% to 26%, which is an increase of 1% versus our previous guidance, driven by discrete items and nondeductible expenses. Our average share count forecast for the year remains unchanged at approximately 114 million diluted common shares, and we expect to end the year at approximately 116 million diluted common shares. The full year adjusted EPS guidance on a pro forma basis is now $4.15 to $4.25. The change in our adjusted EPS range reflects higher EBITDA and an increase in tax rate. In conclusion, we had a transformative third quarter with the spin-off of our logistics segment, and we are enthusiastic about our prospects as a transportation leader in the markets we serve. I will now turn things over to Matt."

            "name": "Mario Harik",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt. I'm going to focus my comments on 2 areas of LTL, where we're bringing a lot of fresh initiatives to the table. One is the action plan we began executing in October and the other is our strategy to accelerate growth going forward by making targeted investments in the business. As you know, we had some year-over-year erosion in our operating ratio, despite reporting our highest third quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA ex real estate. I want to be clear that we know exactly why we fell short on our operating ratio, and we're taking a number of specific actions to get it back on track. I'll walk you through it. As you know, we've had an ongoing strategy of in-sourcing third-party linehaul transportation to use our own capacity. This strategy has worked well for us for years, but the third quarter was a tough time to be in-sourcing, particularly given the ongoing labor and equipment shortages. This impacted our network efficiency and reduced the amount of available capacity. Short-term, we'll be taking a more balanced approach to our linehaul needs. We understand the problem, and we own the solution. I took over as acting President in October, and we immediately began executing on a 5-point action plan. All of our initiatives are underway. First, we're improving network flow with selective embargoes, where we limit the freight we accept at certain terminals for short periods of time. We're working one-on-one with those terminal teams to clear the way for more volume. The short-term cost is embedded in our guidance. Second, we're driving multiple pricing initiatives to improve yield, capitalizing on the firm industry pricing environment. For example, we pulled forward the general rate increase from January to November. That's a 5.9% increase that went into effect at the beginning of this week. And we're instituting accessorials to enforce appropriate charges for trailers that get detained at their drop-off points. The same holds true for loads that require special handling, like oversized freight or irregular dimensions. If the nature of the freight means we can't fully optimize our trailer, we'll get paid more for that. Our pricing actions are already paying dividends, and we saw strong yield performance in October. Third, we're ramping up the attendance at our XPO driver training schools to help mitigate the driver shortage. This year, we'll have 800 graduates in the U.S., and we're targeting more than double that number next year. And fourth, on the equipment side, we have an XPO-specific solution to our most immediate need, which is trailers. We have a major edge here and it's going to get bigger starting in 2022. We're investing to significantly increase our production capacity at our company-owned trailer manufacturing facility in Arkansas. We expect to nearly double the number of units produced in 2022. And fifth, as Brad mentioned, while all these initiatives are underway, we're also embarking on a 2-year plan to expand our U.S. network by about 900 doors or approximately 6%. Over the next 12 to 24 months, we'll make strategic investments in the business and our top 10 metro markets. We'll add doors across the network where they can improve our operating efficiency and grow our revenue and yield while benefiting as many customers as possible. We're in the middle of the planning process, so we'll have more color on this when we give you our outlook next quarter. We expect to add at least half of the 900 doors in 2022. That covers the plan we launched in October and our strategic investments in the business, and we will continue to focus on rolling out new technology to drive value in LTL. LTL pricing is front and center in our tech agenda. It's our biggest opportunity to accelerate yield in the long-term. We're building out our data-driven tools to optimize rates for small accounts, and we use elasticity models to identify the best pricing. Another big opportunity is network optimization and linehaul, where our annual spend is about $1.1 billion ex fuel. Our goal is to reduce the number of miles required to process a given amount of volume in our network. And we're automating the load-building process to get higher trailer utilization. The next area is pickup and delivery, where we launched new planning tools earlier this year and have upcoming launches of new dispatch tools and dynamic routing enhancements. Our goal is to increase the number of stops per route and the average volume per route. Our other big focus is dock productivity. Our XPO Smart productivity tools are in place across our network, and they have had an immediate positive impact that should gain traction when the labor market settles down. Another area where we can enhance dock productivity is through door planning, which is how we position trailers on the dock to minimize worker movements. We have additional developments underway for LTL on the technology front, including a new web portal a new API features for our customers. And finally, you may have seen the recent press coverage of our new hub in Chicago Heights. This terminal has significantly increased our capacity in a key metro area, and it will drive efficiencies across our network. It's a state-of-the-art facility with 264 doors and 150,000 square feet, and it employs around 250 people. All of our drivers are held to strict safety standards, but I'll mentioned that 25 of the drivers based in Chicago Heights have an amazing safety track record of driving either 1 million or 2 million miles accident-free. More doors mean more top-line growth, more efficiencies and more yields flowing to the bottom line for our shareholders. This is the same strategy that's driving our capital investment plan moving forward. Our North American LTL business delivers a high return on invested capital, and we're extremely bullish about this opportunity to unlock more potential. I'll close with a personal comment. I've spent a lot of time in the field over the last month, and it's very exciting to work in the trenches with our first-class LTL organization. I'm impressed by how deeply this team cares about serving our customers and how quickly they've embraced our action plan. These are the folks with their ear to the ground, and there's a lot of positive energy driving the future of this business. As we take actions to course correct our network, in the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted operating ratio to track typical seasonal trends. This implies year-over-year erosion, similar to or slightly greater than what we saw in the third quarter. We expect to inflect back toward year-over-year improvement in the first half of 2022. We look forward to driving significant positive developments in LTL in the coming year. We're continuing to target at least $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA in 2022. And we have a strong conviction that we'll generate hundreds of additional basis points of improvement in our operating ratio in the long-term. With that, we're going to take your questions. Operator, please open the line. Yes. Thanks, Hamzah. So when we look at the third quarter, despite having a record EBITDA and revenue, we underperformed on OR, so we had erosion of 190 basis points versus a lot of our peers that had improvements in their OR. Now I mentioned in the opening remarks that we, as a carrier, have a higher dependency on purchased transportation. So these are -- we call them internally highway subservice miles, where last year in Q3, we had roughly 26% of our miles were highway subservice. And we continued a long-term strategy to in-source highway subservice, which has fared well for us in the past, but it was a tough time to do this in a quarter where you have obviously labor shortages and equipment shortages, which put pressure on our linehaul network, and that caused our network to become less efficient, and the network flow was not as efficient as we would have liked it to be, which effectively increases the cost of being able to fulfill the service we expect. And it also reduced the amount of capacity we have in the network. So, when you combine these things, we -- this is kind of where we saw that OR erosion. Now, we have an action plan, as I mentioned in the opening remarks. It's a 5-point action plan to address this issue. Number one, it's around the strategic embargoes, where for a selective number of sites, we meter the amount of freight that we are getting from our customers in those sites to improve the network flow. And we've seen great results so far; great feedback from the field. I've been spending a lot of time in our terminals over the last month, and it's good to see the impact that this is having in our operation. The second area is around yield. Although we had record yield in the quarter, which is a 6% year-over-year improvement, and it accelerated from 4.5% in Q2, it still needed to be higher. We didn't move as quickly as we should have on raising prices on our customers, and we are taking action on this. So, we already are seeing a very nice improvement in October of our yield performance. And the actions we took there, one was on contract renewals. We've seen a higher percentage on yield improvement there. We are charging our customers accessorials when they detain our trailers, so we can get more of that equipment back into our fleet. We are also charging them whenever they are shipping something that is irregular or long or doesn't fit our network and doesn't allow us to optimize our trailers as well. And then we pulled our general rate increase from early next year -- usually we do it in Q1 -- to this Monday to also capitalize on the local accounts, getting more yield improvement there. Now, the third area has really 3 components to it, which is adding capacity to our network. So when we think about capacity, it's about drivers, it's about equipment and it's about physical terminals, so doors and actual -- the physical space where we move the goods. On the driver side, we have a competitive edge with our driver school, and we're investing more into these driver schools where, this year, we're going to graduate roughly double the number of drivers we had done in 2019. And we are looking to further double that number going into 2022. So that's going to be a solution for us to add more drivers to our driver ranks and help counter some of the driver shortages we're seeing in the industry. On the equipment side, our biggest need is around trailers. So when you have inefficiency in your network, effectively, you need more trailer space to be able to -- and when you in-source also purchased transportation, you need more trailers. And we \u2013 I was in our Searcy, Arkansas facility last week, and we're investing more CapEx, adding more production lines to be able to double the production of trailers going into 2022, as well. And the last aspect of the action plan, which is more of a medium- to long-term growth strategy, is focused on adding doors in the markets where we are seeing higher demand from our customers. These are typically the key metro markets, and then investing in the physical footprint of adding terminals and expanding terminals from a doors perspective, and we're adding roughly 6% more doors than what we have today in the network over the next 12 to 24 months, so we can handle more of our customers' freight and capitalize on the hot market we're seeing in LTL. But that hopefully gives you a good color on what happened one in Q3, the action plans we're taking to course-correct that moving forward and pivoting toward the growth strategy, as well. You got it, Chris. This is Mario. When we think about excess capacity, we roughly have about 15% excess capacity when it comes to the terminal footprint. However, it's not evenly distributed. And so there are pinch points in certain markets, and when we think about our plan going into next year, opening up the additional 6% of doors, we are looking at metro markets where we are seeing higher demand from our customers. And we already cover more than 99% of the zip codes in the country, so we have line of sight to the demand in the many of these markets. And in those markets where we do have pinch points is where we're going to either opening terminals or adding doors as we head into 2022. Now the physical capacity is one aspect. However, obviously, the 2 other aspects of capacity are drivers and equipment. And as we all know, the driver shortage has been impacting our industry significantly, and this is where we are doubling down on both our recruiting efforts and our driver schools to graduate more drivers to fill the gap there on the short term. Now the second part of your question on linehaul. So typically, the way linehaul works, when you in-source purchased transportation, you effectively break one longer haul that you're doing with a third-party carrier into smaller hops in the network. So when you have a driver shortage in some parts of these segments, effectively, you add to either linehaul miles, where you are diverting trailers to another facility, or you add cost on rehandling on the dock as well. So that's the dynamic when you have an imbalance in the driver -- when you have a driver shortage and you have an imbalance. And while we kept on in-sourcing purchased transportation, that impacted our capacity in certain markets where we didn't have enough capacity to meet our customer demand. Yes. I'll give you color kind of what early in the quarter looks like. So one on the yield side, the pricing actions we have taken have shown a very nice acceleration of yield improvement year-over-year in October. However, tonnage with the embargo actions we've taken to meter some of the freight, and as we take this corrective action, we would expect tonnage to be soft in the fourth quarter as we are taking those corrective actions. And when we look going into next year, as we clear the way for more volume and add more of that capacity on the driver side then on the trailer side, we expect to have an inflection point in the first half of the year on both OR improvement and volume improvement as well. Yes. So let's start with the first part of the question on purchased transportation. So on the short-term, and this goes from this quarter -- Q4 and going into Q1 \u2013 we are taking a more balanced approach on purchased transportation. So, we are analyzing on a lane-by-lane basis. We all know what's happening in the truckload market rates. So, these rates have gone significantly up. So, we are going lane-by-lane and analyzing what could be the cost to outsource that to a third-party versus using our own drivers for it, and tying it back to the demand we're seeing from our customers in those markets. So, on the short-term, we're going to take a more balanced approach on purchased transportation that leans towards adding more purchased transportation, if the rates are right and depending on which lanes we can get a good rate. So as an example, if you look at outbound from Southern California today, the rates are just completely out of typical market norm, given the tightness we're seeing in that market. However, other parts of the country, like in the Midwest or the Northeast, you would have much more desirable rates on the truckload side. On the long-term, our strategy to in-source purchased transportation will continue. So, as we clear the way to adding more drivers and more equipment, we do believe that we want to handle more of the linehaul network on our own equipment with our own drivers, but that's going to be back on the long-term strategy. Now in the -- going back to our guidance \u2013- or, our targets for next year, we are targeting at least $1 billion of EBITDA for the full year 2022. When it comes to OR, we will give more color on that going into the next \u2013- so, on the next earnings call, we'll give a bit more color on what we expect on the OR improvement for the year to hit that number. Yes. So going -- when you look at OR going into Q4, so we expect the fourth quarter to have typical seasonal trends coming from Q3, which again will make the year-over-year erosion similar or slightly greater to what we saw in Q3. Now the dynamics of the quarter, as you said, so we're seeing already a very nice improvement for yield in October based on the actions that we have taken so far, on all the things I mentioned earlier on with accessorials, with the higher contract renewals, with all the different pieces there. However, with the embargoes we implemented in October, that effectively created a drag for us in October when it comes to volume. So the dynamic of the quarter will be you would see higher yield, you would see softer volume, and that will contribute to what our OR target looks like for the quarter. Listen, when we look at the current market, it's a pretty firm pricing market. So there is more demand in the market than there is capacity in the market. And then we believe -- the way the GRI works for us, it impacts our local accounts. And we also have spent a lot of time with our sales team to get that feedback on where we need to be. And we felt that, that was the right action to take. We haven't, so far, heard any pushback or negative feedback from customers. They understand that in this market, there's cost inflation in terms of driver wages and getting equipment and all the things that they see in their supply chains. So it's been pretty well received so far. Yes. First, thanks, Ravi. And as you said, I've been very involved in our LTL business in all the technology initiatives that we have been rolling out. And if you go back over the last 5 years, we've improved our operating ratio by 1,000 basis points and nearly tripled the profitability of this business, and tech had a big component to play in that. Now going forward, I mean, obviously, in the role of running the business, I have much more impact in terms of accelerating some of these initiatives and getting them out in the field on the medium to long run. And if I break it down, the biggest opportunity continues to be in pricing, where pricing is all about using price elasticity to better understand where customers are willing to pay in a high elasticity model with a firm pricing environment. And to give you an example, in our brokerage business where we've had 10 years of experience using machine learning to optimize pricing, you can see that evident in how well we price and the margins that we are getting on that business as well. So we continue to believe there's a lot of opportunity in pricing and improving technology there. The second area is around linehaul. When we think about linehaul, there's roughly $1.1 billion worth of spend ex fuel, and it's an area that the more -- so 1% improvement, obviously, is $11 million of EBITDA. And we have improved, we already have good technology there, and we're going to continue to improve that. A lot of it is optimizing the load building process and where we put, for example, freight within a trailer to reduce the amount of rehandles we're seeing in the network as an example there. The third area is around pick up in delivery. We launched new planning tools earlier this year. These were tools that allowed our planners -- it's all web-based, just beautiful-looking user interfaces, easy to use, and that helps our planners do a better job in their P&D routes. And we're in the process now of launching our new dispatch tools and then, going into next year, launching additional route enhancements that would allow us to increase the amount of weight we're putting in a certain trip or increase the number of stops on a certain trip as well. And then the next area is around dock productivity. So as I mentioned in my opening remarks, Smart is already deployed in all of our terminals. And Smart allows us to make sure we have the right amount of dock workers for the amount of work that we need to do. And we're also now launching a new technology that allows us to better position trailers on the docks, so we can minimize worker movements between the doors, so we can improve efficiency by minimizing travel on the dock as well. Then finally, with customers. I spend a lot of time with customers. A lot of their feedback is -- we are launching new API technology that is making our integration with customers go easier. A new web portal, we're currently in pilot. We're very excited about it, and we're getting great feedback from customers on it. So we're definitely accelerating the tech agenda. And similar to what we've done in brokerage of getting outsized results driven by technology. We believe that the LTL business will continue to use tech to better optimize the business. Yes. You got it. So as I mentioned earlier, as we had the long-term strategy to in-source our purchased transportation, but when we think through the summer, especially with the COVID variant picking up and the driver shortage, effectively, that wasn't the right time. It was a tough time to be in-sourcing purchased transportation. So we -- when we in-source that, we effectively move drivers in our network between city and linehaul operations, but there wasn't enough drivers given the shortage. So it was too quick of a move in a market where you have a driver shortage. So moving forward, as we pivot from that, so one, we're going to take a more balanced approach to look at -- depending on the rate for certain HSS lanes, or purchased transportation lanes, we're going to make the right decision for the business on the short term. And also we're accelerating our driver hiring. Now I mentioned driver schools earlier on. If we look -- obviously, when we think about hiring drivers, that includes both hiring externally as well as internally. And this is where we're doubling down on both of these. I mentioned already doubling the number of drivers we're getting from our driver schools this year versus '19, obviously, and it was roughly 6x what it was versus last year and doubling that going to next year. And we're also doubling down on our efforts where we're adding -- increasing the size of our recruiting team. We're using social media. We're adding benefits for -- between referrals or starting bonuses in some markets for drivers to capture that portion of it. Now for us -- but going back to Q3, September really was the pivot point where we've seen the threshold of drivers versus how much we had in-sourced on purchased transportation hit a bottleneck that caused the network to become inefficient. And when that happened, we effectively didn't have enough capacity to pick up customers' freight and that created cost inefficiencies in the network as well. So on a Q3 basis, it was 26% to 24%, and it was roughly around the same in terms of year-over-year in Q2 as well."

With me today in Greenwich are Ravi Tulsyan, our CFO; Matt Fassler, our Chief Strategy Officer; and Mario Harik, our CIO and acting President of LTL. We also have Drew Wilkerson, who leads our North American transportation group, joining us for Q&A. As you saw from our press release, the company overall had an excellent third quarter. We beat expectations for revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow, and raised our full year guidance by more than the beat. We now have 2 reporting segments following the spin-off of GXO. The largest service offering in our Brokerage and Other Services segment is North American truck brokerage, which had another remarkable quarter. Our North American LTL segment had mixed results, and we're actively course-correcting. Highlights of the quarter company-wide include a year-over-year increase in revenue of 22%. We also grew adjusted EBITDA, excluding real estate, by 25%. Our revenue was the highest of any quarter in our history, and our adjusted EBITDA was a third quarter record, marking the fifth consecutive quarter we've raised the bar on this metric. In North American truck brokerage, we continue to significantly outperform the market in growth of gross revenue, net revenue and volume. Year-over-year, we grew volume with our top 20 customers in total by 45%. We also significantly increased productivity, growing loads at nearly twice the rate of headcount. The largest driver of this productivity is our technology, specifically our XPO Connect digital brokerage platform, which continues to have very high levels of industry adoption. Matt will give you the growth numbers behind XPO Connect, including the number of carriers we have on the platform and the carrier usage, customer count and cumulative downloads. In LTL, we delivered record third quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA ex real estate gains and our strongest yield growth yet, up 6% ex fuel. But our adjusted operating ratio ex real estate eroded by 190 basis points year-over-year. Mario will cover this in detail later on the call. Many of you know Mario from his 10 years with XPO. He's one of the most talented executives I've ever worked with, and one of the first leaders I hired at the company. Mario and I have worked shoulder to shoulder on every major project since. Today, he'll talk about the 5-point action plan we've taken to return to our trajectory in LTL of significant multiyear operating ratio improvement. This includes how we're addressing shortages of equipment and labor using XPO-specific capabilities like trailer manufacturing and in-house driver schools. We're also moving to the next phase of our strategy in LTL for shareholder value creation. Over the next 12 to 24 months, we plan to add approximately 900 doors to our LTL network, which equates to about 6% more doors than we have now. We believe these targeted investments will enhance network-wide operating efficiency and support future revenue growth. And notably, our LTL segment has superlative return on invested capital, making it an ideal use of shareholder resources. We continue to target at least $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA in LTL in 2022. In conclusion, we delivered a number of key financial achievements in the quarter company-wide and in each of our segments. And once again, we raised our guidance for full year 2021. Finally, we were delighted to pay down $1.5 billion of debt in the quarter, moving us closer to our goal of an investment-grade rating. I'll now hand over to Ravi to discuss our results and our balance sheet. On the second question, the M&A, while I don't want to get into specifics of what we may or may not be doing on non-core parts of the business, to answer your question, the obvious advantage, if we chose to go that path is it would accelerate our getting to our goal of becoming investment grade. I was very happy that we paid down $1.5 billion of debt this quarter. That was a real good move toward getting investment grade, but we have more ways to go. So if we chose to go down that path, it would just accelerate it. With respect to your first question, we listen to our shareholders, and we listen to them very closely. Sometimes, we hear most of what they say, not all of what they say. So, we heard 2 things that investors told us over the last year. One was reduce your debt. So, we're making huge progress on that. Second was simplify the business model. The spin accomplished that. So, I think we heard those 2 things, loud and clear, and we acted on them. The third point, I don't know if we heard it so well, which was you need to grow your LTL business -- not just sweat the assets and grow the margin and get great returns on capital, but grow top line. So, we have heard that now, and that is something we are going to do. Now, with respect to the third quarter, I would say this: Even great companies stumble now and then. And we certainly did not stumble company-wide. We beat and we raised. So, I rest my case there. We certainly did not stumble in Europe. The numbers were great. It would be very difficult to make an argument that we stumbled in truck brokerage, since we have industry-leading results there. We stumbled in LTL. We were focused on other things and didn't keep our eye on the ball there. We do have our arms around the issues there. We have been intensely focusing on this in the last 3 or 4 weeks, and we will continue to intensely focus on this. With respect to your question about what's the level of urgency, we love solving problems -- that's how we create alpha. We have a tremendous track record of creating significant shareholder value over the long-term for our investors. And we will course-correct this LTL with a great level of urgency, and I'm confident we will. Well, Todd, I think service levels for the entire industry, not just the LTL industry, but globally, transportation, wasn't functioning at peak efficiency in recent months due to the significant upsurge in volume, yet the shortages of labor and equipment, and we were not immune to that either. With respect to what the short-term impacts will be on tonnage, the embargoes that we do selectively, they slow down tonnage a little bit here and there. The raising yield, okay, there's some elasticity on that. But overall, you'll see in the coming quarters a shift to growing the revenue line -- not immediately, but you will see that shift slowly and steadily growing the revenue line. And you'll see us investing more in CapEx, and you'll see us be more aggressive on raising rates. You'll see us being more aggressive on enforcing accessorials. So, there's a whole slew of initiatives we've got in place, and Mario summarized the top ones, that will allow us to regain our position in LTL. I don't see the service metrics for the competition, so it's hard to compare them. But I would say that the industry as a whole suffered as a result of the shortages of equipment, shortages of labor and the big influxes of volumes. And in a network business, in that part of the transportation supply chain, that suffers a little bit more because it's a network -- you tickle it here and it laughs there; you pinch it here and it cries there. I will say that we've got 25,000 loyal customers in LTL, and customers choose carriers that meet their service expectations. My personal opinion is everyone should get vaccinated. I think the evidence is very clear that people who are vaccinated get infected less. And when they do get infected less, they get hospitalized less than nonvaccinated people. And for sure, the data shows that if you're vaccinated, you die less. So there's very compelling reasons to get vaccinated. Having said that, there's a lot of resistance from a lot of people to get vaccinated. And one, the government needs to take into consideration the practical ramifications of policy. And in the trucking industry, in particular, there's probably a little bit higher percentage of people who are anti-vaxxers, so to speak. And if that policy went in right away, it probably would not, short-term at least, have a good effect. You'd see a lot of labor leave the market. So, that's my overall view. I think we will continue to take share. I think the investments we've made in XPO Connect over the last decade have been consistently paying off, and we've been outperforming the market and outperforming the market in brokerage by a significant amount. If you look in this particular quarter, our loads are up 37%. And if you look at the volume from our top 20 customers, it's up 45% year-over-year. If you look at our net revenue, it was up 62%. And you look at XPO Connect specifically, year-over-year carrier is up 37%. Carrier usage has doubled. Customer count is up 3x year-over-year. You look at the API-driven transactions, they're up fivefold year-over-year. So XPO Connect is working very, very well, and that's enabling us to meet customer demands, to meet them where they want to transact with us. So XPO Connect is very, very sticky. And 77% of the carriers who do business with us on Connect, come back within 30 days and do more business with us. So it's a virtuous cycle. Now with respect to your question about allocating resources. In terms of CapEx, truck brokerage doesn't need much CapEx. It's really just the IT and some of the overhead, which is really not even CapEx, it's OpEx. So it just doesn't need a lot of CapEx. The real place we're going to put CapEx in is going to be on LTL, so that we can do what our shareholders have told us, which is to grow, grow in LTL. For that, we've got to invest in it. So that's what we'll do. Thank you. So I'll leave you with 4 points. In LTL in the third quarter, it obviously was not our finest hour. However, we have our arms around the issue, and we're dealing with it with great urgency, and I'm confident that we will achieve our goals there. In terms of truck brokerage, we're just continuing to kill it in truck brokerage. The tech investments over the last decade are clearly paying off. The biggest -- the third point I'd point out is the pricing environment. Inflation is not a good thing for consumers, but it's not necessarily a bad thing for companies within the supply chain, assuming you can raise your pricing in excess of your price inflation, which we should be able to do. So we should be benefiting from the firm pricing environment, and we've seen ourselves be able to execute that in Europe. We've seen ourselves being able to execute that in brokerage and all the lines of business within brokerage. And we are now going to push the pedal to the metal on exerting pricing power in LTL. And the fourth point I would end with is, I'm just very delighted that we paid off $1.5 billion of debt in the quarter, and we've made great progress towards our goal of becoming investment grade. So with that, I thank everyone for participating in this call, and we'll be talking to you all in due course. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks, Ravi. I'll review our third quarter operating results, starting with North American LTL. We grew revenue by 15% year-over-year. Excluding fuel, we grew revenue by 10% year-over-year. We grew tonnage per day by 3% year-over-year. Our tonnage trends tracked typical seasonality in July and August, but trailed in September. Our rate per shipment increased 4% year-over-year, with the increase broad-based across verticals. Shipments fell slightly by 0.6% year-over-year. Our retail and e-commerce vertical was strong, reflecting a strong consumer economy and our expanding footprint in the consumer space. Our 1- to 2-day service offering is attractive to consumer-facing verticals. We see substantial room for further recovery in industrial and especially in automotive, though tonnage did rise nominally in both of these verticals. The pricing environment remained firm. Yield, excluding fuel, rose 6% year-over-year. This is our biggest year-over-year yield improvement since we acquired Con-way in 2015. Price increases on contract renewals were 8%, consistent with Q2. Revenue per shipment, excluding fuel, grew 10%. This reflected the increases that we saw in both yield and weight per shipment. Our LTL adjusted operating ratio was 83.9%. Excluding real estate gains, our adjusted OR was 84.4%, which was 190 basis points higher than the third quarter a year ago. The erosion in adjusted OR mirrored the impact of the higher cost of purchased transportation, which, when measured as a percent of revenue, increased about 200 basis points year-over-year. This increase was driven largely by higher truckload rates. In fact, we reduced our use of third-party transportation year-over-year, as we have for some time. In-sourcing this volume in an environment constrained by shortages of labor and equipment impacted our efficiency. We've already taken steps to address this dynamic going forward. Also, through a number of pricing actions, our yield growth in October accelerated meaningfully. Mario will offer additional details on our strategic plans for LTL. We have enormous opportunity for outsized growth in the years ahead. With the spin, we've allocated our lines of business other than North American LTL into a new segment, Brokerage and Other Services. North American truck brokerage is our largest revenue and profit driver among our lines of business in this segment. Our third quarter truck brokerage results were outstanding as we gained share and delivered outsized profit improvement. Our loads per day increased by 37% versus a year ago, holding steady with our growth in the second quarter. And once again, we sharply outpaced the market. On a year-over-year basis, we generated a 62% increase in both revenue and net revenue. Net revenue per load increased 18% year-on-year. The truckload market remains exceptionally tight as shippers seek capacity and visibility to their freight movements. Our digital brokerage platform, XPO Connect, is helping us drive tremendous volume at excellent margins. Carrier and customer adoption of XPO Connect continues to surge. We exceeded 550,000 cumulative downloads of our Drive XPO mobile app as of the third quarter, nearly tripling the cumulative number of downloads year-over-year. We topped 90,000 registered carrier accounts on the platform, up 37% year-over-year. Average weekly usage by carriers more than doubled, and the number of customer accounts on the platform more than tripled. Our North American truck brokerage profitability was very strong, and we leveraged our 62% net revenue growth into stronger adjusted EBITDA growth in brokerage. Looking at overall segment results from brokerage and other services, revenue rose 27%, while adjusted EBITDA rose 46%. The adjusted EBITDA margin for this segment rose to 5.8% from 5.1% a year ago. I want to mention a couple of recognitions that are particularly gratifying. We were recently named a top company for women to work for by the Women in Trucking Association, and we received both the Ford Excellence Award for treating customers like family and an award from Ulta Beauty for commitment to continuous improvement. Now, I'll turn it over to Mario for a further discussion of North American LTL. It's Matt. In the short run, we expect the macro conditions that we see today, including all of the realities that we see in terms of labor and capacity. We do assume that, over the course of 2022, there's some normalization on both of those fronts. But to be clear, the key to us getting to those numbers, we understand, is achieving the goals that we've set in the 5-point action plan, particularly with relationship to network efficiency and network flow in the short run and achieving the results that we expect on head count and equipment from the initiatives that we outlined earlier."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. Before the call begins, let me read a brief statement on behalf of the company regarding forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. During this call, the company will be making certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the applicable securities laws, which by their nature involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. A discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in the company\u2019s SEC filings. The forward-looking statements in the company\u2019s earnings release or made on this call are made only as of today and the company has no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements, except to the extent required by law. During this call, the company also may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined under applicable SEC rules. Reconciliations of such non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are contained in the company\u2019s earnings release and related financial tables are on its website. You can find a copy of the company\u2019s earnings release, which contains additional important information regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures in the Investors section on the company\u2019s website. I will now turn the call over to Brad Jacobs. Mr. Jacobs, you may begin.\nBrad Jacobs: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our call. With me today in Greenwich are David Wyshner, our CFO; Matt Fassler, our Chief Strategy Officer; and Mark Manduca, the Chief Investment Officer of GXO, our planned logistics spin-off. As you saw yesterday, we delivered the highest revenue and adjusted EBITDA in our history. It was the highest company-wide and in each of our Transportation and Logistics segments. We generated over $5 billion of revenue and over $0.5 billion of adjusted EBITDA. It was the third consecutive quarter. We reported record revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Not only did we solidly beat all expectations, we surpassed a great first quarter with an even better second quarter. It gives both our segments a powerful springboard for profitable growth as separate public companies. Customer activity has more than come back from 2020. And we\u2019re executing extremely well across the business. Yesterday, we raised the midpoint of our 2021 EBITDA guidance for the combined company by more than the second quarter beat. And we raised the pro forma EBITDA guidance for both XPO and GXO. Every area of the business is showing strength. In North American LTL, we\u2019re continuing to expand our operating margin primarily through company specific technology initiatives. As a result, our second quarter adjusted operating ratio ex-real estate gains was our best operating ratio yet. In truck brokerage, we\u2019re continuing to outperform the industry. This is due in no small part to the rapid adoption of our XPO Connect digital platform by customers and carriers. Our Logistics segment delivered the second consecutive quarter of double-digit organic revenue growth. The new contracts we talked about on our last earnings call have been followed by more wins in the second quarter and a constant inflow of new opportunities. I\u2019m confident that the spin-off of this business will unlock the full potential of both GXO and XPO. After we ring the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange on Monday, GXO will start trading as the largest pure-play contract logistics company in the world. This is a business with a rare combination of attributes. GXO is an industry leader with massive revenue tailwinds, double-digit EBITDA growth, long-term contractual relationships with blue-chip customers and importantly, a 28% return on invested capital. XPO will be a pure-play transportation company with an LTL business that is on track to generate at least $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA in 2022 and a booming truck brokerage business with a fast growing digital platform. I want to take this opportunity to thank David for his service as Chief Financial Officer. As we announced yesterday, David will be leaving in September after a seamless handoff to Ravi Tulsyan, our Deputy CFO. David has made many significant contributions to XPO's success as a member of our executive team. I particularly want to thank him for his strong leadership during COVID and throughout the spin-off process. I have no doubt David will continue to be successful in this next step of his career. And now he\u2019ll take you through the numbers. David?\nDavid Wyshner: Thank you for those comments, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Today, I\u2019d like to discuss our second quarter results, our balance sheet and liquidity and our updated outlook for 2021. I\u2019ll be presenting most numbers on a status quo pre-spin basis with post-spin breakouts between XPO and GXO where appropriate, as we anticipate the completion of the spin-off on Monday. In the second quarter, we generated revenue of $5 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $507 million. The revenue number reflects a year-over-year increase of more than 40%. Adjusted EBITDA nearly tripled compared to our Q2 results last year when COVID was at its worst. And both revenue and adjusted EBITDA are higher than we expected at the beginning of the quarter. Our record adjusted EBITDA reflects strong growth and continued execution across our business. In this case, it\u2019s also useful to compare our results to the second quarter of 2019, which takes COVID out of the base period. On a two-year stacked basis, our revenue and our adjusted EBITDA are both up double-digits. Breaking down our 44% year-over-year revenue growth in the quarter, our UK logistics acquisition in January contributed 4 points of growth, foreign exchange contributed 5 points and fuel prices contributed 4 points. As a result, our organic revenue growth in the quarter was 31%. This top line growth translated into even stronger adjusted EBITDA growth of 195% and our EBITDA margin rebounded to 10%. COVID had a much more limited impact this year compared to last. As a consequence, our second quarter results this year with $0.5 billion of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter are much more representative of our earnings power. As Brad mentioned, both of our segments made a strong contribution to our growth and achieved record levels of quarterly adjusted EBITDA. In our Logistics segment, adjusted EBITDA doubled in the second quarter. And in our Transportation segment, adjusted EBITDA was up year-over-year by 168%. Operating conditions in the quarter were favorable with robust consumer demand and a rebound in industrial activity. The global microchip shortage did impact our transportation operations. We estimate that it reduced our EBITDA by around $10 million in the second quarter. On the other hand, our results benefited from the operating leverage inherent in our business and the cost reduction actions we took last year. Matt and Mark will review our segment detail in a few minutes. Our adjusted earnings were $1.86 per diluted share, which is a quarterly record for us. We generated $366 million of cash flow from operations in the second quarter, spent $110 million on gross CapEx and receive $26 million of proceeds from asset sales. As a result, we generated free cash flow of $282 million. This exceeded our expectations for the quarter driven by our strong earnings, as well as some CapEx and working capital timing that worked in our favor. Maintaining strong liquidity continues to be a top priority for us as an organization. Our cash balance at June 30 was $801 million. This cash combined with available debt capacity under committed borrowing facilities give us nearly $2 billion of liquidity at quarter end. We had no borrowings outstanding under our ABL facility. We used a $128 million of cash in the quarter to repurchase the remaining 3% of our European operations held by public shareholders. While this transaction wasn\u2019t required for the GXO spin-off. It\u2019s an economical simplifying cost saving cleanup of our capital structure that we\u2019ve wanted to do for some time. Our net leverage at June 30 was 2.4 times LTM adjusted EBITDA, down from 3.1 times in March. Our free cash flow and our EBITDA growth are helping us achieve meaningful deleveraging. Our steady progress on this metric is important in the context of our commitment to move XPO toward an investment grade rating following the spin-off of GXO. We\u2019ve stood up GXO with an investment grade capital structure. Earlier this month, GXO completed an offering of $800 million of long-term debt with a weighted average interest rate of 2.2%. We\u2019ve also put in place an undrawn $800 million revolving credit facility for GXO. Most of the proceeds from the GXO debt offering will be sent to XPO and GXO will retain about a $100 million of cash post-spin. Shortly after the spin, XPO will use the cash it receives from GXO as well as the nearly $400 million from our recent equity offering and cash on hand to repay all of our outstanding 6.125% notes due 2023 and the 6.75% notes due 2024, a total redemption of $1.5 billion that should reduce our annual interest expense by a $100 million. Following the spin, XPO\u2019s net leverage will be roughly 2.8 times 2021 pro forma adjusted EBITDA. And we will have no significant debt maturities until 2025. We believe our debt paydown will move XPO closer to investment grade. From a housekeeping perspective, let me clarify the financial information that is and will be available about GXO and post-spin XPO. GXO's historical and pro forma results are available in the Form 10. In addition, in August, GXO will file its own 10-Q and will also provide supplementary detail on its historical pro forma EBITDA by quarter. XPO will file an 8-K next week with pro forma financial information reflecting the spin-off as required. In addition, in the third quarter, we intend to provide additional details about XPO\u2019s historical results with logistics classified as a discontinued operation. And for modeling purposes, since the spin-off is of the Logistics segment, a high-level way to understand XPO\u2019s historical results adjusted for the spin is to look at the combination of our Transportation segment and corporate results. Turning to the outlook we issued yesterday. We updated our full year guidance in light of our strong second quarter results and the favorable economic trends we see today. Our outlook assumes these trends will continue and the market impacts of COVID will remain muted. On a combined basis, we\u2019ve increased our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance by $45 million at the midpoint since early May. We now expect that we would generate $1.875 billion to $1.915 billion of adjusted EBITDA this year if there was no spin, with year-over-year growth revised upward to 29% to 33% in our Logistics segment and 35% to 37% in Transportation. On a pro forma basis, as if the spin had happened on January 1, our outlook translates into $605 million to $635 million of pro forma 2021 EBITDA for GXO and $1.195 billion to $1.235 billion of pro forma EBITDA for XPO. These figures take into account the separate corporate costs of each company. In the third quarter, our year-over-year growth metrics will normalize compared to the outsized growth we reported for Q2. We expect that GXO\u2019s and XPO\u2019s adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter will both be in the mid-20s as a percentage of their respective full year pro forma EBITDA outlooks. We expect about $5 million of gains from LTL real estate sales in Q3 versus $26 million in last year\u2019s third quarter. LTL real estate gains in Q4 will be higher than they were last year. So our back half seasonality will look a little different this year compared to last. In total, we expect $55 million to $60 million of gains from LTL real estate sales this year versus $77 million last year. On the cash flow front on a combined basis, our outlook is for full year free cash flow of $650 million to $725 million excluding spin-related outlays. We also continue to target approximately $675 million of gross capital expenditures and $525 million of net CapEx for the combined company. Of these amounts, we estimate the GXO will have roughly $245 million of CapEx and standalone XPO will have about $430 million of gross CapEx and $280 million of net CapEx. Our depreciation and amortization, interest expense and tax expense will be split among GXO and XPO as a result of the spin. We provided the details in our earnings release. And as a result of our recent primary equity offering of 2.9 million shares, we now forecast having roughly 114 million diluted common shares outstanding on average this year and roughly 116 million diluted common shares on average in the second half. We said in May that we were proceeding toward the spin-off of our logistics business with the wind at our back. Our record second quarter results have borne that out. We\u2019ve continued to grow our revenue and execute against our business plan, while we\u2019ve readied our businesses for the spin transaction. And we\u2019ve continued to serve our customers without missing a beat. As a result, GXO and XPO remain strategically well positioned to meet customer needs and capture profitable growth opportunities in logistics, LTL and brokerage. We remain enthusiastic about our prospects as a leader in the markets we serve and we look forward to completing the GXO spin-off on Monday. Lastly, on a personal note, I\u2019m incredibly grateful to have had the opportunity to work with Brad and everyone at XPO as a member of the company\u2019s senior leadership team. Helping to shepherd XPO through the pandemic and prepare for the GXO spin-off has been very gratifying. I know that Ravi, Baris and their finance teams are well positioned to drive XPO\u2019s and GXO\u2019s future progress and I wish them every success. I\u2019ll now turn things over to Matt.\nMatt Fassler: Thanks, David. I\u2019ll review the second quarter operating results for our Transportation segment and then Mark will cover Logistics. The strength we saw in LTL reflects the backdrop of improving demand, a healthy pricing environment, and importantly, the impact of our own operating initiatives, all of which have significant runway ahead. Our LTL revenue growth accelerated sharply. We grew revenue by 37% year-over-year. If we exclude fuel, we grew revenue by 31% year-over-year. It\u2019s true that we\u2019ve cycled the worst of the COVID impact in 2020, but we also gained ground on an underlying basis. As revenue per day, ex-fuel grew 10% from Q1, outpacing typical seasonality. All told, these were our strongest growth rates in LTL since we acquired the business in 2015. We grew tonnage per day by 23% year-over-year. Our sequential increase in weight per day also outpaced typical seasonality. Shipments per day rose 17%. Here, too, we outpaced typical seasonality. And it\u2019s notable that the acceleration in growth for our largest vertical, industrial and manufacturing, outpaced the pickup in retail and e-commerce. Based on comparisons to the period prior to the pandemic, there\u2019s still room for our industrial customers to regain ground as production continues to gear up. At the same time, LTL is becoming more central to the consumer ecosystem, as the growth of e-commerce creates more demand for the staging of smaller quantities of goods closer to consumers. Our weight per shipment increased 6%. This compares to 1.3% increase in the first quarter. Our 1.4% sequential increase in weight per shipment exceeded the typical seasonal trend and the pickup was broad-based across verticals. Yield, excluding fuel rose 4.5% year-over-year. Price increases on contract renewals were 8% and accelerated from Q1 with the underlying impact of the increase offset in part by higher weight per shipment. Revenue per shipment, excluding fuel grew 10.7%, accelerating sharply from the 5.5% growth we had in Q1. This reflected the acceleration we saw in both yield and weight per shipment and help to create the operating leverage we realized this quarter. Our LTL adjusted operating ratio was 80.6%. Excluding real estate gains, our adjusted OR improved to 81.1%, which was 1,030 basis points better than the second quarter a year ago. Our adjusted OR ex-real estate gains also improved sequentially, in this case by 320 basis points. And we tripled our adjusted operating income dollars ex-real estate with the year-over-year increase of 201%. The strong demand environment comes with some industry-wide challenges. Labor remains constrained across the service economy. In the U.S., we\u2019re addressing this with a series of initiatives. For example, our commercial driver training schools are set to yield a record number of graduates, totaling nearly 1,000 driver candidates for XPO. We were successful in accelerating our truck driver recruitment in Q2 with net hires for the four weeks in June at double the number in the prior eight weeks. Higher truck load rates drove a meaningful increase in our purchased transportation costs year-over-year, both in dollars and as a percent of revenue. We mitigated the rate impact by using our in-house capacity to manage the increase in activity with our own fleet, which in turn increased trailer utilization. We\u2019re also using our tech to optimize routes to the lowest cost mode. As a result, we reduced our reliance on third-party linehaul, even though, we drove substantially more tonnage through the network. Pricing remains our biggest opportunity in LTL. We automated 90% of local RFPs in the second quarter, and we\u2019re beginning to add more variables to our pricing algorithms, which we\u2019ll be refining further over the next 12 months. We also remain focused on route optimization. In pickup and delivery, pounds per hour improved by 7.4% year-over-year and on the linehaul front, we launched new control tower solutions to all terminals. We remain on track to deliver at least $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA in LTL next year, driven by both revenue growth and continued improvement in our adjusted OR. Turning to our truck brokerage business. We continue to gain share in a dynamic marketplace. Our loads in the quarter increased by 38% versus a year ago, accelerating from 23% growth in the first quarter. And once again, we sharply outpaced the market. On a year-over-year basis, we generated a 101% increase in revenue and increased net revenue by 47%, as gross margin per load increased year-on-year. Our digital brokerage platform, XPO Connect is helping us drive tremendous volume at excellent margins. Carrier and customer adoption of XPO Connect continues to surge. We reached 475,000 cumulative downloads of our Drive XPO mobile app in Q2, representing 20% growth quarter-over-quarter and tripling the cumulative number of downloads year-over-year. In Q2, we topped 85,000 registered carrier accounts on the platform, up over 40% year-over-year. Average weekly usage by carriers nearly doubled in the quarter, up 87%. And the number of customer accounts on the platform is up by more than 6 times from Q2 last year. We\u2019re also securing brokerage volumes through API technology at a profitable clip. Transactions driven by APIs and similar interfaces increased by more than 8 times in Q2 versus the prior year, as XPO Connect talked directly to our customers systems. Our brokerage profitability was very strong and we leveraged our 47% net revenue growth into stronger adjusted EBITDA growth in brokerage. The combined impact from these lines of business is a very strong performance overall by our Transportation segment in the second quarter. Year-over-year, we increased Transportation revenue by 50% and increased adjusted EBITDA by 168% to a new quarterly record. And our adjusted EBITDA margin for the Transportation segment was a robust 12.3%. After the spin, XPO will be a transportation pure play. And as David said, we raised our full year pro forma guidance for XPO adjusted EBITDA to a range of $1.195 billion to $1.235 billion. This increases our 2021 EBITDA target, pro forma for the spin, by $20 million at the midpoint from our June 9 trading update. This includes adjusted EBITDA of $574 million to $614 million for the second half of this year. I want to mention a couple of recognitions that are particularly meaningful. We recently received Intel\u2019s 2021 Supplier Achievement Award for our COVID response last year, which speaks to our culture as much as our operations. And Gartner named XPO a worldwide leader in their Magic Quadrant for 3PL providers in 2021. That\u2019s based on our vision and our ability to execute across both Transportation and Logistics. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark to discuss our Logistics segment and the outlook for its spin-off as GXO.\nMark Manduca: Thanks Matt. As the largest pure play contract logistics company, our scale puts us at the forefront of the burgeoning demand for logistics services. This is due to three secular mega-trends, outsourcing, e-commerce and warehouse automation. These three robust tailwinds continue to drive our double-digit growth, and the runway remains significant with a potential addressable market of $430 billion, of which $300 billion is yet to be outsourced. In the second quarter, we increased Logistics revenue by 34% compared with a year ago, including the Kuehne + Nagel acquisition, which contributed $151 million of revenue in the second quarter. Moreover, our year-over-year organic revenue growth rose to 16%, accelerating from 13% in the first quarter. We saw exceptionally strong growth from our customers in e-com, omnichannel retail and consumer technology. From 2016 through the end of the second quarter, we\u2019ve delivered an organic revenue CAGR of over 7%, reflecting the high-growth nature of this business. Moving to profit for the quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA of $169 million for Logistics was 104% higher than in the second quarter of last year, and 24% higher than in the second quarter of 2019. Our adjusted EBITDA margin increased 310 basis points to 9%. This was an increase of 10 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2019. On the cost side, we continue to do an excellent job, further strengthening our margin expansion by showing cost discipline and implementing our productivity initiatives. And while the labor market remains tight, we\u2019re managing it well due to the pass-through nature of our contracts. In the last three months, we\u2019ve announced the appointment of an experienced and diverse Board of Directors for GXO. Among other initiatives, our new Directors will help us solidify our ESG leadership, which is important not only to GXO, but also our blue-chip customers. At our Investor Day, we highlighted a number of key environmental goals, including a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 versus 2019, carbon neutrality by 2040 and LED lights used by at least 80% of our operations by 2025. Looking forward, our pipeline remains very strong at $2 billion of opportunity and is skewed toward high-growth consumer verticals. We announced a number of new contract wins in the first quarter. And our momentum with new business wins persisted into the second quarter with the likes of Dixons Carphone, a large technology retailer in the UK and Nike among others. These second quarter wins alone represent annualized revenue of over $300 million in 2022. These contract wins demonstrate how blue-chip customers trust our reliability and value our ability to deliver innovation. And they\u2019re great examples of the tremendous potential for profitable growth we\u2019re seeing in the logistics landscape, across Europe and north America. Based on current exchange rates, the GXO pro forma guidance we provided yesterday for the full year 2021 sets a target revenue range now of $7.5 billion to $7.8 billion, and also raises our adjusted EBITDA range to $605 million to $635 million. We expect this to accelerate our performance going into 2022, resulting in a higher adjusted EBITDA target of $705 million to $740 million on 8% to 12% year-over-year organic revenue growth. As Brad mentioned, this business is growing the top line at multiples of GDP and compounding at double-digit EBITDA growth. While at the same time, producing 28% return on invested capital. And all of us are absolutely delighted to start trading on Monday. Now, I will hand back to the operator and we will take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks, operator. Hi, good morning everybody. Matt, I wanted to ask about the free cash flow guidance, $400 million to $450 million pro forma for the spin. Just seems a little bit low, given what\u2019s implied for free cash flow to EBITDA conversion. Is there just some conservatism there? Can you help us with that walk and just what the right way to think about the conversion is in RemainCo? Thank you.\nMatt Fassler: So Amit, the foundation of that free cash flow guide is consistent with the numbers that we gave you in the Form 10 supplement that we put out on June 9. We gave you numbers at that point for cash taxes, CapEx, cash interest. And we have reiterations of some of those numbers in the press release that went out the other night. A couple of other numbers to keep in mind to bridge to that. We have the real estate gains associated with LTL. Those are both on the profit line and in the net CapEx line. So you want to eliminate that. To the extent that we raised our EBITDA guidance from June 9, there\u2019s a little bit of incremental cash tax, not enough to change the number in the release, but still something incremental from a free cash perspective. And then, obviously, when we\u2019re in revenue growth mode, as we are and have been this year, there\u2019s some working capital drag, and we\u2019re happy to take that as that accompanies the EBITDA growth that we see. And above that, there\u2019s probably a bit of conservatism put into that number. We continue to expect free cash conversion for RemainCo, typical with what you saw for XPO previously, if not slightly north of that over time.\nAmit Mehrotra: Got it. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. So high 30%-ish range of EBITDA. Brad, if I could ask a little bit more of a bigger picture question for you. So if I look at XPO today on a when-issued or ex-distribution basis, it\u2019s implying $76 per share. That\u2019s like under a 9 times EBITDA. I know it\u2019s a very thin market and not a true representation of maybe what the real value is, when the distribution actually happens. But just a scenario question for you, if XPO were to just absorb the conglomerate discount that the whole company had prior to Monday's spin. What further actions are available to you? You have an incredibly attractive brokerage business, I just think you guys have done an amazing job there and it doesn\u2019t really get a lot of attention. Obviously, you have a very attractive last mile business that would be attractive to a lot of other players in the space. And it just also seems that investors, I think, based on my conversations really like or prefer a pure-play LTL company without all the distractions of many other businesses. And so I guess the question is, is there a potential path for XPO to become a pure-play LTL company, if RemainCo or the business doesn\u2019t get the valuation that you deem appropriate for the whole company or for the RemainCo. Thank you.\nBrad Jacobs: Amit, when we were raising our kids, my wife repeatedly told them the 3Ps; pleasant, polite and patient. And I heard the 3 Ps like thousands of times over long periods of time. Patience, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to get the conglomerate discount. I don\u2019t know about the first week or two of trading, but in terms of the fullness of time, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to get the conglomerate discount. I think that investors understand that about 90% of XPO RemainCo\u2019s EBIT is going to be coming from LTL and truck brokerage, and investors know where Old Dominion and Saia and Robinson trade in the mid-teens EBITDA multiples. And the market will look at us compared to them and decide what kind of a relationship our multiple should be. So I\u2019m \u2013 be patient. We haven\u2019t even launched it. That when-issued market has no volume. That index funds, the long only funds can\u2019t trade in it. So, let\u2019s see how it trades next week. I\u2019m optimistic.\nAmit Mehrotra: Okay. Very good. Thank you guys. Good luck with everything. Appreciate it.\nBrad Jacobs: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your questions.\nChris Wetherbee: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Wanted to touch on LTL and think about sort of the life post spin for RemainCo. How do you think about sort of the growth opportunities for LTL specifically? It would seem the transport company is going to have lot of growth potential, particularly from the brokerage side of the house, but how do you think about sort of your approach to the market on LTL. It seems like a growing market above what the sort of broader freight market might be over the course of the next couple of years. Is that something you want to lean into or is this more about margin and sort of profit growth without necessarily that tonnage growth?\nMatt Fassler: We are leaning into it. We\u2019re leaning into it, first and foremost, over the two most prominent strategic initiatives. The first is focused on price and optimizing yield and really doing that primarily through proprietary technology that enhances our pricing algorithms and enables us to get the best price from our customers, while delivering the best volume and to continue to engineer that. Secondly, we\u2019re going at it to optimize efficiency. We\u2019re doing so on the dock. We\u2019re doing so on pickup and delivery. We\u2019re doing so with linehaul. Those are intense strategic tech efforts that have been delivering results and are going to continue to do so. We have a $1 billion EBITDA target \u2013 $1 billion or more EBITDA target in 2022. Those are the primary tools for us to get there. Above and beyond that, obviously, to your point, it\u2019s a very attractive space, becoming a more central to the consumer sectors, I spoke about earlier. And in fact, the industrial economy has not yet returned to peak, so we think there\u2019s going to be good cyclical tailwinds in addition to our secular initiatives. We feel very good about that industry and our growth opportunity, our profitable growth opportunity within it.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay. All right. That\u2019s helpful. And maybe if I can switch gears over to GXO for a moment. Mark, you talked about the business wins in the quarter. You guys have obviously posted a number of relatively high-profile customer acquisitions over the course of the last couple of quarters. And I guess when we think about the pipeline of what\u2019s in store, do we think what we\u2019re seeing over the course of the last couple of months is indicative of the type of pace of growth that can be sustained over a period of time? Or are we seeing the confluence of what is a very strong freight market, significant disruptions in the supply chain and maybe some of the secular tailwinds all coming together to sort of post sort of outsized growth. I guess, I just want to get a sense of your confidence level about maintaining this type of sort of customer acquisition rate over the course of the foreseeable future.\nMark Manduca: Yes. Great question, Chris. Thank you for that. And so a couple of things. So firstly, we\u2019re very confident about the 8% to 12% that we talked about for next year, 2022, in terms of revenue growth guide. Remember, that\u2019s an organic growth number. Remember, it is the mix of two things. It\u2019s the 5% to 8% of new business wins alongside 3% to 4% of growth in existing facilities. And clearly, I would say that we\u2019re seeing strength in both buckets at the moment, obviously given our e-comm exposure, as you referred to. Let me touch on a couple of things in regards to your question about persistence, what we\u2019re seeing on the ground at the moment at the contract level. As a business model, clearly, we\u2019re driving a few things that are different in the market. I really think that we\u2019re going to create the category here at our level. If you think about what we\u2019re seeing, we\u2019re seeing customers demand scale. We\u2019re seeing customers demand bargaining power in terms of regional pools of labor. We\u2019re seeing our customers demand bargaining power in regards to regional pools of real estate as well. And that obviously helps us with our preferred providers. We\u2019re obviously seeing customers talking about our reverse logistics prowess as well, our ESG backbone, our balance sheet, as David mentioned in his comments. And first and foremost, our technology advancements. So this is pervading through all of the contracts that we\u2019re signing at the moment. We\u2019re clearly no longer seeing a market, and this hasn\u2019t been the case for now many years, we\u2019re not seeing a market anymore that prioritizes price. The market has moved on for that, we\u2019ve seen a secular shift taking place. So we\u2019re very confident our long-term guidance, we would view next year as very much a normal year, and long may the wins continue as we\u2019ve seen across H1.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate the color. Thank you very much, guys.\nBrad Jacobs: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions.\nRyan Gunning: Hey, good morning. This is actually Ryan Gunning filling in for Hamzah today. Could you just kind of following up on the last question, could you talk about the pathway to getting to double-digit margins in GXO? And do you have like a timeframe for that?\nMark Manduca: So in terms of margin expansion, it\u2019s definitely an output of all the good business that we\u2019re writing at the moment. Clearly, we run the business from a return standpoint, as any concession business would. But naturally, when you have the tenants that I talked about, particularly in regards to scale, obviously this business, given the fact that we\u2019re writing business in regards to 28% return on invested capital, our cash paybacks of three years, that day one profitability, business is getting longer and longer as well in regards to our contract value. So logically, all of the things that I answered in Chris\u2019s question would naturally lead to margin expansion in this business. In fact, we\u2019re guiding to margin expansion next year implicitly within our 8% and 12% and 14% and 20% guide in the numbers that we\u2019ve given you today. So that\u2019s about 50 basis points in and of itself within that operational gearing that we\u2019re pointing towards. So margin expansion is a natural output of what this business is offering, primarily given the tenants that I mentioned in Chris\u2019s question.\nRyan Gunning: Great. Thank you. And then, just for my follow-up, could you just talk about maybe what you\u2019re seeing, geographically, on the logistics side? I know you mentioned some new contract wins, but maybe like in Europe versus North America relative to expectations.\nMark Manduca: Yes. Good question. So couple of things we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of quarters, if you go back over the last quarter, we\u2019ve signed roughly around $2 billion of contract value in one single quarter, and there\u2019s been a really good mix of countries across our 27 countries. If you put that into context, that means we\u2019ve signed around $5 billion worth of contract value over the course of H1. Like I said, we don\u2019t manage this business from a country-to-country perspective. You\u2019re seeing if anything, a trend right now where one contract is turning into three contracts, one country contract is turning into a multi-contract \u2013 multi-country basis. And therefore, we don\u2019t think about it in country terms, so to speak, but the contract mixes that we talked about, if you look across the top 20 in terms of new wins, it\u2019s a very good mix across our two biggest jurisdictions, two-thirds Europe, one-third North America. So all regions are doing well right now, seeing very strong top line growth and also margin expansion.\nRyan Gunning: Great. Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Seidl: Thank you, operator. Good morning, Brad and team. I\u2019ll start off with the more high-level question. Brad, you talked about getting back beyond pre-pandemic levels in your different business lines earlier in the call. I was wondering if you could talk about \u2013 I\u2019m assuming that was in totality some of the areas that maybe aren\u2019t back and where we can expect them to sort of even add more, as they get back to the pre-pandemic levels, whether it be in the back half of this year or in 2022.\nBrad Jacobs: Yes. Hi, Jason. We\u2019re back. I mean, customers are back and volumes are there. We just came off of a second quarter, where we had the best OR of any quarter we\u2019ve ever had in our history at 81.1%. We just came off a quarter in our LTL business, where our EBITDA ex-real estate at $253 million is an all-time record for any quarter. And we\u2019re outpacing the typical seasonality on revenue on tonnage and on shipments. And then if you look at the truck brokerage side of the house, we just had a phenomenal quarter. Year-over-year revenue doubled is up 101%. Load count was up 38%. Net revenue was up 47%. So we\u2019re outperforming the market. We\u2019re taking share. Positive trends are continuing as we came into July. And XPO Connect is on fire. Massive adoption in XPO Connect continued in the second quarter, we had year-over-year carrier usage up 87%. We had customer usage up 99%. So I feel it's back and it can only get better from here. Now, we have to watch this little Delta virus thing, see how that affects the world, but for the time being, it\u2019s back, it\u2019s rip-roaring back.\nJason Seidl: Okay, fair enough. I\u2019m going to actually dive down a little bit more on the LTL side with my follow-up. You sort of mentioned the seasonality being sort of above normal levels for the quarter. Wanted to sort of see where that started out in the third quarter in terms of the seasonal trends from June to July. And then maybe dive a little bit into the freight network of XPO freight, because it\u2019s interesting. You have two competitors out there, one looking to add nine terminals, open nine new terminals in the back half of the year, another may be looking to potentially scale down an operation that they just purchased because there\u2019s too many terminals they felt. So just curious where you stand right now with your terminal network and how you feel about maybe potential expansion or contraction.\nMatt Fassler: Jason, it\u2019s Matt. I\u2019ll take both of those. On LTL, this is in July is good. Yield growth is continuing. Revenue per shipment looks very good. Weight per shipment still holding up nicely. In terms of our coverage, we like our coverage. We have 291 terminals. We have good coverage for the U.S. We\u2019re able to do anything our customers need us to do. We\u2019re very happy with the results that we\u2019re delivering. Obviously we continue to aspire for more, hence our target of $1 billion or more of adjusted EBITDA in LTL in 2022. But we feel our network serves us well for a business strategy and for our customers.\nJason Seidl: Okay. And just to clarify, on the July trends, would you call that normal seasonality?\nMatt Fassler: Yes.\nJason Seidl: Okay, perfect. I appreciate the time, as always gentlemen nice quarter.\nBrad Jacobs: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please, proceed with your question.\nTodd Fowler: Hey, great. Thanks, and good morning. So just on the brokerage side, your net revenue margins have held in relatively well compared to your peers. I\u2019m curious, kind of what your expectations are for net revenue margins into the back half of the year, and then with the strong volume growth in the quarter, how do you view that as being sticky? Is a lot of that more transactional business, or would your expectation be that a lot of that business stays with you if the market normalizes?\nMatt Fassler: Net revenue margins are holding up well. And we really look at net revenue per load or gross margin per load, which was really the key economic metric. And that number was very good for us in the second quarter. And it remains very good for us as we start the third quarter. We spoke with our brokerage people a lot about the market and about our customer position and that business, is sticky. Our customer relationships have never been stronger, including our relationships with our key customers. Our load count is exceptionally high levels. It\u2019s holding at exceptional high levels and we expect that to be the case through the remainder of this year. We\u2019ve made massive investments as you know in XPO Connect our digital freight marketplace that\u2019s helping us drive share. Its helping us to optimize price, its helping us drive productivity and that\u2019s really central to our winning business and retaining business.\nTodd Fowler: Good. Okay. That makes sense, Matt. And then Brad, just for a follow-up when you think about RemainCo post the spin, we just had the GXO Analyst Day and so there was some clarity on kind of the focus there. What do you see as kind of the main areas for focus for RemainCo after the spin, as we look out into 2022 and beyond?\nBrad Jacobs: Well, we\u2019re going to build on the leading positions we\u2019ve got in LTL and truck brokerage. We\u2019re going to continue to focus on innovative technologies. From a financial perspective, clearly our number one priority is to deleverage and to meet our target of investment grade rating. We\u2019re going to continue to execute on the LTL side to achieve at least $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA next year. And we\u2019re going to continue on truck brokerage to outperform the market primarily due to XPO Connect. So the future looks bright.\nTodd Fowler: Okay. Got it. So it\u2019s really the focus on the growth in brokerage and margin improvement in LTL.\nBrad Jacobs: Correct.\nTodd Fowler: Great. Thanks the time this morning.\nBrad Jacobs: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please, proceed with your question.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks. Good morning. Congratulations to David and Ravi. I \u2013 Brad or Matt, I\u2019m going to go to you guys first on truck brokerage, very impressive margins and growth. It\u2019s been covered pretty well on the call, but we\u2019ve seen some M&A in the industry recently. And just kind of curious where you think the industry looks a few years from now, further consolidation where XPO plays in that. Thanks.\nMatt Fassler: Well, there\u2019s definitely been some interesting consolidation recently. I think that\u2019s a good thing and plays right into how we have envisioned the industry to evolve over time. Some of the transactions were at very healthy multiples and served to validate what assets in this industry are worth and maybe shows that we\u2019re even more undervalued than we thought. In terms of our role in it, our prime goal is to delever, and that\u2019s going to be our most important use of cash, but we don\u2019t rule out M&A. It\u2019s a tool in our tool kit, but it can\u2019t conflict with our goal to delever.\nScott Schneeberger: Excellent. Thanks. And following-up, Mark over to you. Curious how should we be tracking XPO Direct, GXO direct \u2013 going forward, just a progress report on that, and maybe, I think you have some guidance on where that should be in 2021, but just thinking about 2022 and beyond. Thank you.\nMark Manduca: Thanks for the question. So GXO Direct continues to be as you say, on track, it\u2019s growing incredibly fast as we talked about in the Investor Day, it\u2019s got around about $200 million of revenue at the moment. It\u2019s an important place to grow customers particularly for our longer-term plans of moving them towards dedicated facilities. So it\u2019s a high growth engine for us. It\u2019s a great place to find new customers and work with them going forwards. So it\u2019s an important part of our business, but it\u2019s by no means the major part of our business. We are very much the Cadillac service in providing dedicated facilities across our 850-or-so warehouses.\nScott Schneeberger: Understood. Thanks.\nBrad Jacobs: Thank you.\nOperator: Next questions is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please, proceed with your question.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Brad, just to follow-up on your last response, so it\u2019s been a while since we got an update on your strategic kind of long-term view of the brokerage business with everything that\u2019s going on in the space. Where do you think that business goes over time? Kind of what our long-term sustainable growth and net margin's like? What role do you see the new digital entrance playing kind of do you think the business looks the way it has in the last 10 years \u2013 in the next 10 years?\nBrad Jacobs: I think the difference in distinctions between the digital players and the \u2013 whatever you call the non-digital players has become almost non-existent. I think the technology that\u2019s been embraced by C.H. Robinson and some of the other truck brokers, and of course, ourselves, it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re digital. We\u2019re as digital, more digital than the so-called digital ones. I think over time with respect to margins, I think margins will come down. Having said that, I think profit will go up, because I think volume will go up, because I think the amount of transactions, the velocity transactions is going to increase. I think it\u2019s going to evolve very much like you've seen commodity markets, particularly like the oil market, for example, it morphed purely physical markets and then derivative markets and Wall Street got involved. I think the players will be different. And I think the connectivity between shippers and the carriers and the brokers in between will become seamless. I think it will be much more digital and much less human based. I think on the physical truck side, it\u2019s a question of time, when it will be autonomous. I think that autonomous evolution is slowed down a little bit because of the way that the political winds are blowing, where it\u2019s more of a EV focus than an autonomous focus. But the compelling economics of autonomous trucking are extreme. And Adam Smith's hidden hand of capitalism will not allow autonomous trucking to be delayed forever, and that\u2019ll take cost out, it'll take a huge amount of cost out. So, you will see costs coming on in the actual brokerage side, you\u2019ll see costs coming out on the purchase transportation side. And it\u2019ll be just to be more efficient and brokerages who are like ourselves, who are all in on technology will have a great role to play there. But margin should come down with volumes going up, therefore profit going up.\nRavi Shanker: That\u2019s very, very helpful color. Thanks for that, Brad. And maybe as a follow-up either to you or for Matt, you guys have given us 2022 guidance on the GXO side, which is really helpful. How do we think about that on the XPO side kind of just maybe your views on how long the cycle it would last and also maybe idiosyncratically irrespective of the cycle, how much margin growth can you drive there?\nMatt Fassler: We\u2019re likely to give you guidance for XPO RemainCo at the end of the year, as we typically would. And to your point, there are \u2013 there is more cyclicality, there\u2019s economic cyclicality, but more so truck cycle cyclicality and other things related to that. I think best time to give guidance for this business is going to be at year end. Obviously GXO has fantastic visibility to its business based on the contractual nature of that business. And they\u2019ve given you 2021 guidance, 2022 guidance, 2021 revenue guidance and 2022 organic revenue guidance, so obviously a tremendous basis for evaluating that business as well.\nRavi Shanker: Understood. Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Stephanie Moore with Truist. Please, proceed with your questions.\nStephanie Moore: Hi, good morning. Thank you for the question. I wanted to touch on RemainCo or XPO\u2019s technology investment strategy as we look to \u2013 the remainder of this year and next year, I think GXO's was a little bit more apparent and kind of broken out during the Analyst Day and the move towards automation, robotics, but I\u2019d love to hear what RemainCo kind of has planned as it historically has also been a pretty large investor behind new technology. So any color there would be helpful. Thank you.\nMatt Fassler: Stephanie, that\u2019s right. And we\u2019re going to continue to be. So obviously XPO Connect is our primary technology platform in brokerage. It\u2019s our digital freight marketplace. You know how it\u2019s helped drive our success in brokerage over the past number of quarters, and it's going to continue to do so. It\u2019s less about dollar investment there. We\u2019ve booked a lot of dollar investment there. It's about enhancing that, that technology and we\u2019re on path to do that. We continue to rollout XPO Smart within LTL to optimize the labor on the dock. It\u2019s rolled out, but we continue to harvest the benefits of XPO Smart, and there\u2019s the opportunity to continue to enhance that platform as well. And then finally, within LTL, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we\u2019re very focused on enhancing our pricing algorithms. We\u2019re really just beginning to pierce the surface. There\u2019s an awful lot of enhancement opportunity for us there. And then our route optimization efforts in P&D and linehaul, have very high potential. Those are the highest priority technology investments for us here at RemainCo.\nStephanie Moore: Great. Thank you so much.\nBrad Jacobs: Okay. And it's 9:30 and that concludes our earnings call. We\u2019re very happy that we reported such a strong quarter and we raised the outlook for both XPO and GXO. And I want to take this opportunity to give a big thanks to all the employees around the country and around Europe and around Asia who have worked so hard over the last eight or nine months to create two industry powerhouses launching next week. So thank you all. Talk to you soon.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.",

            "content": "Thanks Matt. As the largest pure play contract logistics company, our scale puts us at the forefront of the burgeoning demand for logistics services. This is due to three secular mega-trends, outsourcing, e-commerce and warehouse automation. These three robust tailwinds continue to drive our double-digit growth, and the runway remains significant with a potential addressable market of $430 billion, of which $300 billion is yet to be outsourced. In the second quarter, we increased Logistics revenue by 34% compared with a year ago, including the Kuehne + Nagel acquisition, which contributed $151 million of revenue in the second quarter. Moreover, our year-over-year organic revenue growth rose to 16%, accelerating from 13% in the first quarter. We saw exceptionally strong growth from our customers in e-com, omnichannel retail and consumer technology. From 2016 through the end of the second quarter, we've delivered an organic revenue CAGR of over 7%, reflecting the high-growth nature of this business. Moving to profit for the quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA of $169 million for Logistics was 104% higher than in the second quarter of last year, and 24% higher than in the second quarter of 2019. Our adjusted EBITDA margin increased 310 basis points to 9%. This was an increase of 10 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2019. On the cost side, we continue to do an excellent job, further strengthening our margin expansion by showing cost discipline and implementing our productivity initiatives. And while the labor market remains tight, we're managing it well due to the pass-through nature of our contracts. In the last three months, we've announced the appointment of an experienced and diverse Board of Directors for GXO. Among other initiatives, our new Directors will help us solidify our ESG leadership, which is important not only to GXO, but also our blue-chip customers. At our Investor Day, we highlighted a number of key environmental goals, including a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 versus 2019, carbon neutrality by 2040 and LED lights used by at least 80% of our operations by 2025. Looking forward, our pipeline remains very strong at $2 billion of opportunity and is skewed toward high-growth consumer verticals. We announced a number of new contract wins in the first quarter. And our momentum with new business wins persisted into the second quarter with the likes of Dixons Carphone, a large technology retailer in the UK and Nike among others. These second quarter wins alone represent annualized revenue of over $300 million in 2022. These contract wins demonstrate how blue-chip customers trust our reliability and value our ability to deliver innovation. And they're great examples of the tremendous potential for profitable growth we're seeing in the logistics landscape, across Europe and north America. Based on current exchange rates, the GXO pro forma guidance we provided yesterday for the full year 2021 sets a target revenue range now of $7.5 billion to $7.8 billion, and also raises our adjusted EBITDA range to $605 million to $635 million. We expect this to accelerate our performance going into 2022, resulting in a higher adjusted EBITDA target of $705 million to $740 million on 8% to 12% year-over-year organic revenue growth. As Brad mentioned, this business is growing the top line at multiples of GDP and compounding at double-digit EBITDA growth. While at the same time, producing 28% return on invested capital. And all of us are absolutely delighted to start trading on Monday. Now, I will hand back to the operator and we will take your questions. Yes. Great question, Chris. Thank you for that. And so a couple of things. So firstly, we're very confident about the 8% to 12% that we talked about for next year, 2022, in terms of revenue growth guide. Remember, that's an organic growth number. Remember, it is the mix of two things. It's the 5% to 8% of new business wins alongside 3% to 4% of growth in existing facilities. And clearly, I would say that we're seeing strength in both buckets at the moment, obviously given our e-comm exposure, as you referred to. Let me touch on a couple of things in regards to your question about persistence, what we're seeing on the ground at the moment at the contract level. As a business model, clearly, we're driving a few things that are different in the market. I really think that we're going to create the category here at our level. If you think about what we're seeing, we're seeing customers demand scale. We're seeing customers demand bargaining power in terms of regional pools of labor. We're seeing our customers demand bargaining power in regards to regional pools of real estate as well. And that obviously helps us with our preferred providers. We're obviously seeing customers talking about our reverse logistics prowess as well, our ESG backbone, our balance sheet, as David mentioned in his comments. And first and foremost, our technology advancements. So this is pervading through all of the contracts that we're signing at the moment. We're clearly no longer seeing a market, and this hasn't been the case for now many years, we're not seeing a market anymore that prioritizes price. The market has moved on for that, we've seen a secular shift taking place. So we're very confident our long-term guidance, we would view next year as very much a normal year, and long may the wins continue as we've seen across H1. So in terms of margin expansion, it's definitely an output of all the good business that we're writing at the moment. Clearly, we run the business from a return standpoint, as any concession business would. But naturally, when you have the tenants that I talked about, particularly in regards to scale, obviously this business, given the fact that we're writing business in regards to 28% return on invested capital, our cash paybacks of three years, that day one profitability, business is getting longer and longer as well in regards to our contract value. So logically, all of the things that I answered in Chris's question would naturally lead to margin expansion in this business. In fact, we're guiding to margin expansion next year implicitly within our 8% and 12% and 14% and 20% guide in the numbers that we've given you today. So that's about 50 basis points in and of itself within that operational gearing that we're pointing towards. So margin expansion is a natural output of what this business is offering, primarily given the tenants that I mentioned in Chris's question. Yes. Good question. So couple of things we've seen in the last couple of quarters, if you go back over the last quarter, we've signed roughly around $2 billion of contract value in one single quarter, and there's been a really good mix of countries across our 27 countries. If you put that into context, that means we've signed around $5 billion worth of contract value over the course of H1. Like I said, we don't manage this business from a country-to-country perspective. You're seeing if anything, a trend right now where one contract is turning into three contracts, one country contract is turning into a multi-contract \u2013 multi-country basis. And therefore, we don't think about it in country terms, so to speak, but the contract mixes that we talked about, if you look across the top 20 in terms of new wins, it's a very good mix across our two biggest jurisdictions, two-thirds Europe, one-third North America. So all regions are doing well right now, seeing very strong top line growth and also margin expansion. Thanks for the question. So GXO Direct continues to be as you say, on track, it's growing incredibly fast as we talked about in the Investor Day, it's got around about $200 million of revenue at the moment. It's an important place to grow customers particularly for our longer-term plans of moving them towards dedicated facilities. So it's a high growth engine for us. It's a great place to find new customers and work with them going forwards. So it's an important part of our business, but it's by no means the major part of our business. We are very much the Cadillac service in providing dedicated facilities across our 850-or-so warehouses."

            "name": "Matt Fassler",
            "content": "Thanks, David. I'll review the second quarter operating results for our Transportation segment and then Mark will cover Logistics. The strength we saw in LTL reflects the backdrop of improving demand, a healthy pricing environment, and importantly, the impact of our own operating initiatives, all of which have significant runway ahead. Our LTL revenue growth accelerated sharply. We grew revenue by 37% year-over-year. If we exclude fuel, we grew revenue by 31% year-over-year. It's true that we've cycled the worst of the COVID impact in 2020, but we also gained ground on an underlying basis. As revenue per day, ex-fuel grew 10% from Q1, outpacing typical seasonality. All told, these were our strongest growth rates in LTL since we acquired the business in 2015. We grew tonnage per day by 23% year-over-year. Our sequential increase in weight per day also outpaced typical seasonality. Shipments per day rose 17%. Here, too, we outpaced typical seasonality. And it's notable that the acceleration in growth for our largest vertical, industrial and manufacturing, outpaced the pickup in retail and e-commerce. Based on comparisons to the period prior to the pandemic, there's still room for our industrial customers to regain ground as production continues to gear up. At the same time, LTL is becoming more central to the consumer ecosystem, as the growth of e-commerce creates more demand for the staging of smaller quantities of goods closer to consumers. Our weight per shipment increased 6%. This compares to 1.3% increase in the first quarter. Our 1.4% sequential increase in weight per shipment exceeded the typical seasonal trend and the pickup was broad-based across verticals. Yield, excluding fuel rose 4.5% year-over-year. Price increases on contract renewals were 8% and accelerated from Q1 with the underlying impact of the increase offset in part by higher weight per shipment. Revenue per shipment, excluding fuel grew 10.7%, accelerating sharply from the 5.5% growth we had in Q1. This reflected the acceleration we saw in both yield and weight per shipment and help to create the operating leverage we realized this quarter. Our LTL adjusted operating ratio was 80.6%. Excluding real estate gains, our adjusted OR improved to 81.1%, which was 1,030 basis points better than the second quarter a year ago. Our adjusted OR ex-real estate gains also improved sequentially, in this case by 320 basis points. And we tripled our adjusted operating income dollars ex-real estate with the year-over-year increase of 201%. The strong demand environment comes with some industry-wide challenges. Labor remains constrained across the service economy. In the U.S., we're addressing this with a series of initiatives. For example, our commercial driver training schools are set to yield a record number of graduates, totaling nearly 1,000 driver candidates for XPO. We were successful in accelerating our truck driver recruitment in Q2 with net hires for the four weeks in June at double the number in the prior eight weeks. Higher truck load rates drove a meaningful increase in our purchased transportation costs year-over-year, both in dollars and as a percent of revenue. We mitigated the rate impact by using our in-house capacity to manage the increase in activity with our own fleet, which in turn increased trailer utilization. We're also using our tech to optimize routes to the lowest cost mode. As a result, we reduced our reliance on third-party linehaul, even though, we drove substantially more tonnage through the network. Pricing remains our biggest opportunity in LTL. We automated 90% of local RFPs in the second quarter, and we're beginning to add more variables to our pricing algorithms, which we'll be refining further over the next 12 months. We also remain focused on route optimization. In pickup and delivery, pounds per hour improved by 7.4% year-over-year and on the linehaul front, we launched new control tower solutions to all terminals. We remain on track to deliver at least $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA in LTL next year, driven by both revenue growth and continued improvement in our adjusted OR. Turning to our truck brokerage business. We continue to gain share in a dynamic marketplace. Our loads in the quarter increased by 38% versus a year ago, accelerating from 23% growth in the first quarter. And once again, we sharply outpaced the market. On a year-over-year basis, we generated a 101% increase in revenue and increased net revenue by 47%, as gross margin per load increased year-on-year. Our digital brokerage platform, XPO Connect is helping us drive tremendous volume at excellent margins. Carrier and customer adoption of XPO Connect continues to surge. We reached 475,000 cumulative downloads of our Drive XPO mobile app in Q2, representing 20% growth quarter-over-quarter and tripling the cumulative number of downloads year-over-year. In Q2, we topped 85,000 registered carrier accounts on the platform, up over 40% year-over-year. Average weekly usage by carriers nearly doubled in the quarter, up 87%. And the number of customer accounts on the platform is up by more than 6 times from Q2 last year. We're also securing brokerage volumes through API technology at a profitable clip. Transactions driven by APIs and similar interfaces increased by more than 8 times in Q2 versus the prior year, as XPO Connect talked directly to our customers systems. Our brokerage profitability was very strong and we leveraged our 47% net revenue growth into stronger adjusted EBITDA growth in brokerage. The combined impact from these lines of business is a very strong performance overall by our Transportation segment in the second quarter. Year-over-year, we increased Transportation revenue by 50% and increased adjusted EBITDA by 168% to a new quarterly record. And our adjusted EBITDA margin for the Transportation segment was a robust 12.3%. After the spin, XPO will be a transportation pure play. And as David said, we raised our full year pro forma guidance for XPO adjusted EBITDA to a range of $1.195 billion to $1.235 billion. This increases our 2021 EBITDA target, pro forma for the spin, by $20 million at the midpoint from our June 9 trading update. This includes adjusted EBITDA of $574 million to $614 million for the second half of this year. I want to mention a couple of recognitions that are particularly meaningful. We recently received Intel's 2021 Supplier Achievement Award for our COVID response last year, which speaks to our culture as much as our operations. And Gartner named XPO a worldwide leader in their Magic Quadrant for 3PL providers in 2021. That's based on our vision and our ability to execute across both Transportation and Logistics. Now, I'll turn it over to Mark to discuss our Logistics segment and the outlook for its spin-off as GXO. So Amit, the foundation of that free cash flow guide is consistent with the numbers that we gave you in the Form 10 supplement that we put out on June 9. We gave you numbers at that point for cash taxes, CapEx, cash interest. And we have reiterations of some of those numbers in the press release that went out the other night. A couple of other numbers to keep in mind to bridge to that. We have the real estate gains associated with LTL. Those are both on the profit line and in the net CapEx line. So you want to eliminate that. To the extent that we raised our EBITDA guidance from June 9, there's a little bit of incremental cash tax, not enough to change the number in the release, but still something incremental from a free cash perspective. And then, obviously, when we're in revenue growth mode, as we are and have been this year, there's some working capital drag, and we're happy to take that as that accompanies the EBITDA growth that we see. And above that, there's probably a bit of conservatism put into that number. We continue to expect free cash conversion for RemainCo, typical with what you saw for XPO previously, if not slightly north of that over time. We are leaning into it. We're leaning into it, first and foremost, over the two most prominent strategic initiatives. The first is focused on price and optimizing yield and really doing that primarily through proprietary technology that enhances our pricing algorithms and enables us to get the best price from our customers, while delivering the best volume and to continue to engineer that. Secondly, we're going at it to optimize efficiency. We're doing so on the dock. We're doing so on pickup and delivery. We're doing so with linehaul. Those are intense strategic tech efforts that have been delivering results and are going to continue to do so. We have a $1 billion EBITDA target \u2013 $1 billion or more EBITDA target in 2022. Those are the primary tools for us to get there. Above and beyond that, obviously, to your point, it's a very attractive space, becoming a more central to the consumer sectors, I spoke about earlier. And in fact, the industrial economy has not yet returned to peak, so we think there's going to be good cyclical tailwinds in addition to our secular initiatives. We feel very good about that industry and our growth opportunity, our profitable growth opportunity within it. Jason, it's Matt. I'll take both of those. On LTL, this is in July is good. Yield growth is continuing. Revenue per shipment looks very good. Weight per shipment still holding up nicely. In terms of our coverage, we like our coverage. We have 291 terminals. We have good coverage for the U.S. We're able to do anything our customers need us to do. We're very happy with the results that we're delivering. Obviously we continue to aspire for more, hence our target of $1 billion or more of adjusted EBITDA in LTL in 2022. But we feel our network serves us well for a business strategy and for our customers. Yes. Net revenue margins are holding up well. And we really look at net revenue per load or gross margin per load, which was really the key economic metric. And that number was very good for us in the second quarter. And it remains very good for us as we start the third quarter. We spoke with our brokerage people a lot about the market and about our customer position and that business, is sticky. Our customer relationships have never been stronger, including our relationships with our key customers. Our load count is exceptionally high levels. It's holding at exceptional high levels and we expect that to be the case through the remainder of this year. We've made massive investments as you know in XPO Connect our digital freight marketplace that's helping us drive share. Its helping us to optimize price, its helping us drive productivity and that's really central to our winning business and retaining business. Well, there's definitely been some interesting consolidation recently. I think that's a good thing and plays right into how we have envisioned the industry to evolve over time. Some of the transactions were at very healthy multiples and served to validate what assets in this industry are worth and maybe shows that we're even more undervalued than we thought. In terms of our role in it, our prime goal is to delever, and that's going to be our most important use of cash, but we don't rule out M&A. It's a tool in our tool kit, but it can't conflict with our goal to delever. We're likely to give you guidance for XPO RemainCo at the end of the year, as we typically would. And to your point, there are \u2013 there is more cyclicality, there's economic cyclicality, but more so truck cycle cyclicality and other things related to that. I think best time to give guidance for this business is going to be at year end. Obviously GXO has fantastic visibility to its business based on the contractual nature of that business. And they've given you 2021 guidance, 2022 guidance, 2021 revenue guidance and 2022 organic revenue guidance, so obviously a tremendous basis for evaluating that business as well. Stephanie, that's right. And we're going to continue to be. So obviously XPO Connect is our primary technology platform in brokerage. It's our digital freight marketplace. You know how it's helped drive our success in brokerage over the past number of quarters, and it's going to continue to do so. It's less about dollar investment there. We've booked a lot of dollar investment there. It's about enhancing that, that technology and we're on path to do that. We continue to rollout XPO Smart within LTL to optimize the labor on the dock. It's rolled out, but we continue to harvest the benefits of XPO Smart, and there's the opportunity to continue to enhance that platform as well. And then finally, within LTL, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're very focused on enhancing our pricing algorithms. We're really just beginning to pierce the surface. There's an awful lot of enhancement opportunity for us there. And then our route optimization efforts in P&D and linehaul, have very high potential. Those are the highest priority technology investments for us here at RemainCo."

            "name": "David Wyshner",
            "content": "Thank you for those comments, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'd like to discuss our second quarter results, our balance sheet and liquidity and our updated outlook for 2021. I'll be presenting most numbers on a status quo pre-spin basis with post-spin breakouts between XPO and GXO where appropriate, as we anticipate the completion of the spin-off on Monday. In the second quarter, we generated revenue of $5 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $507 million. The revenue number reflects a year-over-year increase of more than 40%. Adjusted EBITDA nearly tripled compared to our Q2 results last year when COVID was at its worst. And both revenue and adjusted EBITDA are higher than we expected at the beginning of the quarter. Our record adjusted EBITDA reflects strong growth and continued execution across our business. In this case, it's also useful to compare our results to the second quarter of 2019, which takes COVID out of the base period. On a two-year stacked basis, our revenue and our adjusted EBITDA are both up double-digits. Breaking down our 44% year-over-year revenue growth in the quarter, our UK logistics acquisition in January contributed 4 points of growth, foreign exchange contributed 5 points and fuel prices contributed 4 points. As a result, our organic revenue growth in the quarter was 31%. This top line growth translated into even stronger adjusted EBITDA growth of 195% and our EBITDA margin rebounded to 10%. COVID had a much more limited impact this year compared to last. As a consequence, our second quarter results this year with $0.5 billion of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter are much more representative of our earnings power. As Brad mentioned, both of our segments made a strong contribution to our growth and achieved record levels of quarterly adjusted EBITDA. In our Logistics segment, adjusted EBITDA doubled in the second quarter. And in our Transportation segment, adjusted EBITDA was up year-over-year by 168%. Operating conditions in the quarter were favorable with robust consumer demand and a rebound in industrial activity. The global microchip shortage did impact our transportation operations. We estimate that it reduced our EBITDA by around $10 million in the second quarter. On the other hand, our results benefited from the operating leverage inherent in our business and the cost reduction actions we took last year. Matt and Mark will review our segment detail in a few minutes. Our adjusted earnings were $1.86 per diluted share, which is a quarterly record for us. We generated $366 million of cash flow from operations in the second quarter, spent $110 million on gross CapEx and receive $26 million of proceeds from asset sales. As a result, we generated free cash flow of $282 million. This exceeded our expectations for the quarter driven by our strong earnings, as well as some CapEx and working capital timing that worked in our favor. Maintaining strong liquidity continues to be a top priority for us as an organization. Our cash balance at June 30 was $801 million. This cash combined with available debt capacity under committed borrowing facilities give us nearly $2 billion of liquidity at quarter end. We had no borrowings outstanding under our ABL facility. We used a $128 million of cash in the quarter to repurchase the remaining 3% of our European operations held by public shareholders. While this transaction wasn't required for the GXO spin-off. It's an economical simplifying cost saving cleanup of our capital structure that we've wanted to do for some time. Our net leverage at June 30 was 2.4 times LTM adjusted EBITDA, down from 3.1 times in March. Our free cash flow and our EBITDA growth are helping us achieve meaningful deleveraging. Our steady progress on this metric is important in the context of our commitment to move XPO toward an investment grade rating following the spin-off of GXO. We've stood up GXO with an investment grade capital structure. Earlier this month, GXO completed an offering of $800 million of long-term debt with a weighted average interest rate of 2.2%. We've also put in place an undrawn $800 million revolving credit facility for GXO. Most of the proceeds from the GXO debt offering will be sent to XPO and GXO will retain about a $100 million of cash post-spin. Shortly after the spin, XPO will use the cash it receives from GXO as well as the nearly $400 million from our recent equity offering and cash on hand to repay all of our outstanding 6.125% notes due 2023 and the 6.75% notes due 2024, a total redemption of $1.5 billion that should reduce our annual interest expense by a $100 million. Following the spin, XPO's net leverage will be roughly 2.8 times 2021 pro forma adjusted EBITDA. And we will have no significant debt maturities until 2025. We believe our debt paydown will move XPO closer to investment grade. From a housekeeping perspective, let me clarify the financial information that is and will be available about GXO and post-spin XPO. GXO's historical and pro forma results are available in the Form 10. In addition, in August, GXO will file its own 10-Q and will also provide supplementary detail on its historical pro forma EBITDA by quarter. XPO will file an 8-K next week with pro forma financial information reflecting the spin-off as required. In addition, in the third quarter, we intend to provide additional details about XPO's historical results with logistics classified as a discontinued operation. And for modeling purposes, since the spin-off is of the Logistics segment, a high-level way to understand XPO's historical results adjusted for the spin is to look at the combination of our Transportation segment and corporate results. Turning to the outlook we issued yesterday. We updated our full year guidance in light of our strong second quarter results and the favorable economic trends we see today. Our outlook assumes these trends will continue and the market impacts of COVID will remain muted. On a combined basis, we've increased our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance by $45 million at the midpoint since early May. We now expect that we would generate $1.875 billion to $1.915 billion of adjusted EBITDA this year if there was no spin, with year-over-year growth revised upward to 29% to 33% in our Logistics segment and 35% to 37% in Transportation. On a pro forma basis, as if the spin had happened on January 1, our outlook translates into $605 million to $635 million of pro forma 2021 EBITDA for GXO and $1.195 billion to $1.235 billion of pro forma EBITDA for XPO. These figures take into account the separate corporate costs of each company. In the third quarter, our year-over-year growth metrics will normalize compared to the outsized growth we reported for Q2. We expect that GXO's and XPO's adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter will both be in the mid-20s as a percentage of their respective full year pro forma EBITDA outlooks. We expect about $5 million of gains from LTL real estate sales in Q3 versus $26 million in last year's third quarter. LTL real estate gains in Q4 will be higher than they were last year. So our back half seasonality will look a little different this year compared to last. In total, we expect $55 million to $60 million of gains from LTL real estate sales this year versus $77 million last year. On the cash flow front on a combined basis, our outlook is for full year free cash flow of $650 million to $725 million excluding spin-related outlays. We also continue to target approximately $675 million of gross capital expenditures and $525 million of net CapEx for the combined company. Of these amounts, we estimate the GXO will have roughly $245 million of CapEx and standalone XPO will have about $430 million of gross CapEx and $280 million of net CapEx. Our depreciation and amortization, interest expense and tax expense will be split among GXO and XPO as a result of the spin. We provided the details in our earnings release. And as a result of our recent primary equity offering of 2.9 million shares, we now forecast having roughly 114 million diluted common shares outstanding on average this year and roughly 116 million diluted common shares on average in the second half. We said in May that we were proceeding toward the spin-off of our logistics business with the wind at our back. Our record second quarter results have borne that out. We've continued to grow our revenue and execute against our business plan, while we've readied our businesses for the spin transaction. And we've continued to serve our customers without missing a beat. As a result, GXO and XPO remain strategically well positioned to meet customer needs and capture profitable growth opportunities in logistics, LTL and brokerage. We remain enthusiastic about our prospects as a leader in the markets we serve and we look forward to completing the GXO spin-off on Monday. Lastly, on a personal note, I'm incredibly grateful to have had the opportunity to work with Brad and everyone at XPO as a member of the company's senior leadership team. Helping to shepherd XPO through the pandemic and prepare for the GXO spin-off has been very gratifying. I know that Ravi, Baris and their finance teams are well positioned to drive XPO's and GXO's future progress and I wish them every success. I'll now turn things over to Matt."

            "content": "Thank you, operator. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our call. With me today in Greenwich are David Wyshner, our CFO; Matt Fassler, our Chief Strategy Officer; and Mark Manduca, the Chief Investment Officer of GXO, our planned logistics spin-off. As you saw yesterday, we delivered the highest revenue and adjusted EBITDA in our history. It was the highest company-wide and in each of our Transportation and Logistics segments. We generated over $5 billion of revenue and over $0.5 billion of adjusted EBITDA. It was the third consecutive quarter. We reported record revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Not only did we solidly beat all expectations, we surpassed a great first quarter with an even better second quarter. It gives both our segments a powerful springboard for profitable growth as separate public companies. Customer activity has more than come back from 2020. And we're executing extremely well across the business. Yesterday, we raised the midpoint of our 2021 EBITDA guidance for the combined company by more than the second quarter beat. And we raised the pro forma EBITDA guidance for both XPO and GXO. Every area of the business is showing strength. In North American LTL, we're continuing to expand our operating margin primarily through company specific technology initiatives. As a result, our second quarter adjusted operating ratio ex-real estate gains was our best operating ratio yet. In truck brokerage, we're continuing to outperform the industry. This is due in no small part to the rapid adoption of our XPO Connect digital platform by customers and carriers. Our Logistics segment delivered the second consecutive quarter of double-digit organic revenue growth. The new contracts we talked about on our last earnings call have been followed by more wins in the second quarter and a constant inflow of new opportunities. I'm confident that the spin-off of this business will unlock the full potential of both GXO and XPO. After we ring the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange on Monday, GXO will start trading as the largest pure-play contract logistics company in the world. This is a business with a rare combination of attributes. GXO is an industry leader with massive revenue tailwinds, double-digit EBITDA growth, long-term contractual relationships with blue-chip customers and importantly, a 28% return on invested capital. XPO will be a pure-play transportation company with an LTL business that is on track to generate at least $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA in 2022 and a booming truck brokerage business with a fast growing digital platform. I want to take this opportunity to thank David for his service as Chief Financial Officer. As we announced yesterday, David will be leaving in September after a seamless handoff to Ravi Tulsyan, our Deputy CFO. David has made many significant contributions to XPO's success as a member of our executive team. I particularly want to thank him for his strong leadership during COVID and throughout the spin-off process. I have no doubt David will continue to be successful in this next step of his career. And now he'll take you through the numbers. David? Amit, when we were raising our kids, my wife repeatedly told them the 3Ps; pleasant, polite and patient. And I heard the 3 Ps like thousands of times over long periods of time. Patience, I don't think we're going to get the conglomerate discount. I don't know about the first week or two of trading, but in terms of the fullness of time, I don't think we're going to get the conglomerate discount. I think that investors understand that about 90% of XPO RemainCo's EBIT is going to be coming from LTL and truck brokerage, and investors know where Old Dominion and Saia and Robinson trade in the mid-teens EBITDA multiples. And the market will look at us compared to them and decide what kind of a relationship our multiple should be. So I'm \u2013 be patient. We haven't even launched it. That when-issued market has no volume. That index funds, the long only funds can't trade in it. So, let's see how it trades next week. I'm optimistic. Thank you. Thank you. Yes. Hi, Jason. We're back. I mean, customers are back and volumes are there. We just came off of a second quarter, where we had the best OR of any quarter we've ever had in our history at 81.1%. We just came off a quarter in our LTL business, where our EBITDA ex-real estate at $253 million is an all-time record for any quarter. And we're outpacing the typical seasonality on revenue on tonnage and on shipments. And then if you look at the truck brokerage side of the house, we just had a phenomenal quarter. Year-over-year revenue doubled is up 101%. Load count was up 38%. Net revenue was up 47%. So we're outperforming the market. We're taking share. Positive trends are continuing as we came into July. And XPO Connect is on fire. Massive adoption in XPO Connect continued in the second quarter, we had year-over-year carrier usage up 87%. We had customer usage up 99%. So I feel it's back and it can only get better from here. Now, we have to watch this little Delta virus thing, see how that affects the world, but for the time being, it's back, it's rip-roaring back. Thank you. Well, we're going to build on the leading positions we've got in LTL and truck brokerage. We're going to continue to focus on innovative technologies. From a financial perspective, clearly our number one priority is to deleverage and to meet our target of investment grade rating. We're going to continue to execute on the LTL side to achieve at least $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA next year. And we're going to continue on truck brokerage to outperform the market primarily due to XPO Connect. So the future looks bright. Correct. Thank you. Thank you. I think the difference in distinctions between the digital players and the \u2013 whatever you call the non-digital players has become almost non-existent. I think the technology that's been embraced by C.H. Robinson and some of the other truck brokers, and of course, ourselves, it's \u2013 we're digital. We're as digital, more digital than the so-called digital ones. I think over time with respect to margins, I think margins will come down. Having said that, I think profit will go up, because I think volume will go up, because I think the amount of transactions, the velocity transactions is going to increase. I think it's going to evolve very much like you've seen commodity markets, particularly like the oil market, for example, it morphed purely physical markets and then derivative markets and Wall Street got involved. I think the players will be different. And I think the connectivity between shippers and the carriers and the brokers in between will become seamless. I think it will be much more digital and much less human based. I think on the physical truck side, it's a question of time, when it will be autonomous. I think that autonomous evolution is slowed down a little bit because of the way that the political winds are blowing, where it's more of a EV focus than an autonomous focus. But the compelling economics of autonomous trucking are extreme. And Adam Smith's hidden hand of capitalism will not allow autonomous trucking to be delayed forever, and that'll take cost out, it'll take a huge amount of cost out. So, you will see costs coming on in the actual brokerage side, you'll see costs coming out on the purchase transportation side. And it'll be just to be more efficient and brokerages who are like ourselves, who are all in on technology will have a great role to play there. But margin should come down with volumes going up, therefore profit going up. Okay. And it's 9:30 and that concludes our earnings call. We're very happy that we reported such a strong quarter and we raised the outlook for both XPO and GXO. And I want to take this opportunity to give a big thanks to all the employees around the country and around Europe and around Asia who have worked so hard over the last eight or nine months to create two industry powerhouses launching next week. So thank you all. Talk to you soon."

I will now turn the call over to Brad Jacobs. Mr. Jacobs, you may begin.\nBrad Jacobs: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our conference call. With me today in Greenwich are David Wyshner, our CFO; Matt Fassler, our Chief Strategy Officer; and from London, Malcolm Wilson, our current CEO of XPO Europe and future CEO of the planned spin GXO. As you saw, we had a tremendous first quarter that beat expectations and gave us a very strong start to 2021. On a year-over-year basis, our first quarter revenue was up 24% to $4.8 billion, which is an all-time high, not just for a first quarter, but for any quarter.  Our revenue includes 22% growth from our transportation segment where the truck brokerage market is white-hot and the LTL environment is coming back strong. And in logistics, our revenue growth was a hefty 27%. Our logistics segment also had a great first quarter for sales, with a number of large contract wins. Company-wide we set new first quarter records for both net income and adjusted EBITDA. Both of our segments generated robust EBITDA in the first quarter, leading to our third consecutive quarterly record. Our $443 million of adjusted EBITDA was a year-over-year increase of 33%, and our first quarter adjusted EBITDA margin of 9.3% was up from the prior year by 70 basis points.  Technology and operational excellence were the two big drivers here. Even with the gains we've been reporting, we're confident that we're in the early innings of margin improvement. On the back of our first quarter beat and considering the optimism we're hearing from our customers, we significantly raised our full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $1.825 billion to $1.875 billion.  Our LTL business in North America is on a solid upward trend. Tonnage per day in LTL was up 3.7% in the quarter compared with a year ago, and yield ex fuel was up 4.2%. Our LTL adjusted operating ratio ex real estate improved to a first quarter record of 84.3%, which was 220 basis points better than a year ago. In truck brokerage, the story is growth, growth and more growth. Three months ago, we reported a record fourth quarter for our brokerage business, and now we've driven results higher to top it with another record quarter. Our loads per day in brokerage were substantially better than the market, up year-over-year by 25%. Revenue in brokerage was up 83%, and net revenue was up 132%. Our net revenue margin in brokerage was up 389 basis points to 18.6%. The big driver behind our brokerage performance is our technology and the productivity we're getting from XPO Connect, our digital platform. Over the last five years, our technology enabled us to handle 41% more volume with just a 3% increase in sales and procurement head count. In logistics, our growth is being driven by the big three tailwinds of e-commerce, outsourcing, and customer demand for warehouse automation. I'm delighted to report that we recently won the largest contract in the history of our North American logistics business. It's also the largest win for our company overall at $1.8 billion of projected revenue through 2032. This includes both an extension and an expansion with a longstanding customer.  Malcolm will talk about some other recent wins in a minute, including three major brands that in total will be using over $1 billion of our logistics services over the next five years. We're also continuing to make excellent progress on GXO, the planned spin-off of our logistics business. We remain on track to complete the spin in the second half of the year, and our goal is to have GXO be investment grade from day one, followed by XPO. Our strategy and our spin address the consistent themes we've heard from shareholders over the last year \u2014 to simplify the company and reduce leverage. With that, I'll ask Malcolm to share some recent developments in our logistics business. Malcolm?\nMalcolm Wilson: Thank you, Brad. Demand for our logistics services is very strong due to a combination of secular tailwinds and our company's positioning within this environment. The three big mega trends of outsourcing, e-commerce, and warehouse automation are driving the double-digit revenue and EBITDA growth in our logistics. Outsourcing has been a consistent trend for years, but it accelerated as a result of the pandemic. Large companies have become more aware of both the critical importance of supply chain continuity to their success and the potential vulnerability of handling logistics completely in-house. We collaborate strategically with customers to help them redesign their supply chains, and we give them greater visibility and flexibility through our technology. This sustained rise in e-commerce we're seeing is a secular shift in consumer buying behavior. We can all relate to this. Right now, order fulfillment times are being compressed, most notably in the [direct-to-consumer e-commerce] [corrected by company after the call] space. What used to be a five-day logistics process is now down to one day or less. Advanced automation and intelligent machines are cost-effective ways to meet these expectations. In consumer end markets where supply chains are becoming increasingly complex, our investments in robotics and advanced automation are delivering fast, smarter logistics processes at lower cost for our customers and our company. We're utilizing more and more robotic technology to deliver crucial improvements in speed, control, accuracy, safety, quality of employment, and consistency of outcomes. This gives us strong positioning as a large-scale operator and industry innovator. [More than ever before, our] [corrected by company after the call] blue-chip customers see the strategically and deeply integrated solutions we provide as mission critical. This is evident in the growing number [customers who are awarding us business] [corrected by company after the call]. In the first quarter, we had a number of important wins with some significant value attached to each of them. As Brad mentioned, one of these wins is the largest contract in our company's history.  We also won several other very large customer contracts. An exciting development is the contract we just signed with Apple, who is a major new customer for us. We'll open a massive distribution center for Apple in Indiana with over 1 million square feet of state-of-the-art space for e-commerce fulfillment. It will be direct-to-consumer distribution that uses advanced automation [to accelerate deliveries] [corrected by company after the call] and robots to personalize products before we ship them to consumers. Two other examples of large customer wins in Europe are ASOS and Waitrose. ASOS is a global online fashion retailer we've been serving since 2014. Our recent agreement with them is a pair of contracts that further cement our position as the UK's e-fulfillment leader. ASOS has renewed our [operation of a large] [corrected by company after the call] distribution center and expanded the relationship with a second hub we'll open next month.  Waitrose is a prominent UK food retailer that values our specialized expertise in temperature control and ambient food distribution. We implemented our first contract with Waitrose in the midst of COVID last year, and this year they're entrusting us to run an incremental distribution center. These contracts demonstrate how blue-chip customers trust our reliability and value our ability to deliver innovation. They're great examples of tremendous potential for profitable growth we're seeing in the logistics landscape in Europe and North America.  Of our new business signings overall, there's a good balance between established customers seeking longer-term contracts and new first-time customers like Apple. All in all, year-to-date we're executing on customer agreements with a combined value of more than $4 billion over the contract life. These agreements also give us great visibility into future revenue and margin performance in our Logistics business, which is planned to be spun off as GXO. All of the work streams required for the spin are in good shape and running to schedule. Importantly, we've been building the GXO C-suite over the last month with strong internal appointments and external hires. I'd like to mention Baris Oran, who will be GXO's Chief Financial Officer. Baris is a hands-on CFO who also thinks strategically about value creation. During his tenure as CFO of the Sabanci Group, he led the multinational finance operation of one of Turkey's largest publicly traded companies.  I'm also pleased to welcome Mark Manduca who will be our Chief Investment Officer. Mark has been the number one ranked transport analyst in Europe for eight years in a row with an impressive track record at Citigroup [and Bank of America] [corrected by company after the call]. GXO will be a high-growth company, and I'm pleased that we're making great progress in bringing a world-class team together in preparation to lead that growth. There will be more announcements to come. Now, David will go over the quarter.\nDavid Wyshner: Thanks, Malcolm, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'd like to discuss our first quarter results, our balance sheet and liquidity, and our updated outlook for 2021. In the first quarter, we generated revenue of $4.8 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $443 million. The revenue number reflects a year-over-year increase of more than 20%. Adjusted EBITDA is up more than 30%, and both figures are higher than we expected at the beginning of the quarter. Our record Q1 adjusted EBITDA reflects commercial momentum and powerful execution across our business units in a strong ongoing economic recovery. As Brad mentioned, revenue grew 24% year-over-year in the first quarter. Our U.K. logistics acquisition contributed 3 points of revenue growth and foreign exchange contributed three points. As a result, our organic revenue growth in the quarter was 18%. Our revenue growth translated into even stronger adjusted EBITDA growth of 33%, and our EBITDA margin increased 70 basis points year over year. We had limited COVID impact on first quarter EBITDA last year, so our year-over-year growth this year largely reflects our strong operational execution and favorable market dynamics. Both of our segments made a strong contribution to our adjusted EBITDA growth. Logistics adjusted EBITDA increased by 28% in the first quarter and transportation adjusted EBITDA was up 36%. We continue to see robust consumer demand and a more modest rebound in industrial activity. And as revenue increased, we benefited from the operating leverage inherent in our business and the cost reduction actions we took last year. Weather also affected us in February, but the negative impact in the quarter was minimal. Matt will review our segment detail in a few minutes. Our adjusted earnings were $1.46 per diluted share in the quarter, which is more than double what they were last year. We generated $173 million of cash flow from operations in the first quarter, spent $140 million on gross CapEx, and received $36 million of proceeds from asset sales. As a result, we generated free cash flow of $69 million in the quarter. Q1 free cash flow exceeded our expectation despite stronger-than-expected revenue that gave rise to a use of working capital for receivables in the period. Maintaining strong liquidity continues to be a top priority for us as an organization. Our cash balance at March 31 was $629 million. This cash, combined with available debt capacity under committed borrowing facilities, gives us nearly $2 billion of liquidity at quarter end. We redeemed our 6.5% senior notes due 2022 in January. This reduced both our debt balance and our cash by $1.2 billion. We also refinanced our $2 billion term loan in March, lowering the average interest rate by 0.375%. We had no borrowings outstanding under our ABL facility at quarter end, and we have no significant debt maturities until September 2023. Our net leverage at March 31 was 3.1 times LTM adjusted EBITDA and 2.5 times the midpoint of our projected 2021 adjusted EBITDA. Our free cash flow in 2020 and our EBITDA growth in 2021 are helping us delever fairly swiftly. Our steady progress on this metric is important in the context of our commitment to move both XPO and GXO toward investment-grade ratings. Over the last several weeks we've spoken with the rating agencies about GXO. In those discussions, we've highlighted how GXO's business model is based on contractual commitments and long-term relationships with a diversified group of blue-chip customers. These are attractive attributes from a credit perspective. Our plan is for GXO to be investment grade from day one. We expect to have more details soon about precisely how much debt GXO will carry, and how the proceeds paid over to XPO RemainCo will be deployed. Turning to our outlook. We've updated our full-year guidance to reflect our strong first quarter results as well as our expectation that the effects of COVID on our business will continue to moderate in 2021. All of our projections exclude impacts from our planned spin-off of GXO. As Brad highlighted, we now expect to generate $1.825 billion to $1.875 billion of adjusted EBITDA this year, with growth of 28% to 32% in our logistics segment and 30% to 34% in transportation. Our outlook assumes a modest amount of ongoing COVID-related costs in Q2 and Q3 and intentionally lower year-over-year gains from LTL real estate sales. We expect that consumer demand will continue to be solid, e-commerce will continue to grow, industrial demand will continue to recover, and new business opportunities will continue to emerge. In fact, that is precisely what we've seen so far this year. In the second quarter, we expect that our adjusted EBITDA will be in the mid-20s as a percentage of our full-year adjusted EBITDA, which is typical seasonality for us. We expect continued strong margin performance in our LTL business and about $5 million of gains from LTL real estate sales versus $10 million in last year's second quarter. Our year-over-year growth metrics in Q2 will be extremely strong due to the significant pandemic impacts we experienced in the second quarter of 2020. On the cash flow front, we've upped our estimate of full-year free cash flow to a range of $650 million to $725 million. We've also upped our full-year CapEx estimates by $25 million, and are now targeting roughly $675 million of gross capital expenditures and $525 million of net CapEx. These estimates could vary based on new business opportunities in our logistics segment. We currently expect D&A, excluding the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles to be $625 million to $645 million. Due to our opportunistic term loan refinancing in March, we're now forecasting $270 million to $280 million of interest expense in 2021, which represents a $50 million year-over-year reduction. And we continue to estimate that our effective tax rate will be in the 24% to 26% range. As a result, and with roughly 113 million diluted common shares outstanding this year, we're now projecting adjusted earnings of $5.90 to $6.50 per diluted share. At the midpoint, this is year-over-year EPS growth of 109%. In sum, our business has been firing on all cylinders. In Q1, we generated stellar top-line growth and even stronger bottom-line growth. We grew our margins in the process, and we've now delivered three straight quarterly records for adjusted EBITDA. Our results not only reflect strong execution throughout our operations, they also underscore how our businesses are strategically well positioned to meet customers' needs and capture profitable growth opportunities in logistics, LTL, and brokerage. We remain enthusiastic about our prospects as a leader in the markets we serve, and we're proceeding decisively toward the planned spin-off of our logistics business with the wind at our back. I'll now turn things over to Matt.\nMatthew Fassler: Thanks, David. I'll review the first quarter operating results starting with our transportation segment. We had a very strong quarter in North American LTL, driven by the recovery in the U.S. economy, a healthy pricing backdrop, and our ongoing progress improving our pricing and operating disciplines. Our LTL revenue growth accelerated to 7.1% and revenue ex fuel grew by 6.7%. These were our strongest year-on-year growth rates in LTL since we acquired the business in 2015. We also grew tonnage per day by 3.7% year-over-year, which was a pickup from the fourth quarter of 2.1 percentage points. Shipments per day rose 2.4%, accelerating by 3.1 percentage points from the fourth quarter. Tonnage improved in five of our six largest verticals, which together comprise over 80% of our volume. Retail and consumer verticals remained stronger than industrial, but trends in industrial continued to improve, most notably late in the quarter. Tonnage and shipment count both outperformed typical seasonality. Our weight per day ticked down by 10 basis points from Q4, outperforming the typical Q1 decline of 90 basis points. Yield excluding fuel rose 4.2% year over year, which was a sharp acceleration from the 1.5% increase we posted in the fourth quarter. Revenue per shipment excluding fuel grew 5.5%, improving from the 3.8% growth we had in the fourth quarter. Growth in revenue per day excluding fuel accelerated to 8.4%, up 4.7 percentage points from Q4. Our LTL adjusted operating ratio of 82.6% compared favorably to 83.4% a year ago. Excluding real estate gains, our adjusted OR improved to 84.3%, which was 220 basis points better than the first quarter a year ago. Our adjusted OR ex real estate gains also improved sequentially by 20 basis points. And adjusted operating income ex real estate increased by 23% year-over-year. Importantly, we're seeing ongoing improvements in productivity in LTL. Our load factor increased by 2.3% year-over-year, and we reduced empty miles by 6%. And we were 4.8% more efficient in pickup and delivery than we were in Q1 last year aided by our XPO Smart labor management tools. We're firmly on track to deliver at least $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA in LTL next year driven by both revenue growth and continued improvement in our operating ratio. Turning to truck brokerage. Our North American truck brokerage business delivered another spectacular quarter. On a year-over-year basis, we generated an 83% increase in revenue and more than doubled net revenue with an increase of 132%. Loads per day increased by 25%, once again sharply outpacing the market, and net revenue margin rate increased by nearly 400 basis points to 18.6%. We controlled costs well and earnings growth in truck brokerage substantially outpaced an increase in net revenue. Truckload capacity was quite tight in Q1 with a high load-to-truck ratio. Our technology team and carrier network working together allowed us to find capacity for our customers. I want to take a step back for a minute to last year's third quarter in brokerage, when we made the decision to invest in headcount at a time when our competitors were pulling back. This may have seemed counterintuitive at the time, given the environment as it was, but we had a plan to be first out of the gate in the recovery, and now it's paying off. Our new hires are ramping productivity significantly faster than in the past, aided by XPO Connect. And over time, as you heard from Brad earlier, our productivity and brokerage has increased dramatically. Carrier and customer adoption of XPO Connect continues to surge. We approached 400,000 downloads of the platform's mobile app in Q1, representing 30% growth quarter-over-quarter and tripling the cumulative number of downloads year over year. In the first quarter, we topped 81,000 registered carrier accounts on XPO Connect, up nearly 50% year-over-year, and the number of customer accounts on the platform grew sequentially from the fourth quarter to the first quarter of 2021 by 16%. We're also securing volumes through API technology at a profitable clip. Looking at our transportation segment overall, ear-over-year, we increased first quarter revenue by 22% and increased adjusted EBITDA by 36%. Our adjusted EBITDA margin in the segment was 11.5% compared with 10.3% a year ago. We project 30% to 34% growth in full-year adjusted EBITDA in the Transportation segment, which is above our prior outlook of 24% to 29%. Turning to our logistics segment. We increased revenue by 27% in the first quarter year-over-year. Organic revenue growth accelerated to 13% from 9% in the fourth quarter. The remainder of our revenue growth reflected our U.K. acquisition and favorable FX conversion. We saw exceptionally strong growth from our customers in the omnichannel retail, CPG, and technology verticals. The holiday peak was not only an early peak, it was an extended peak as well, and our warehouse operations were running at a high velocity for our customers in consumer-facing businesses. These sectors \u2014 e-commerce, reverse logistics, consumer tech \u2014 continue to represent enormous new revenue opportunities for us. In Europe, our logistics business generated 15% organic growth, which underpinned the 38% year-over-year increase in our revenue. In North American logistics, we grew revenue by 9% over last year. Labor is still tight, but we're managing it well. We continue to see 5% to 7% productivity improvement with XPO Smart, our proprietary suite of intelligent analytics and labor management tools. This technology is rolled out in most of our North American warehouses and more than half of our European sites. Globally in logistics, our adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was 28% higher than in Q1 last year, and our adjusted EBITDA margin increased 10 basis points to 8.5%. As David mentioned, we expect annual adjusted EBITDA growth in this segment. We expect it to grow 28% to 32%, which is above our prior forecast of 24% to 29%. We're pleased that the strong momentum we achieved in the first quarter continued through April. The industrial rebound is helping our LTL business, with a lot more runway to the recovery. The pricing environment remains helpful, and it's showing up in our yield, which is outperforming typical seasonality. In brokerage, capacity is still tight, and the volume backdrop remains fantastic. In logistics, new contracts are on the rise. Malcolm gave you a sense of just how exciting our growth prospects are in Logistics. The operations we acquired in the U.K. and Ireland are ramping up volumes as COVID restrictions are lifted. We're also seeing the resumption of more normal activity in Italy. We're continuing to bring operations online from new business wins in the U.S. as well, and the global tailwind from e-commerce is creating demand for XPO Direct, our shared space distribution network in North America. While we're happy we've delivered a strong quarter, we're also focused on delivering sustainable results for the long term, and increasingly we're collaborating with customers on ESG strategies. This melds with our own pursuit of environmental sustainability, social responsibility, and good governance, and our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. We prioritize these parts of our culture because it's good for our employees and communities and because it helps make XPO a great place to work. When we use our expertise to further our ESG goals, it resonates with like-minded customers who share these values. Within our company, we're tracking about 40 ESG initiatives with a new scorecard that documents our progress. The metrics are largely operational at 25% of the long-term incentive comp for our senior execs is tied to this scorecard. We have a number of initiatives underway to help our customers achieve greener supply chains. For instance, we've had a massive rollout of LED lighting in our warehouses, and we're constantly focused on reducing empty miles in our transportation businesses. We're a leader on alternative fuel vehicles in key European markets where we have over 250 natural gas-powered trucks in our fleet across France, the U.K., and Spain. We've also invested in improving the sustainability of our packaging, waste management, and recycling. I'll close with a few of the accolades we received in the quarter. We were recently named a Forbes Best Company to Work For in Spain for the third straight year. Intel recognized us with their Supplier Achievement Award for our COVID-19 response. And three XPO executives \u2014 Ashfaque Chowdhury, Drew Wilkerson, and Erik Caldwell \u2014 were recognized by Supply & Demand Chain Executive magazine for their accomplishments in the industry. So, altogether an outstanding quarter for our transportation business, our logistics business, and our progress on the spin with much more to come. With that, we'll take your questions. And operator, over to you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nThomas Wadewitz: Yeah, good morning and congratulations on the strong results. Wanted to ask you a bit about pricing and kind of how you think about the contour of that this year. I guess two components. So one would be on LTL pricing. Obviously, you saw a nice acceleration in first quarter. How do we think about where that can go to? If it's 4% in first quarter, can it be 6%, 7% when you get to second half of the year, or is that asking for too much? And then I guess the second question would -- well, actually, let me just leave that and then I'll come back on the second one.\nMatthew Fassler: Tom, the LTL pricing environment is strong. You commented on the acceleration that we noted in our yield in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter. Obviously, the market is tight. There's lots of demand for our capacity. Our price increases on contract renewals continue to move in the right direction both quarter-over-quarter and month over month and into the second quarter. So that's a very helpful harbinger of the yield outlook for the rest of the year which is a good one.\nThomas Wadewitz: So then the second question would be on logistics. I think it's quite evident on transport that there's a very favorable dynamic, supply-demand is very tight, and that's benefiting pricing. Is there any impact in logistic pricing? I know it's a very different market. Are you seeing stronger pricing? Would you expect stronger margin performance in logistics contracts you're signing now, or are those markets kind of just disconnected in terms of some of the tightness in pricing and transport and how that could affect whether there's tightness or more pricing in logistics? Thank you.\nMatt Fassler: Tom, one of the things we love about the logistics business is its consistency. That's evident in pricing and it's evident in the kind of financial results that we're able to generate in a variety of backdrops. So, we're able to manage our price movements very well in that business, and you shouldn't expect to see any impact in logistics results based on the movement that you're seeing in transportation markets today. Obviously, to the extent that there are indicators of a strong demand backdrop that's good for the logistics business as it is for transportation, but generally a constructive backdrop there as well.\nThomas Wadewitz: Okay, great. Thank you.\nBrad Jacobs: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nHamzah Mazari: Hey, good morning. My question is on the Logistics GXO side. You've talked about getting to double-digit EBITDA margins. Could you just remind us what the big levers there are to get there and your confidence level in the timeframe?\nMatt Fassler: Sure. First of all, labor productivity. We have our Smart workforce management platform. It drives 5% to 7% labor productivity per annum as we roll it out. That rollout is still maturing in the U.S. and is really in the middle innings at most as you think about Europe. So, there's lots of headway for us to make progress in terms of labor productivity. There's organic growth at existing sites, particularly when you think about our sites with exposure to e-commerce, which is our fastest-growing area right now. That will help us drive operating leverage. There's, of course, the acceleration of the rollout of automation and robotics, a huge part of our value proposition to our customers. There's tremendous new business opportunities. Obviously, we seek out lucrative business opportunities and the incremental revenue helps us drive operating leverage as well. Finally, XPO Direct continues to season and continues to contribute to our profit outlook. So, really, I think those five drivers are going to be the key for our operating leverage and logistics going forward.\nHamzah Mazari: Got it. And just my follow-up question. I'll turn it over. Again, just on logistics. Could you remind us how you think about the reoccurring revenue base in the logistics segment? I know customer retention is high, but when you do lose a customer, do they take that in-house? Do they go to a competitor? Just give us a sense of the reoccurring revenue base in that business.\nMatt Fassler: The renewal and retention rates in contract logistics are very strong. Many of our largest customers have been with us for many, many years. We've had multiple renewals with them, and we expect that to remain the general cadence of the business. There are some instances where we part ways and typically come to an arrangement and then we move on. But generally, the retention and renewal dynamics are very powerful in our logistics franchise.\nHamzah Mazari: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my questions. So I know we've talked about this a little bit in the past on past calls, but sounds like the split's coming along much closer now. So can we just revisit the priorities for each business post-split? I think we're getting some more information from you guys, too. It sounds like investment-grade balance sheets might be in the future as well. So can you talk to maybe the priorities from the capital side as well as maybe a resumption of M&A?\nMatt Fassler: Sure, Brandon. Good morning. So, in terms of capital allocation, we're always looking for the best ROI from the cash that we generate from the business. Our current focus, to your earlier point, is effectuating the spin which is going to create lots of value, then paying down debt to become investment-grade, and then obviously in parallel to that at all times is investing in CapEx. Those are our priorities for capital.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. And does M&A become a bigger piece of the story then once separate?\nMatt Fassler: Accretive M&A and stock buybacks, each of those is really always an option. We're always aware of what's happening in the market. We'll announce any moves after the fact, and we're very highly disciplined, obviously, as we think about those opportunities.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. And then a quick follow-up on the margin question in Logistics. I think you guys brought on a pretty large portfolio of U.K. contracts this quarter. We thought it was going to be potentially dilutive to margins, but it looks like you guys have pretty good performance there. So can you speak to how that business has been integrated?\nMalcolm Wilson: Yeah. Please allow me to just give an update on that. It's Malcolm here. So, in fact, new business coming in has been a combination of brand new customers. So, we've had some really exciting new customers coming in, big whale type of size contracts with established customers and brand new customers, and also we've brought in, in the quarter, the acquisition, the tactical acquisition of the K&N business, and that's come with some real blue-chip customers. Just to remind, that came with new verticals. So, in tech, the e-comm, food services, and beverages, and we've seen very strong synergies coming from that project. We've also seen a lot of synergies coming from customers. There must have been a pent-up demand in those verticals because we've seen a very large sales flow of new opportunities coming into us. And lastly, really, we've renewed and reviewed through some of the existing agreements. So those have all been margin accretive, and I think that's really giving the background that you're describing.\nBrandon Oglenski: Appreciate the feedback, Malcolm.\nBrad Jacobs: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks. Morning, everybody. I wanted to go back to the comment around the GXO leverage and just how this will work. I think the way these things have worked in the past is like SpinCo draws down new debt, the proceeds from that debt are dividended back to RemainCo, which then uses the proceeds to offset dilution. Is that the right pathway and do you expect the dilution at RemainCo to largely be offset pro forma for the spin of GXO?\nDavid Wyshner: Good morning. It's David. The way you're thinking about it is the right way to think about it. We're confident that GXO will be investment grade on day one. We haven't announced a precise capitalization plan yet, and we're still talking to the rating agencies. But as you say, the remainder of the debt will stay with XPO RemainCo, and we want to drive RemainCo to being investment grade soon. And from a process standpoint, to the extent that we issue debt for GXO, some or most of that cash would be dividended up to XPO to pay down RemainCo debt. And so that will allow us to reduce the leverage. In addition to that, we generate a lot of cash and we're prioritizing the allocation of that cash to pay down debt. And to me what's really exciting is that if you look at the Q1 balance sheet for the combined company, net leverage is at 2.5 times our current EBITDA guidance for this year. And that means that the aggregate amount of debt that needs to be allocated between the two companies is manageable and really positions us well for GXO to be investment grade on day one and for XPO RemainCo to move rapidly to being investment grade.\nAmit Mehrotra: Got it. So it's not really an offsetting of dilution but really a transfer of the debt load from XPO to GXO because of the recurring revenue stream and the asset-light intensity of GXO. Correct me if I'm wrong on that but I'll move on to my follow-up if it's okay. So Matt, I think the operating leverage in the business will tick up in the second quarter just given more growth coming from LTL. I think that's kind of a consolidated dynamic. But if I just look at Logistics, and I think this is kind of important as it relates to GXO, this is an asset-light business. I assume most of the D&A is amortization of intangibles as opposed to depreciation of the asset base. But if I look at the Logistics business, given that asset-light nature, I guess ROIC is the best way to look at that business. And so is there any way you or Malcolm or somebody could talk to us about what these new contracts that they're bringing on \u2014 they\u2019re humongous \u2014 are underwriting from an ROIC perspective? I guess you look at it on a project basis because of the contract nature of the business, but any help there in terms of what the ROIC is being underwritten at in terms of what these new contracts are coming on?\nMatthew Fassler: Sure. You're absolutely right. We look at every project at the project level. We solve for pre-tax and after-tax ROIC. We look at the IRR. We look for a return on capital at the project level of at least 20% and approaching 30% over the life of the first contract. We get paid back and more on the first contract, assuming no renewals. Obviously, we have a very strong track record of generating renewals, and we're extremely disciplined about the kind of new business we take in and the financial profile of the business that we bring in. That's critical to our success in contract logistics.\nAmit Mehrotra: So, on an unallocated basis, you're saying the ROIC of Logistics is 20% to 30% and on a fully allocated basis it's what 10% to 15%?\nMatthew Fassler: We'll share more of those numbers with you as the Form 10 comes out, but at the project level, that's what you tend to see. Then obviously there's some G&A, et cetera, that you layer on. We obviously think about all the associated overhead, any incremental overhead as we consider bringing on a customer or a new project.\nAmit Mehrotra: Okay. Thank you very much, guys. Appreciate it.\nBrad Jacobs: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Wetherbee: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Wanted to touch on the EBITDA guidance and maybe a little bit about seasonality. I think 2Q is expected to kind of move back into the mid-20s range, which I think is typical from a seasonal perspective. Obviously, a strong outperformance in the first quarter. So I guess I just wanted to make sure I understood some of the moving parts in terms of cost, maybe revenue growth, obviously the comps are fairly challenging, that sort of leads going from the significant outperformance from an EBITDA seasonality standpoint in 1Q to maybe something that's a little bit more normal, and do you think that kind of lasts for rest of the year? So just some helpful color around the seasonality of the profits of the business.\nMatt Fassler: Chris, we had a really, really good first quarter in a terrific environment. We're going to have a very strong second quarter. We framed the seasonality for you. David did, he talked about mid-20s as a share of the year. Obviously we expected a very good year as well. We talked about the EBITDA guidance for the Europe for the company overall and for each of the businesses, and we see obviously a very strong performance in the second quarter, very good trends both in Transportation and Logistics.\nChris Wetherbee: So nothing specific that's changing materially from 1Q to 2Q about the business environment or otherwise that maybe sort of changes the dynamic of seasonality?\nDavid Wyshner: No particular changes. Obviously, the year-over-year comps are strange this year because of the pandemic last year, but when we look at the year overall, we\u2019ve delivered 33% EBITDA growth in the first quarter, and that's right at the midpoint of what we're expecting for the year as a whole. So, I think there's a consistency there between our first quarter results and what we're expecting for the full year on a year-over-year basis. The comps will be easier in the second quarter because of the pandemic effects last year and will be tougher in the second half.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay. Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate it. And then if you guys could help maybe share -- you mentioned some of the leverage numbers on the EBITDA guidance as it stands right now and I think you've talked to the rating agencies recently. So what does investment grade look like for GXO in terms of leverage and maybe how do we think about that for both companies I guess? Any sort of guidance that you've gotten or helpful color would be interesting.\nDavid Wyshner: We're really still working through the details of that, and we expect to have more details around that soon. What I would emphasize is that we're confident that GXO can be investment grade on day one and that would allow us to -- give us the flexibility to issue some debt that GXO can support and still be investment grade, and dividend those funds across to XPO to reduce the amount of net leverage remaining at XPO following the spin.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay. Great. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it.\nBrad Jacobs: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nTodd Fowler: Great. Thanks and good morning. The Logistics pipeline sounds very healthy, obviously very strong right now as we look out to the rest of the year. Also we understand that there's some benefit on the comps from the acquired Kuehne + Nagel business. But how are you thinking about Logistics revenue growth with where the pipeline is at? Basically, when does the pipeline start to translate into revenue maybe for the remainder of '21 and then some thoughts on kind of what you'd expect for a normalized top line growth rate in Logistics beyond '21?\nMatthew Fassler: Sure. So, the business that we spoke about today, some of it comes online later this year, more of it comes online in 2022. That said, there's new business that we underwrote and signed previous to today, which we've discussed and signed prior, which is going to flow in, obviously, to revenue in the second quarter, third quarter, et cetera. So, there's a very nice, consistent flow of revenue from new business meeting its way into the -- into our logistics operations.  In terms of the long-term cadence of logistics revenue, it's certainly at least a high single-digit growth rate is the algorithm that we've spoken about over time. And I think that's a pretty good way to think about the long-term revenue algorithm for contract logistics. \nTodd Fowler: Okay. Great, Matt. And then as a follow-up. Obviously, some advantage on the decisions you've made on the brokerage side to add headcount into the market. The volume growth there is just exceptionally strong right now. How do you think about the stickiness of some of that business? I mean once you're handling some of that volume, is that more transactional that if we start to see the market become more balanced at some point in the future that reverts back to a contracted or an asset-based carrier, or how should we think about some of the success that you're having in the strong brokerage top line and volume growth that you've seen recently? Thanks.\nMatthew Fassler: We have a terrific customer base, we have terrific people, and we have terrific technology. And we've delivered for those customers during this very tight market. We expect the strength of the franchise to continue to resonate through the cycle and really across the vagaries of any truck brokerage cycles. We feel exceptionally good about the durability of the franchise and the sustainability of strong results relative to the market in brokerage.\nTodd Fowler: Thanks for the time.\nBrad Jacobs: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer & Co. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks very much. I'm going to ask about last mile. I know it's small. It doesn't get a lot of airtime anymore. But looked like a really strong quarter. Would love if you could elaborate on that, both in North America and in Europe. Thanks.\nMatthew Fassler: It was. It was a terrific quarter for last mile. Focusing on North America for a moment. Demand for heavy goods is still very, very strong. Our revenue growth was 22% year over year, and importantly, we're continuing to drive volume through our network of 85 last mile hubs. We're leveraging those facilities and their proximity to population centers around the U.S. Recall that we're the leading outsourced provider of last mile logistics for heavy goods and the largest provider for many of the leading retailers and e-tailers. In Europe this business is at an earlier stage of its development, but the results there were outstanding, stronger growth in general in last mile in Europe than we have in the U.S. So very strong quarter for last mile in both regions, Scott.\nScott Schneeberger: Great. Thanks on that. And then on XPO Direct in contract logistics, I'm curious -- congratulations on a really strong first quarter with these wins. How is XPO Direct affected and how are you progressing towards your long-term objectives there?\nMatthew Fassler: XPO Direct is doing really well. It obviously outgrew the North American business nicely. It's a critical service for emerging e-commerce players, direct to consumer players who don't have their own distribution capacity and are seeking to build their connectivity with consumers. It's a very differentiated offering in the market, and it's a real nice element of the growth story that we have in contract logistics.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks very much.\nBrad Jacobs: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael DiMattia: Hi, good morning. This is Michael DiMattia on behalf of Allison. Strong quarter in LTL. Just had a question on strategic priorities for the business with RemainCo post the spin. And also as we look at over the next three to five years, what a realistic OR for this business can be as it gets more attention? Can it sustainably be a 75 to 80 OR business?\nMatthew Fassler: The strategic priority for LTL is obviously to drive more EBITDA, and that's our number one priority, to simplify it for you. We have an initial goal for 2022 of at least a $1 billion of adjusted [EBITDA] [corrected by company after the call], as I said in my earlier remarks, and that's going to result from a combination of revenue and operating leverage. Remember that in LTL, we have a number of very high potential technology efforts underway. We're working on our labor optimization through XPO Smart. Obviously, our route optimization impacting both linehaul and P&D, and you saw some of the impact of that manifest itself in the first quarter. And then obviously the work we're doing on LTL pricing elasticity, optimizing our pricing as we get better and better data on the market, and to use our own data more effectively. Each of these technology initiatives has lots of runway and is going to help us drive our profitability going forward. If higher OR was good OR, I'd say the sky is the limit, but I think you get my point. We have lots of opportunity to improve our operating ratio further from here in LTL.\nMichael DiMattia: That sounds great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Seidl: Thank you, operator. Gentlemen, good morning. Two quick questions one on the LTL front. That seems to be a little bit more weighted towards the industrial manufacturing side of the economy. That's coming back, but it's still slower than the consumer. How should we think about tonnage growth as we move into the back half of the year and then early '22?\nMatthew Fassler: Obviously, Jason, tonnage growth in the second quarter is going to look amazing. Think about our compare. But the good story here, we obviously just finished April, so had a fresh look at the numbers. The March -- the April weight per day compared to March weight per day relative to typical seasonality was slightly better. So, it's not just easier comps. There's also intrinsic, underlying acceleration in that LTL business. So, we'll have very, very strong tonnage growth in the second quarter and healthy tonnage growth we think in the second half of the year as well. Obviously, the comparisons normalize a bit, but we have a very good outlook for tonnage.\nJason Seidl: Okay. That's a good color. I want to also switch onto logistics side and how we should think about XPO sort of returns as they open up more and more of sort of these modern facilities that feature more and more robotics. How's the margin profile on a new facility like that compared to a more legacy facility that doesn't use that type of technology?\nMatthew Fassler: Every project is different. As I said in the answer to an earlier question, we underwrite every project considering the capital that we deploy, the duration of the contract, and all of those considerations. And whatever the automation is, whatever the robotic component, we still have the same financial framework for evaluating the project. So we underwrite a project if it's promising for our customer and financially promising for us and for our shareholders, and we work with every proposal to ensure that it will deliver on that potential regardless of the amount of automation and technology. It just so happens, we have lots of very compelling opportunities to introduce advanced automation and robotics. It's one of the things that our customers are looking to us for. It's one of the big drivers of outsourcing in contract logistics. It ties in very well obviously to e-commerce and omnichannel retail. So all those themes are really converging. And obviously, we're considering that as we underwrite our financial proposition. And keep in mind, automation becomes more and more cost effective over time. And the lead we have in implementing this automation helps differentiate us from the rest of the marketplace, both in delivering for customers and in delivering the associated financials for shareholders.\nJason Seidl: So I guess the best way to think about it is the contracts are done on a contract-by-contract basis and you pretty much put in good returns to make sure that you're covering your investments, but the technology that you're employing in the marketplace is going to help you win more and more awards as we go forward.\nBrad Jacobs: You nailed it.\nJason Seidl: All right, perfect. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.\nBrad Jacobs: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our time allowed for questions. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Jacobs for any final comments.\nBrad Jacobs: Thank you, operator. So let me conclude by highlighting: in LTL, we improved the operating ratio by 220 basis points; in truck brokerage, we grew loads by 25% and net revenue by 132%; in logistics, we signed a bunch of whales, massive contracts with premier customers, both here in the United States and in Europe, each worth hundreds of millions of dollars over the life of the contract, one worth significantly more than that; and in logistics, we're benefiting from three powerful growth drivers, outsourcing, warehouse automation, and e-commerce. And finally, based on the Q1 beat and the strength we're seeing in April, we raised guidance significantly for the full year. We raised the new low end above the prior high end. So, I'd like to thank the team. None of these accomplishments were done by any one specific person. It's always the team. So XPO, good job. Thank you. See you in 90 days.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Matthew Fassler",
            "content": "Thanks, David. I'll review the first quarter operating results starting with our transportation segment. We had a very strong quarter in North American LTL, driven by the recovery in the U.S. economy, a healthy pricing backdrop, and our ongoing progress improving our pricing and operating disciplines. Our LTL revenue growth accelerated to 7.1% and revenue ex fuel grew by 6.7%. These were our strongest year-on-year growth rates in LTL since we acquired the business in 2015. We also grew tonnage per day by 3.7% year-over-year, which was a pickup from the fourth quarter of 2.1 percentage points. Shipments per day rose 2.4%, accelerating by 3.1 percentage points from the fourth quarter. Tonnage improved in five of our six largest verticals, which together comprise over 80% of our volume. Retail and consumer verticals remained stronger than industrial, but trends in industrial continued to improve, most notably late in the quarter. Tonnage and shipment count both outperformed typical seasonality. Our weight per day ticked down by 10 basis points from Q4, outperforming the typical Q1 decline of 90 basis points. Yield excluding fuel rose 4.2% year over year, which was a sharp acceleration from the 1.5% increase we posted in the fourth quarter. Revenue per shipment excluding fuel grew 5.5%, improving from the 3.8% growth we had in the fourth quarter. Growth in revenue per day excluding fuel accelerated to 8.4%, up 4.7 percentage points from Q4. Our LTL adjusted operating ratio of 82.6% compared favorably to 83.4% a year ago. Excluding real estate gains, our adjusted OR improved to 84.3%, which was 220 basis points better than the first quarter a year ago. Our adjusted OR ex real estate gains also improved sequentially by 20 basis points. And adjusted operating income ex real estate increased by 23% year-over-year. Importantly, we're seeing ongoing improvements in productivity in LTL. Our load factor increased by 2.3% year-over-year, and we reduced empty miles by 6%. And we were 4.8% more efficient in pickup and delivery than we were in Q1 last year aided by our XPO Smart labor management tools. We're firmly on track to deliver at least $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA in LTL next year driven by both revenue growth and continued improvement in our operating ratio. Turning to truck brokerage. Our North American truck brokerage business delivered another spectacular quarter. On a year-over-year basis, we generated an 83% increase in revenue and more than doubled net revenue with an increase of 132%. Loads per day increased by 25%, once again sharply outpacing the market, and net revenue margin rate increased by nearly 400 basis points to 18.6%. We controlled costs well and earnings growth in truck brokerage substantially outpaced an increase in net revenue. Truckload capacity was quite tight in Q1 with a high load-to-truck ratio. Our technology team and carrier network working together allowed us to find capacity for our customers. I want to take a step back for a minute to last year's third quarter in brokerage, when we made the decision to invest in headcount at a time when our competitors were pulling back. This may have seemed counterintuitive at the time, given the environment as it was, but we had a plan to be first out of the gate in the recovery, and now it's paying off. Our new hires are ramping productivity significantly faster than in the past, aided by XPO Connect. And over time, as you heard from Brad earlier, our productivity and brokerage has increased dramatically. Carrier and customer adoption of XPO Connect continues to surge. We approached 400,000 downloads of the platform's mobile app in Q1, representing 30% growth quarter-over-quarter and tripling the cumulative number of downloads year over year. In the first quarter, we topped 81,000 registered carrier accounts on XPO Connect, up nearly 50% year-over-year, and the number of customer accounts on the platform grew sequentially from the fourth quarter to the first quarter of 2021 by 16%. We're also securing volumes through API technology at a profitable clip. Looking at our transportation segment overall, ear-over-year, we increased first quarter revenue by 22% and increased adjusted EBITDA by 36%. Our adjusted EBITDA margin in the segment was 11.5% compared with 10.3% a year ago. We project 30% to 34% growth in full-year adjusted EBITDA in the Transportation segment, which is above our prior outlook of 24% to 29%. Turning to our logistics segment. We increased revenue by 27% in the first quarter year-over-year. Organic revenue growth accelerated to 13% from 9% in the fourth quarter. The remainder of our revenue growth reflected our U.K. acquisition and favorable FX conversion. We saw exceptionally strong growth from our customers in the omnichannel retail, CPG, and technology verticals. The holiday peak was not only an early peak, it was an extended peak as well, and our warehouse operations were running at a high velocity for our customers in consumer-facing businesses. These sectors \u2014 e-commerce, reverse logistics, consumer tech \u2014 continue to represent enormous new revenue opportunities for us. In Europe, our logistics business generated 15% organic growth, which underpinned the 38% year-over-year increase in our revenue. In North American logistics, we grew revenue by 9% over last year. Labor is still tight, but we're managing it well. We continue to see 5% to 7% productivity improvement with XPO Smart, our proprietary suite of intelligent analytics and labor management tools. This technology is rolled out in most of our North American warehouses and more than half of our European sites. Globally in logistics, our adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was 28% higher than in Q1 last year, and our adjusted EBITDA margin increased 10 basis points to 8.5%. As David mentioned, we expect annual adjusted EBITDA growth in this segment. We expect it to grow 28% to 32%, which is above our prior forecast of 24% to 29%. We're pleased that the strong momentum we achieved in the first quarter continued through April. The industrial rebound is helping our LTL business, with a lot more runway to the recovery. The pricing environment remains helpful, and it's showing up in our yield, which is outperforming typical seasonality. In brokerage, capacity is still tight, and the volume backdrop remains fantastic. In logistics, new contracts are on the rise. Malcolm gave you a sense of just how exciting our growth prospects are in Logistics. The operations we acquired in the U.K. and Ireland are ramping up volumes as COVID restrictions are lifted. We're also seeing the resumption of more normal activity in Italy. We're continuing to bring operations online from new business wins in the U.S. as well, and the global tailwind from e-commerce is creating demand for XPO Direct, our shared space distribution network in North America. While we're happy we've delivered a strong quarter, we're also focused on delivering sustainable results for the long term, and increasingly we're collaborating with customers on ESG strategies. This melds with our own pursuit of environmental sustainability, social responsibility, and good governance, and our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. We prioritize these parts of our culture because it's good for our employees and communities and because it helps make XPO a great place to work. When we use our expertise to further our ESG goals, it resonates with like-minded customers who share these values. Within our company, we're tracking about 40 ESG initiatives with a new scorecard that documents our progress. The metrics are largely operational at 25% of the long-term incentive comp for our senior execs is tied to this scorecard. We have a number of initiatives underway to help our customers achieve greener supply chains. For instance, we've had a massive rollout of LED lighting in our warehouses, and we're constantly focused on reducing empty miles in our transportation businesses. We're a leader on alternative fuel vehicles in key European markets where we have over 250 natural gas-powered trucks in our fleet across France, the U.K., and Spain. We've also invested in improving the sustainability of our packaging, waste management, and recycling. I'll close with a few of the accolades we received in the quarter. We were recently named a Forbes Best Company to Work For in Spain for the third straight year. Intel recognized us with their Supplier Achievement Award for our COVID-19 response. And three XPO executives \u2014 Ashfaque Chowdhury, Drew Wilkerson, and Erik Caldwell \u2014 were recognized by Supply & Demand Chain Executive magazine for their accomplishments in the industry. So, altogether an outstanding quarter for our transportation business, our logistics business, and our progress on the spin with much more to come. With that, we'll take your questions. And operator, over to you. Tom, the LTL pricing environment is strong. You commented on the acceleration that we noted in our yield in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter. Obviously, the market is tight. There's lots of demand for our capacity. Our price increases on contract renewals continue to move in the right direction both quarter-over-quarter and month over month and into the second quarter. So that's a very helpful harbinger of the yield outlook for the rest of the year which is a good one. Sure. You're absolutely right. We look at every project at the project level. We solve for pre-tax and after-tax ROIC. We look at the IRR. We look for a return on capital at the project level of at least 20% and approaching 30% over the life of the first contract. We get paid back and more on the first contract, assuming no renewals. Obviously, we have a very strong track record of generating renewals, and we're extremely disciplined about the kind of new business we take in and the financial profile of the business that we bring in. That's critical to our success in contract logistics. We'll share more of those numbers with you as the Form 10 comes out, but at the project level, that's what you tend to see. Then obviously there's some G&A, et cetera, that you layer on. We obviously think about all the associated overhead, any incremental overhead as we consider bringing on a customer or a new project. Sure. So, the business that we spoke about today, some of it comes online later this year, more of it comes online in 2022. That said, there's new business that we underwrote and signed previous to today, which we've discussed and signed prior, which is going to flow in, obviously, to revenue in the second quarter, third quarter, et cetera. So, there's a very nice, consistent flow of revenue from new business meeting its way into the -- into our logistics operations.  In terms of the long-term cadence of logistics revenue, it's certainly at least a high single-digit growth rate is the algorithm that we've spoken about over time. And I think that's a pretty good way to think about the long-term revenue algorithm for contract logistics. We have a terrific customer base, we have terrific people, and we have terrific technology. And we've delivered for those customers during this very tight market. We expect the strength of the franchise to continue to resonate through the cycle and really across the vagaries of any truck brokerage cycles. We feel exceptionally good about the durability of the franchise and the sustainability of strong results relative to the market in brokerage. It was. It was a terrific quarter for last mile. Focusing on North America for a moment. Demand for heavy goods is still very, very strong. Our revenue growth was 22% year over year, and importantly, we're continuing to drive volume through our network of 85 last mile hubs. We're leveraging those facilities and their proximity to population centers around the U.S. Recall that we're the leading outsourced provider of last mile logistics for heavy goods and the largest provider for many of the leading retailers and e-tailers. In Europe this business is at an earlier stage of its development, but the results there were outstanding, stronger growth in general in last mile in Europe than we have in the U.S. So very strong quarter for last mile in both regions, Scott. XPO Direct is doing really well. It obviously outgrew the North American business nicely. It's a critical service for emerging e-commerce players, direct to consumer players who don't have their own distribution capacity and are seeking to build their connectivity with consumers. It's a very differentiated offering in the market, and it's a real nice element of the growth story that we have in contract logistics. The strategic priority for LTL is obviously to drive more EBITDA, and that's our number one priority, to simplify it for you. We have an initial goal for 2022 of at least a $1 billion of adjusted [EBITDA] [corrected by company after the call], as I said in my earlier remarks, and that's going to result from a combination of revenue and operating leverage. Remember that in LTL, we have a number of very high potential technology efforts underway. We're working on our labor optimization through XPO Smart. Obviously, our route optimization impacting both linehaul and P&D, and you saw some of the impact of that manifest itself in the first quarter. And then obviously the work we're doing on LTL pricing elasticity, optimizing our pricing as we get better and better data on the market, and to use our own data more effectively. Each of these technology initiatives has lots of runway and is going to help us drive our profitability going forward. If higher OR was good OR, I'd say the sky is the limit, but I think you get my point. We have lots of opportunity to improve our operating ratio further from here in LTL. Obviously, Jason, tonnage growth in the second quarter is going to look amazing. Think about our compare. But the good story here, we obviously just finished April, so had a fresh look at the numbers. The March -- the April weight per day compared to March weight per day relative to typical seasonality was slightly better. So, it's not just easier comps. There's also intrinsic, underlying acceleration in that LTL business. So, we'll have very, very strong tonnage growth in the second quarter and healthy tonnage growth we think in the second half of the year as well. Obviously, the comparisons normalize a bit, but we have a very good outlook for tonnage. Every project is different. As I said in the answer to an earlier question, we underwrite every project considering the capital that we deploy, the duration of the contract, and all of those considerations. And whatever the automation is, whatever the robotic component, we still have the same financial framework for evaluating the project. So we underwrite a project if it's promising for our customer and financially promising for us and for our shareholders, and we work with every proposal to ensure that it will deliver on that potential regardless of the amount of automation and technology. It just so happens, we have lots of very compelling opportunities to introduce advanced automation and robotics. It's one of the things that our customers are looking to us for. It's one of the big drivers of outsourcing in contract logistics. It ties in very well obviously to e-commerce and omnichannel retail. So all those themes are really converging. And obviously, we're considering that as we underwrite our financial proposition. And keep in mind, automation becomes more and more cost effective over time. And the lead we have in implementing this automation helps differentiate us from the rest of the marketplace, both in delivering for customers and in delivering the associated financials for shareholders."

            "content": "Thank you, Brad. Demand for our logistics services is very strong due to a combination of secular tailwinds and our company's positioning within this environment. The three big mega trends of outsourcing, e-commerce, and warehouse automation are driving the double-digit revenue and EBITDA growth in our logistics. Outsourcing has been a consistent trend for years, but it accelerated as a result of the pandemic. Large companies have become more aware of both the critical importance of supply chain continuity to their success and the potential vulnerability of handling logistics completely in-house. We collaborate strategically with customers to help them redesign their supply chains, and we give them greater visibility and flexibility through our technology. This sustained rise in e-commerce we're seeing is a secular shift in consumer buying behavior. We can all relate to this. Right now, order fulfillment times are being compressed, most notably in the [direct-to-consumer e-commerce] [corrected by company after the call] space. What used to be a five-day logistics process is now down to one day or less. Advanced automation and intelligent machines are cost-effective ways to meet these expectations. In consumer end markets where supply chains are becoming increasingly complex, our investments in robotics and advanced automation are delivering fast, smarter logistics processes at lower cost for our customers and our company. We're utilizing more and more robotic technology to deliver crucial improvements in speed, control, accuracy, safety, quality of employment, and consistency of outcomes. This gives us strong positioning as a large-scale operator and industry innovator. [More than ever before, our] [corrected by company after the call] blue-chip customers see the strategically and deeply integrated solutions we provide as mission critical. This is evident in the growing number [customers who are awarding us business] [corrected by company after the call]. In the first quarter, we had a number of important wins with some significant value attached to each of them. As Brad mentioned, one of these wins is the largest contract in our company's history.  We also won several other very large customer contracts. An exciting development is the contract we just signed with Apple, who is a major new customer for us. We'll open a massive distribution center for Apple in Indiana with over 1 million square feet of state-of-the-art space for e-commerce fulfillment. It will be direct-to-consumer distribution that uses advanced automation [to accelerate deliveries] [corrected by company after the call] and robots to personalize products before we ship them to consumers. Two other examples of large customer wins in Europe are ASOS and Waitrose. ASOS is a global online fashion retailer we've been serving since 2014. Our recent agreement with them is a pair of contracts that further cement our position as the UK's e-fulfillment leader. ASOS has renewed our [operation of a large] [corrected by company after the call] distribution center and expanded the relationship with a second hub we'll open next month.  Waitrose is a prominent UK food retailer that values our specialized expertise in temperature control and ambient food distribution. We implemented our first contract with Waitrose in the midst of COVID last year, and this year they're entrusting us to run an incremental distribution center. These contracts demonstrate how blue-chip customers trust our reliability and value our ability to deliver innovation. They're great examples of tremendous potential for profitable growth we're seeing in the logistics landscape in Europe and North America.  Of our new business signings overall, there's a good balance between established customers seeking longer-term contracts and new first-time customers like Apple. All in all, year-to-date we're executing on customer agreements with a combined value of more than $4 billion over the contract life. These agreements also give us great visibility into future revenue and margin performance in our Logistics business, which is planned to be spun off as GXO. All of the work streams required for the spin are in good shape and running to schedule. Importantly, we've been building the GXO C-suite over the last month with strong internal appointments and external hires. I'd like to mention Baris Oran, who will be GXO's Chief Financial Officer. Baris is a hands-on CFO who also thinks strategically about value creation. During his tenure as CFO of the Sabanci Group, he led the multinational finance operation of one of Turkey's largest publicly traded companies.  I'm also pleased to welcome Mark Manduca who will be our Chief Investment Officer. Mark has been the number one ranked transport analyst in Europe for eight years in a row with an impressive track record at Citigroup [and Bank of America] [corrected by company after the call]. GXO will be a high-growth company, and I'm pleased that we're making great progress in bringing a world-class team together in preparation to lead that growth. There will be more announcements to come. Now, David will go over the quarter. Yeah. Please allow me to just give an update on that. It's Malcolm here. So, in fact, new business coming in has been a combination of brand new customers. So, we've had some really exciting new customers coming in, big whale type of size contracts with established customers and brand new customers, and also we've brought in, in the quarter, the acquisition, the tactical acquisition of the K&N business, and that's come with some real blue-chip customers. Just to remind, that came with new verticals. So, in tech, the e-comm, food services, and beverages, and we've seen very strong synergies coming from that project. We've also seen a lot of synergies coming from customers. There must have been a pent-up demand in those verticals because we've seen a very large sales flow of new opportunities coming into us. And lastly, really, we've renewed and reviewed through some of the existing agreements. So those have all been margin accretive, and I think that's really giving the background that you're describing."

            "name": "David Wyshner",
            "content": "Thanks, Malcolm, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'd like to discuss our first quarter results, our balance sheet and liquidity, and our updated outlook for 2021. In the first quarter, we generated revenue of $4.8 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $443 million. The revenue number reflects a year-over-year increase of more than 20%. Adjusted EBITDA is up more than 30%, and both figures are higher than we expected at the beginning of the quarter. Our record Q1 adjusted EBITDA reflects commercial momentum and powerful execution across our business units in a strong ongoing economic recovery. As Brad mentioned, revenue grew 24% year-over-year in the first quarter. Our U.K. logistics acquisition contributed 3 points of revenue growth and foreign exchange contributed three points. As a result, our organic revenue growth in the quarter was 18%. Our revenue growth translated into even stronger adjusted EBITDA growth of 33%, and our EBITDA margin increased 70 basis points year over year. We had limited COVID impact on first quarter EBITDA last year, so our year-over-year growth this year largely reflects our strong operational execution and favorable market dynamics. Both of our segments made a strong contribution to our adjusted EBITDA growth. Logistics adjusted EBITDA increased by 28% in the first quarter and transportation adjusted EBITDA was up 36%. We continue to see robust consumer demand and a more modest rebound in industrial activity. And as revenue increased, we benefited from the operating leverage inherent in our business and the cost reduction actions we took last year. Weather also affected us in February, but the negative impact in the quarter was minimal. Matt will review our segment detail in a few minutes. Our adjusted earnings were $1.46 per diluted share in the quarter, which is more than double what they were last year. We generated $173 million of cash flow from operations in the first quarter, spent $140 million on gross CapEx, and received $36 million of proceeds from asset sales. As a result, we generated free cash flow of $69 million in the quarter. Q1 free cash flow exceeded our expectation despite stronger-than-expected revenue that gave rise to a use of working capital for receivables in the period. Maintaining strong liquidity continues to be a top priority for us as an organization. Our cash balance at March 31 was $629 million. This cash, combined with available debt capacity under committed borrowing facilities, gives us nearly $2 billion of liquidity at quarter end. We redeemed our 6.5% senior notes due 2022 in January. This reduced both our debt balance and our cash by $1.2 billion. We also refinanced our $2 billion term loan in March, lowering the average interest rate by 0.375%. We had no borrowings outstanding under our ABL facility at quarter end, and we have no significant debt maturities until September 2023. Our net leverage at March 31 was 3.1 times LTM adjusted EBITDA and 2.5 times the midpoint of our projected 2021 adjusted EBITDA. Our free cash flow in 2020 and our EBITDA growth in 2021 are helping us delever fairly swiftly. Our steady progress on this metric is important in the context of our commitment to move both XPO and GXO toward investment-grade ratings. Over the last several weeks we've spoken with the rating agencies about GXO. In those discussions, we've highlighted how GXO's business model is based on contractual commitments and long-term relationships with a diversified group of blue-chip customers. These are attractive attributes from a credit perspective. Our plan is for GXO to be investment grade from day one. We expect to have more details soon about precisely how much debt GXO will carry, and how the proceeds paid over to XPO RemainCo will be deployed. Turning to our outlook. We've updated our full-year guidance to reflect our strong first quarter results as well as our expectation that the effects of COVID on our business will continue to moderate in 2021. All of our projections exclude impacts from our planned spin-off of GXO. As Brad highlighted, we now expect to generate $1.825 billion to $1.875 billion of adjusted EBITDA this year, with growth of 28% to 32% in our logistics segment and 30% to 34% in transportation. Our outlook assumes a modest amount of ongoing COVID-related costs in Q2 and Q3 and intentionally lower year-over-year gains from LTL real estate sales. We expect that consumer demand will continue to be solid, e-commerce will continue to grow, industrial demand will continue to recover, and new business opportunities will continue to emerge. In fact, that is precisely what we've seen so far this year. In the second quarter, we expect that our adjusted EBITDA will be in the mid-20s as a percentage of our full-year adjusted EBITDA, which is typical seasonality for us. We expect continued strong margin performance in our LTL business and about $5 million of gains from LTL real estate sales versus $10 million in last year's second quarter. Our year-over-year growth metrics in Q2 will be extremely strong due to the significant pandemic impacts we experienced in the second quarter of 2020. On the cash flow front, we've upped our estimate of full-year free cash flow to a range of $650 million to $725 million. We've also upped our full-year CapEx estimates by $25 million, and are now targeting roughly $675 million of gross capital expenditures and $525 million of net CapEx. These estimates could vary based on new business opportunities in our logistics segment. We currently expect D&A, excluding the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles to be $625 million to $645 million. Due to our opportunistic term loan refinancing in March, we're now forecasting $270 million to $280 million of interest expense in 2021, which represents a $50 million year-over-year reduction. And we continue to estimate that our effective tax rate will be in the 24% to 26% range. As a result, and with roughly 113 million diluted common shares outstanding this year, we're now projecting adjusted earnings of $5.90 to $6.50 per diluted share. At the midpoint, this is year-over-year EPS growth of 109%. In sum, our business has been firing on all cylinders. In Q1, we generated stellar top-line growth and even stronger bottom-line growth. We grew our margins in the process, and we've now delivered three straight quarterly records for adjusted EBITDA. Our results not only reflect strong execution throughout our operations, they also underscore how our businesses are strategically well positioned to meet customers' needs and capture profitable growth opportunities in logistics, LTL, and brokerage. We remain enthusiastic about our prospects as a leader in the markets we serve, and we're proceeding decisively toward the planned spin-off of our logistics business with the wind at our back. I'll now turn things over to Matt. Good morning. It's David. The way you're thinking about it is the right way to think about it. We're confident that GXO will be investment grade on day one. We haven't announced a precise capitalization plan yet, and we're still talking to the rating agencies. But as you say, the remainder of the debt will stay with XPO RemainCo, and we want to drive RemainCo to being investment grade soon. And from a process standpoint, to the extent that we issue debt for GXO, some or most of that cash would be dividended up to XPO to pay down RemainCo debt. And so that will allow us to reduce the leverage. In addition to that, we generate a lot of cash and we're prioritizing the allocation of that cash to pay down debt. And to me what's really exciting is that if you look at the Q1 balance sheet for the combined company, net leverage is at 2.5 times our current EBITDA guidance for this year. And that means that the aggregate amount of debt that needs to be allocated between the two companies is manageable and really positions us well for GXO to be investment grade on day one and for XPO RemainCo to move rapidly to being investment grade. No particular changes. Obviously, the year-over-year comps are strange this year because of the pandemic last year, but when we look at the year overall, we've delivered 33% EBITDA growth in the first quarter, and that's right at the midpoint of what we're expecting for the year as a whole. So, I think there's a consistency there between our first quarter results and what we're expecting for the full year on a year-over-year basis. The comps will be easier in the second quarter because of the pandemic effects last year and will be tougher in the second half. We're really still working through the details of that, and we expect to have more details around that soon. What I would emphasize is that we're confident that GXO can be investment grade on day one and that would allow us to -- give us the flexibility to issue some debt that GXO can support and still be investment grade, and dividend those funds across to XPO to reduce the amount of net leverage remaining at XPO following the spin."

            "name": "Brad Jacobs",
            "content": "Thank you, operator. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our conference call. With me today in Greenwich are David Wyshner, our CFO; Matt Fassler, our Chief Strategy Officer; and from London, Malcolm Wilson, our current CEO of XPO Europe and future CEO of the planned spin GXO. As you saw, we had a tremendous first quarter that beat expectations and gave us a very strong start to 2021. On a year-over-year basis, our first quarter revenue was up 24% to $4.8 billion, which is an all-time high, not just for a first quarter, but for any quarter.  Our revenue includes 22% growth from our transportation segment where the truck brokerage market is white-hot and the LTL environment is coming back strong. And in logistics, our revenue growth was a hefty 27%. Our logistics segment also had a great first quarter for sales, with a number of large contract wins. Company-wide we set new first quarter records for both net income and adjusted EBITDA. Both of our segments generated robust EBITDA in the first quarter, leading to our third consecutive quarterly record. Our $443 million of adjusted EBITDA was a year-over-year increase of 33%, and our first quarter adjusted EBITDA margin of 9.3% was up from the prior year by 70 basis points.  Technology and operational excellence were the two big drivers here. Even with the gains we've been reporting, we're confident that we're in the early innings of margin improvement. On the back of our first quarter beat and considering the optimism we're hearing from our customers, we significantly raised our full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $1.825 billion to $1.875 billion.  Our LTL business in North America is on a solid upward trend. Tonnage per day in LTL was up 3.7% in the quarter compared with a year ago, and yield ex fuel was up 4.2%. Our LTL adjusted operating ratio ex real estate improved to a first quarter record of 84.3%, which was 220 basis points better than a year ago. In truck brokerage, the story is growth, growth and more growth. Three months ago, we reported a record fourth quarter for our brokerage business, and now we've driven results higher to top it with another record quarter. Our loads per day in brokerage were substantially better than the market, up year-over-year by 25%. Revenue in brokerage was up 83%, and net revenue was up 132%. Our net revenue margin in brokerage was up 389 basis points to 18.6%. The big driver behind our brokerage performance is our technology and the productivity we're getting from XPO Connect, our digital platform. Over the last five years, our technology enabled us to handle 41% more volume with just a 3% increase in sales and procurement head count. In logistics, our growth is being driven by the big three tailwinds of e-commerce, outsourcing, and customer demand for warehouse automation. I'm delighted to report that we recently won the largest contract in the history of our North American logistics business. It's also the largest win for our company overall at $1.8 billion of projected revenue through 2032. This includes both an extension and an expansion with a longstanding customer.  Malcolm will talk about some other recent wins in a minute, including three major brands that in total will be using over $1 billion of our logistics services over the next five years. We're also continuing to make excellent progress on GXO, the planned spin-off of our logistics business. We remain on track to complete the spin in the second half of the year, and our goal is to have GXO be investment grade from day one, followed by XPO. Our strategy and our spin address the consistent themes we've heard from shareholders over the last year \u2014 to simplify the company and reduce leverage. With that, I'll ask Malcolm to share some recent developments in our logistics business. Malcolm? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You nailed it. Thank you. Thank you, operator. So let me conclude by highlighting: in LTL, we improved the operating ratio by 220 basis points; in truck brokerage, we grew loads by 25% and net revenue by 132%; in logistics, we signed a bunch of whales, massive contracts with premier customers, both here in the United States and in Europe, each worth hundreds of millions of dollars over the life of the contract, one worth significantly more than that; and in logistics, we're benefiting from three powerful growth drivers, outsourcing, warehouse automation, and e-commerce. And finally, based on the Q1 beat and the strength we're seeing in April, we raised guidance significantly for the full year. We raised the new low end above the prior high end. So, I'd like to thank the team. None of these accomplishments were done by any one specific person. It's always the team. So XPO, good job. Thank you. See you in 90 days."

            "name": "Matt Fassler",
            "content": "Tom, one of the things we love about the logistics business is its consistency. That's evident in pricing and it's evident in the kind of financial results that we're able to generate in a variety of backdrops. So, we're able to manage our price movements very well in that business, and you shouldn't expect to see any impact in logistics results based on the movement that you're seeing in transportation markets today. Obviously, to the extent that there are indicators of a strong demand backdrop that's good for the logistics business as it is for transportation, but generally a constructive backdrop there as well. Sure. First of all, labor productivity. We have our Smart workforce management platform. It drives 5% to 7% labor productivity per annum as we roll it out. That rollout is still maturing in the U.S. and is really in the middle innings at most as you think about Europe. So, there's lots of headway for us to make progress in terms of labor productivity. There's organic growth at existing sites, particularly when you think about our sites with exposure to e-commerce, which is our fastest-growing area right now. That will help us drive operating leverage. There's, of course, the acceleration of the rollout of automation and robotics, a huge part of our value proposition to our customers. There's tremendous new business opportunities. Obviously, we seek out lucrative business opportunities and the incremental revenue helps us drive operating leverage as well. Finally, XPO Direct continues to season and continues to contribute to our profit outlook. So, really, I think those five drivers are going to be the key for our operating leverage and logistics going forward. The renewal and retention rates in contract logistics are very strong. Many of our largest customers have been with us for many, many years. We've had multiple renewals with them, and we expect that to remain the general cadence of the business. There are some instances where we part ways and typically come to an arrangement and then we move on. But generally, the retention and renewal dynamics are very powerful in our logistics franchise. Sure, Brandon. Good morning. So, in terms of capital allocation, we're always looking for the best ROI from the cash that we generate from the business. Our current focus, to your earlier point, is effectuating the spin which is going to create lots of value, then paying down debt to become investment-grade, and then obviously in parallel to that at all times is investing in CapEx. Those are our priorities for capital. Accretive M&A and stock buybacks, each of those is really always an option. We're always aware of what's happening in the market. We'll announce any moves after the fact, and we're very highly disciplined, obviously, as we think about those opportunities. Chris, we had a really, really good first quarter in a terrific environment. We're going to have a very strong second quarter. We framed the seasonality for you. David did, he talked about mid-20s as a share of the year. Obviously we expected a very good year as well. We talked about the EBITDA guidance for the Europe for the company overall and for each of the businesses, and we see obviously a very strong performance in the second quarter, very good trends both in Transportation and Logistics."

I'll now turn the call over to XPO's Chief Executive Officer, Mario Harik. Mr. Harik, you may begin.\nMario Harik: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call. We're excited to talk about our simplified business model following the spin-off of RXO and how it focuses our resources on growing the value of our LTL network. I am here in Greenwich with Carl Anderson, our CFO, who will cover the fourth quarter and full year results. And we also have Ali Faghri with us for Q&A. Ali is our new Chief Strategy Officer, and he's a great addition to the executive team. Yesterday, you saw us report a solid quarter of growth in a soft macro environment. That statement is true for the company as a whole and also for our 2 reportable segments, North American LTL and European Transportation. Company-wide, we generated revenue of $1.8 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 3% and we grew adjusted EBITDA year-over-year by 38%, which far outpaced our revenue growth and beat consensus for the 11th straight quarter. For the full year, we generated over $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA in our LTL business. This exceeded a major target we had set for 2022. Looking at the business by segment, I want to focus on LTL and some key results that tie directly to our growth plan. In the fourth quarter, the LTL industry in North America saw a year-over-year decline in shipment volumes due to macro pressure. But at XPO, we grew our shipment count and tonnage. Our positive tonnage growth ties back to the plan we call LTL 2.0, which is to invest in capacity ahead of demand and earn profitable market share by providing best-in-class service. We continue to have great success on boarding new business, including volumes from blue-chip customers who are either signing up with us for the first time or giving us more of their business. This drove a strategic change in our mix in the quarter, and our tonnage ended up more than typical seasonality. We also had a high-margin local base, and these customers give us more shipments per day. However, the weight per shipment declined in the softer macro. As a result, our yield came in at the lower end of our outlook. Our mix should become a tailwind for us to both volume and yield as the macro recovers. The second reason we're outperforming is service, and I'll give you an example. In the fourth quarter, we improved our damage frequency by 66% year-over-year to the lowest damage frequency in 6 years. There's no doubt that our intense focus on service is helping us secure more tonnage, especially as we're hearing from new customers that we rank as one of their top LTL carriers for quality of service. Customer feedback like this has a ripple effect on our entire organization. Employee satisfaction is up sharply, which is an indication of the pride our team is taking in our service standards. In our year-end survey, employee satisfaction, including drivers and dock workers was the highest in more than a decade. For the full year 2022, from an operating ratio perspective, there were a lot of puts and takes, including the softer macro. We improved our adjusted operating ratio excluding real estate gains, by 40 basis points for the year, which was short of our target range. Strategically, we made good progress in setting up the network to capitalize when volumes rebound, and we like our positioning. We're executing on the growth levels in our plan, like the 369 net new doors we added with 6 new terminal openings. In the next 90 days, we expect to open another 167 net new doors in Salt Lake City, Atlanta and Dallas. We're also following the unique levers we have within our company to help drive our expansion. In 2022, we increased our line haul fleet by over 10% by manufacturing more than 4,700 trailers in-house. We also trained over 1,700 truck drivers last year at our driver training schools. These are tangible advantages we have in the execution of our long-term plan for LTL 2.0 and they're gaining ground. Turning to Europe. This business continues to perform ahead of expectations with solid organic growth, particularly in the U.K. and Spain. In constant currency, fourth quarter revenue in Europe increased year-over-year by 9%. Our pricing in Europe was up year-over-year in Q4, and we're continuing to win business with new and existing customers. Despite the macro uncertainty there, our sales pipeline continues to be very robust. I want to wrap up my remarks by summarizing the exciting trajectory with creative going into 2023. We successfully completed the spinoff of RXO in November, which simplified our business model. We now have 2 highly focused business segments with strong value propositions in the customer market they know best. In North America, we drove above-industry tonnage growth in LTL in Q4, and we ended the year with over $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA, making good on the targets we set 5 years earlier. We're winning LTL market share with our service quality and also through our investment in network capacity. We're on track to open the remainder of the 900 net new doors we projected in our growth plan. And in Europe, our business is performing above expectations. This is the momentum we're carrying into 2023, and we intend to continue to invest in growth. We're confident that we'll deliver on the 3 targets we set for our LTL business; a revenue CAGR of 6% to 8%, an adjusted EBITDA CAGR of 11% to 13% and an adjusted operating ratio improvement of at least 600 basis points. These targets covered the period from 2021 through 2027. And as we move toward them, we'll focus on being world-class in every aspect of our business. We know that this combination of financial and operational excellence is the most sustainable way to deliver outsized shareholder value. Now I'm going to hand it over to Carl to discuss our results and our balance sheet. Carl, over to you.\nCarl Anderson: Thank you, Mario, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our fourth quarter and full year results, balance sheet and liquidity. I'll start with the fourth quarter, where we delivered strong year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Revenue in the quarter was $1.8 billion, up 3% year-over-year. Organic revenue growth for the quarter was 2%, and the net impact of fuel prices and FX contributed an additional point of growth. We grew adjusted EBITDA by 38% year-over-year to $262 million. This was primarily driven by our North American LTL business, which increased adjusted EBITDA by $42 million or 20% year-over-year. This includes a real estate gain of $55 million, which was up $20 million from a year ago. Additionally, we had a $30 million reduction in corporate expense as we continue to rationalize our overhead after the spin-off. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 14.3%, representing a year-over-year improvement of 350 basis points. In the LTL segment, our fourth quarter operating ratio was 84.2%. Our adjusted operating ratio, excluding gains on real estate sales, was 87.1%, which is a 60-basis point improvement from a year ago. Our European business also continued its solid performance with revenue up year-over-year 9% on a constant currency basis. Please note that we won't be addressing a potential sale of our European business on this call. We reported a net loss from continuing operations of $36 million in the fourth quarter, representing a diluted loss per share of $0.31. This compares to income of $47 million and earnings of $0.40 per share a year ago. The fourth quarter 2022 net loss includes 3 impacts primarily incurred in connection with the RXO spin-off completed in November. First, we had a $64 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to a change in our segment structure following the spin-off. Prior to that, the European Transportation business was a single reporting unit and goodwill was evaluated for impairment at that level. Following the spin, the European Transportation business is comprised of 4 reporting units and impairment testing is required to be performed on a disaggregated basis for each of the new units, resulting in the charge this quarter. The second impact related to the spin was the $42 million of transaction and integration costs. And finally, we had $35 million of restructuring charges, mostly due to the planned step-down in corporate costs. On an adjusted basis, our adjusted earnings per diluted share for the quarter was $0.98, which was up 53% from a year ago. This increase was primarily driven by higher adjusted EBITDA and a lower effective tax rate. We generated $196 million of cash flow from continuing operations, spent $167 million on gross CapEx and received $78 million of proceeds from asset sales. Gross CapEx was up $77 million year-over-year driven by our planned investments in expanding our LTL network. This resulted in strong free cash flow of $107 million. Turning to the full year 2022. We delivered revenue of $7.7 billion, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 7%. Adjusted EBITDA was $997 million in 2022, up from $812 million a year ago. This was primarily driven by a 12% increase in adjusted EBITDA in our LTL business and a $75 million reduction in corporate expense. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased by 82%, coming in at $3.53 per share this year. We generated cash flow from operating activities of $824 million for 2022 and free cash flow of $391 million, which was up 11% from the prior year. Our CapEx investments of $521 million almost doubled from a year ago as we accelerated our investments in the business to support our long-term growth targets. Our LTL adjusted operating ratio, excluding real estate, improved by 40 basis points from the prior year to 83.9%. Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $460 million of cash. This cash, combined with available borrowing capacity under committed borrowing facilities gave us $930 million of liquidity at year-end. We had no borrowings outstanding under our ABL facility and our net debt leverage at year-end was 2.1x adjusted EBITDA, down from 2.7x a year ago on a previously reported basis prior to the RXO spin-off. This week, we extended our ABL maturity to 2026. And we recently received a credit upgrade from S&P from BB to BB+. Turning to the first quarter 2023. We expect the company to generate year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA in the low double digits. This anticipates $5 million to $10 million of unallocated corporate costs in the quarter. We expect to wind down these costs over the course of the year. And finally, a reminder that starting with the current quarter, our adjusted operating ratio will include the allocation of incremental corporate costs and exclude pension income. You'll find a historical reconciliation for this in our investor presentation. In addition, we're providing assumptions for the full year 2023 to help with your planning. These are gross CapEx of $500 million to $600 million, interest expense of $185 million to $195 million, pension income of approximately $20 million, an effective tax rate of 24% to 26% and a diluted share count of 117 million shares. Overall, we're pleased with our results in 2022 and are excited about our growth prospects as we move forward. We'll now take your questions. Operator, please open the line.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Stephanie Moore with Jefferies.\nStephanie Moore: To start out, I was hoping -- could you provide a little bit more color in terms of how you're thinking about the first quarter for LTL? And in particular, how you're thinking about pricing which does not -- which now appears to be kind of in that low single-digit range where a lot of your peers are more mid to high? Any color there would be helpful.\nMario Harik: Well, we expect company-wide adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter to be up low double digits, as Carl mentioned earlier. For LTL specifically, we expect adjusted EBITDA to either be slightly down or slightly up depending on what happens in the demand environment in the month of March, which, as you know, is a big driver for the first quarter for us. From an OR perspective, we expect it to be better than typical seasonality in the first quarter, typically, seasonality for us is a 50-basis point deterioration from the fourth quarter going into the first quarter. Now that said, we're off to a great start here in the month of January. Our tonnage is up and better than typical seasonality and our yield ex fuel is in line with the fourth quarter [on a year-over-year basis as well] (added by company after the call). Now we are cautiously optimistic about the demand environment. So when we look at the back half of the quarter, based on what we're seeing in our results today, we are seeing a pickup and more strength from a volume perspective. But obviously, we'll see what the rest of the quarter will do. But hopefully, this gives you color on all of -- on the entire fourth quarter.\nStephanie Moore: And maybe just on the pricing side of it as well, if you can.\nMario Harik: Yes, sure. On the -- in the first quarter, we expect yield to be in line with the fourth quarter [on a year-over-year basis] (added by the company after the call), here in the month of January, that was the case. We did take a GRI for our local accounts in the month of January as opposed to what we did last year in the fourth quarter. But we will continue to be impacted by some of the mix dynamics we mentioned in some of our prepared remarks in the first quarter, but we continue to see the pricing environment being rational.\nStephanie Moore: Understood. And then just kind of more on the modeling question. Could you provide a bit more color on corporate expenses in the fourth quarter and what it should look like, again, kind of in the first quarter and then moving forward throughout the year?\nCarl Anderson: Stephanie, it's Carl Anderson. I can -- I'll take that. So if you look at the fourth quarter, our corporate expense was $29 million. And as we begin 2023, $20 million of that will be allocated to LTL starting in the first quarter. So it really leaves about $9 million left as far as the pure corporate expense. And as I said in the prepared remarks, we expect our corporate expense in the first quarter to range around $5 million to $10 million, in line with what we saw with you make that adjustment. And importantly, we expect that to wind down throughout the course of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.\nScott Schneeberger: Could you talk to tonnage trends in the quarter, just kind of puts and takes versus your internal expectations of what occurred? And then I'll follow up on that.\nMario Harik: Sure, Scott. So in the fourth quarter, tonnage came in on the lower end of our outlook, but we obviously bucked industry trends in terms of our tonnage being up and our shipment counts also being higher than our tonnage. Our tonnage came in roughly at plus 1% for the quarter. Now in terms of the trends within the quarter, December was the soft month of the quarter, which was impacted by weather in the back half of December. So that was more of a softer than what we saw for the remainder of the quarter. Now as I mentioned earlier though, January is up better than the fourth quarter numbers and it's better than typical seasonality as well. And we're seeing -- we saw a strong demand from our customers especially a lot of the new customers we onboarded through the course of 2022.\nScott Schneeberger: I appreciate that. And then with regard to the operating ratio in the fourth quarter, sounds like weather was an impact there. Could you kind of hit on the main items that were impactful in the fourth quarter versus your internal expectations? And thanks for the guidance just provided. I appreciate that. So just kind of focusing on fourth quarter and what occurred tax?\nMario Harik: Yes, you got it. So predominantly for the fourth quarter came in short of our expectation, driven by the tonnage outcome in the month of December. So if you take out the impact of weather in the back half of December, we would have exceeded our expectation on OR improvement for the fourth quarter.\nScott Schneeberger: It was purely the weather, were there any other headwind impacts in the quarter that were worth calling out?\nMario Harik: Yes. Not outside what we had discussed on the last call, which was more driven by elevated cost inflation. When you think about labor expenses and maintenance costs were higher than expected but we already had factors for that when we got together on the last earnings call.\nScott Schneeberger: Got it. It sounds fairly isolated to the fourth quarter, what was impacting that. Those other factors has just cost inflation, is that in solid shape as you enter the coming -- in 2023 with your pricing and other strategies?\nMario Harik: Yes. So as we head into 2023, obviously, we're seeing inflation starting to taper off in terms of overall cost. When you look at the fourth quarter for us, the 2 big categories of costs are labor and purchase transportation. And for our wages, these were up 10% on a year-on-year basis in the fourth quarter. And roughly 2/3 of that was based on wage inflation, additional wages we have given our folks in the field and the other 1/3 was to support the 1.5% shipment growth that we had in the fourth quarter. On the purchase transportation cost, that was down 10% in the fourth quarter. That was -- but also -- and appreciate that fuel as part of that line for the third-party providers. So effectively, the rates were actually down more than that in the fourth quarter. Now as we head into 2023, that stronger cost inflation we saw in 2022 is starting to subside, especially on the purchase transportation side that will become a tailwind through the course of the year. And same thing on wages, we expect them, obviously, to be up but not as up as they were in 2022.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup.\nChris Wetherbee: Maybe starting on the strategy around your local customers versus some of the national accounts on the LTL side. So I guess maybe I just wanted to maybe better understand that. And then do you -- I guess, over the course of the last several years post the Con-way integration, I think there was a strong effort to kind of go through the customer base in the right size and make sure you're dealing with the best, most profitable customers and obviously, the operating ratio improved over the course of that period of time. So I guess I'm kind of curious how much work is left to do? And what does the strategy sort of really entail? And maybe ultimately, what do you think the potential benefit to your operating ratio or profitability, broadly speaking, can be?\nMario Harik: If you take a step back and you look at the channel mix dynamic in the fourth quarter, and so I'll walk you through that, and then we'll talk about 2023 and beyond. But when you think about the fourth quarter, we did have a channel mix impact on our yield, but that was driven by onboarding larger strategic national accounts in the back half of 2022, which we have discussed on prior calls as well. And these were important to build density in lanes in our network. Now on the local channel side, these are typically smaller accounts that are higher yielding freight for that type of business. And we have also taken market share in that particular segment where our shipment count in the fourth quarter was up mid-single digit, but tonnage was down and that's driven predominantly through the softness in the macro where these customers were shipping -- again, we gained more customers, however, they were shipping lower weight on a per shipment basis. So as the macro recovers, those local accounts would have higher weight per shipment that would drive tonnage up commensurate with the volume of shipments we're seeing in the network and that becomes both a tailwind for tonnage and for yield for us moving forward. So that's the dynamic between national and local.\nChris Wetherbee: And in terms of how you think that, that might impact the -- I mean, in fact, the operating ratio, and I guess, making sure I understand what's sort of different now versus what you've been doing because I thought you're were trying to optimize sort of the customer mix over the course of the last several years?\nMario Harik: Yes. So overall, it's still a similar strategy. But as we switch to LTL 2.0, the strategy is also around gaining market share. And again, when you look at national accounts from a mix perspective, in an LTL network, they create density on a lane per lane basis, which is very important. And we use the metric internally called a lane balance factor in our operation which as you get closer to a stronger lane balance that's overall accretive for your margins. So when we onboard the national accounts and we say that a good fit for the network, they are improving the lane balance and using available capacity that we have in the network. Now over time, in the current market, we -- obviously, there is softer freight demand but as that recovers and you see that pickup in that local channel as well as the nationals we onboarded, that would be a tailwind for both volume and yield. Now in terms of the impact on OR, obviously, that will depend on many factors because OR will include the combination of volume, yield and cost management as well. So all of these lead to an outcome. But obviously, our goal is by 2027 to have improved our operating ratio by at least 600 basis points, and we're confident we're going to deliver on that.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay. That's helpful. And then just a real quick clarification. For the first quarter, adjusted EBITDA up double digits. Can you give us a clean number of what you're comparing that to, obviously, given the breakup of the business, I want to make sure I understand what the base is for that. And then your guidance around the LTL adjusted EBITDA as well. That includes $5 million to $10 million of unallocated costs when you're thinking about being flat or up or down a little bit.\nCarl Anderson: Yes. So Chris, it's -- if you think about comparing it to Q1 of a year ago, that base is $184 million. And then as far as the corporate cost, as I referenced, in that range, $5 million to $10 million, that will still be in that corporate bucket. It will not be part of LTL. LTL will have the additional $20 million approximately that we previously said we would be allocating it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs.\nJordan Alliger: At your Analyst Day, you talked about technology and implementation to help with dynamic pricing, line haul, reducing other costs like PT. Can you maybe give an update on that? And how it's shaping up versus your expectations?\nMario Harik: Thanks, Jordan. We're making great progress on the rollout of our proprietary technology. As we have discussed in our Investor Day. There are number of initiatives and proprietary pieces power tech that helps us drive results. Starting with pricing. This year, we made great progress in upgrading our discussions on the last call, our cost modeling and how we allocate cost of shipments and how we price more efficiently. So in this environment, we are investing more than our sales force, and we've had record numbers of RFPs that we are driving through the system, and having a platform that makes it very easy for our pricing analysts to price that business and have a quick turnaround with the sales team is essential and our technology is enabling these things. A similar things, as you mentioned on dynamic pricing, our platform is enabling us on the spot business side to be able to onboard more business and being able to react more quickly to the environment. On the cost management side, we've made great progress in our linehaul technology platform and how we optimize linehaul runs similarly on the pickup and delivery platform for both our planners and dispatchers. And then finally, for dock efficiency, our solutions with the smart labor platform enables us to improve how we operate our dock ships and make them commensurate with the volume we are getting. So great progress across the board with our tech.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski: [indiscernible] That may be helpful. We can just let here because it's so between allocation to perform adjusted EBITDA. Could you just help us like what was comparable margins from 2022 to 2021 and the LTL network. It does is appropriate just for [indiscernible]\nMario Harik: Brandon, you're coming in very choppy. We couldn't hear you well. But let me try to ask your question, that you're asking about the baseline of 2021, 2022 and how corporate expenses are layering and moving forward as well?\nBrandon Oglenski: Yes. Sorry.\nCarl Anderson: Yes. I think, Brandon, as you look, we did include in the investor presentation, a pretty detailed historical reconciliation on Page 27, specifically for the LTL segment that kind of walks the differences on a year-over-year basis and by quarter for all of '22 as well as full year '21.\nBrandon Oglenski: Yes. [indiscernible] So I guess looking since this for 1Q because I think you guys have said LTL adjusted EBITDA either the down slightly, is that correct?\nMario Harik: That's correct. For LTL EBITDA, we expect it to either be down slightly or up slightly, depending on the demand environment in the month of March.\nBrandon Oglenski: I'm sorry, I know you have the numbers in the presentation, but what is that EBITDA when comparing to 1Q '22?\nCarl Anderson: Yes. So for Q1 of 2022, now that we've allocated $20 million, it's going to be $186 million would be the LTL EBITDA for Q1 of '22.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. So we should be thinking maybe [indiscernible] from that number for this quarter?\nMario Harik: That's correct.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\nScott Group: So relative to the newly adjusted 1Q -- OR of 89% 1Q a year ago, how are you thinking about OR in Q1 this year? And any thoughts on full year operating ratio for LTL?\nMario Harik: Yes. So what -- first, I'll start on the full year. So when you look -- because obviously, we had the old definition last year, Scott, that was updated with, as Carl mentioned earlier on with the corporate allocations and the removal of pension income. So last year's OR, the number was 83.9%. And when you account for the allocation of corporate and the exclusion of pension income that would have been in 86% and changed OR. Now for the full year of 2023, we're obviously not guiding for the full year, given where things are this year, but there is a path to improve OR this year, but it will depend on the macro. We feel cautiously optimistic about the demand outlook, as I mentioned earlier. And based on what we're seeing today and our results, again, volume is up, it's better than seasonality, and we're seeing stronger demand from customers. And we're hearing optimism from our customers as you head into the spring and the back half of the year. But obviously, we're watching the macro like everybody else is. Now specifically in the demand environment, the segments are different retail has been -- had sequential declines in the fourth quarter, but the feedback we hear now that the retailers have gone through that inventories and now that we're going to see more normal seasonal buying patterns in 2023. And the industrial, we're seeing short-term softness, but we've seen some strength in some of the areas like auto, machinery, short-cycle manufacturing where they're outlining a more robust 2023. So depending on what that environment does for the rest of the year would dictate what OR would do. And obviously, there are dynamics at our yield, and there are a lot of company-specific initiatives we're driving on the cost side like in-sourcing linehaul. And all of these variables would lead to the outcome for 2023 on OR. But again, there is a path to improve OR in 2023, but all of these variables will dictate that outcome. For the first quarter, as I mentioned earlier, we expect OR seasonally to be better than typical seasonality from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. And typically, that's a 50-basis points deterioration is what we see from Q4 to Q1, and we expect to do better than that.\nScott Group: And I think we're all just a little confused because we don't -- there's new numbers now, so we're not really sure with the seasonality. So just to be clear, you did -- on the new methodology, you did a 90.3% OR in Q4, 83.9% in Q1 of '22, and you're saying it should be -- typically, it's 50 basis points worse Q4 to Q1, but maybe it's going to be something better than that?\nMario Harik: Correct. And on the high end of the range, if you think of an EBITDA improvement for the first quarter, Scott, that would be an OR improvement for the quarter.\nScott Group: OR improvement sequentially or year-over-year?\nMario Harik: Year-over-year, on the low end of the range in terms of EBITDA being slightly down, that would be a year-on-year deterioration but better than seasonality on the high end of the range where EBITDA improved slightly in the first quarter, that would be an OR improvement on a year-on-year basis.\nScott Group: Okay. And then just bigger picture, right? If I take a step back in the model, it looks like you're really outperforming everybody on tonnage. You're really underperforming on yield. So it seems like maybe sacrificing some price to get volume. Is that what's happening here is what it looks like in the model, but just -- is that what we're doing here?\nMario Harik: No, we're not sacrificing price to buy volume with price. There were a few dynamics in the fourth quarter that impacted us. The first one, Scott, is that we were lapping a early GRI we took in Q4 of last year. While this year, we took that in the month of January, which is usually our customary time line. And I mentioned the yield dynamic on the mix channel earlier on. So we onboarded those national accounts that are strategic for our network, yet the higher-yielding local accounts, again, their shipment count is up mid-single digits, so we're taking market share. However, we've seen a weight per shipment decline in that channel that caused the overall weight to be down. So that dynamic is what effectively impacted yield. And then finally, life of haul was down 1.3% for the quarter, where we onboarded more next day and 2-day lanes shipments to our network. And we also saw less outbound California freight coming through lesser imports in the fourth quarter, which has a direct correlation to yield. Now if you take a step back, our contract renewals in the quarter were up roughly 7%. That's for existing business. And we continue to see from us in the overall industry, very rational pricing in how we price the business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.\nAllison Poliniak: Just wanted to talk about the CapEx for the year. If you can maybe break that down a little bit more. And then in terms of the new door adds, maybe talk to, I would say, relative capacity available today with how you're thinking about the investment as we go through the year in terms of discipline around that?\nCarl Anderson: Thanks, Allison. Yes, if you look at 2022, our total CapEx, the company is about $521 million. About 85% of that relates to the LTL business. And as you can see from our guide for our planning assumptions for 2023, we do expect CapEx at the midpoint to be up over what it was last year. So -- and again, I think that same percentage mix between LTL and Europe is how you should think about it.\nMario Harik: And on the lower side, so we -- obviously, when we started the LTL 2.0 plan, our goal was to open up 900 new doors. And these were based on areas where we have line of sight on demand from customers. So a lot of the markets that we go after, we already know that we need capacity and we're seeing that demand come from customers. So over the next 90 days, we're going to be opening up additional doors, 167 net new doors in Salt Lake City, in Atlanta and in Dallas, Texas as well. And we have a plan through the remainder of the year to open up more doors in those markets where we need that capacity. For example, Houston is a great market for us. Florida is a great market for us, where we need more capacity that we're going to be looking to add. But we're being very disciplined in how we open up those stores and all the terminals we've opened up have been operating better than expectations.\nAllison Poliniak: Got it. And then just a follow-up on the shipment cost inflation. Should we be assuming sort of up mid-single digit for this year? Or is it lower or higher than that? Just any color.\nMario Harik: This is -- it would be in the ZIP code of mid-single digit, but it will depend on what the truck for us because we have roughly around 1/4 of our linehaul miles are outsourced it will depend on what the truckload rates do for the balance of the year. We expect this to be a good tailwind for us here in the first half of the year, but it depends on the demand environment in the back half and how that translates. On the weightage side, we expect it to be in the sub mid-single digits, but in that territory.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS.\nTom Wadewitz: Mario, I know you've had some questions on price a bit. I was wondering if you could tell us a bit more just in terms of the broader strategy, what type of freight are you trying to bring on? What -- I guess, what's the if you push harder on price versus tonnage kind of what's the overall strategy for what you're trying to build that's going to be OR accretive in terms of kind of price mix and how much tonnage matters relative to that?\nMario Harik: Sure. So first, starting with the type of freight that we look for. We look for freight that can build density in our network. So effectively, these are 48x48 skids that are -- that fit well in an LTL network, typically going dock-to-dock in terms of B2B-type shipments is the primary type of freight that we're going after. We also look to go after freight that creates density around our terminals. So we think about pickups that are in proximity to our terminals is another way we think about the quality of the freight and the -- how it relates to our network as well. Now in terms of channel mix, we are looking to build density, both international channel and the local channel. As I mentioned earlier, in the local channel, we're making great strides and onboarding new customers. This year, we ended the year with 27,000 customers, which was up 2,000 from our prior number of 25,000 customers, and a lot of these were new local accounts we are onboarding. And with having that success in sales, it's driven by 2 main areas of focus. One, our service is up and to the right, and we're hearing great feedback from customers on the quality of service; and two, is the investments we are making in capacity to be able to handle that business. And we want to grow in both of these channels with the type of freight and the type of profile I just mentioned.\nTom Wadewitz: So I guess, it's the primary driver of the more moderate growth in revenue per hundredweight versus peers. Is that really just the emphasis on -- or the greater growth with national accounts? And then I guess just from kind of a forward look, would you think that your revenue per hundredweight would accelerate a bit as you look forward? Or would you think it remains kind of low single digit, given that mix effect with the national account tonnage?\nMario Harik: So Tom, it's a combination of all the things I mentioned earlier on. So the mix of channels is one component. And obviously, the local being down on weight but shipments being up, that's going to become a tailwind. But it's also the other items that our GRI and on length of haul as well. And a lot of these things would recover as the macro -- as the freight demand environment recovers through the course of 2023. Now going back to the local channel, the fact that shipments are up as the macro recovers, you would see that wafer shipments start to go up and then the overall tonnage we're getting in that channel would go up, which would be a lift for yield. And for our national accounts, we're looking at these as longer-term strategic relationship. Just to give you an example, the average tenure of our top 10 customer today is 60 years. So these are customers that we're going to be fine-tuning the business we do with them over time. So again, overall, we expect yield to remain positive, and we expect our strategy to pay dividends as the macro recovered and the freight environment gets stronger. And we like our positioning.\nTom Wadewitz: So, it's probably cyclical in terms of seeing that acceleration in revenue per hundredweight?\nMario Harik: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.\nKen Hoexter: I'll just throw it out there. I think a lot of discussion here. I think I've rebuilt this model 4 times this year alone and it sounds like with another reallocation and other ones coming next year. So looking forward to the consistency, they're going forward. But just the base level understand this, you're now at a 90% OR in the fourth quarter at LTL, I think full year just about 87%. You were at, what, 93% at Con-way before you bought it and you're talking about another 600 basis points in a few years. Maybe talk about how you get there? And it sounds like the strategy is shifting a little bit to now re-adding national accounts, which I know you've talked a little bit about, but it sounded like that was a key move to get away from because that was a key driver of improving OR. So maybe to start with that. And then, Carl, just a clarification on EBITDA. I know you've included in the adjustments to the $20 million and $15 million on OR. But did you leave the $15 million out of EBITDA? Is that the way we should think about that to get to that $185 million?\nCarl Anderson: Yes. On the $20 million, I kind of walked you through that, Ken. On the $15 million, I guess, I'm not understanding the question.\nKen Hoexter: Well, I guess, to get to the adjusted operating income, you take out both the $20 million and re-add the $15 million of income -- pension income, but you don't do that on EBITDA, right? You just take out the $20 million of corporate costs?\nCarl Anderson: Well, no. I mean, as we go forward pension -- as we think about income, pension will be excluded. Overall EBITDA, though, has pension income. So -- and as we said in the planning assumptions, we kind of showed you what the expectations were for 2023 as far as pension income being approximately $20 million for the full year.\nMario Harik: And Ken, going back to your question on OR definition. So we closed last year with an OR of 83.9%, which obviously Con-way had more than one line of business, and they had a corporate structure as well. So they had the warehousing business, which was the former Menlo business. They had the truckload business and they had LTL business. Now what do you think on a -- and we haven't changed that definition since we acquired the business back in 2015. And on that reporting basis, the OR was 83.9% at year-end 2022. Now moving forward, and we just substituting our Investor Day, as we become a stand-alone LTL company, we are taking back the corporate cost and putting them in LTL effectively. What Carl mentioned earlier on, there are the $5 million to $10 million of unallocated costs that would be in the third quarter that would wind down for the course of the year as we rationalize the corporate structure. And this is where that new definition kicks into place. Now with the new definition in 2022 with 86.8% from an OR perspective. And obviously, as we move forward, I would go to improve by at least 600 basis points by the time we get through 2027.\nKen Hoexter: Yes. Just to clarify, I was talking about just the LTL section of Con-way, which had all the allocations. So it was like-to-like, I believe, having followed Con-way for 15 years before that. So just maybe then can you follow up, Mario, on that strategic mix? I know you've talked a little bit about going the national accounts. Maybe I just want to understand now with your focus is on returning to more national accounts, doesn't that serve as a detriment to -- I believe Matt Fassler used to talk a lot about moving more toward local accounts because that's where you needed to get better pricing and thus better margins and not just chase density. When we listen to other LTLs, it sounds like it's not a desire just to fill the network and fill density, but to do so with a profitable focus, it sounds like -- again, help us understand because I think a lot of the questions are coming at you because we're all really struggling to understand how just chasing that density at a lower price, optically, maybe it's just optics, but that typically historically has been at a detriment to the OR. So maybe just fill us in because I think that's where some of the misunderstanding from the markets may come.\nMario Harik: Sure. I think Ken, we're actually doing both. So when you think about our sales efforts, I mean, again, when you think about the investments we have made in capacity and the improvements in service and the investments in our sales force, the goal is to grow profitable national accounts and very profitable local account business as well. So when you look at the fourth quarter, as an example, with the local accounts, shipment count is up mid-single digit. So we are actually going after both. And for the national accounts, we remain very disciplined with the type of freight we are getting into the network. I mentioned earlier on one of the metrics we look at internally is the balance -- is a lane balance factor and we are onboarding business that enables us to improve that factor and which will make the local accounts more profitable over time as well. But you need a combination of both to be able to drive higher margins over time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners.\nJeff Kauffman: I want to go back and talk about the network maybe through a different lens. And I want to think back about 18, 19 months ago, when GXO was spun out. And we had that quarter where the LTL network struggled with service because of that purchase -- we were in-sourcing transportation and a number of customers, as you mentioned, your average customer tenure 16 years, kind of steered freight away from the network for a couple of quarters. You guys are in the penalty box until service has improved and you got driver staffing at appropriate levels. If I look at where the network is today, versus where we were in that aftermath, not a year ago but, say, 18 months ago, I'm just kind of curious where has the network improved? I know Mario, you were talking about the damage frequency was one of the best ever. But kind of talk about where service levels are relative to maybe where you were pre that issue 18 months ago. And in terms of the customer business, it got steered away from you. In the aftermath of that, you didn't lose customers so much. They just didn't give you as much freight. Have you gained all that back? Is there still some of that customer freight that's out there that we're looking to bring back in the network now that the service metrics are better? Just kind of -- I want to look at it through a slightly different lens and understand what's where it needs to be, what is not yet where it needs to be and how you've recovered relative to where you were?\nMario Harik: Yes, Jeff. So when you look at our service levels, I mentioned this in my opening remarks, our damage frequency has improved 66% year-on-year in the fourth quarter, and it's the best it's been in 6 years -- of any quarter in 6 years. So when you look at it from that perspective, obviously, not only really covered from the 18 months ago, but we're now on a path to get back to company records in terms of the quality that we offer to our customers. And similarly, our on-time service was up 14 points on a year-on-year basis in the fourth quarter. Now we do surveys with our customers on a weekly basis, and these are live shipping customers. And the customer satisfaction in the fourth quarter, exiting the month of December was a company record when we started doing this a couple of years ago in terms of taking that satisfaction. So the improvement has been dramatic and the improvement has been very effective, and we hear it from our customers. Now going back to your question on the customers, that we could have lost. Obviously, when we onboard business, some of it is existing customers who we are expanding the amount of business that we do with. To give you an example, recently, I mentioned last quarter, we onboarded a new top 10 customer. That was a customer that was doing a small amount of revenue with us prior, and now the amount of revenue is multiple. I mean we're talking more than 10x the amount of volume that they used to do with us pre those improvements. So we see a direct correlation between the improvements we're making in service and customers wanting to give us a bigger share of wallet and giving us more business as well.\nJeff Kauffman: If I could follow up on that just for a second. About early 2022, I mean, there's always been a gap between the year-on-year yield improvement, XPO versus the peer group. And it feels like that gap is closing a little bit the last few quarters. And I remember early '22, it was, \" Oh, we can't really push price with customer because the service is still healing.\" Are you past that? And are there gains that you can still make on a relative basis, like maybe relative to peer group now that the service is at these levels, is that something we should see in '23?\nMario Harik: Yes, we are past that in terms of service. And again, when I talk to our large customers, we've onboarded, I consistently get the feedback that we are one of the top carriers in terms of service quality. Now obviously, with some of the existing customers that could have left us due to service issues in the past, these as they come back, that takes time to be able to grow that -- the share of wallet with them as well. But generally, when we think about the impact of service, currently, we are providing close to best-in-class service, and we are on a up and to the right trajectory of continuous improvement and focus on it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Maybe just for Carl to follow up on the CapEx. Can you give a breakdown in terms of the 85% or so percent that's LTL. What's real estate? What's tractors and trailers? Can you give us a sense of what terminals are leased versus owned? I know we'll see that in the 10-K before too long. And then can you just wrap that into maybe a range of expectations for free cash flow for the year?\nCarl Anderson: Yes, sure. So if you look at kind of the breakdown, about 70% of the CapEx that we're planning for really is between tractors and trailers, and it's weighted pretty much equally. The remaining amount is kind of split between other things. There's a little bit in there for real estate as well, which probably adds another 15%. And if you think about the mix between purchase and lease about 40% -- or excuse me, between owned and leased, 40% is owned.\nBrian Ossenbeck: And any thoughts on free cash flow and what that all shakes out to [indiscernible] conversion rate?\nCarl Anderson: Yes, I mean I think as we look at -- yes, it's a fair question. As we look at the first quarter, we are planning to really accelerate our CapEx expenditures. And it's really going to be based off of the availability of getting new trucks in. So there's a chance we can have -- up to 50% of our CapEx spend could occur in the first quarter, obviously subject to the availability of what we're seeing right now. I think additionally, as far as cash flow, a couple of other points we should, kind of point one, we are not planning for any real estate sales in the -- in 2023. And two, we do expect to have higher cash interest costs as well that would factor into your free cash flow numbers for us.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Got it. And then just a follow-up on one of the other variables we'll be looking at this year, the impact of fuel. So you can look at fuel surcharge at more than expense. Obviously, Mario mentioned there's purchase transportation component on that. But if the fuel curve stays where it is, how does that affect LTL, OR and EBIT as we go throughout the year?\nMario Harik: When you look at fuel, it's always been part of the economics of an LTL carrier. So when customers pay us our services, they have a price that is inclusive of fuel and similar to all carriers. Now when you look at the price of diesel today, last year, we -- on a full year basis, the price per gallon was roughly in the upwards of $5 per gallon while currently it's in that $4.6 range. So if the level stays at current levels, that will most likely be some pressure related to that. And obviously, the positive side though of fuel being lower is going to simulate more economic activity and also would have more yield ex-fuel type strength associated with that as well. But obviously, we'll see how the year does. We are focused from our perspective on the levers that we can control, obviously and few -- we'll see what the year looks like as the year develops.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen & Company.\nJason Seidl: I wanted to get back to the pricing in yield side. I don't think I heard this. Can you talk about what you're pricing new contracts at the quarter?\nMario Harik: For the fourth quarter, we were roughly at 7%.\nJason Seidl: Okay. All right. So maybe you could help me out here about your comments about sequential yields from 4Q to 1Q. Mario, I believe you said they were going to be about flat. And I'm assuming that was an ex-fuel commentary.\nMario Harik: That's correct.\nJason Seidl: Okay. So why is it going to be flat when you're repricing at 7% in the quarter, your GRI also moved to January. I would assume that would drive it up or is there just another massive mix shift going to happen again in 1Q?\nMario Harik: When you look at for the first -- yes. Sequential, when you look at the first quarter, we expect the year-on-year to be up similar to what we've seen in the fourth quarter ex fuel. And this is what we have seen in the month of January. Now some of the dynamics that impacted our yield in the fourth quarter are sell-through for the first quarter which includes the mix change between national and local. And the local weight per shipment, it still has a similar dynamic of what we saw in the fourth quarter so far here in the -- at the beginning of the first quarter. So that dynamic and mix change has not changed from the fourth quarter. The only change is the GRI that we took in the month of January. Now typically, our local accounts are roughly the 1/4 of our business. So obviously, that's about a 1% flow-through on -- call it, 1% to 2% flow-through on yield -- on total system yield associated with the GRI we took in January. But again, there's the same dynamics for national to local ship and dynamic for length of haul are still impactful in the first quarter as well.\nJason Seidl: Okay. And all right. So I guess I'll just take this offline because when I look at weight per shipment, all other things being equal, should help yield going down at least. Questions about the network here. You had some nice damage rates in the quarter's best numbers in 6 years. That's fantastic. You have a 14% -- 14-point on-time improvement. Could you compare the on-time improvement sort of where you've been historically? So you gave the year-over-year. What does that put you on a historic on-time performance level versus your old numbers?\nMario Harik: So we are back to pre-COVID levels on these numbers for quality, which is the damage frequency piece, we are back to the best in 6 years. And on time and another metric we use internally is what we call network fluidity, we're back to what we were in pre-COVID today.\nJason Seidl: And where when you look at your network right now, and I know you're adding terminals and everything. So how much excess capacity is in the network? And is that going to increase as you add terminals and then you just eventually take that down?\nMario Harik: So in terms of overall capacity in the network, we're roughly in the 20% available capacity across the network. However, in some markets, we already tapped out on capacity. I mentioned earlier on, for example, the markets we're opening up in. When we opened up in Atlanta, a terminal over -- through the course of 2022, we've seen volume in that market uptick considerably because we had the customers, we had the demand and we needed more physical space. Now when you look at our plan of adding 900 net new doors through the course of the 2 years since we started our LTL 2.0 plan, that's roughly around 3% per year and it is in markets where we already were tapped out on capacity and we're adding more capacity to handle more volume for our customers.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, our final question this morning comes from the line of Jack Atkins with Stephens Inc.\nJack Atkins: Okay. Great. I appreciate it. I guess, maybe kind of going back to an earlier line of questioning on just sort of the network and network investments. I mean, Mario, when I kind of think about the last 3 years, your EBIT and LTL is up 25% or so. Your peers in LTL are up on average about 200% over that time frame. So I guess, conceptually and strategically, why does the network deserve to be able to invest more capital into expansion when you haven't sort of been able to justify the capital that's already in place? I would think the idea would be to really improve the performance of the existing network, improve price, improve lean balance. Why are we adding capacity when we're not getting an appropriate return on the capacity already in place?\nCarl Anderson: Jack, it's Carl. So if we look at just from a return on invested capital perspective, we are actually getting a very sizable return. It's -- if we look at what we did, it's running probably 34% as far as on a return-on-investment capital. So reinvesting into the network, obviously, is very -- is a pretty big benefit as it relates to what we're getting for those investments.\nJack Atkins: And the underperformance versus peers?\nMario Harik: Yes. When we look overall I mean and we discussed this quite a bit Jack in the past. A lot of it went back to capacity we had into the network. So on pre-COVID all the way through end of 2021, the amount of capital we invested into the business was based on a maintenance amount of CapEx to refresh equipment but not to add capacity so we can handle more volume. And obviously, we have discussed quite a bit what happened back in 2021. And these were the dynamics. Now moving forward, we're solving for all of these things. So we are investing capital in capacity so we can say yes more often to the customer and ahead of demand. We are very focused on continuous improvements in service to be best in class in the service we offer our customers. And these over time, will pay dividends both in terms of margin expansion and higher returns through our plans to 2027.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our time allowed for questions. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Harik for any final comments.\nMario Harik: Thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning, and I'm proud that we delivered solid results across the business, and I want to thank our 38,000 team members not just for the progress we've made, but also for the momentum they've created. In North America, this will be our first full year as a pure-play LTL carrier, and we have a strong organization who's bringing high energy to all 3 parts of our growth strategy, investing in network capacity ahead of demand, providing best-in-class service to earn market share and optimizing pricing and operations through our technology. We're confident that we'll make more progress this year with all 3 of these objectives, and we look forward to seeing you at the upcoming conferences. Operator, please close the line.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Carl Anderson",
            "content": "Thank you, Mario, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our fourth quarter and full year results, balance sheet and liquidity. I'll start with the fourth quarter, where we delivered strong year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Revenue in the quarter was $1.8 billion, up 3% year-over-year. Organic revenue growth for the quarter was 2%, and the net impact of fuel prices and FX contributed an additional point of growth. We grew adjusted EBITDA by 38% year-over-year to $262 million. This was primarily driven by our North American LTL business, which increased adjusted EBITDA by $42 million or 20% year-over-year. This includes a real estate gain of $55 million, which was up $20 million from a year ago. Additionally, we had a $30 million reduction in corporate expense as we continue to rationalize our overhead after the spin-off. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 14.3%, representing a year-over-year improvement of 350 basis points. In the LTL segment, our fourth quarter operating ratio was 84.2%. Our adjusted operating ratio, excluding gains on real estate sales, was 87.1%, which is a 60-basis point improvement from a year ago. Our European business also continued its solid performance with revenue up year-over-year 9% on a constant currency basis. Please note that we won't be addressing a potential sale of our European business on this call. We reported a net loss from continuing operations of $36 million in the fourth quarter, representing a diluted loss per share of $0.31. This compares to income of $47 million and earnings of $0.40 per share a year ago. The fourth quarter 2022 net loss includes 3 impacts primarily incurred in connection with the RXO spin-off completed in November. First, we had a $64 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to a change in our segment structure following the spin-off. Prior to that, the European Transportation business was a single reporting unit and goodwill was evaluated for impairment at that level. Following the spin, the European Transportation business is comprised of 4 reporting units and impairment testing is required to be performed on a disaggregated basis for each of the new units, resulting in the charge this quarter. The second impact related to the spin was the $42 million of transaction and integration costs. And finally, we had $35 million of restructuring charges, mostly due to the planned step-down in corporate costs. On an adjusted basis, our adjusted earnings per diluted share for the quarter was $0.98, which was up 53% from a year ago. This increase was primarily driven by higher adjusted EBITDA and a lower effective tax rate. We generated $196 million of cash flow from continuing operations, spent $167 million on gross CapEx and received $78 million of proceeds from asset sales. Gross CapEx was up $77 million year-over-year driven by our planned investments in expanding our LTL network. This resulted in strong free cash flow of $107 million. Turning to the full year 2022. We delivered revenue of $7.7 billion, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 7%. Adjusted EBITDA was $997 million in 2022, up from $812 million a year ago. This was primarily driven by a 12% increase in adjusted EBITDA in our LTL business and a $75 million reduction in corporate expense. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased by 82%, coming in at $3.53 per share this year. We generated cash flow from operating activities of $824 million for 2022 and free cash flow of $391 million, which was up 11% from the prior year. Our CapEx investments of $521 million almost doubled from a year ago as we accelerated our investments in the business to support our long-term growth targets. Our LTL adjusted operating ratio, excluding real estate, improved by 40 basis points from the prior year to 83.9%. Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $460 million of cash. This cash, combined with available borrowing capacity under committed borrowing facilities gave us $930 million of liquidity at year-end. We had no borrowings outstanding under our ABL facility and our net debt leverage at year-end was 2.1x adjusted EBITDA, down from 2.7x a year ago on a previously reported basis prior to the RXO spin-off. This week, we extended our ABL maturity to 2026. And we recently received a credit upgrade from S&P from BB to BB+. Turning to the first quarter 2023. We expect the company to generate year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA in the low double digits. This anticipates $5 million to $10 million of unallocated corporate costs in the quarter. We expect to wind down these costs over the course of the year. And finally, a reminder that starting with the current quarter, our adjusted operating ratio will include the allocation of incremental corporate costs and exclude pension income. You'll find a historical reconciliation for this in our investor presentation. In addition, we're providing assumptions for the full year 2023 to help with your planning. These are gross CapEx of $500 million to $600 million, interest expense of $185 million to $195 million, pension income of approximately $20 million, an effective tax rate of 24% to 26% and a diluted share count of 117 million shares. Overall, we're pleased with our results in 2022 and are excited about our growth prospects as we move forward. We'll now take your questions. Operator, please open the line. Stephanie, it's Carl Anderson. I can -- I'll take that. So if you look at the fourth quarter, our corporate expense was $29 million. And as we begin 2023, $20 million of that will be allocated to LTL starting in the first quarter. So it really leaves about $9 million left as far as the pure corporate expense. And as I said in the prepared remarks, we expect our corporate expense in the first quarter to range around $5 million to $10 million, in line with what we saw with you make that adjustment. And importantly, we expect that to wind down throughout the course of the year. Yes. So Chris, it's -- if you think about comparing it to Q1 of a year ago, that base is $184 million. And then as far as the corporate cost, as I referenced, in that range, $5 million to $10 million, that will still be in that corporate bucket. It will not be part of LTL. LTL will have the additional $20 million approximately that we previously said we would be allocating it. Yes. I think, Brandon, as you look, we did include in the investor presentation, a pretty detailed historical reconciliation on Page 27, specifically for the LTL segment that kind of walks the differences on a year-over-year basis and by quarter for all of '22 as well as full year '21. Yes. So for Q1 of 2022, now that we've allocated $20 million, it's going to be $186 million would be the LTL EBITDA for Q1 of '22. Thanks, Allison. Yes, if you look at 2022, our total CapEx, the company is about $521 million. About 85% of that relates to the LTL business. And as you can see from our guide for our planning assumptions for 2023, we do expect CapEx at the midpoint to be up over what it was last year. So -- and again, I think that same percentage mix between LTL and Europe is how you should think about it. Yes. On the $20 million, I kind of walked you through that, Ken. On the $15 million, I guess, I'm not understanding the question. Well, no. I mean, as we go forward pension -- as we think about income, pension will be excluded. Overall EBITDA, though, has pension income. So -- and as we said in the planning assumptions, we kind of showed you what the expectations were for 2023 as far as pension income being approximately $20 million for the full year. Yes, sure. So if you look at kind of the breakdown, about 70% of the CapEx that we're planning for really is between tractors and trailers, and it's weighted pretty much equally. The remaining amount is kind of split between other things. There's a little bit in there for real estate as well, which probably adds another 15%. And if you think about the mix between purchase and lease about 40% -- or excuse me, between owned and leased, 40% is owned. Yes, I mean I think as we look at -- yes, it's a fair question. As we look at the first quarter, we are planning to really accelerate our CapEx expenditures. And it's really going to be based off of the availability of getting new trucks in. So there's a chance we can have -- up to 50% of our CapEx spend could occur in the first quarter, obviously subject to the availability of what we're seeing right now. I think additionally, as far as cash flow, a couple of other points we should, kind of point one, we are not planning for any real estate sales in the -- in 2023. And two, we do expect to have higher cash interest costs as well that would factor into your free cash flow numbers for us. Jack, it's Carl. So if we look at just from a return on invested capital perspective, we are actually getting a very sizable return. It's -- if we look at what we did, it's running probably 34% as far as on a return-on-investment capital. So reinvesting into the network, obviously, is very -- is a pretty big benefit as it relates to what we're getting for those investments."

            "name": "Mario Harik",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call. We're excited to talk about our simplified business model following the spin-off of RXO and how it focuses our resources on growing the value of our LTL network. I am here in Greenwich with Carl Anderson, our CFO, who will cover the fourth quarter and full year results. And we also have Ali Faghri with us for Q&A. Ali is our new Chief Strategy Officer, and he's a great addition to the executive team. Yesterday, you saw us report a solid quarter of growth in a soft macro environment. That statement is true for the company as a whole and also for our 2 reportable segments, North American LTL and European Transportation. Company-wide, we generated revenue of $1.8 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 3% and we grew adjusted EBITDA year-over-year by 38%, which far outpaced our revenue growth and beat consensus for the 11th straight quarter. For the full year, we generated over $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA in our LTL business. This exceeded a major target we had set for 2022. Looking at the business by segment, I want to focus on LTL and some key results that tie directly to our growth plan. In the fourth quarter, the LTL industry in North America saw a year-over-year decline in shipment volumes due to macro pressure. But at XPO, we grew our shipment count and tonnage. Our positive tonnage growth ties back to the plan we call LTL 2.0, which is to invest in capacity ahead of demand and earn profitable market share by providing best-in-class service. We continue to have great success on boarding new business, including volumes from blue-chip customers who are either signing up with us for the first time or giving us more of their business. This drove a strategic change in our mix in the quarter, and our tonnage ended up more than typical seasonality. We also had a high-margin local base, and these customers give us more shipments per day. However, the weight per shipment declined in the softer macro. As a result, our yield came in at the lower end of our outlook. Our mix should become a tailwind for us to both volume and yield as the macro recovers. The second reason we're outperforming is service, and I'll give you an example. In the fourth quarter, we improved our damage frequency by 66% year-over-year to the lowest damage frequency in 6 years. There's no doubt that our intense focus on service is helping us secure more tonnage, especially as we're hearing from new customers that we rank as one of their top LTL carriers for quality of service. Customer feedback like this has a ripple effect on our entire organization. Employee satisfaction is up sharply, which is an indication of the pride our team is taking in our service standards. In our year-end survey, employee satisfaction, including drivers and dock workers was the highest in more than a decade. For the full year 2022, from an operating ratio perspective, there were a lot of puts and takes, including the softer macro. We improved our adjusted operating ratio excluding real estate gains, by 40 basis points for the year, which was short of our target range. Strategically, we made good progress in setting up the network to capitalize when volumes rebound, and we like our positioning. We're executing on the growth levels in our plan, like the 369 net new doors we added with 6 new terminal openings. In the next 90 days, we expect to open another 167 net new doors in Salt Lake City, Atlanta and Dallas. We're also following the unique levers we have within our company to help drive our expansion. In 2022, we increased our line haul fleet by over 10% by manufacturing more than 4,700 trailers in-house. We also trained over 1,700 truck drivers last year at our driver training schools. These are tangible advantages we have in the execution of our long-term plan for LTL 2.0 and they're gaining ground. Turning to Europe. This business continues to perform ahead of expectations with solid organic growth, particularly in the U.K. and Spain. In constant currency, fourth quarter revenue in Europe increased year-over-year by 9%. Our pricing in Europe was up year-over-year in Q4, and we're continuing to win business with new and existing customers. Despite the macro uncertainty there, our sales pipeline continues to be very robust. I want to wrap up my remarks by summarizing the exciting trajectory with creative going into 2023. We successfully completed the spinoff of RXO in November, which simplified our business model. We now have 2 highly focused business segments with strong value propositions in the customer market they know best. In North America, we drove above-industry tonnage growth in LTL in Q4, and we ended the year with over $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA, making good on the targets we set 5 years earlier. We're winning LTL market share with our service quality and also through our investment in network capacity. We're on track to open the remainder of the 900 net new doors we projected in our growth plan. And in Europe, our business is performing above expectations. This is the momentum we're carrying into 2023, and we intend to continue to invest in growth. We're confident that we'll deliver on the 3 targets we set for our LTL business; a revenue CAGR of 6% to 8%, an adjusted EBITDA CAGR of 11% to 13% and an adjusted operating ratio improvement of at least 600 basis points. These targets covered the period from 2021 through 2027. And as we move toward them, we'll focus on being world-class in every aspect of our business. We know that this combination of financial and operational excellence is the most sustainable way to deliver outsized shareholder value. Now I'm going to hand it over to Carl to discuss our results and our balance sheet. Carl, over to you. Well, we expect company-wide adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter to be up low double digits, as Carl mentioned earlier. For LTL specifically, we expect adjusted EBITDA to either be slightly down or slightly up depending on what happens in the demand environment in the month of March, which, as you know, is a big driver for the first quarter for us. From an OR perspective, we expect it to be better than typical seasonality in the first quarter, typically, seasonality for us is a 50-basis point deterioration from the fourth quarter going into the first quarter. Now that said, we're off to a great start here in the month of January. Our tonnage is up and better than typical seasonality and our yield ex fuel is in line with the fourth quarter [on a year-over-year basis as well] (added by company after the call). Now we are cautiously optimistic about the demand environment. So when we look at the back half of the quarter, based on what we're seeing in our results today, we are seeing a pickup and more strength from a volume perspective. But obviously, we'll see what the rest of the quarter will do. But hopefully, this gives you color on all of -- on the entire fourth quarter. Yes, sure. On the -- in the first quarter, we expect yield to be in line with the fourth quarter [on a year-over-year basis] (added by the company after the call), here in the month of January, that was the case. We did take a GRI for our local accounts in the month of January as opposed to what we did last year in the fourth quarter. But we will continue to be impacted by some of the mix dynamics we mentioned in some of our prepared remarks in the first quarter, but we continue to see the pricing environment being rational. Sure, Scott. So in the fourth quarter, tonnage came in on the lower end of our outlook, but we obviously bucked industry trends in terms of our tonnage being up and our shipment counts also being higher than our tonnage. Our tonnage came in roughly at plus 1% for the quarter. Now in terms of the trends within the quarter, December was the soft month of the quarter, which was impacted by weather in the back half of December. So that was more of a softer than what we saw for the remainder of the quarter. Now as I mentioned earlier though, January is up better than the fourth quarter numbers and it's better than typical seasonality as well. And we're seeing -- we saw a strong demand from our customers especially a lot of the new customers we onboarded through the course of 2022. Yes, you got it. So predominantly for the fourth quarter came in short of our expectation, driven by the tonnage outcome in the month of December. So if you take out the impact of weather in the back half of December, we would have exceeded our expectation on OR improvement for the fourth quarter. Yes. Not outside what we had discussed on the last call, which was more driven by elevated cost inflation. When you think about labor expenses and maintenance costs were higher than expected but we already had factors for that when we got together on the last earnings call. Yes. So as we head into 2023, obviously, we're seeing inflation starting to taper off in terms of overall cost. When you look at the fourth quarter for us, the 2 big categories of costs are labor and purchase transportation. And for our wages, these were up 10% on a year-on-year basis in the fourth quarter. And roughly 2/3 of that was based on wage inflation, additional wages we have given our folks in the field and the other 1/3 was to support the 1.5% shipment growth that we had in the fourth quarter. On the purchase transportation cost, that was down 10% in the fourth quarter. That was -- but also -- and appreciate that fuel as part of that line for the third-party providers. So effectively, the rates were actually down more than that in the fourth quarter. Now as we head into 2023, that stronger cost inflation we saw in 2022 is starting to subside, especially on the purchase transportation side that will become a tailwind through the course of the year. And same thing on wages, we expect them, obviously, to be up but not as up as they were in 2022. If you take a step back and you look at the channel mix dynamic in the fourth quarter, and so I'll walk you through that, and then we'll talk about 2023 and beyond. But when you think about the fourth quarter, we did have a channel mix impact on our yield, but that was driven by onboarding larger strategic national accounts in the back half of 2022, which we have discussed on prior calls as well. And these were important to build density in lanes in our network. Now on the local channel side, these are typically smaller accounts that are higher yielding freight for that type of business. And we have also taken market share in that particular segment where our shipment count in the fourth quarter was up mid-single digit, but tonnage was down and that's driven predominantly through the softness in the macro where these customers were shipping -- again, we gained more customers, however, they were shipping lower weight on a per shipment basis. So as the macro recovers, those local accounts would have higher weight per shipment that would drive tonnage up commensurate with the volume of shipments we're seeing in the network and that becomes both a tailwind for tonnage and for yield for us moving forward. So that's the dynamic between national and local. Yes. So overall, it's still a similar strategy. But as we switch to LTL 2.0, the strategy is also around gaining market share. And again, when you look at national accounts from a mix perspective, in an LTL network, they create density on a lane per lane basis, which is very important. And we use the metric internally called a lane balance factor in our operation which as you get closer to a stronger lane balance that's overall accretive for your margins. So when we onboard the national accounts and we say that a good fit for the network, they are improving the lane balance and using available capacity that we have in the network. Now over time, in the current market, we -- obviously, there is softer freight demand but as that recovers and you see that pickup in that local channel as well as the nationals we onboarded, that would be a tailwind for both volume and yield. Now in terms of the impact on OR, obviously, that will depend on many factors because OR will include the combination of volume, yield and cost management as well. So all of these lead to an outcome. But obviously, our goal is by 2027 to have improved our operating ratio by at least 600 basis points, and we're confident we're going to deliver on that. Thanks, Jordan. We're making great progress on the rollout of our proprietary technology. As we have discussed in our Investor Day. There are number of initiatives and proprietary pieces power tech that helps us drive results. Starting with pricing. This year, we made great progress in upgrading our discussions on the last call, our cost modeling and how we allocate cost of shipments and how we price more efficiently. So in this environment, we are investing more than our sales force, and we've had record numbers of RFPs that we are driving through the system, and having a platform that makes it very easy for our pricing analysts to price that business and have a quick turnaround with the sales team is essential and our technology is enabling these things. A similar things, as you mentioned on dynamic pricing, our platform is enabling us on the spot business side to be able to onboard more business and being able to react more quickly to the environment. On the cost management side, we've made great progress in our linehaul technology platform and how we optimize linehaul runs similarly on the pickup and delivery platform for both our planners and dispatchers. And then finally, for dock efficiency, our solutions with the smart labor platform enables us to improve how we operate our dock ships and make them commensurate with the volume we are getting. So great progress across the board with our tech. Brandon, you're coming in very choppy. We couldn't hear you well. But let me try to ask your question, that you're asking about the baseline of 2021, 2022 and how corporate expenses are layering and moving forward as well? That's correct. For LTL EBITDA, we expect it to either be down slightly or up slightly, depending on the demand environment in the month of March. That's correct. Yes. So what -- first, I'll start on the full year. So when you look -- because obviously, we had the old definition last year, Scott, that was updated with, as Carl mentioned earlier on with the corporate allocations and the removal of pension income. So last year's OR, the number was 83.9%. And when you account for the allocation of corporate and the exclusion of pension income that would have been in 86% and changed OR. Now for the full year of 2023, we're obviously not guiding for the full year, given where things are this year, but there is a path to improve OR this year, but it will depend on the macro. We feel cautiously optimistic about the demand outlook, as I mentioned earlier. And based on what we're seeing today and our results, again, volume is up, it's better than seasonality, and we're seeing stronger demand from customers. And we're hearing optimism from our customers as you head into the spring and the back half of the year. But obviously, we're watching the macro like everybody else is. Now specifically in the demand environment, the segments are different retail has been -- had sequential declines in the fourth quarter, but the feedback we hear now that the retailers have gone through that inventories and now that we're going to see more normal seasonal buying patterns in 2023. And the industrial, we're seeing short-term softness, but we've seen some strength in some of the areas like auto, machinery, short-cycle manufacturing where they're outlining a more robust 2023. So depending on what that environment does for the rest of the year would dictate what OR would do. And obviously, there are dynamics at our yield, and there are a lot of company-specific initiatives we're driving on the cost side like in-sourcing linehaul. And all of these variables would lead to the outcome for 2023 on OR. But again, there is a path to improve OR in 2023, but all of these variables will dictate that outcome. For the first quarter, as I mentioned earlier, we expect OR seasonally to be better than typical seasonality from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. And typically, that's a 50-basis points deterioration is what we see from Q4 to Q1, and we expect to do better than that. Correct. And on the high end of the range, if you think of an EBITDA improvement for the first quarter, Scott, that would be an OR improvement for the quarter. Year-over-year, on the low end of the range in terms of EBITDA being slightly down, that would be a year-on-year deterioration but better than seasonality on the high end of the range where EBITDA improved slightly in the first quarter, that would be an OR improvement on a year-on-year basis. No, we're not sacrificing price to buy volume with price. There were a few dynamics in the fourth quarter that impacted us. The first one, Scott, is that we were lapping a early GRI we took in Q4 of last year. While this year, we took that in the month of January, which is usually our customary time line. And I mentioned the yield dynamic on the mix channel earlier on. So we onboarded those national accounts that are strategic for our network, yet the higher-yielding local accounts, again, their shipment count is up mid-single digits, so we're taking market share. However, we've seen a weight per shipment decline in that channel that caused the overall weight to be down. So that dynamic is what effectively impacted yield. And then finally, life of haul was down 1.3% for the quarter, where we onboarded more next day and 2-day lanes shipments to our network. And we also saw less outbound California freight coming through lesser imports in the fourth quarter, which has a direct correlation to yield. Now if you take a step back, our contract renewals in the quarter were up roughly 7%. That's for existing business. And we continue to see from us in the overall industry, very rational pricing in how we price the business. And on the lower side, so we -- obviously, when we started the LTL 2.0 plan, our goal was to open up 900 new doors. And these were based on areas where we have line of sight on demand from customers. So a lot of the markets that we go after, we already know that we need capacity and we're seeing that demand come from customers. So over the next 90 days, we're going to be opening up additional doors, 167 net new doors in Salt Lake City, in Atlanta and in Dallas, Texas as well. And we have a plan through the remainder of the year to open up more doors in those markets where we need that capacity. For example, Houston is a great market for us. Florida is a great market for us, where we need more capacity that we're going to be looking to add. But we're being very disciplined in how we open up those stores and all the terminals we've opened up have been operating better than expectations. This is -- it would be in the ZIP code of mid-single digit, but it will depend on what the truck for us because we have roughly around 1/4 of our linehaul miles are outsourced it will depend on what the truckload rates do for the balance of the year. We expect this to be a good tailwind for us here in the first half of the year, but it depends on the demand environment in the back half and how that translates. On the weightage side, we expect it to be in the sub mid-single digits, but in that territory. Sure. So first, starting with the type of freight that we look for. We look for freight that can build density in our network. So effectively, these are 48x48 skids that are -- that fit well in an LTL network, typically going dock-to-dock in terms of B2B-type shipments is the primary type of freight that we're going after. We also look to go after freight that creates density around our terminals. So we think about pickups that are in proximity to our terminals is another way we think about the quality of the freight and the -- how it relates to our network as well. Now in terms of channel mix, we are looking to build density, both international channel and the local channel. As I mentioned earlier, in the local channel, we're making great strides and onboarding new customers. This year, we ended the year with 27,000 customers, which was up 2,000 from our prior number of 25,000 customers, and a lot of these were new local accounts we are onboarding. And with having that success in sales, it's driven by 2 main areas of focus. One, our service is up and to the right, and we're hearing great feedback from customers on the quality of service; and two, is the investments we are making in capacity to be able to handle that business. And we want to grow in both of these channels with the type of freight and the type of profile I just mentioned. So Tom, it's a combination of all the things I mentioned earlier on. So the mix of channels is one component. And obviously, the local being down on weight but shipments being up, that's going to become a tailwind. But it's also the other items that our GRI and on length of haul as well. And a lot of these things would recover as the macro -- as the freight demand environment recovers through the course of 2023. Now going back to the local channel, the fact that shipments are up as the macro recovers, you would see that wafer shipments start to go up and then the overall tonnage we're getting in that channel would go up, which would be a lift for yield. And for our national accounts, we're looking at these as longer-term strategic relationship. Just to give you an example, the average tenure of our top 10 customer today is 60 years. So these are customers that we're going to be fine-tuning the business we do with them over time. So again, overall, we expect yield to remain positive, and we expect our strategy to pay dividends as the macro recovered and the freight environment gets stronger. And we like our positioning. Yes. And Ken, going back to your question on OR definition. So we closed last year with an OR of 83.9%, which obviously Con-way had more than one line of business, and they had a corporate structure as well. So they had the warehousing business, which was the former Menlo business. They had the truckload business and they had LTL business. Now what do you think on a -- and we haven't changed that definition since we acquired the business back in 2015. And on that reporting basis, the OR was 83.9% at year-end 2022. Now moving forward, and we just substituting our Investor Day, as we become a stand-alone LTL company, we are taking back the corporate cost and putting them in LTL effectively. What Carl mentioned earlier on, there are the $5 million to $10 million of unallocated costs that would be in the third quarter that would wind down for the course of the year as we rationalize the corporate structure. And this is where that new definition kicks into place. Now with the new definition in 2022 with 86.8% from an OR perspective. And obviously, as we move forward, I would go to improve by at least 600 basis points by the time we get through 2027. Sure. I think Ken, we're actually doing both. So when you think about our sales efforts, I mean, again, when you think about the investments we have made in capacity and the improvements in service and the investments in our sales force, the goal is to grow profitable national accounts and very profitable local account business as well. So when you look at the fourth quarter, as an example, with the local accounts, shipment count is up mid-single digit. So we are actually going after both. And for the national accounts, we remain very disciplined with the type of freight we are getting into the network. I mentioned earlier on one of the metrics we look at internally is the balance -- is a lane balance factor and we are onboarding business that enables us to improve that factor and which will make the local accounts more profitable over time as well. But you need a combination of both to be able to drive higher margins over time. Yes, Jeff. So when you look at our service levels, I mentioned this in my opening remarks, our damage frequency has improved 66% year-on-year in the fourth quarter, and it's the best it's been in 6 years -- of any quarter in 6 years. So when you look at it from that perspective, obviously, not only really covered from the 18 months ago, but we're now on a path to get back to company records in terms of the quality that we offer to our customers. And similarly, our on-time service was up 14 points on a year-on-year basis in the fourth quarter. Now we do surveys with our customers on a weekly basis, and these are live shipping customers. And the customer satisfaction in the fourth quarter, exiting the month of December was a company record when we started doing this a couple of years ago in terms of taking that satisfaction. So the improvement has been dramatic and the improvement has been very effective, and we hear it from our customers. Now going back to your question on the customers, that we could have lost. Obviously, when we onboard business, some of it is existing customers who we are expanding the amount of business that we do with. To give you an example, recently, I mentioned last quarter, we onboarded a new top 10 customer. That was a customer that was doing a small amount of revenue with us prior, and now the amount of revenue is multiple. I mean we're talking more than 10x the amount of volume that they used to do with us pre those improvements. So we see a direct correlation between the improvements we're making in service and customers wanting to give us a bigger share of wallet and giving us more business as well. Yes, we are past that in terms of service. And again, when I talk to our large customers, we've onboarded, I consistently get the feedback that we are one of the top carriers in terms of service quality. Now obviously, with some of the existing customers that could have left us due to service issues in the past, these as they come back, that takes time to be able to grow that -- the share of wallet with them as well. But generally, when we think about the impact of service, currently, we are providing close to best-in-class service, and we are on a up and to the right trajectory of continuous improvement and focus on it. When you look at fuel, it's always been part of the economics of an LTL carrier. So when customers pay us our services, they have a price that is inclusive of fuel and similar to all carriers. Now when you look at the price of diesel today, last year, we -- on a full year basis, the price per gallon was roughly in the upwards of $5 per gallon while currently it's in that $4.6 range. So if the level stays at current levels, that will most likely be some pressure related to that. And obviously, the positive side though of fuel being lower is going to simulate more economic activity and also would have more yield ex-fuel type strength associated with that as well. But obviously, we'll see how the year does. We are focused from our perspective on the levers that we can control, obviously and few -- we'll see what the year looks like as the year develops. For the fourth quarter, we were roughly at 7%. That's correct. When you look at for the first -- yes. Sequential, when you look at the first quarter, we expect the year-on-year to be up similar to what we've seen in the fourth quarter ex fuel. And this is what we have seen in the month of January. Now some of the dynamics that impacted our yield in the fourth quarter are sell-through for the first quarter which includes the mix change between national and local. And the local weight per shipment, it still has a similar dynamic of what we saw in the fourth quarter so far here in the -- at the beginning of the first quarter. So that dynamic and mix change has not changed from the fourth quarter. The only change is the GRI that we took in the month of January. Now typically, our local accounts are roughly the 1/4 of our business. So obviously, that's about a 1% flow-through on -- call it, 1% to 2% flow-through on yield -- on total system yield associated with the GRI we took in January. But again, there's the same dynamics for national to local ship and dynamic for length of haul are still impactful in the first quarter as well. So we are back to pre-COVID levels on these numbers for quality, which is the damage frequency piece, we are back to the best in 6 years. And on time and another metric we use internally is what we call network fluidity, we're back to what we were in pre-COVID today. So in terms of overall capacity in the network, we're roughly in the 20% available capacity across the network. However, in some markets, we already tapped out on capacity. I mentioned earlier on, for example, the markets we're opening up in. When we opened up in Atlanta, a terminal over -- through the course of 2022, we've seen volume in that market uptick considerably because we had the customers, we had the demand and we needed more physical space. Now when you look at our plan of adding 900 net new doors through the course of the 2 years since we started our LTL 2.0 plan, that's roughly around 3% per year and it is in markets where we already were tapped out on capacity and we're adding more capacity to handle more volume for our customers. Yes. When we look overall I mean and we discussed this quite a bit Jack in the past. A lot of it went back to capacity we had into the network. So on pre-COVID all the way through end of 2021, the amount of capital we invested into the business was based on a maintenance amount of CapEx to refresh equipment but not to add capacity so we can handle more volume. And obviously, we have discussed quite a bit what happened back in 2021. And these were the dynamics. Now moving forward, we're solving for all of these things. So we are investing capital in capacity so we can say yes more often to the customer and ahead of demand. We are very focused on continuous improvements in service to be best in class in the service we offer our customers. And these over time, will pay dividends both in terms of margin expansion and higher returns through our plans to 2027. Thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning, and I'm proud that we delivered solid results across the business, and I want to thank our 38,000 team members not just for the progress we've made, but also for the momentum they've created. In North America, this will be our first full year as a pure-play LTL carrier, and we have a strong organization who's bringing high energy to all 3 parts of our growth strategy, investing in network capacity ahead of demand, providing best-in-class service to earn market share and optimizing pricing and operations through our technology. We're confident that we'll make more progress this year with all 3 of these objectives, and we look forward to seeing you at the upcoming conferences. Operator, please close the line."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. Before the call begins, let me read a brief statement on behalf of the company regarding forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. During the call, the company will be making certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws, which by their nature involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. A discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in the company\u2019s SEC filings as well as in its earnings release. The forward-looking statements in the company\u2019s earnings release or made on this call are made only as of today and the company has no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements except to the extent required by law. During this call, the company may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined under applicable SEC rules. Reconciliations of such non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are contained in the company\u2019s earnings release and the related financial tables or on its website. You can find a copy of the company\u2019s earnings release, which contains additional important information regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures in the Investors section of the company\u2019s website. I will now turn the call over to Brad Jacobs. Mr. Jacobs, you may begin.\nBrad Jacobs: Good morning, everybody and Happy Halloween. Thanks for joining our earnings call. With me today in Greenwich are Mario Harik and Drew Wilkerson, our two incoming CEOs of XPO and RXO and Ravi Tulsyan, our CFO of XPO. We will be joined during Q&A by XPO\u2019s Chief Strategy Officer, Matt Basler and from RXO we have Jared Weisfeld, Chief Strategy Officer and Jamie Harris, Chief Financial Officer. This morning, we reported another strong quarter with over $3 billion of revenue and record third quarter operating income, up year-over-year by 65%. Notably, we generated $142 million of free cash flow, while more than doubling the historical gross CapEx we invested in our North American LTL network. Under Mario\u2019s leadership, our plan for LTL 2.0 is gaining momentum. This morning, we reported third quarter records for LTL revenue and adjusted EBITDA. And one of the most telling LTL metrics is our accelerating year-over-year tonnage trend, which improved every month through the quarter and inflected positive in September. Our third quarter tonnage outperformed typical seasonality, which is the opposite of what we are hearing in the industry. Importantly, our tonnage remains strong in October and we expect positive year-over-year tonnage for the fourth quarter. We are getting more freight from customers for two good reasons. One is the investments we have been making in capacity and the other is our improved quality of service. Our truck brokerage business under Drew\u2019s leadership continued to outperform in the third quarter. The team grew volume year-over-year by an impressive 9%. They also delivered a very strong gross profit margin of 19%. I am pleased that both companies will be strongly positioned for growth when RXO spins off tomorrow. We have been working towards separating our asset-based and asset-light businesses, since we announced our strategic plan in March and this is a watershed moment for XPO\u2019s shareholders. The final piece of the plan is the divestiture of our European business. We will not be providing any updates on that sales process today. Before I close, I want to thank Ravi for his many contributions to XPO\u2019s success over the last 6 years. Ravi was instrumental to our GXO spin last year. And he has led our finance organization through the current spin process and the sale of intermodal. We wish Ravi the very best. And we are pleased that he will assist in the transition to Carl Anderson, our incoming CFO, who joins us next week. I look forward to working with Mario and Drew in my roles as Executive Chairman of XPO and Non-Executive Chairman of RXO. And now, Ravi will cover the quarter. Ravi?\nRavi Tulsyan: Thank you, Brad and good morning everyone. Today, I will discuss our third quarter results and our balance sheet and liquidity. In the third quarter, we generated revenue of just over $3 billion. Excluding the impact of the intermodal business, which was sold in March, revenue increased 3% year-over-year. Currency had a negative impact on our reported revenue of $86 million or 3%. We grew adjusted EBITDA to $352 million, reflecting strong earnings growth across the businesses. The year-over-year increase in adjusted EBITDA was 15% or an increase of 25% excluding intermodal and gains from real estate sales. FX negatively impacted EBITDA by $8 million in the quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was a third quarter record of 11.6%, representing a year-over-year improvement of 220 basis points. The firm pricing environment continued this quarter and helped offset inflationary pressures. Our European business also continued its strong performance with organic revenue growth of 6.8%, which was driven by both volume growth and price. Our corporate costs for the third quarter, excluding one-time expenses was down year-over-year by 37%. This reflects continued rationalization of our corporate cost structure in preparation for the upcoming spin-off of RXO. Our interest expense for the quarter was $35 million compared to $53 million in the year ago period. The effective tax rate for the adjusted EPS for the quarter was 23%. Our adjusted earnings per diluted share, was $1.45, which was up from $0.94 a year ago or an increase of 54%. This increase was primarily driven by higher adjusted EBITDA and lower interest expense. We generated $265 million of cash flow from continuing operations, spent $127 million on growth CapEx and received $4 million of proceeds from asset sales. Gross CapEx was up $50 million year-over-year, primarily allocated to investments in our LTL network capacity. Our free cash flow was $142 million. This includes $53 million of cash outflows related to transaction costs that were not included in our free cash flow guidance. Excluding these transaction costs, our free cash flow was $195 million for the quarter. Moving on to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $544 million of cash. This cash combined with available borrowing capacity under committed borrowing facilities gave us over $1.5 billion of liquidity at quarter end. We had no borrowings outstanding under our ABL facility and our net leverage at quarter end was 1.7x adjusted EBITDA. RXO will dividend the net proceeds to XPO, which XPO will then use to pay down debt. Lastly, on a personal note, I am very thankful to XPO and Brad for the opportunity to be part of this leadership team and the incredible transformation we have achieved over the last few years. Both companies are well positioned to continue on the growth path. And I wish both Jamie Harris and Carl Anderson success in the new roles. I will now turn things over to Mario.\nMario Harik: Thanks, Ravi and good morning, everyone. As you saw from our earnings report, we achieved the second straight quarter of tangible results from our growth strategy, which we call LTL 2.0. Our investments and capacity and the momentum we have with service quality are accelerating our top and bottom lines. We reported revenue of $1.2 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $258 million, which exceedingly real estate gains, was 19% higher than a year ago. Both our revenue and adjusted EBITDA are third quarter records and we continue to expect to deliver at least $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA this year based on no more than $50 million of real estate gains in the fourth quarter. As Brad mentioned, we steadily improved our tonnage through the quarter, outpacing typical seasonality. A key inflection point came in September when we flipped tonnage positive year-over-year. Our tonnage trends continue to surpass typical seasonality in October. I am pleased that our results are strengthening relative to our peers. Our operating ratio in the quarter was 85% and our adjusted operating ratio was 82.8%, that\u2019s a year-over-year improvement of 160 basis points. The full year target we put out with our preliminary third quarter results is for 50 to 100 basis points of adjusted operating ratio improvement year-over-year. We expect at least 120 basis points of year-over-year improvement in Q4. In the third quarter, we improved yield by 7%. And we continue to see rational industry pricing. Now, I want to double click on LTL 2.0 and talk about what\u2019s driving our results. We focus on two critical areas to drive long-term performance. The first is providing world class service to our customers and the second is investing in capacity ahead of demand. Our objectives are to gain market share, optimize pricing, and improve operational efficiency. It starts with our investment in capacity. Our LTL CapEx spend this year will end up at 9% to 10% of revenue, which is about double our historical CapEx budget. In August, we opened a new terminal in New Jersey to manage volume flowing through the Northeast Corridor. This replaced a smaller terminal and added 24 new doors to our network. This expansion, in addition to the other five terminals we have opened over the last year, puts us at 369 doors against our target of 900 net new doors open by year end 2023. On the trailer side, our ability to manufacture our all trailers at scale is unique in the industry. Our trailer production rate is the highest that\u2019s ever been. We added a second production line in the first quarter. And we will be adding a third line in the fourth quarter. We are tracking to expand our line-haul trailer fleet by more than 10% by year end 2022. Our goal is to increase trailer production by another 50% next year, which would allow us to further expand with our line-haul and our pickup and delivery fleet. On the tractor side, we are working with the OEMs to bring on more trucks in 2023. And for our drivers, we have expanded our training footprint to what we believe is the largest in the industry, with 130 driver school locations. This is another company-specific advantage and we expect to train 1,700 drivers this year. In 2023 and for at least the next several years, our plan calls for CapEx at 8% to 12% of revenue to expand our capacity, so we can say yes to customers more often. The other two goals of the plan, optimizing pricing and improving operational efficiency are a function of our people and our technology delivering great service. Damage frequency is one of the metrics customers care most about. In September, we delivered our best damage frequency since 2016 and improved again in October. We improved damage frequency year-over-year in the third quarter by 58%, and the numbers are up and to the right, with 76% improvement in September and 86% in October. That didn\u2019t happen in a vacuum. We changed our incentive comp to focus on reducing damages and improving shipping quality, all the way down to the supervisor level. We also launched a program at our terminal called Gladiator to recognize quality loading. If the quality target is exceeded, the entire team at that terminal is rewarded. And we launched new technology in the field that allows us to raise the 30,000 trailers we load each day. We can now pinpoint trailers that fall short of our quality loading standards and identify which supervisors and dockworkers need more coaching. These are just some of the internal initiatives that are energizing the team to elevate our customer service metrics and the impact has been dramatic. Another important investment we are making is in our sales force. We are taking a layered approach to sales with teams dedicated to strategic accounts, national accounts and also the base of 24,000 smaller accounts that are our bread and butter. All three customer segments have a role in growing the business. In the third quarter we onboarded some major accounts with the potential to become top 10 customers for us. The feedback we hear from these customers is that they are pleased with their onboarding experience and with the service we provide them. There is direct correlation between our success in winning this business and the fact that we are willing to invest in capacity and service to back up our promises. This is where our technology comes in as well. I spent a lot of time in the field talking to our managers and also our team members on the frontline. We have equipped them with new tools to make them more successful and we put in strong feedback loops to capture their inputs. The result has been really exciting. And the most recent employee survey we conducted last month, which includes our dockworkers and drivers, we saw the highest engagement and highest job satisfaction since we acquired Con-way in 2015. What we are doing now is building off that culture so that our entire team has the voice and how we get the world class. So in summary, we are investing in every lever of growth, including network capacity, quality of service and the satisfaction of our team to deliver that service. This is LTL 2.0 and we believe that this plan focused solely on North American LTL can move us to the top of the industry at a pace that outperforms our peers over time. Now, I hand it over to Drew to cover truck brokerage on RXO. Drew?\nDrew Wilkerson: Thanks, Mario. I\u2019d like to thank Brad and the entire XPO team. It\u2019s been an absolute privilege to work with this top-tier group over the past decade. North American transportation, soon to be RXO, had another strong quarter. We continue to harness our massive capacity and cutting-edge technology to grow volume, expand gross profit margin and drive adoption of our proprietary brokerage platform. I will start by discussing some key metrics from the quarter and then talk about our strong position heading into tomorrow\u2019s launch of RXO. In the third quarter, we delivered more loads than in any other quarter in our history. Our volume was up year-over-year by 9%. Our September average loads per day, was also an all-time record and this was not an anomaly. Over the last 3 years, we grew volume at a 15% CAGR and we grew gross profit dollars at a 35% CAGR. Our consistent outperformance proves that we can take share in any market. And importantly, our growth is profitable. Our gross profit margin was a strong 19%, up year-over-year by nearly 500 basis points and our year-over-year gross profit dollars were up 31%. In the third quarter, we generated operating income of $52 million and adjusted EBITDA of $78 million. Our technology is the engine behind our financial outperformance. Over the last decade, we built this platform from scratch. And now, our strategic investments are continuing to drive adoption among customers and carriers. Another 10,000 carriers have registered on RXO Connect. And our mobile app has been downloaded 850,000 times, that\u2019s up 53% year-over-year and 75% of carriers returned to the platform within 1 week. Carriers love how easy it is to use our technology, which gives them access to an enormous amount of volume from the largest shippers in the world. They also love our strong carrier rewards program. In the third quarter, we created or covered 81% of truck brokerage loads digitally. While we anticipate a muted peak season, we are still seeing very strong contractual bid activity and we expect year-over-year load growth in the quarter. In the fourth quarter, we expect to generate adjusted EBITDA as similar to the third quarter, excluding incremental corporate cost as a standalone company. With robust data powering our business and a team with deep understanding of the transportation sector, we are poised to outperform regardless of the fluctuating market conditions. The spin-off of RXO marks a new chapter, but some things will remain the same, for example, our commitment to rapid growth and strong profitability. We operate in a $750 billion industry, led by a $400 billion for-hire truckload market, with $88 billion in brokerage alone. We are an industry leader, yet we only have about 4% share of this growing and underpenetrated market, which gives us an enormous opportunity for growth. Brokers are taking share from asset-based carriers and we are leading the charge. Our customers and carriers are excited about the added value we can provide as a standalone company focused solely on our asset-light services. The RXO brand stands for massive capacity and cutting-edge technology and we have the right people to leverage both advantages. We expect to continue to take share and outperform for our employees, customers, carriers and our shareholders. That concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn it over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Mario, a couple of questions for you. The accelerating relative tonnage in LTL kind of you went through some of the kind of service changes you have made that kind of help you with that, but do you see that as \u2013 are you taking share from your peers or is it more of you being exposed to kind of in a better part of the market and kind of taking more advantage of that?\nMario Harik: See, we are driving taking market share overall. So Ravi, when you look at the investments we have made in capacity first. So by adding terminals in markets where we were short on capacity, we were able to gain more business from customers in those markets. As an example, we opened up a terminal in Atlanta 6 months ago. And in the month of September, we have seen tonnage in the Atlanta market go up 38% on a year-on-year basis. We are also investing in more fleet and more drivers as well and the sales force is very energized with the improvement in both the service product as well as the investments we are making in our sales force. So we had record business wins in the second quarter and the third quarter record pipeline and we are on a very, very strong trend of winning business and winning market share. Now sequentially, when we are \u2013 Q3 was better than typical seasonality when compared to Q2 and we flipped to positive tonnage in the month of September and we also continue to see that in the month of October, where we came in better than typical seasonality and we expect tonnage to be up on a year-on-year basis for the fourth quarter as well.\nRavi Shanker: Got it. And maybe as a follow-up to that kind of can you also unpack the 3Q to 4Q walk, especially on the OR and maybe any puts and takes that we need to keep in mind as we think about that versus seasonality? Thank you.\nMario Harik: Yes, sure. Thanks. So I mentioned tonnage obviously going up, going \u2013 in the fourth quarter. On the yield side, we \u2013 the pricing backdrop remains good, but we expect our yield to be up low to mid single-digits in the fourth quarter, which is driven in partly by tough comp and lapping the GRI that we won\u2019t take till early next year this year. But generally, the momentum is strong on both tonnage and yield from that perspective. On the OR side, it\u2019s at least 120 basis points of OR improvement in the fourth quarter. And obviously, as we execute through the rest of the quarter here, our goal is to succeed that as well.\nRavi Shanker: Great. And congrats to each one of you for the carrier so far and the carriers to come. So thanks for all the time over the years.\nMario Harik: Thanks, Ravi.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good morning. I just want to clarify the fourth quarter OR guidance, I think it\u2019s the worst sequential 3Q to 4Q we have seen in the model. So is this just \u2013 is the incremental tonnage coming on at lower yields or margins? And then any thoughts on what that means for next year\u2019s OR? And then, Drew, I just want to clarify when you said similar EBITDA, I think for the RXO, when are we going to get the pro forma RXO numbers for Q3? I just want to \u2013 we haven\u2019t seen those.\nMario Harik: Scott, I will start first on the LTL side. So as we said at least 120 basis points for the fourth quarter. Now that OR degradation is slightly higher than typical seasonality from the third to the fourth quarter and that\u2019s driven predominantly by cost pressure associated with persistent inflation that we expected that to abate more in the back half of the year. That\u2019s specifically coming from wages is the first category. Generally, our labor is up mid single-digits in part to be able to accommodate the additional demand and tonnage we are getting. And also we are seeing higher inflation in some other cost categories, including maintenance and parts to keep our fleet up-to-date and also some of our facilities expenses are higher due to inflation as well.\nDrew Wilkerson: Scott, this is Drew. You will get historicals through June next week. And I believe December 1 is the day for Q3.\nScott Group: Okay. Yes, if there is any way to get it? The sooner the better, I think, for all of us trying to build models for RXO. Thank you.\nDrew Wilkerson: Understood. Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Wetherbee: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Maybe I wanted to ask Mario to comment on sort of the strategy in the LTL business. So growing tonnage in an environment where we are actually seeing maybe decelerating tonnage at some of your competitors. I wanted to get a sense of whether you feel like there are going to ultimately be trade-offs in yield for tonnage in the quarter \u2013 over the course of the next couple of quarters, particularly for in a more challenging macro environment. And then I know you mentioned there is some incremental door capacity coming online, which can help sort of boost that. But how do you think about the competitive environment and maybe how that influences yields in 2023? And maybe sort of just following up on that comment around how you think the operating ratio may sort of trend out as you think about the next several quarters and into \u201823?\nMario Harik: Sure thing, Chris. So first, starting with the overall strategy, so our strategy is focused on keeping to improve our service product to our customers and delivering best-in-class service as well as investing in capacity in areas and markets where we have a need for that capacity based on what we are hearing from our customers and the demand that we are seeing from our customers and that in turn is leading to us gaining market share through investments in the sales force that we are doing and going and gaining new business. This includes, for example, incentivizing our salespeople to onboard new business, including new logos, as we grow the business moving forward. In terms of yield dynamic, I mean, obviously, yield has always been a very strong in our industry. This is mainly driven by the fact that if you look over the long time period, there is less capacity in the LTL than there was 10 years ago. And we continue to see that play out. So in a softer market, if the market gets softer, we would see yield be in the low single-digit territory. And in a strong market, we\u2019d see that be in the high single-digit, low double-digit territory, and we expect that to play out next year depending on what happens with the macroeconomic conditions. And then finally, for us, for the set of company-specific initiatives, is around operational cost reduction or overall operational excellence. And that\u2019s a combination of using our technology to keep on refining our line-haul pickup and delivery and dock costs as well as in-sourcing third-party line haul to our own assets. Today, third-party line haul is roughly 10% to 11% of our revenue. And when you think about in-sourcing, we save 30% to 40% per mile. So we can see that also obviously being a tailwind for us from a cost perspective, not only next year, but over the years to come. For 2023, obviously, we will talk more about 2023 as we report next quarter, depending on what we\u2019re seeing in the market, but we\u2019re modeling for different scenarios depending on what the macro is doing.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay. And just to clarify, so you think tonnage growth is possible with maintenance of yield growth being \u2013 still being positive, so you can keep the two of those positives together?\nMario Harik: That\u2019s correct, Chris.\nChris Wetherbee: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. \nAllison Poliniak: Hi, good morning. Just wanted to Chris\u2019 question a little further. The pricing dynamic and the algorithms that you guys and the analytics that you\u2019re pushing forward, I know you mentioned low single digit, but do you think that\u2019s pricing above sort of the market at this point? Is that giving you the capability or it\u2019s better cost management? Just any thoughts there. And then, Drew, any color on how we should think about the contract versus spot/mix as you exit 2022 at this point? Thanks.\nMario Harik: Allis, I\u2019ll start first with the yield question. So again, for the fourth quarter, we expect yield to be up low to mid-single digits, which is in line with difficult seasonality when you play out Q3 going into Q4. Now keep in mind that in the fourth quarter of last year, we had a tough comp with yields having been up 11% on a year-on-year basis. We also, last year, if you recall in the month of November, we took an early GRI, which we typically take early in the year as opposed to in the month of November. So we\u2019re going to be lapping the GRI. And in terms of new customers versus existing customers, there is a bit of a mix impact, specifically on length of haul that also would be a bit of a drag on yield. But generally, we continue to see a very rational pricing environment. Our contracts in yields, for example, in the first quarter were still up high single digits. So we \u2013 again, we see a rational environment, but this is what the trend looks like as we head into Q4.\nDrew Wilkerson: And Allison, the contract for spot for brokerage was at 73%, again, contract and 27% on the spot. That\u2019s exactly where we wanted to be during this market. It allowed us to operate at strong margins, continuing to take market share and do it profitably. And as we head into next year, we\u2019re in a strong bid cycle right now. Bids are up significantly on a year-over-year basis right now.\nAllison Poliniak: Perfect. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nTom Wadewitz: Yes. Good morning. Drew, had a couple for you. I wanted to see if you could just offer some thoughts on how we ought to think about revenue per load when we look at like fourth quarter and gross margin percent. Are you thinking that it will be kind of stable sequentially? Or do you expect further pressure in the market and some pressure on those metrics? And then, I guess, if I look beyond fourth quarter, as the truckload market\u2019s weaker, as contract rates come down, does that drive pressure on your gross margin eventually? I know there is the transition where it\u2019s favorable, but maybe just how you think about gross margin in brokerage out a couple of quarters as well. Thank you.\nDrew Wilkerson: Yes. Thanks, Tom. So I\u2019d start with we expect to grow volume on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter, and we expect it to operate at strong margins. We were at 19% this quarter. It could be a hair behind that as we\u2019re into Q4. We\u2019ve got volume tailwinds. To your point on gross margin per load, you could see that come down. But right now, we\u2019re operating in line with our 3-year average and ahead of our 5-year average. So it doesn\u2019t matter what happens in the market. There is a lot of unknowns in 2023. We\u2019re confident that we will outperform the market as a whole next year.\nTom Wadewitz: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJordan Alliger: Yes. Hi, good morning. I\u2019m sort of curious, I know it may be early for 2023 guidance per se, but maybe sort of big picture. Can you talk to a little bit \u2013 two things. One, your thoughts on RXO EBITDA, will it be growth next year? And then secondarily, on LTL operating ratio, know the long-term targets, but do you expect improvement in 2023? Thanks.\nDrew Wilkerson: Yes. Jordan, as I just said to Tom, there is a lot of unknowns as we head into 2023. We\u2019re in a very strong bid cycle right now. Bids are up significantly for us year-over-year. Customers are coming back to us. We\u2019re growing with our existing customer base, and we\u2019re also growing with new customers coming in. So I\u2019m confident that we will go out and take market share for 2023, but don\u2019t want to go much beyond that.\nMario Harik: Yes. For the XPO side on the LTL side, I mean, obviously, we will talk more about 2023 as we get closer to the beginning of the year. But generally, we are modeling for different scenarios. In one scenario, if the macro does get softer and that impacts the volumes, obviously, we\u2019re not immune to the macro, although we\u2019re planning on outperforming in terms of gaining market share. But that said, obviously, we would flex our variable costs where, today, 75% of our cost is variable in price to volume. And we also have a few potential tailwinds from a P&L perspective, which includes in-sourcing our third-party line-haul miles after. And the fact that we have higher exposure to purchase transportation, that would be a good guy in a softer environment with truckload rates coming down. That\u2019s kind of how we look at the year overall. But obviously, our intent is to continue to gain market share, but we\u2019re modeling for different scenarios.\nJordan Alliger: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Hoexter: Hey, great. Good morning, and good luck with the spin process. Maybe, Mario, if we could just kind of follow-up on that last kind of debate and Scott\u2019s earlier questions about the OR. You\u2019re talking about inflationary costs rising. You\u2019re pushing out your GRI, which you had last year in November to the beginning of the year. You\u2019re talking about the worst OR improvement in the fourth quarter, I guess, on a sequential basis, you mentioned. Is there anything you can do given the environment to move some of those costs quicker? Is there potential that you benefit, as you mentioned, on purchased transportation maybe faster given those rates are coming down? I\u2019m just trying to wonder what you can do, self-help maybe even faster given the environment and the exposure you just talked about on those few items.\nMario Harik: The purchase transportation is definitely one of those areas, Ken. Because when you look at purchase transportation, today, contractual rates are still up on a year-on-year basis, although they obviously moderated significantly from where they were earlier in the year. In a continued soft market, we would see the contractual rates continue to come down, which obviously would be a tailwind for us from a PT perspective. Similarly, for in-sourcing third-party line-haul miles or cutting schedules. So if the volume is more challenged going to 2023, then obviously, that\u2019s an area we can move on faster with cutting schedules as well. And we are also accelerating some of our rollouts on the technology side in terms of how we run our docks, our pickup and delivery operation and our line-haul operation to improve operational efficiencies in those areas as well that will help becoming tailwinds in 2023, if there is a softer environment from a ton standpoint.\nKen Hoexter: And I guess just my follow-up would then be on the \u2013 will you adjust the timing of the rollout in CapEx on the doors? And maybe you could talk a bit about \u2013 each of you, the corporate costs. What scale should we target for each of the groups going forward into the fourth quarter and next year?\nMario Harik: Yes. I\u2019ll start with the capital deployments. So we are not planning on slowing down our capital deployment. We think about the capital we invest in the business as being a long-term investment that goes through the cycle. So it doesn\u2019t matter what the markets are doing on the short-term, these will give us capacity whenever the markets go back up again, being able to handle that capacity. This includes, on the door side, a lot of the projects we\u2019ve done so far, we\u2019ve opened up six terminals that we\u2019re predominantly opening up a new terminal versus a lot of the projects that we\u2019re going through now are expansion projects for existing terminals. So we have a half a dozen or so projects that are already underway in the Dallas market, Houston, Salt Lake, Atlanta and a few other markets as well where we are expanding the terminal base. In terms of fleet, we do need, obviously, the fleet for two reasons. One, as we in-source third-party line-haul, we\u2019re going to deploy some of that CapEx for both trucks and trailers to be able to move some of these miles onto our own assets as well as position the fleet where we can bring the fleet age down, which would help with maintenance expenses as well. So we continue to expect to deploy that CapEx through the cycle here as we head into 2023.\nDrew Wilkerson: And then, Ken, you asked about the incremental cost that will come over to RXO. It\u2019s around $45 million on an annual basis that will be incremental to us of corporate costs.\nMario Harik: And for the XPO, it would be roughly the unallocated corporate cost for LTL or roughly around $80 million.\nKen Hoexter: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of John Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Chappell: Thank you. Good morning. Mario, simple one for me. You\u2019re talking about the positive trends in tonnage. I was hoping you could break that down for us. Where were you in July on a year-over-year basis? Where were you in September, if that was the inflection point in term positive. It is October 31. So I understand you have a day left, but maybe give us a sense to where October is as well. Just as you talk about doing better than the peers in the positive direction, help us put a magnitude on that.\nMario Harik: You got it. When you look at the third quarter, so we\u2019ve improved every month in the quarter and then flipping positive in the month of September. And the quarter as a whole and the monthly trend was better than typical seasonality in terms of sequential volume improvements. And that continued in the month of October, where we\u2019re seeing strong volume trends as well, that both outpaced typical seasonality and with positive tonnage for the full month as well.\nJohn Chappell: I understand that. Is there any way you can give a number? Was July down 4? August was down 1 and September was up 2 and October is up 3? I mean if there is any quantitative way to kind of manage that positive direction.\nMatt Fassler: John, it\u2019s Matt. July was the softest month in the quarter. August, obviously better than that, closer to the quarterly average. September, obviously much, much better and October, to your point, 1 day left, is a good month for us and again, outpaced typical seasonality for the quarter, for the month of September and for the month of October as well.\nJohn Chappell: Okay, thanks, Matt.\nMatt Fassler: You bet.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good morning, everyone and thanks for taking my question. So, Drew, just a couple of points for you, I think you mentioned that you\u2019re going through a bid cycle right now. Pricing is actually coming in positive. Was that a comment on contract rates? And should we be thinking that double-digit volume is attainable here in the near-term, like 4Q and looking into next year?\nDrew Wilkerson: Yes, Brandon, I don\u2019t think that I said that pricing on contract was positive in the bid cycle. Pricing is slightly down of what we\u2019re seeing on contract. Spot is down more than that and on double-digit volume growth going forward, we expect that we can do that over the long run, but don\u2019t look for it on a quarter-by-quarter basis for where we\u2019re at. We\u2019re confident that there is a \u2013 we will outperform the market in 2023 and beyond. And we\u2019re confident in the 5-year guide that we\u2019ve put out there that has a midpoint of $500 million of EBITDA, roughly 70% growth from where we are today.\nBrandon Oglenski: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks. Good morning. And Mario, could you touch upon, I think you mentioned three new, and clarify if that\u2019s accurate or not, new customers in the third quarter that could become top 10 customers. Could you just touch upon how that may be impacting metrics for the next few quarters? And any additional commentary on developments in the sales force and strategy there with regard to our customers? Thanks.\nMario Harik: Yes. On the \u2013 on large customers we onboarded. So we onboarded several large customers in the third quarter that has the potential to become top 10 customers. And it\u2019s a combination of both industrial \u2013 large industrials as well as the large retail as well that we onboarded through there. Now what we\u2019re doing differently from a sales perspective, one is that we expanded our sales force since the beginning of the year. We have roughly around 7% more salespeople in our sales force. We also established a new strategic account selling team, which is focused on the largest 200 to 250 strategic accounts across North America, where we split that team between RXO and XPO at the beginning of the year, where these strategic centers are now \u2013 a portion of the strategic centers are focused on our LTL business. And that\u2019s paying dividends. In the second quarter, we had record business wins. In the third quarter, we had another quarter of record business wins. Our pipeline is the highest it\u2019s been, and we\u2019re trending in the right direction. We\u2019ve also incentivized our salespeople to get new logos and expand business with existing logos, and that\u2019s also paying dividends as well. And when we pass forward to the years to come with our investments in capacity where we are getting capacity ahead of demand, as well as the focus on keep on improving service significantly over time as well, all of these would lead to more wins as we head over the years to come in our 5-year plan.\nScott Schneeberger: Great, thanks. And for a follow-up, just Brad or someone, if you can provide an update on how the European business is performing trend you\u2019re seeing in the macro and how that\u2019s holding up. Thanks.\nRavi Tulsyan: This is Ravi here. So our European business, it continues to perform very well. Last quarter, we had a very strong organic revenue growth of 6.8%, which was driven by both volume and price. For the full year, our business is performing exactly in line with our expectation. And the macros are definitely getting tough, but we continue to outperform the macro and are able to price in the inflation.\nScott Schneeberger: Great. Thanks, Ravi. Thanks, everyone.\nRavi Tulsyan: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. \nBrian Ossenbeck: Hey, good morning. I want to come back to Drew first. You can maybe clarify the comment about the strongest \u2013 strong bid cycle. Was that more on a volume perspective? Because it does sound like it\u2026\nDrew Wilkerson: That\u2019s the volume number of bids that we\u2019re seeing, Brian. So the number of bids that we are participating is up significantly. That\u2019s existing customers, but it\u2019s also new customers who are coming to us for the first time as well.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Okay. Got it. And I\u2019d love to get your thoughts on just where you think the floor isn\u2019t coming for spot rates as well. But a second one for Mario. There is some concern about the market share wins, the divergence in trends from a tonnage perspective and just the level of competition in LTL. So maybe you can put some context around that, how much of a different service has mattered. What are the clean trends trending towards for the quarter? Where the year-over-year? And perhaps where do you want them to be? Is that a significant driver of some of these wins you\u2019re getting? Because I think what you\u2019re hearing is there is more concern about this competition and how that would affect yields in the industry that\u2019s typically been known for having good pricing power discipline.\nDrew Wilkerson: Brian, I\u2019ll kick it off with your question on the spot and then turn it over to Mario. As far as calling the floor on spots, we\u2019re not going to call the floor on spot rates, just like we didn\u2019t call the peak on spot rates over the last couple of years. I will tell you that our data is showing us, over the last few weeks, that rates have leveled off.\nMario Harik: Yes. And Brian, on your question on the service. So definitely service has been a great trend for us with dramatic improvement over the course of the last year. I mean, I mentioned in my opening remarks our damage frequency, which is a measure of when we deliver skids to our customer, what\u2019s the \u2013 how many of them are effectively damaged. And it\u2019s the best it\u2019s been since 2016 where, for the full quarter, it improved by 58%. For the month of October, it improved by 76% \u2013 September 76%, and October by 86% on a year-on-year basis. And we\u2019ve implemented many programs to delight our customers and how we service them. And we\u2019re hearing that feedback from the customers, which helps with obviously onboarding more business. Our customer satisfaction, we do weekly surveys with our customers. It\u2019s at record highs in the third quarter. And that\u2019s going to allow us to onboard more and more customers over time. In terms of gaining market share, a lot of that goes back to, obviously, the improvement in service but, at the same time, the investments in capacity, where we\u2019re being able to say yes more often to customers in markets where we are adding that additional capacity as well. On the yield side, yield continues to be rational when I look at our contracts renewals even through what is a softer macro, we\u2019re continuing to see strong contract renewals associated with that. And again, in the software macro, you would see yield come down a bit, but you would still see it in positive territory. And then obviously, in a strong macro, you would see yield be in that high single-digit territory. So we continue to expect rational pricing in our industry over the years to come.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Alright. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Seidl: Thanks, operator. Thank you, gentlemen for taking my question. Mario, I wanted to stick on yields a bit. Would you say that the yields for the recent contract wins in 3Q were above your cost inflation? And then what\u2019s the level of confidence getting yield above cost inflation in this bigger-than-average bid season that you\u2019ve been talking about?\nMario Harik: Yes. We are seeing \u2013 going into the fourth quarter, when we think about cost inflation, remains persistent higher than what we expected it to be, which is putting pressure on the overall margins, which is what we discussed earlier. However, for the new wins, Obviously, yield is also a factor of mix as well. So some of the new wins, and it\u2019s a combination, all of them are obviously profitable above cost and all of them operate really well. But at the same time, they could have some mix change associated with them, depending on the customers. But generally, it\u2019s in the ballpark of where our overall mix is. We\u2019re seeing some pressure on length of haul, where some of these shipments are shorter in nature with some of these wins, but that\u2019s about the only dynamic that we\u2019re seeing is different than our existing mix. But yields are up sequentially going from Q3 to Q4, and they are in line with typical seasonality as well.\nJason Seidl: Okay. That\u2019s great color. A follow-up here for Doug. Doug, there are some questions about the overall market and spot. I know you answered some of that, but can you talk a little bit about your carrier base and what you\u2019re seeing in terms of attrition? Has it been higher than normal over the last quarter?\nDrew Wilkerson: Yes. Thanks. This is Drew. When you look at what we\u2019re seeing on the overall from our carriers, we grew our carrier count at RXO Connect by 10,000 carriers for the quarter. So we\u2019re continuing to see carriers who want to come back and do business with us. It\u2019s easy to hop on to our platform and book a load, negotiate, do that with no human interaction. There is a great rewards program that they have got access to. And you can see that our registered carriers in RXO Connect year-over-year are up 48%. Our weekly carrier usage is up 60% and our RXO has been downloaded 850,000x. So there is a lot of momentum for carriers to continue to come over and do business with RXO. We have got the volume they need and an operating system that they love to use.\nJason Seidl: [indiscernible] gentlemen.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research. Please proceed with your question.\nJeff Kauffman: Thank you very much. Question for Mario. Mario, the fleet age on the LTL side is kind of bumped up from about 5.1 years to 5.9. So almost a full year higher than it was 2 years ago. With this CapEx spend that you\u2019re going to have, when do you expect that fleet age to get back down towards 5? Where do you want that fleet age to be in? Can you quantify some of the savings, whether it\u2019s maintenance costs, whether it\u2019s fuel efficiency that you might generate from some of this CapEx spend over the next couple of years?\nMario Harik: Yes, you got it. So first, on the fleet age side, typically, in LTL, we want to be between 4 to 6 years of age on our fleet. Obviously, usually, the younger the truck, we put them on our line-haul network to gain the benefit of fuel efficiency associated with that. And the older it gets, we put it in the city. Now the fleet age, with COVID, due to the constraints that we have seen with the OEMs have caused the fleet age to go up with less \u2013 with getting less trucks effectively. Now going \u2013 this year, we\u2019re going to get slightly less trucks than where we expected to be. But generally, it\u2019s trending in the right direction. Now for 2023, we do want to add a significantly higher number of trucks, and we\u2019re working with the OEMs to get our allocations locked in for 2023 and see where we get there. Now there is \u2013 that is a OEM or still capacity constraints, but obviously, the softness in the truckload market could be a potential tailwind as we head into 2023. Now for us, remember, CapEx for this year is going to be nearly double what it has been historically. And for next year, we expect that to even go slightly higher than where we are this year. And in terms of the benefits we get from a younger fleet age, as you said, maintenance is a component of that. I mean you can estimate anywhere between low double digit up to 20%, 25% reduction in maintenance costs as we pull back the fleet age where we want it to be. And similarly, on the fuel MPG, that is the benefit you get from the younger trucks as well. So we\u2019re \u2013 again, we\u2019re working every lever for 2023 to get more trucks and pull that aged fleet back for the full year.\nJeff Kauffman: So just to follow-up on the answer. Is the goal to get the fleet age back toward 5? And how long do you think that would take?\nMario Harik: It will \u2013 and so that\u2019s the goal, to even potentially get it sub-5 as well. But it will depend on what the OEMs do for next year in 2023. Now we see, again, the availability of truck easing as we head into 2024. I personally meet with all the heads of the OEMs, including with my team as well. And what we\u2019re hearing from them is that they are seeing signs that 2023 could improve. But at the same time, we won\u2019t know until we get closer to the beginning of the year. And then we will go from there to assess how many trucks we can get in 2023. But that would be the case, but we see it easing up further in 2024 to be able to get more of these trucks and then pull the fleet age back.\nJeff Kauffman: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Todd Fowler with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.\nTodd Fowler: Hey, great. Thanks and good morning. So Mario, I\u2019m not sure if you have any information that shows with the improvement in the service metrics, is your sense that your pricing \u2013 your core pricing is maybe below that of peers? And so do you have an opportunity to move yields up maybe stronger than where the industry is going forward? Or do you think you\u2019re relatively kind of in line with where the industry is? And then secondly, I think you addressed this a little bit, but weight per shipment came down in the quarter. That probably had some positive impact on yields. It sounds like that, that\u2019s something maybe with some of the mix changes that we should expect going forward?\nMario Harik: Yes. So first, I\u2019ll address the second half of the question, then come back to the first one. So when we look at the third quarter, there were two dynamics. So weight per shipment helps a bit in terms of the weight per shipment coming down, impacting yield positively. However, length of haul also went down. It\u2019s predominantly a mix change where last year, we saw more shipments outbound California, for example. And these are typically longer length-of-haul type shipments that impacted our length of haul coming down, which has a direct correlation to yield as well. So on a net-net basis, that was a slight drag on yield as opposed to a benefit for yield. Going back to your question on our price versus peers, our price is competitive versus some peers, and it\u2019s behind other peers. And we do believe that with the continuous improvements are in service and getting \u2013 our goal is to be best-in-class when it comes to our service metrics, and that would help with us accelerating our yield improvement as well.\nTodd Fowler: Okay, thanks for the time. Congratulations Drew. Congratulations, Mario.\nDrew Wilkerson: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I\u2019ll hand the floor back to management for closing remarks.\nEnd of Q&A:\nBrad Jacobs: Thank you, operator. So it\u2019s been an amazing journey. It\u2019s been an amazing decade. I feel lucky. I feel privileged and very gratified. I want to thank the shareholders, particularly those who have bought the shares when it was a fraction of where it is now and stuck with it and held onto it and made a lot of money. And thank you very much for your support. And I also want to thank the hundreds of thousands of team members who created \u2013 well, now as of tomorrow, will be three great companies. And I want to especially thank Mario and Drew for your commitment to bring the companies to a new level and achieve even greater heights than we\u2019ve accomplished over the last decade and to prove our supporters right and our detractors wrong. Thanks, everyone. Have a great day.\nOperator: This will conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.",

            "name": "Drew Wilkerson",
            "content": "Thanks, Mario. I'd like to thank Brad and the entire XPO team. It's been an absolute privilege to work with this top-tier group over the past decade. North American transportation, soon to be RXO, had another strong quarter. We continue to harness our massive capacity and cutting-edge technology to grow volume, expand gross profit margin and drive adoption of our proprietary brokerage platform. I will start by discussing some key metrics from the quarter and then talk about our strong position heading into tomorrow's launch of RXO. In the third quarter, we delivered more loads than in any other quarter in our history. Our volume was up year-over-year by 9%. Our September average loads per day, was also an all-time record and this was not an anomaly. Over the last 3 years, we grew volume at a 15% CAGR and we grew gross profit dollars at a 35% CAGR. Our consistent outperformance proves that we can take share in any market. And importantly, our growth is profitable. Our gross profit margin was a strong 19%, up year-over-year by nearly 500 basis points and our year-over-year gross profit dollars were up 31%. In the third quarter, we generated operating income of $52 million and adjusted EBITDA of $78 million. Our technology is the engine behind our financial outperformance. Over the last decade, we built this platform from scratch. And now, our strategic investments are continuing to drive adoption among customers and carriers. Another 10,000 carriers have registered on RXO Connect. And our mobile app has been downloaded 850,000 times, that's up 53% year-over-year and 75% of carriers returned to the platform within 1 week. Carriers love how easy it is to use our technology, which gives them access to an enormous amount of volume from the largest shippers in the world. They also love our strong carrier rewards program. In the third quarter, we created or covered 81% of truck brokerage loads digitally. While we anticipate a muted peak season, we are still seeing very strong contractual bid activity and we expect year-over-year load growth in the quarter. In the fourth quarter, we expect to generate adjusted EBITDA as similar to the third quarter, excluding incremental corporate cost as a standalone company. With robust data powering our business and a team with deep understanding of the transportation sector, we are poised to outperform regardless of the fluctuating market conditions. The spin-off of RXO marks a new chapter, but some things will remain the same, for example, our commitment to rapid growth and strong profitability. We operate in a $750 billion industry, led by a $400 billion for-hire truckload market, with $88 billion in brokerage alone. We are an industry leader, yet we only have about 4% share of this growing and underpenetrated market, which gives us an enormous opportunity for growth. Brokers are taking share from asset-based carriers and we are leading the charge. Our customers and carriers are excited about the added value we can provide as a standalone company focused solely on our asset-light services. The RXO brand stands for massive capacity and cutting-edge technology and we have the right people to leverage both advantages. We expect to continue to take share and outperform for our employees, customers, carriers and our shareholders. That concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn it over to the operator for Q&A. Scott, this is Drew. You will get historicals through June next week. And I believe December 1 is the day for Q3. Understood. Thanks, Scott. And Allison, the contract for spot for brokerage was at 73%, again, contract and 27% on the spot. That's exactly where we wanted to be during this market. It allowed us to operate at strong margins, continuing to take market share and do it profitably. And as we head into next year, we're in a strong bid cycle right now. Bids are up significantly on a year-over-year basis right now. Yes. Thanks, Tom. So I'd start with we expect to grow volume on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter, and we expect it to operate at strong margins. We were at 19% this quarter. It could be a hair behind that as we're into Q4. We've got volume tailwinds. To your point on gross margin per load, you could see that come down. But right now, we're operating in line with our 3-year average and ahead of our 5-year average. So it doesn't matter what happens in the market. There is a lot of unknowns in 2023. We're confident that we will outperform the market as a whole next year. Yes. Jordan, as I just said to Tom, there is a lot of unknowns as we head into 2023. We're in a very strong bid cycle right now. Bids are up significantly for us year-over-year. Customers are coming back to us. We're growing with our existing customer base, and we're also growing with new customers coming in. So I'm confident that we will go out and take market share for 2023, but don't want to go much beyond that. And then, Ken, you asked about the incremental cost that will come over to RXO. It's around $45 million on an annual basis that will be incremental to us of corporate costs. Yes, Brandon, I don't think that I said that pricing on contract was positive in the bid cycle. Pricing is slightly down of what we're seeing on contract. Spot is down more than that and on double-digit volume growth going forward, we expect that we can do that over the long run, but don't look for it on a quarter-by-quarter basis for where we're at. We're confident that there is a \u2013 we will outperform the market in 2023 and beyond. And we're confident in the 5-year guide that we've put out there that has a midpoint of $500 million of EBITDA, roughly 70% growth from where we are today. That's the volume number of bids that we're seeing, Brian. So the number of bids that we are participating is up significantly. That's existing customers, but it's also new customers who are coming to us for the first time as well. Brian, I'll kick it off with your question on the spot and then turn it over to Mario. As far as calling the floor on spots, we're not going to call the floor on spot rates, just like we didn't call the peak on spot rates over the last couple of years. I will tell you that our data is showing us, over the last few weeks, that rates have leveled off. Yes. Thanks. This is Drew. When you look at what we're seeing on the overall from our carriers, we grew our carrier count at RXO Connect by 10,000 carriers for the quarter. So we're continuing to see carriers who want to come back and do business with us. It's easy to hop on to our platform and book a load, negotiate, do that with no human interaction. There is a great rewards program that they have got access to. And you can see that our registered carriers in RXO Connect year-over-year are up 48%. Our weekly carrier usage is up 60% and our RXO has been downloaded 850,000x. So there is a lot of momentum for carriers to continue to come over and do business with RXO. We have got the volume they need and an operating system that they love to use. Thank you."

            "name": "Ravi Tulsyan",
            "content": "Thank you, Brad and good morning everyone. Today, I will discuss our third quarter results and our balance sheet and liquidity. In the third quarter, we generated revenue of just over $3 billion. Excluding the impact of the intermodal business, which was sold in March, revenue increased 3% year-over-year. Currency had a negative impact on our reported revenue of $86 million or 3%. We grew adjusted EBITDA to $352 million, reflecting strong earnings growth across the businesses. The year-over-year increase in adjusted EBITDA was 15% or an increase of 25% excluding intermodal and gains from real estate sales. FX negatively impacted EBITDA by $8 million in the quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was a third quarter record of 11.6%, representing a year-over-year improvement of 220 basis points. The firm pricing environment continued this quarter and helped offset inflationary pressures. Our European business also continued its strong performance with organic revenue growth of 6.8%, which was driven by both volume growth and price. Our corporate costs for the third quarter, excluding one-time expenses was down year-over-year by 37%. This reflects continued rationalization of our corporate cost structure in preparation for the upcoming spin-off of RXO. Our interest expense for the quarter was $35 million compared to $53 million in the year ago period. The effective tax rate for the adjusted EPS for the quarter was 23%. Our adjusted earnings per diluted share, was $1.45, which was up from $0.94 a year ago or an increase of 54%. This increase was primarily driven by higher adjusted EBITDA and lower interest expense. We generated $265 million of cash flow from continuing operations, spent $127 million on growth CapEx and received $4 million of proceeds from asset sales. Gross CapEx was up $50 million year-over-year, primarily allocated to investments in our LTL network capacity. Our free cash flow was $142 million. This includes $53 million of cash outflows related to transaction costs that were not included in our free cash flow guidance. Excluding these transaction costs, our free cash flow was $195 million for the quarter. Moving on to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $544 million of cash. This cash combined with available borrowing capacity under committed borrowing facilities gave us over $1.5 billion of liquidity at quarter end. We had no borrowings outstanding under our ABL facility and our net leverage at quarter end was 1.7x adjusted EBITDA. RXO will dividend the net proceeds to XPO, which XPO will then use to pay down debt. Lastly, on a personal note, I am very thankful to XPO and Brad for the opportunity to be part of this leadership team and the incredible transformation we have achieved over the last few years. Both companies are well positioned to continue on the growth path. And I wish both Jamie Harris and Carl Anderson success in the new roles. I will now turn things over to Mario. This is Ravi here. So our European business, it continues to perform very well. Last quarter, we had a very strong organic revenue growth of 6.8%, which was driven by both volume and price. For the full year, our business is performing exactly in line with our expectation. And the macros are definitely getting tough, but we continue to outperform the macro and are able to price in the inflation. Thank you."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Mario Harik",
            "content": "Thanks, Ravi and good morning, everyone. As you saw from our earnings report, we achieved the second straight quarter of tangible results from our growth strategy, which we call LTL 2.0. Our investments and capacity and the momentum we have with service quality are accelerating our top and bottom lines. We reported revenue of $1.2 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $258 million, which exceedingly real estate gains, was 19% higher than a year ago. Both our revenue and adjusted EBITDA are third quarter records and we continue to expect to deliver at least $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA this year based on no more than $50 million of real estate gains in the fourth quarter. As Brad mentioned, we steadily improved our tonnage through the quarter, outpacing typical seasonality. A key inflection point came in September when we flipped tonnage positive year-over-year. Our tonnage trends continue to surpass typical seasonality in October. I am pleased that our results are strengthening relative to our peers. Our operating ratio in the quarter was 85% and our adjusted operating ratio was 82.8%, that's a year-over-year improvement of 160 basis points. The full year target we put out with our preliminary third quarter results is for 50 to 100 basis points of adjusted operating ratio improvement year-over-year. We expect at least 120 basis points of year-over-year improvement in Q4. In the third quarter, we improved yield by 7%. And we continue to see rational industry pricing. Now, I want to double click on LTL 2.0 and talk about what's driving our results. We focus on two critical areas to drive long-term performance. The first is providing world class service to our customers and the second is investing in capacity ahead of demand. Our objectives are to gain market share, optimize pricing, and improve operational efficiency. It starts with our investment in capacity. Our LTL CapEx spend this year will end up at 9% to 10% of revenue, which is about double our historical CapEx budget. In August, we opened a new terminal in New Jersey to manage volume flowing through the Northeast Corridor. This replaced a smaller terminal and added 24 new doors to our network. This expansion, in addition to the other five terminals we have opened over the last year, puts us at 369 doors against our target of 900 net new doors open by year end 2023. On the trailer side, our ability to manufacture our all trailers at scale is unique in the industry. Our trailer production rate is the highest that's ever been. We added a second production line in the first quarter. And we will be adding a third line in the fourth quarter. We are tracking to expand our line-haul trailer fleet by more than 10% by year end 2022. Our goal is to increase trailer production by another 50% next year, which would allow us to further expand with our line-haul and our pickup and delivery fleet. On the tractor side, we are working with the OEMs to bring on more trucks in 2023. And for our drivers, we have expanded our training footprint to what we believe is the largest in the industry, with 130 driver school locations. This is another company-specific advantage and we expect to train 1,700 drivers this year. In 2023 and for at least the next several years, our plan calls for CapEx at 8% to 12% of revenue to expand our capacity, so we can say yes to customers more often. The other two goals of the plan, optimizing pricing and improving operational efficiency are a function of our people and our technology delivering great service. Damage frequency is one of the metrics customers care most about. In September, we delivered our best damage frequency since 2016 and improved again in October. We improved damage frequency year-over-year in the third quarter by 58%, and the numbers are up and to the right, with 76% improvement in September and 86% in October. That didn't happen in a vacuum. We changed our incentive comp to focus on reducing damages and improving shipping quality, all the way down to the supervisor level. We also launched a program at our terminal called Gladiator to recognize quality loading. If the quality target is exceeded, the entire team at that terminal is rewarded. And we launched new technology in the field that allows us to raise the 30,000 trailers we load each day. We can now pinpoint trailers that fall short of our quality loading standards and identify which supervisors and dockworkers need more coaching. These are just some of the internal initiatives that are energizing the team to elevate our customer service metrics and the impact has been dramatic. Another important investment we are making is in our sales force. We are taking a layered approach to sales with teams dedicated to strategic accounts, national accounts and also the base of 24,000 smaller accounts that are our bread and butter. All three customer segments have a role in growing the business. In the third quarter we onboarded some major accounts with the potential to become top 10 customers for us. The feedback we hear from these customers is that they are pleased with their onboarding experience and with the service we provide them. There is direct correlation between our success in winning this business and the fact that we are willing to invest in capacity and service to back up our promises. This is where our technology comes in as well. I spent a lot of time in the field talking to our managers and also our team members on the frontline. We have equipped them with new tools to make them more successful and we put in strong feedback loops to capture their inputs. The result has been really exciting. And the most recent employee survey we conducted last month, which includes our dockworkers and drivers, we saw the highest engagement and highest job satisfaction since we acquired Con-way in 2015. What we are doing now is building off that culture so that our entire team has the voice and how we get the world class. So in summary, we are investing in every lever of growth, including network capacity, quality of service and the satisfaction of our team to deliver that service. This is LTL 2.0 and we believe that this plan focused solely on North American LTL can move us to the top of the industry at a pace that outperforms our peers over time. Now, I hand it over to Drew to cover truck brokerage on RXO. Drew? See, we are driving taking market share overall. So Ravi, when you look at the investments we have made in capacity first. So by adding terminals in markets where we were short on capacity, we were able to gain more business from customers in those markets. As an example, we opened up a terminal in Atlanta 6 months ago. And in the month of September, we have seen tonnage in the Atlanta market go up 38% on a year-on-year basis. We are also investing in more fleet and more drivers as well and the sales force is very energized with the improvement in both the service product as well as the investments we are making in our sales force. So we had record business wins in the second quarter and the third quarter record pipeline and we are on a very, very strong trend of winning business and winning market share. Now sequentially, when we are \u2013 Q3 was better than typical seasonality when compared to Q2 and we flipped to positive tonnage in the month of September and we also continue to see that in the month of October, where we came in better than typical seasonality and we expect tonnage to be up on a year-on-year basis for the fourth quarter as well. Yes, sure. Thanks. So I mentioned tonnage obviously going up, going \u2013 in the fourth quarter. On the yield side, we \u2013 the pricing backdrop remains good, but we expect our yield to be up low to mid single-digits in the fourth quarter, which is driven in partly by tough comp and lapping the GRI that we won't take till early next year this year. But generally, the momentum is strong on both tonnage and yield from that perspective. On the OR side, it's at least 120 basis points of OR improvement in the fourth quarter. And obviously, as we execute through the rest of the quarter here, our goal is to succeed that as well. Thanks, Ravi. Scott, I will start first on the LTL side. So as we said at least 120 basis points for the fourth quarter. Now that OR degradation is slightly higher than typical seasonality from the third to the fourth quarter and that's driven predominantly by cost pressure associated with persistent inflation that we expected that to abate more in the back half of the year. That's specifically coming from wages is the first category. Generally, our labor is up mid single-digits in part to be able to accommodate the additional demand and tonnage we are getting. And also we are seeing higher inflation in some other cost categories, including maintenance and parts to keep our fleet up-to-date and also some of our facilities expenses are higher due to inflation as well. Sure thing, Chris. So first, starting with the overall strategy, so our strategy is focused on keeping to improve our service product to our customers and delivering best-in-class service as well as investing in capacity in areas and markets where we have a need for that capacity based on what we are hearing from our customers and the demand that we are seeing from our customers and that in turn is leading to us gaining market share through investments in the sales force that we are doing and going and gaining new business. This includes, for example, incentivizing our salespeople to onboard new business, including new logos, as we grow the business moving forward. In terms of yield dynamic, I mean, obviously, yield has always been a very strong in our industry. This is mainly driven by the fact that if you look over the long time period, there is less capacity in the LTL than there was 10 years ago. And we continue to see that play out. So in a softer market, if the market gets softer, we would see yield be in the low single-digit territory. And in a strong market, we'd see that be in the high single-digit, low double-digit territory, and we expect that to play out next year depending on what happens with the macroeconomic conditions. And then finally, for us, for the set of company-specific initiatives, is around operational cost reduction or overall operational excellence. And that's a combination of using our technology to keep on refining our line-haul pickup and delivery and dock costs as well as in-sourcing third-party line haul to our own assets. Today, third-party line haul is roughly 10% to 11% of our revenue. And when you think about in-sourcing, we save 30% to 40% per mile. So we can see that also obviously being a tailwind for us from a cost perspective, not only next year, but over the years to come. For 2023, obviously, we will talk more about 2023 as we report next quarter, depending on what we're seeing in the market, but we're modeling for different scenarios depending on what the macro is doing. That's correct, Chris. Allis, I'll start first with the yield question. So again, for the fourth quarter, we expect yield to be up low to mid-single digits, which is in line with difficult seasonality when you play out Q3 going into Q4. Now keep in mind that in the fourth quarter of last year, we had a tough comp with yields having been up 11% on a year-on-year basis. We also, last year, if you recall in the month of November, we took an early GRI, which we typically take early in the year as opposed to in the month of November. So we're going to be lapping the GRI. And in terms of new customers versus existing customers, there is a bit of a mix impact, specifically on length of haul that also would be a bit of a drag on yield. But generally, we continue to see a very rational pricing environment. Our contracts in yields, for example, in the first quarter were still up high single digits. So we \u2013 again, we see a rational environment, but this is what the trend looks like as we head into Q4. Yes. For the XPO side on the LTL side, I mean, obviously, we will talk more about 2023 as we get closer to the beginning of the year. But generally, we are modeling for different scenarios. In one scenario, if the macro does get softer and that impacts the volumes, obviously, we're not immune to the macro, although we're planning on outperforming in terms of gaining market share. But that said, obviously, we would flex our variable costs where, today, 75% of our cost is variable in price to volume. And we also have a few potential tailwinds from a P&L perspective, which includes in-sourcing our third-party line-haul miles after. And the fact that we have higher exposure to purchase transportation, that would be a good guy in a softer environment with truckload rates coming down. That's kind of how we look at the year overall. But obviously, our intent is to continue to gain market share, but we're modeling for different scenarios. The purchase transportation is definitely one of those areas, Ken. Because when you look at purchase transportation, today, contractual rates are still up on a year-on-year basis, although they obviously moderated significantly from where they were earlier in the year. In a continued soft market, we would see the contractual rates continue to come down, which obviously would be a tailwind for us from a PT perspective. Similarly, for in-sourcing third-party line-haul miles or cutting schedules. So if the volume is more challenged going to 2023, then obviously, that's an area we can move on faster with cutting schedules as well. And we are also accelerating some of our rollouts on the technology side in terms of how we run our docks, our pickup and delivery operation and our line-haul operation to improve operational efficiencies in those areas as well that will help becoming tailwinds in 2023, if there is a softer environment from a ton standpoint. Yes. I'll start with the capital deployments. So we are not planning on slowing down our capital deployment. We think about the capital we invest in the business as being a long-term investment that goes through the cycle. So it doesn't matter what the markets are doing on the short-term, these will give us capacity whenever the markets go back up again, being able to handle that capacity. This includes, on the door side, a lot of the projects we've done so far, we've opened up six terminals that we're predominantly opening up a new terminal versus a lot of the projects that we're going through now are expansion projects for existing terminals. So we have a half a dozen or so projects that are already underway in the Dallas market, Houston, Salt Lake, Atlanta and a few other markets as well where we are expanding the terminal base. In terms of fleet, we do need, obviously, the fleet for two reasons. One, as we in-source third-party line-haul, we're going to deploy some of that CapEx for both trucks and trailers to be able to move some of these miles onto our own assets as well as position the fleet where we can bring the fleet age down, which would help with maintenance expenses as well. So we continue to expect to deploy that CapEx through the cycle here as we head into 2023. And for the XPO, it would be roughly the unallocated corporate cost for LTL or roughly around $80 million. You got it. When you look at the third quarter, so we've improved every month in the quarter and then flipping positive in the month of September. And the quarter as a whole and the monthly trend was better than typical seasonality in terms of sequential volume improvements. And that continued in the month of October, where we're seeing strong volume trends as well, that both outpaced typical seasonality and with positive tonnage for the full month as well. Yes. On the \u2013 on large customers we onboarded. So we onboarded several large customers in the third quarter that has the potential to become top 10 customers. And it's a combination of both industrial \u2013 large industrials as well as the large retail as well that we onboarded through there. Now what we're doing differently from a sales perspective, one is that we expanded our sales force since the beginning of the year. We have roughly around 7% more salespeople in our sales force. We also established a new strategic account selling team, which is focused on the largest 200 to 250 strategic accounts across North America, where we split that team between RXO and XPO at the beginning of the year, where these strategic centers are now \u2013 a portion of the strategic centers are focused on our LTL business. And that's paying dividends. In the second quarter, we had record business wins. In the third quarter, we had another quarter of record business wins. Our pipeline is the highest it's been, and we're trending in the right direction. We've also incentivized our salespeople to get new logos and expand business with existing logos, and that's also paying dividends as well. And when we pass forward to the years to come with our investments in capacity where we are getting capacity ahead of demand, as well as the focus on keep on improving service significantly over time as well, all of these would lead to more wins as we head over the years to come in our 5-year plan. Yes. And Brian, on your question on the service. So definitely service has been a great trend for us with dramatic improvement over the course of the last year. I mean, I mentioned in my opening remarks our damage frequency, which is a measure of when we deliver skids to our customer, what's the \u2013 how many of them are effectively damaged. And it's the best it's been since 2016 where, for the full quarter, it improved by 58%. For the month of October, it improved by 76% \u2013 September 76%, and October by 86% on a year-on-year basis. And we've implemented many programs to delight our customers and how we service them. And we're hearing that feedback from the customers, which helps with obviously onboarding more business. Our customer satisfaction, we do weekly surveys with our customers. It's at record highs in the third quarter. And that's going to allow us to onboard more and more customers over time. In terms of gaining market share, a lot of that goes back to, obviously, the improvement in service but, at the same time, the investments in capacity, where we're being able to say yes more often to customers in markets where we are adding that additional capacity as well. On the yield side, yield continues to be rational when I look at our contracts renewals even through what is a softer macro, we're continuing to see strong contract renewals associated with that. And again, in the software macro, you would see yield come down a bit, but you would still see it in positive territory. And then obviously, in a strong macro, you would see yield be in that high single-digit territory. So we continue to expect rational pricing in our industry over the years to come. Yes. We are seeing \u2013 going into the fourth quarter, when we think about cost inflation, remains persistent higher than what we expected it to be, which is putting pressure on the overall margins, which is what we discussed earlier. However, for the new wins, Obviously, yield is also a factor of mix as well. So some of the new wins, and it's a combination, all of them are obviously profitable above cost and all of them operate really well. But at the same time, they could have some mix change associated with them, depending on the customers. But generally, it's in the ballpark of where our overall mix is. We're seeing some pressure on length of haul, where some of these shipments are shorter in nature with some of these wins, but that's about the only dynamic that we're seeing is different than our existing mix. But yields are up sequentially going from Q3 to Q4, and they are in line with typical seasonality as well. Yes, you got it. So first, on the fleet age side, typically, in LTL, we want to be between 4 to 6 years of age on our fleet. Obviously, usually, the younger the truck, we put them on our line-haul network to gain the benefit of fuel efficiency associated with that. And the older it gets, we put it in the city. Now the fleet age, with COVID, due to the constraints that we have seen with the OEMs have caused the fleet age to go up with less \u2013 with getting less trucks effectively. Now going \u2013 this year, we're going to get slightly less trucks than where we expected to be. But generally, it's trending in the right direction. Now for 2023, we do want to add a significantly higher number of trucks, and we're working with the OEMs to get our allocations locked in for 2023 and see where we get there. Now there is \u2013 that is a OEM or still capacity constraints, but obviously, the softness in the truckload market could be a potential tailwind as we head into 2023. Now for us, remember, CapEx for this year is going to be nearly double what it has been historically. And for next year, we expect that to even go slightly higher than where we are this year. And in terms of the benefits we get from a younger fleet age, as you said, maintenance is a component of that. I mean you can estimate anywhere between low double digit up to 20%, 25% reduction in maintenance costs as we pull back the fleet age where we want it to be. And similarly, on the fuel MPG, that is the benefit you get from the younger trucks as well. So we're \u2013 again, we're working every lever for 2023 to get more trucks and pull that aged fleet back for the full year. It will \u2013 and so that's the goal, to even potentially get it sub-5 as well. But it will depend on what the OEMs do for next year in 2023. Now we see, again, the availability of truck easing as we head into 2024. I personally meet with all the heads of the OEMs, including with my team as well. And what we're hearing from them is that they are seeing signs that 2023 could improve. But at the same time, we won't know until we get closer to the beginning of the year. And then we will go from there to assess how many trucks we can get in 2023. But that would be the case, but we see it easing up further in 2024 to be able to get more of these trucks and then pull the fleet age back. Yes. So first, I'll address the second half of the question, then come back to the first one. So when we look at the third quarter, there were two dynamics. So weight per shipment helps a bit in terms of the weight per shipment coming down, impacting yield positively. However, length of haul also went down. It's predominantly a mix change where last year, we saw more shipments outbound California, for example. And these are typically longer length-of-haul type shipments that impacted our length of haul coming down, which has a direct correlation to yield as well. So on a net-net basis, that was a slight drag on yield as opposed to a benefit for yield. Going back to your question on our price versus peers, our price is competitive versus some peers, and it's behind other peers. And we do believe that with the continuous improvements are in service and getting \u2013 our goal is to be best-in-class when it comes to our service metrics, and that would help with us accelerating our yield improvement as well."

            "content": "Good morning, everybody and Happy Halloween. Thanks for joining our earnings call. With me today in Greenwich are Mario Harik and Drew Wilkerson, our two incoming CEOs of XPO and RXO and Ravi Tulsyan, our CFO of XPO. We will be joined during Q&A by XPO's Chief Strategy Officer, Matt Basler and from RXO we have Jared Weisfeld, Chief Strategy Officer and Jamie Harris, Chief Financial Officer. This morning, we reported another strong quarter with over $3 billion of revenue and record third quarter operating income, up year-over-year by 65%. Notably, we generated $142 million of free cash flow, while more than doubling the historical gross CapEx we invested in our North American LTL network. Under Mario's leadership, our plan for LTL 2.0 is gaining momentum. This morning, we reported third quarter records for LTL revenue and adjusted EBITDA. And one of the most telling LTL metrics is our accelerating year-over-year tonnage trend, which improved every month through the quarter and inflected positive in September. Our third quarter tonnage outperformed typical seasonality, which is the opposite of what we are hearing in the industry. Importantly, our tonnage remains strong in October and we expect positive year-over-year tonnage for the fourth quarter. We are getting more freight from customers for two good reasons. One is the investments we have been making in capacity and the other is our improved quality of service. Our truck brokerage business under Drew's leadership continued to outperform in the third quarter. The team grew volume year-over-year by an impressive 9%. They also delivered a very strong gross profit margin of 19%. I am pleased that both companies will be strongly positioned for growth when RXO spins off tomorrow. We have been working towards separating our asset-based and asset-light businesses, since we announced our strategic plan in March and this is a watershed moment for XPO's shareholders. The final piece of the plan is the divestiture of our European business. We will not be providing any updates on that sales process today. Before I close, I want to thank Ravi for his many contributions to XPO's success over the last 6 years. Ravi was instrumental to our GXO spin last year. And he has led our finance organization through the current spin process and the sale of intermodal. We wish Ravi the very best. And we are pleased that he will assist in the transition to Carl Anderson, our incoming CFO, who joins us next week. I look forward to working with Mario and Drew in my roles as Executive Chairman of XPO and Non-Executive Chairman of RXO. And now, Ravi will cover the quarter. Ravi?"

I will now turn the call over to Brad Jacobs. Mr. Jacobs, you may begin.  \nBrad Jacobs:   Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining our call. With me today in Greenwich are Ravi Tulsyan, our CFO; Matt Fassler, our Chief Strategy Officer; Mario Harik, President of LTL; and Drew Wilkerson, President of North American Transportation.   Before we get into earnings, I want to comment on the succession plan we announced yesterday. Once we complete the spinoff, Mario will succeed me as CEO of XPO, and I\u2019ll remain with the company as Executive Chairman. I\u2019ll be the Non-Executive Chairman of the spin-off, RXO.   Appointing Mario as my successor was an easy decision for the Board and me. Mario has a deep understanding of the nuts and bolts of our LTL operations. He\u2019s been hands on with LTL as CIO for 7 years, because as soon as we acquired the network, we started developing technology for it.   He also worked closely with the LTL sales team in his role as Chief Customer Officer, and he\u2019s been running the entire LTL business since last year.   Mario is mission-critical to XPO. He was the third person I hired back in 2011 and we\u2019ve worked side-by-side on every major initiative since then. He\u2019s been instrumental in the successful integration of 18 acquisitions and he spearheaded countless innovations that have given us a tremendous commercial advantage.   Now Mario and his management team will take the reins of our growth strategy for LTL and lead XPO into its next chapter as a pure-play LTL carrier.   I\u2019m proud to report a very strong second quarter. All of our reported metrics were ahead of guidance and consensus. We had our ninth straight beat on adjusted EBITDA and in fact, we generated more adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter than in any quarter in our history.   Like adjusted EBITDA, our adjusted diluted EPS was a new record for any quarter. In our North American LTL business, we\u2019re continuing to build tremendous momentum. What a difference 9 months make. Kudos to Mario and the team for delivering LTL revenue and adjusted EBITDA that were records for any quarter.   Our adjusted operating ratio ex-real estate inflected positive in the quarter by 70 basis points to 80.4%. That\u2019s another company record for any quarter, and it puts us right on track for an improvement of more than 100 basis points this year compared with 2021.   Also in the second quarter, we maintained our highest level of LTL network fluidity since 2020. So it\u2019s not surprising that we\u2019ve seen a significant increase in our customer satisfaction scores as measured both internally and by third parties. The LTL team has increased its focus on customer service over the last 9 months now, and it\u2019s gratifying to see us continue to build high satisfaction levels after a V-shaped recovery in our service metrics.   In North American truck brokerage, we continue to sharply outperform the industry. Our gross profit was a record for any quarter at 20.8%, up year-over-year by 610 basis points.   And it\u2019s not just a price play. We grew volume year-over-year in the quarter by 16% in truck brokerage. This is a best-in-class business that\u2019s both highly profitable and taking share quarter after quarter.   In Europe, our operations continue to perform well despite the war in Ukraine. Our organic revenue growth in Europe was 7% year-over-year, which was a sequential improvement from the 5% we reported in the first quarter. And in constant currency, we grew adjusted EBITDA year-over-year by a robust 14%.   Company-wide, a key part of our success has been to pay rigorous attention to return on invested capital and free cash flow. And I\u2019m pleased to report that as of the end of the second quarter, our trailing 12-month company-wide ROIC was 38% and significantly higher in our North American LTL and truck brokerage businesses.   It\u2019s worth noting that since we bought the LTL business in October 2015, the business has generated net cash of over $3.8 billion.   And lastly, over the first 6 months of the year, we brought our net leverage ratio down from 2.7x to 1.8x. It\u2019s gratifying to see XPO perform so well across the board and our strategic actions on track. This includes the planned spin-off of our tech-enabled brokered transportation platform, RXO, in the fourth quarter.   Finally, I\u2019d like to profoundly thank all of our 43,000 XPO employees for delivering a phenomenal quarter en route to a record year.   Now I\u2019ll pass the call over to Ravi to go through the financials.  \nRavi Tulsyan:   Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our second quarter results, our balance sheet and liquidity and our outlook for the balance of 2022.   I\u2019ll start with our results. We delivered strong year-over-year growth with record second quarter revenue and the highest adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS of any quarter in our history. Revenue in the quarter was $3.2 billion.   Adjusting for the sale of our intermodal business, our year-over-year revenue increased 11%. We grew adjusted EBITDA year-over-year by 23% to $405 million or 29%, excluding intermodal and gains from real estate sales. This reflects the strong earnings growth across all our businesses. FX negatively impacted EBITDA by $6 million in the quarter.   Our adjusted EBITDA margin was a record 12.5%, and this was a year-over-year improvement of 210 basis points. Operating conditions in the quarter were favorable, and the firm pricing environment more than offset inflationary pressures for labor and purchased transportation.   Our corporate costs in the quarter, excluding one-time expenses related to strategic initiatives was down year-over-year by 29%. This reflects continued rationalization of our corporate cost structure. Our interest expense for the second quarter was $31 million compared to $58 million in the year ago period. This reflects the paydown of approximately $3 billion of debt last year and over $600 million of debt during the second quarter.   The effective tax rate for adjusted EPS for the quarter was 24%. Our adjusted earnings per diluted share was $1.81, which was up from $1.22 a year ago, an increase of 48%. The increase was primarily driven by higher adjusted EBITDA and lower interest expense. We generated $199 million of cash flow from continuing operations; spent $130 million on gross CapEx; and received $4 million of proceeds from asset sales. Gross CapEx was up $69 million year-over-year primarily allocated to growing our LTL network.   Our free cash flow was $73 million. This includes $28 million of cash outflows related to transaction costs that were not contemplated in our free cash flow guidance.   Excluding these transaction costs, our free cash flow was $101 million for the quarter.   Looking at the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $436 million of cash. This cash, combined with available debt capacity under committed borrowing facilities gave us $1.4 billion of liquidity at quarter end.   We had no borrowings outstanding under our ABL facility. Our net leverage at quarter end was 1.8x adjusted EBITDA. We are ahead of schedule on our deleveraging plan and are well within our target leverage range of 1 to 2x adjusted EBITDA.   In light of our strong results in the first half and our expectations for the second half, we updated our guidance after market close yesterday. Our new full year guidance for adjusted EBITDA is $1.4 billion to $1.43 billion. This increase primarily reflects our second quarter outperformance and does not include the impacts of our planned spin-off or the divestment of our European operations. We still expect to have up to $50 million of gains from real estate sales and we currently expect all of these gains to be realized in the fourth quarter.   We also issued guidance for the third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $330 million to $345 million. Pro forma for the Intermodal sales, the midpoint of this range implies the third quarter adjusted EBITDA growth rate of 18% over the prior year. Our outlook for full year 2022 adjusted EPS anticipates a range of $5.55 to $5.90. This reflects our higher EBITDA outlook and slightly lower interest expense.   The midpoint of our new full year guidance for adjusted EPS implies year-over-year growth of 33%.   On the cash flow front, our outlook for full year cash flow is now $425 million to $475 million, up $25 million versus our previous outlook.   As a reminder, this excludes all transaction-related cash outflows. We expect interest expense of $145 million to $150 million, which is down from our prior target of $150 million to $160 million. There is no change to our previous guidance for depreciation and amortization expense, CapEx and the tax rate.   In conclusion, we had a very strong first half of 2022 and we are entering the second half with good momentum. The execution of our strategic plan remains on track, and we are excited about creating 2 pure-play transportation powerhouses.   I will now turn things over to Matt.  \nMatthew Fassler:   Thanks, Ravi. I\u2019ll review our second quarter operating results by segment, starting with North American LTL. We grew LTL revenue 15% year-over-year to $1.2 billion, the highest revenue of any quarter in our history. LTL adjusted EBITDA grew by 14% year-over-year, or 16% ex real estate.   We had a 5.5% decline in tonnage per day from the second quarter of 2021. Demand from our major verticals was mixed. The year-over-year trend in agricultural verticals, which are seasonally significant in Q2, decelerated while automotive accelerated.   Industrial, by far, our largest vertical, tracked the overall trend as in our second largest vertical, retail and e-commerce.   Year-over-year growth in tonnage per day improved through the quarter. Yield, excluding fuel accelerated to an 11% improvement year-over-year from 9% in Q1, reflecting a solid pricing backdrop to the industry and the benefit of our proprietary pricing tools. Pricing is a major focus of our technology development in LTL, and we\u2019ve added top talent to our pricing team. We increased pricing on contract renewals year-over-year by 12%.   Our LTL adjusted operating ratio of 80.4% was 70 basis points better than the second quarter a year ago. It\u2019s also a 530 basis point improvement sequentially from Q1.   On our last earnings call, we said we expected to achieve at least 400 basis points of sequential improvement, so we outperformed that expectation. I\u2019ll note that these adjusted operating ratios exclude gains from real estate sales.   Our success in improving network fluidity is driving improvement in our cost trends. As we procured third-party line haul capacity more effectively, the year-over-year headwind from purchase transportation, measured as a percent of revenue, moderated from 250 basis points in Q1 to just 10 basis points in Q2. Those are the financial highlights of a solid second quarter performance in North American LTL.   Our other segment is brokerage and other services, and I\u2019ll remind you that intermodal was reported in this segment until we sold the business late in Q1 of this year.   Segment revenue, as reported, declined in Q2 by 4% year-over-year, but excluding intermodal, revenue increased by 9% to $2.1 billion.   In addition, FX weighed on revenue growth by 3 percentage points. Adjusted EBITDA increased 17% or 29% ex intermodal to $152 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin for this segment expanded by 140 basis points to 7.4% from 6% a year ago.   The largest revenue and profit driver in the segment is our North American truck brokerage business, which had another outstanding quarter. This will be the core business of our planned spin-off of RXO in the fourth quarter of this year. We increased our brokerage loads per day by 16% versus a year ago and by 61% from 2 years ago.   Second quarter truck brokerage revenue rose 24% year-over-year. Our truck brokerage growth reflects our strong execution in a dynamic market. Drew will speak more about the specific drivers in a minute.   As Brad mentioned, organic revenue in Europe grew 7%, accelerating by 2 percentage points from the first quarter. We saw acceleration in organic revenue growth in all 3 of our major regions. France, U.K. and Iberia and the platform continues to deliver results, both top line and profits despite the geopolitical backdrop.   And lastly, we\u2019re grateful for some external recognition we received during the quarter. XPO was named a top 100 3PL by Inbound Logistics magazine for the ninth year. Forbes named XPO a best place to work in Spain for the fourth consecutive year.   We were named a Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion on the Disability Equality Index for the second consecutive year. And we served as the official transport partner for the Tour de France for the 42nd year and expanded our partnership as the official transport partner for the women\u2019s edition of the tour.   Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Mario for his comments on North American LTL.  \nMario Harik:   Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I want to thank Brad and the Board for placing their trust in me. XPO has an enormous opportunity ahead and it will be a privilege to lead the company and continue working with Brad as Executive Chairman.   It\u2019s also humbling to be entrusted with continuing the transformation we\u2019re executing in LTL. I\u2019ve run the business for almost a year now, and I\u2019m constantly inspired by our best-in-class team, and we\u2019re going to accomplish a lot more together.   As Brad said, we continue to see tremendous momentum in our LTL business. This has accelerated over the last quarter with the actions we\u2019re taking to drive improvements in network fluidity and service and grow our network capacity.   In the second quarter, we gained significant traction in all these areas with measurable results. We achieved the highest level of network fluidity since before the pandemic. We also reached a new high for customer satisfaction, according to Mastio, a third-party industry consultant that tracks our Net Promoter Score on a quarterly basis.   In addition, our investments in capacity are on track. The 5 terminals we added since October are fully operational. Now we\u2019re evaluating sites in Salt Lake City, Houston, Atlanta, Kansas City, Dallas and Philadelphia.   We\u2019re being very disciplined about the network expansion. We\u2019ve done the analysis, and we\u2019re adding new terminals or new doors to existing terminals in markets with growing demand for LTL service. We expect these markets to continue to grow over the long term. The 345 net new doors we\u2019ve added to date bring us over 1/3 of the way to our goal of adding 900 net new doors by the end of next year.   Looking beyond our footprint, we\u2019re investing in capacity where we have a competitive advantage. For example, last quarter, we announced that we added a second production line at our trailer manufacturing facility in Arkansas. That investment had an immediate impact. And in the second quarter, we produced a record number of trailers for our fleet. Our target is to manufacture more than 4,700 trailers this year. This will expand our in-house linehaul trailer capacity by over 10% to an all-time high.   We\u2019ve reaffirmed our plan for LTL CapEx at 8% to 9% of revenue this year. On the driver side, we\u2019ve been ramping up our hiring with targeted recruitment efforts and training more drivers in-house at our 130 training locations. These 2 channels are working well as solutions to the ongoing driver shortage. June was a particularly strong month for recruitment. The hiring environment overall is still tight, but it loosened significantly in the second quarter. We had a 44% average increase in the number of applications for each job we posted in the quarter.   Now I want to switch gears for a minute and talk about our record Q2 adjusted operating ratio of 80.4%. That\u2019s a year-over-year improvement of 70 basis points ex real estate. We had promised a second quarter inflection to year-over-year improvement, and we delivered that. I\u2019m also pleased that we overachieved on sequential improvement which, as Matt noted, was 530 basis points from Q1 to Q2.   We\u2019re on track for our target of more than 100 basis points of year-over-year improvement this year. Looking at the underlying drivers. We expect yield to remain strong throughout the balance of the year. Our pricing technology is mission-critical in getting us fair value for our services.   In the second quarter, we saw the early impact of our pricing tools with strong yield on contract renewals. From a sales standpoint, we won a record amount of new business in Q2. And our sales sustained a positive trajectory each month in the quarter.   Last week, I met with a large shipper at our new Atlanta terminal. They just signed on with XPO and they\u2019re our newest top 10 customer. They\u2019re very happy with their onboarding experience and they\u2019ve already committed to incremental volume with us.   In addition, we\u2019re in discussions with 2 more brands this quarter, both of these would be top 10 LTL customers for XPO. This would set us up well for 2023.   As we onboard more revenue, we\u2019ll also focus on cost management. This is another area where our technology excels. In the second quarter, we introduced proprietary cost models to enhance the team\u2019s visibility into cost management levers. We also have a new piece-level tracking capability that has the potential to significantly improve customer service and visibility.   One of our largest costs and a large opportunity is purchased transportation. We\u2019ll continue to moderate purchased transportation costs as we move through the back half of the year driven by more efficient network operations and newly negotiated carrier rates.   There are times when third-party line haul is the optimal solution. But as we continue to add drivers and equipment, we expect to, over time, insource more third-party line haul-miles. This should drive material cost savings.   We have a lot of initiatives underway. And to sum it up, our goal is pretty simple. We want to be the best. We\u2019re creating a world-class LTL carrier by maintaining an intense focus on every part of the business. We have a highly engaged team that\u2019s determined to delight our customers.   This year, we expect to generate at least $1 billion of LTL adjusted EBITDA and more than 100 basis points of year-over-year improvement in adjusted operating ratio ex real estate.   Going forward, we have company-specific levers that can expand our margin and improve our operating ratio well into the 70s. We\u2019ll take more volume share for our investments in fleet, doors and people and capture a high return on those investments over time.   Over the last 9 months, we\u2019ve made major advances in positioning XPO to become a world-class LTL carrier from every perspective. And we know exactly where we\u2019re going from here. We\u2019ll provide more details on our growth plan at our LTL Investor Day as we get closer to the spinoff. We\u2019ll also announce our long-term outlook for XPO as a stand-alone company.   Now I\u2019ll hand it over to Drew to cover Truck brokerage. Drew?  \nDrew Wilkerson:   Thanks, Mario. North American truck brokerage had another strong quarter as we continued to sharply outpace the industry. I\u2019ll start by giving you 4 metrics from the quarter that highlight the stellar performance the team delivered. Then I\u2019ll talk about what\u2019s driving these results.   First is volume. We grew loads by 16% in the quarter, and it was the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit load growth for our business.   Second, we delivered a gross profit margin of 20.8%, up year-over-year by 610 basis points. This is a record performance for us in any quarter. Third is gross profit dollars, which we grew year-over-year by 76%. We have a long track record of growing gross profit through economic cycles, and we\u2019re confident we\u2019ll continue to do that.   And the fourth metric is an adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.6%, that\u2019s 420 basis points higher than Q2 last year and it\u2019s our first double-digit adjusted EBITDA margin. We achieved these 4 metrics through a powerful combination we\u2019ve built over many years: scale, cutting-edge technology and deep customer relationships.   Scale refers to our access to massive capacity of 98,000 independent carriers in North America that allow us to serve more than 5,500 customers including nearly half of the Fortune 100 companies. These are carriers who have registered to do business with us on our XPO Connect digital platform and come back week after week because of the immense volume that flows through our network.   To a carrier, these are income opportunities. Truck brokerage is a highly fragmented industry, and there\u2019s a lot of competition for carriers, especially with the driver shortage. We make it more efficient for carriers to do business with us. Our digital platform is easy to use and we have a national carrier rewards program that saves them money on things like fuel, tires and roadside assistance.   And to shippers, our scale means reliable capacity on demand. The automation and machine learning we\u2019ve built into the platform allow our people to focus on being more productive for our customers. We\u2019re known as dependable problem solvers who have a strong understanding of market dynamics.   We work with our customers to make sure we have the appropriate amount of spot versus contract business based on the current market conditions.   For instance, we made a deliberate shift in the second quarter to operate at a favorable revenue mix of 73% contract and 27% spot. A year earlier, that mix was 66% contract and 34% spot. Our technology gives us the agility to manage that change.   In the early days of XPO in 2011, we had the vision to develop a fully automated brokerage system, and we\u2019ve been building on our first-mover advantage ever since. I\u2019m privileged to lead the team that made this vision a reality over the last 11 years, and I\u2019m even more excited about the next decade because of the opportunity to leverage our platform to continue to serve more customers and outpace the market.   Every dollar we put in our digital platform continues to pay off. Even now years after we introduced XPO Connect, it\u2019s still growing at a rapid clip.   Our mobile app has been downloaded more than 800,000 times. The number of weekly average carrier users on the platform increased year-over-year by 74%. And 80% of our truck brokerage loads were created or covered digitally up from 74% in the first quarter.   It\u2019s exciting to see the tremendous demand for our platform drive additional share gains for us. Soon, we expect to spin off as RXO. And once that happens, I\u2019ll continue to work closely with Yoav Amiel, who will be our Chief Information Officer. Yoav currently leads the ongoing development of XPO\u2019s digital brokerage platform, which will be called RXO Connect and will be the technology backbone of the new company.   For us, the strategy of becoming a brokerage pure play makes sense on every level, We\u2019re a high-growth platform with a long runway for value creation.   As a new public company with a sole focus on asset-light transportation, we\u2019ll continue to deliver best-in-class results for our employees, customers, carriers and investors. I look forward to meeting many of you at our Investor Day this fall, where we\u2019ll be sharing our long-term outlook.   That concludes our prepared remarks. I\u2019ll turn it over to the operator, and we\u2019ll go to Q&A.  \nOperator:   Thank you. We will now be conducting our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.  \nScott Group:   Brad, first, can you give an update on the process with Europe? And then Mario, I wanted to ask you about some of the LTL items. So nice sequential margin improvement. But if I look at the implied guidance for third quarter, implies a bigger sort of step back in margin than some of the other LTLs. So any thoughts on the sequential margin into third quarter? And any way to quantify the savings you think you\u2019ll get from more insourcing?  \nBrad Jacobs:   Scott. The sales process in Europe remains very lively, very buoyant. It\u2019s a great opportunity for a buyer to buy an asset that\u2019s got scale and has pan-European strategic value. It\u2019s a very attractive platform. The base case scenario is we\u2019d be signing a deal to sell it in the fourth quarter and probably wouldn\u2019t close by the time of the spin. It could, but probably not. In that case, we\u2019ll just have it as discontinued operations, and we\u2019ll show the numbers with and without it. Mario?  \nMario Harik:   Scott, on the sequential margins and overall LTLs you said, the second quarter, we delivered a great sequential improvement of 530 basis points, an 80.4% adjusted OR.   When we look at the third quarter, we expect an improvement of at least 150 basis points on a year-on-year basis, which is the typical -- in the neighborhood of our typical seasonality going from the second to the third quarter.  \nScott Group:   Is there something you think you could do to sort of lessen that seasonality going forward to be more consistent with some of the other LTLs. And then I also just asked about the in-sourcing in any way to quantify.  \nMario Harik:   Yes. So let\u2019s start with insourcing. So we do expect purchased transportation costs to continue to moderate through the course of the year. When you look at the second quarter, our linehaul miles that were outsourced were roughly 24.7%, which was up 80 basis points from last year, which is what we said we would do, where we\u2019re going to lean a bit more on purchased transportation this year.   Now we don\u2019t expect to insource purchased transportation as much in 2022. That\u2019s more of a longer-term strategic initiative for us and how we expect to drive that. However, we do expect the rates on a per mile basis to continue to moderate through the course of the year. As we improve network fluidity, we can be much more predictive in how we purchase transportation. And just to give you a few stats, the cost per mile for us in linehaul was up on a year-on-year basis by 33% in the first quarter and it was up 14% in the second quarter with newly negotiated rates with carriers that went into effect in the month of May. So as we head into the back half of the year, we would expect that to continue to moderate and give us a portion of the cost tailwinds we expect in the back half.   Now going back to your question on if we can accelerate further the OR improvement. Obviously, OR goes back to volume, to price and all the cost improvements that we are doing. And there are multiple paths for us to get to our guidance of at least $1 billion of EBITDA and at least 100 basis points of OR improvement.  \nOperator:   Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question.  \nChristian Wetherbee:   So Mario, maybe I could stick with you on the operating ratio sort of implied for particularly the third quarter. I get last year, you had a step up, I think, in the neighborhood of 300 basis points from 2Q to 3Q, and that was when we had some challenges in the network. I think the implied guide is maybe in the 200-ish type of range in terms of increase in the OR sequentially.   So I still want to make sure I understand sort of the moving parts around cost and some of the progress you\u2019ve made in terms of efficiency in the business. Because it seems like the second quarter was a big step forward. I\u2019m just wondering if there are some dynamics that maybe changed from 2Q to 3Q and maybe there\u2019s some tonnage discussion that needs to be had within that comment. But I just want to maybe get a little bit more color on what\u2019s happening from 2Q to 3Q from a cost perspective.  \nMario Harik:   Yes. Sure thing, Chris. So when we look at the -- if we follow sequentially, so from an OR perspective, obviously, we flipped favorable in the second quarter, 70 basis points on a year-on-year basis. And now when we go to the third quarter, starting first with pricing. We expect the pricing environment to remain very robust. Our yield in the second quarter was up 11% versus 8.7% in the first quarter and we expect yield to continue to remain strong for the course of the year, although we\u2019ll have tougher comps as we head into the back half.   But our contract renewals were up 12% in the second quarter, and it continues to be up double digits in the month of July.   From a volume perspective, we were down 5.5% in the second quarter, and we expect the third quarter to be down in the low to mid-single digits on the tonnage front, but we\u2019re excited about the momentum we have in sales, as I said in my prepared remarks, we saw record new business wins in the second quarter, and that trend improved through the quarter. We landed a new top 10 customer in the second quarter. Just recently here, I met with them and they\u2019re sending more business our way. They were very happy with their onboarding experience. We\u2019re in top quartile in terms of quality that we offer them, and they\u2019re going to send more business our way.   And we\u2019re in -- we\u2019re having great momentum here early in the third quarter with 2 potential top 10 customers as well. So that would lead to obviously volumes improving through the course of the year.   Then finally, on the cost side, I mentioned third-party linehaul cost, and overall linehaul cost, that will moderate through the course of the year. And we also have a number of efficiency actions. We\u2019ve had the best network fluidity since pre-pandemic, and that\u2019s going to lead to better results as well.  \nChristian Wetherbee:   Okay. And just to clarify, is around 200 basis points you think the right sort of seasonal transition from 2Q to 3Q in the business, there\u2019s been a lot of volatility. So kind of just curious about what the right number is as we think about that going forward.  \nMario Harik:   Yes. The typical seasonality is in the, call it, 200 to 250 range in terms of OR change from the second quarter to the third quarter.  \nOperator:   Thank you. Our next question is from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.  \nKenneth Scott Hoexter:   Great. Just to round that out, Mario, you mentioned 3 new top 10 customers potentially coming online. That\u2019s a lot of new business, coming or leaving. Can you maybe talk about the process, the risk to your routing structure or service levels or how you prepare for that?   And then just to clarify that your EBITDA is up. I think you raised your target about $50 million with the $40 million, $41 million beat this quarter. or about $45 million overall. So are you just saying the back half is kind of no change to that despite the large beat in the second quarter. I just want to understand your vision on that guidance raising outlook.  \nMario Harik:   Yes. First, I\u2019ll take the customer question and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Matt for the guidance piece. I mentioned also earlier that we launched new costing technology in the second quarter. It\u2019s a proprietary costing model. So we have a very deep understanding about how a customer, as we onboard them, how they would impact the network as a whole and we price according to where we have excess capacity or imbalanced lanes, where we need to get more volume and lanes that we want to be able to fill the backhaul for and better balance our network.   So this is how we look at these large relationships in terms of, one, how we price them but, two, how we analyze that data for fit with the network. And we have a new technology that helps us make these determinations easier and better. And these will be accretive both in terms of volume and profits as well.  \nA - Matthew Fassler:   And then as it relates to the guidance, Ken, you\u2019re right. We beat the midpoint of our guidance by $40 million. We raised the midpoint of our new guidance for 2022 by an additional $5 million beyond that. You can think about that as relating to strong visibility in both LTL and in brokerage services. And you asked about LTL in particular, in the first half of the year, in LTL, ex real estate, we had an adjusted EBITDA increase of about 11%, and we\u2019re more like mid- to high teens in the second half of the year. So we have very good visibility on first half to second half acceleration for LTL.  \nKenneth Scott Hoexter:   And then I think you mentioned earlier, 70% OR moving forward. Is that your near-term target? Was that just a throw out number? And what levers do you need to get there?  \nMario Harik:   When we think overall about getting to the 70s from an OR perspective, that\u2019s our goal. So if we think about our strategy that we started in Q4 of last year, we expect to improve our OR by hundreds of basis points to get well into the 70s over the years to come, and the strategy is focused on the customer where we want to delight our customers by providing outstanding service in on-time, damage performance and all the aspects of service. We want to continue to grow volume by adding capacity.   Historically, we\u2019ve spent maintenance CapEx to expand margins. Now we\u2019re pivoting to a strategy where we\u2019re investing in more doors, more people and more equipment, leveraging our trailer manufacturing facility there. Obviously, pricing will continue to be firm in our industry moving forward. And then finally, we want to leverage our proprietary technology to keep on optimizing our cost structure.   And in-sourcing linehaul miles where it makes sense. Over the years to come, we expect to improve our OR hundreds of basis points to get well into the 70s. And we\u2019ll give more color on that in our Investor Day later, early fall and how the model looks like over the years to come.  \nOperator:   Thank you. Our next question is from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.  \nAllison Ann Marie Poliniak-Cusic:   Mario, in line with that, should we see this accelerated industrial softening into next year, a lot of investment into that proprietary technology. Can you maybe walk through how we should think of the competitive advantage that proprietary technology would bring you to better manage the down this cycle, whether through market share gains or even the agility on the cost side?   And then secondly, just I guess this is more on the brokerage side, expansion of loads covered digitally, was that expansion weighted more towards new customers attracted to XPO Connect or existing customers moving more into digital capabilities? Just any thoughts there.  \nMario Harik:   You got it, Allison. I\u2019ll take the first one, then I\u2019ll turn it over to Drew.   But first, starting with the macro and the industrial. So today, 2/3 of our customers are industrial companies. And we hear mixed feedback from these customers. When we look at many of these companies have had pent-up demand from their customers where they couldn\u2019t produce enough parts to fulfill open POs that they have from their customers. And as things are easing up in their supply chain they\u2019re actually being able to move product faster, which is leading to stronger demand. Others aren\u2019t seeing that, others are actually seeing softness in demand that is impacting overall how much they\u2019re shipping.   But generally, we see the industrial economy very much in recovery, and that\u2019s going to become a tailwind as we get through where things are today.   Now in terms of technology and how we use technology. For us, technology has a number of components. Number one is the focus on pricing where we launch proprietary pricing technology. And as I mentioned earlier, we just launched a new proprietary costing model that allows us to better understand the cost structure of a given shipment and how we can price the freight for the customer so we can get the highest yield possible.   And also bridging the yield gap we have with some of our competition as well. It also helps with automation technology like dynamic pricing and reducing manual processing as well. And then we have a slew of technologies around cost efficiency and overall operational excellence and these start with linehaul, and this is where doing things like better balancing the network and our algorithms that operate linehaul to optimize how much headhauls to be built in the network will improve the more than $1.1 billion of spend we spend on line haul over time. And then similarly with pickup and delivery to increase route density and on the docks to optimize labor efficiency.   And finally, from a customer-facing perspective, we believe in technology to help with our service to the customer. And case in point, we just launched new technology called piece-level tracking, where we can give customers visibility to the pallet level of where every pallet is moving through the network and then giving them better visibility on it in terms of when they\u2019re going to see their shipments.  \nDrew Wilkerson:   Allison, this is Drew. On the second part of your question, it was both new and existing customers, but it was also both new and existing carriers that we\u2019re working with. When you look at the carrier side, last quarter, we talked about having 88,000 carriers in our network. This quarter, we have 98,000 carriers, but all of our stats on both the carrier side and the customer side, are up and to the right. Our year-over-year registered carriers on XPO Connect are up 47%. The registered customers are up 29%, and the carrier usage is up 74%. So when you look at the outperformance that we\u2019ve had for the past several quarters, technology is the main reason that we\u2019ve been able to do that, and that\u2019s because we began investing in it in 2011.  \nOperator:   Thank you. Our next question is from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.  \nThomas Richard Wadewitz:   Mario, congratulations on the future -- I guess, on leading LTL and being a future CEO of XPO, and congratulations on the transition as well, Brad.   I wanted to ask about the volume side on LTL. The 5.5% decline in 2Q is a bit greater than I expected or a bigger decline than I would have expected. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a time lag between an improvement in the network performance and the volumes? Or what\u2019s happening within that. But it just seems like you\u2019ve had a pretty quick bounce back in the network. You\u2019re talking about customer satisfaction scores that are improving. So do you think that the weakness in volume in 2Q is just a time lag or how should we think about that? And then, I guess, how does that affect second half? Like could you get to volume growth in 4Q? Just trying to understand the kind of positive commentary versus the weak volume in 2Q in LTL.  \nMario Harik:   You got it. First, thank you for the well wishes. But as you said, Q2 tonnage was down 5.5%, which was within our guidance. But when you think about the sequential tonnage trends from Q1 to Q2, these were favorable relative to peers.   Now when we think about what drove that, I mean, some of what I mentioned earlier on, the mixed feedback from customers. When you look at the existing customer base, there was slight softness compared to -- if you compare that to last year, as an example, in the environment that was leading to that.   Now what we are excited about, though, is the momentum we have from a sales perspective. With the significant improvement we\u2019ve seen in how we\u2019re performing and the network fluidity that is back to pre-pandemic levels, we have great sales momentum from our sales force, where we\u2019ve had record business wins in the second quarter, and that accelerated through the quarter as well. So when we think about it, that\u2019s going to be new customers and new volumes that get onboarded in the back half as we head into 2023 and add more volume to our network.  \nThomas Richard Wadewitz:   Well, I guess one other element within the discussion. You talked a lot about technology as a way to improve the customer experience. What about culture of the employee base at LTL. I think if you look at like an Old Dominion, they have this remarkable culture on service and focus on -- getting employees focused on service. Is that something that there\u2019s opportunity to improve or need to improve as well as the really having the strong technology?  \nMario Harik:   Yes, you\u2019re spot on, Tom. This is very much ingrained in our culture, where the culture of one continuous improvement but focus on the customer and keep on improving service. And just to give you an example, we have a number of ongoing initiatives that actually help drive that. Starting first, our sales team is working with our customers on freight packaging best practices. And for customers who load their own trailers, we actually have feedback loops where we now give them feedback on how well their dock workers are loading these trailers.   We launched a number of changes in the incentive plan for our people in the field that actually have quality as a whole as part of that incentive plan. And we also have a number of initiatives where -- and these are new technology initiatives that are ingrained now in the culture, where if you\u2019re a dock worker or a driver, whenever you open up a, or a freight operations supervisor, whenever you open up or you close a trailer, you actually take a photo of it and you rate the quality of the loading of that trailer in terms of using our quality methods of loading these loads.   So that\u2019s very much ingrained in what we\u2019re doing. And there is a tremendous amount of momentum in focusing on the customer and the quality we offer our customers.  \nOperator:   Thank you. Our next question is from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.  \nRavi Shanker:   Congrats to you, Mario, very well deserved. Maybe the first question is on brokerage, either for Brad or for Drew. Brad, I think you mentioned in your opening comments that brokerage is taking a lot of share in the marketplace. Can you give us a little more detail on that? Like who is that taking share from? Is that growing the pie? Is it coming from asset-based carriers, it\u2019s coming from other incumbent brokers coming from digital guys? And where is that share coming from?  \nDrew Wilkerson:   Ravi, this is Drew. It\u2019s coming from both. When you look at the trend that\u2019s been going on for years in the brokerage industry, brokerage as a whole is taking share from asset-based carriers. I know I\u2019ve said this before, but whenever I started in the brokerage industry, brokers had about 10% share of the for-hire trucking market. Today it\u2019s 22% and it\u2019s continuing to grow, and I\u2019m confident that it will continue to grow for the next several years going forward.   So, it\u2019s coming from asset-based carriers; it\u2019s coming from other brokers. And it\u2019s because of the service that we provide to customers. The technology that creates solutions for customers and the team that they\u2019ve got strong relationships with. Our top 20 customers have been with us for 13 years on average. We\u2019ve got a long history of service and continuing to create solutions for the customers.  \nRavi Shanker:   Got it. It\u2019s always dangerous to ask an incoming CEO where he thinks his share might max out because I don\u2019t think you think there is a limit, but I\u2019m going to ask it anyway, kind of -- is there a natural kind of share limit when you compare it to some of the larger incumbents that you compete with as well as the long fragmented tail, like what is a kind of steady-state share target, do you think?  \nDrew Wilkerson:   Ravi, I\u2019m going to keep it simple. Right now, we\u2019ve only got 4% share in the brokerage market, and we\u2019ve got a long way to go.  \nRavi Shanker:   Got it. Brad, you are -- I\u2019m sure you\u2019re going to stay extremely busy with XPO, RXO and any other ventures. But if I can ask you kind of what your plans are as Executive Chairman of XPO and non-executive Chairman of RXO. So what are some of the priorities going to be?  \nBrad Jacobs:   I couldn\u2019t hear the very last part of your question, Ravi. Just the very end.  \nRavi Shanker:   What are some of your priorities is going to be as Executive Chairman of XPO and Non-Executive Chairman of RXO.  \nBrad Jacobs:   All parties, yes. So obviously, as the Executive Chair at XPO, I\u2019ll be spending much more time, but I\u2019ll still be involved. I will perform the customary duties that are expected of a Non-Executive Chairman at RXO, and I\u2019ll be spending the normal customary duties to be expected for an Executive Chairman at XPO. So there\u2019ll be more time invested in XPO than RXO. But I\u2019ll also be involved in RXO.  \nOperator:   Thank you. Our next question is from Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.  \nJonathan Chappell:   Drew, as we think about that 16% volume growth in the second quarter, is there any way to give a breakdown on a month-by-month basis of where you ended up in July? Just trying to think about the falloff in the trucking market throughout the second quarter was a benefit to you or a bit of a headwind.   And then also, as we think about that breaking the 20% threshold on the gross profit margin, if volume does become a bit of a headwind, does that enable the margin to kind of improve as you scale more the technology, the network, et cetera? Or does it kind of go hand does the gross profit margin kind of go hand-in-hand with any potential volume headwinds.  \nDrew Wilkerson:   Yes. So when you look at it, the volume growth started off strong in April, came down just a little bit in May and then peaked back up again in June. So it was pretty consistent throughout overall for Q2. When you talk about the potential of volume falling off in the future, yes, there is the opportunity to expand net revenue margins. And you saw us do that by putting up 21% in the second quarter and July was operating around that same gross profit percentage.  \nJonathan Chappell:   Okay. So just to frame. I mean, 16% starts to decelerate, is 20.8% gross profit margin kind of the new floor as we think about the back half of the year and into \u201823?  \nDrew Wilkerson:   I wouldn\u2019t call it the floor. There\u2019s a lot of unknowns for the back half of the year. So what I\u2019m confident in is that we\u2019ll outperform the market because the investments that we\u2019ve made in technology; that we\u2019ll have best-in-class gross profit percentages going forward.  \nOperator:   Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.  \nScott Andrew Schneeberger:   Congratulations, Mario, and Brad, to you as well. Drew, I\u2019m going to keep it on you. I\u2019m curious in the back half for truck brokerage. What are you anticipating for kind of the dynamic -- the industry dynamic in spot rates? And how do you intend to manage contract versus spot? It looks like you\u2019ve improved that toward the contract side year-over-year? And any color you can share about what time of year you may renew contract rates more so than others?  \nDrew Wilkerson:   Yes. So the spot rates have come down on a year-over-year basis. They\u2019re below contract rates. I don\u2019t think that they can fall too much further from where they are right now overall. When you look at the back half of the year, there\u2019s still some unknowns in the macro, but I\u2019m confident that we\u2019ll outperform whether the market tightens or loosens, we\u2019ve built a model that can perform well in either market. The second part of your question, I forgot. Will you repeat that?  \nScott Andrew Schneeberger:   Yes, just the management of contract versus spot. And is there for a time of the year where you renew contract more than others.  \nDrew Wilkerson:   Yes. Typically, our annual contracts come up in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter, but rates with customers is always an ongoing discussion. And that\u2019s something that we manage through the second quarter and it\u2019s why you saw our contract volume go up to 73%, which was perfect for this -- for the market that we\u2019re in.  \nOperator:   Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Seidl with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.  \nJason Seidl:   First of all, Mario, congratulations on the CEO role going forward. I wanted to stick with you here on the LTL side. You talked a little bit about the cost savings from in-housing a lot of the linehaul. Can you talk about the differential between in-house linehaul and an outsourced linehaul. In terms of operational performance, is in-house linehaul more reliable? And should we expect, as you in-house more that your performance numbers will go up?  \nMario Harik:   Sure thing, Jason, first, thank you. So when we think about first starting with cost, there is a roughly differential of 30% to 40% cost per mile differential between outsourced linehaul and in-sourced linehaul.   Now in terms of service, if you go back in the back half of last year, on-time service for carriers were generally in a much tougher place. So the differential on on-time service between internal and external was fairly wide. But since then, that gap has narrowed quite a bit. So carriers now are performing at a much better level of on-time service. However, internal is always better because internal, It\u2019s always better because internally, obviously, it\u2019s your drivers, your employees, your equipment. So you effectively have full control over it, and it\u2019s usually 100% of the time there. So it\u2019s still slightly better for internal, but that gap has closed significantly since last -- the back half of last year.  \nJason Seidl:   And how should we look longer term at your terminal footprint? How comfortable are you that right now, this is the right footprint to have? And what changes might you think about making if you want to make any.  \nMario Harik:   Yes. On the terminal openings, so obviously, we have a plan to add 900 net new doors that we initiated in October of last year. And so far, we\u2019ve added a net 345 doors. And these are all in markets that we -- where we are either seeing demand from our customers where we don\u2019t have enough capacity to handle that demand or improving the operation of our line haul network. When you think about the freight moving through our network, if we have certain docks where we\u2019re seeing that are already tapped out of capacity or running close to capacity, this is where we\u2019re looking to expand those.   To give you an example, the Atlanta market is a market where we were seeing both demand in the local market as well as demand for market to flow in the south of the country, for example, down to Florida.   So by us adding the new terminal there, that gives us effectively more capacity to handle that local volume as well as move more freight through the linehaul network. And this is what\u2019s driving our strategy.  \nOperator:   Thank you. Our next question is from Ari Rosa with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.  \nAriel Luis Rosa:   Great. And I\u2019ll echo others\u2019 comments in terms of extending congrats to Mario on the promotion or the anticipated promotion to CEO. Mario, I wanted to stick on that topic of kind of negative tonnage growth versus adding door capacity. It seems like those 2 things are in conflict. So I guess my question is, as we think about 2023, is the expectation that tonnage can be up year-over-year as you start to bring on onboard some of these new customers? And maybe you can talk about that logic. Is it really just filling out the network and improving service capacity? And do you anticipate maybe idle capacity, maybe a little bit more elevated than what it has been relative to history?  \nMario Harik:   Thanks, Ari, on the best wishes. But when we think about capacity, we think of it as being a long-term investment for us to be able to drive grabbing market share and growing volumes, and historically, since we first acquired Con-way, our CapEx investment strategy in LTL was to actually keep volume steady but expand margins and case in point, we generated $3.8 billion of cash since we acquired Con-way and the goal was not to expand volume.   That said moving forward, when we think about these investments, in the short term, again, we\u2019re seeing that mixed feedback from customers and softer demand than what we saw last year. But generally, over the years to come, that demand is going to pick up, and we\u2019re going to have the investments in capacity to be able to capture that demand, both from a network perspective, from a real estate doors perspective as well, as adding more fleet to be able to handle that as well.   For 2023 guidance, we\u2019ll obviously give more of that later in the year. And I definitely encourage you to attend the Investor Day, we\u2019re going to be holding in the fall.  \nAriel Luis Rosa:   Okay. Great. And if I can sneak in a quick follow-up. I just wanted to ask Brad because we\u2019re probably not going to get too many more opportunities to have Brad on these calls. I would imagine. Brad, just given your experience with XPO and spending a decade building this business, any reflections on kind of what went well, what went less well and thoughts on the future for the broader industry in terms of both LTL and brokerage.  \nBrad Jacobs:   I look back over the last 11 years, and I feel very proud. I feel very proud of the team. I feel proud of what the team has accomplished. We started off buying a relatively small company back in 2011, Express-1. It had about $170 million of revenue and less than $10 million of EBITDA and look at what we\u2019ve grown the business to right now.   And we\u2019ve done it with being very careful with how we spend the money that our shareholders have given us and our lenders have lent to us, and we\u2019ve had an intense focus on return on capital and generating free cash flow. And this is what creates value over time. So I like where the company is positioned. I like the fact that we\u2019ve cultured management and people have grown so much over the last decade to the point where I feel comfortable dividing the company up in 3. We\u2019ve already divided up the warehousing business with an excellent CEO running that. We\u2019re spinning off brokerage, and we got an excellent CEO to run that. And RemainCo will be run by an excellent CEO, Mario Harik and LTL business will be very strong.   The second part of your question is, what do I think about the future of the LTL business and truck brokerage. I think they\u2019re both good businesses. I think particularly the way we\u2019re approaching those businesses. In truck brokerage, we -- Mario and I, right from the very beginning in 2011, said, we have a vision here. Let\u2019s automate this business. And let\u2019s make things that are done by humans, done by the computer.   And that\u2019s what we did. And we spent so much money investing in developing what was originally Freight Optimizer. We were going to call it Super Mario, but that name was taken. And then developed that into XPO Connect. And XPO Connect, the adoption rates are off the charts. And there\u2019s a lot of elements that have gone into making our brokerage business very strong, but the technology is the main one, in my opinion.   So I think brokerage has got a bright future because it\u2019s tech-enabled and we provide a service that shippers need, and we provide a service that carriers need. So I\u2019m good with the business.   In terms of LTL, different business plan there. There, that\u2019s something completely levered -- not completely, but predominantly levered to the industrial economy. So we have to go up and down with the industrial economy. And we\u2019ve had an approach there to -- in Phase 1 of LTL up until now, to run the business for cash, to run the business for not growing the top line, not growing tonnage, not growing headcount, not growing the fleet but to run the business more intelligently, run the business more efficiently, run the business more productively.   And as a result of that, we\u2019ve taken a business that was doing $300-something million of EBITDA when we bought it. Now we\u2019re on track to do $1 billion of EBITDA. And we\u2019ve taken the margins up by 1,290 basis points and all the while generating $3.8 billion of cash. I can\u2019t emphasize that enough, because anybody can put a lot of CapEx into your business and you\u2019re going to see volume growth, of course, you will. But to take a business and not put money into it in a big way, but instead, generate cash from it, and grow profit growth from that. That\u2019s really something I\u2019m very proud of what the team has done.   Now in Phase 2 of LTL, we\u2019re going to continue our discipline of growing the margin, eliminating waste, reducing inefficiencies, running the business in a way that customers love us. And at the same time, we\u2019re going to invest in the fleet, and we\u2019re going to grow the top line as well. Very big inflection point in terms of Phase 1 of LTL, in which we were sweating the assets, and Phase 2 of LTL, where we\u2019re going to continue to focus on the optimization of the assets, but also invest in the business and grow the top line.   So I think the future is very, very bright there. And I think Mario is inheriting a very good platform, and I\u2019m confident he\u2019s going to bring it to a whole new level over the next few years.  \nAriel Luis Rosa:   Great. Thanks for the all the color and congrats on the strong results.  \nBrad Jacobs:   Thank you. And congrats on your new position, Ari. You have big shoes to fill.  \nAriel Luis Rosa:   Thank you so much. I appreciate that.  \nBrad Jacobs:   Thank you.  \nEnd of Q&A:  \nBrad Jacobs:   Well, we\u2019ve got a lot of record results to talk about on this call, including our highest adjusted EBITDA of any quarter.   In LTL, we reported our best adjusted operating ratio ever. Truck brokerage is continuing its phenomenal run with another quarter of double-digit volume growth. The process with Europe is going well and a sale there should help us to continue to delever. And the spin remains on track for the fourth quarter.   After the spin, each company will have a rock-solid CEO, Mario for LTL, Drew for brokerage, and will have a long runway for earnings growth for both of them. So thank you, everyone. It\u2019s been a pleasure, and we\u2019ll talk again soon.  \nOperator:   This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Drew Wilkerson",
            "content": "Thanks, Mario. North American truck brokerage had another strong quarter as we continued to sharply outpace the industry. I'll start by giving you 4 metrics from the quarter that highlight the stellar performance the team delivered. Then I'll talk about what's driving these results.   First is volume. We grew loads by 16% in the quarter, and it was the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit load growth for our business.   Second, we delivered a gross profit margin of 20.8%, up year-over-year by 610 basis points. This is a record performance for us in any quarter. Third is gross profit dollars, which we grew year-over-year by 76%. We have a long track record of growing gross profit through economic cycles, and we're confident we'll continue to do that.   And the fourth metric is an adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.6%, that's 420 basis points higher than Q2 last year and it's our first double-digit adjusted EBITDA margin. We achieved these 4 metrics through a powerful combination we've built over many years: scale, cutting-edge technology and deep customer relationships.   Scale refers to our access to massive capacity of 98,000 independent carriers in North America that allow us to serve more than 5,500 customers including nearly half of the Fortune 100 companies. These are carriers who have registered to do business with us on our XPO Connect digital platform and come back week after week because of the immense volume that flows through our network.   To a carrier, these are income opportunities. Truck brokerage is a highly fragmented industry, and there's a lot of competition for carriers, especially with the driver shortage. We make it more efficient for carriers to do business with us. Our digital platform is easy to use and we have a national carrier rewards program that saves them money on things like fuel, tires and roadside assistance.   And to shippers, our scale means reliable capacity on demand. The automation and machine learning we've built into the platform allow our people to focus on being more productive for our customers. We're known as dependable problem solvers who have a strong understanding of market dynamics.   We work with our customers to make sure we have the appropriate amount of spot versus contract business based on the current market conditions.   For instance, we made a deliberate shift in the second quarter to operate at a favorable revenue mix of 73% contract and 27% spot. A year earlier, that mix was 66% contract and 34% spot. Our technology gives us the agility to manage that change.   In the early days of XPO in 2011, we had the vision to develop a fully automated brokerage system, and we've been building on our first-mover advantage ever since. I'm privileged to lead the team that made this vision a reality over the last 11 years, and I'm even more excited about the next decade because of the opportunity to leverage our platform to continue to serve more customers and outpace the market.   Every dollar we put in our digital platform continues to pay off. Even now years after we introduced XPO Connect, it's still growing at a rapid clip.   Our mobile app has been downloaded more than 800,000 times. The number of weekly average carrier users on the platform increased year-over-year by 74%. And 80% of our truck brokerage loads were created or covered digitally up from 74% in the first quarter.   It's exciting to see the tremendous demand for our platform drive additional share gains for us. Soon, we expect to spin off as RXO. And once that happens, I'll continue to work closely with Yoav Amiel, who will be our Chief Information Officer. Yoav currently leads the ongoing development of XPO's digital brokerage platform, which will be called RXO Connect and will be the technology backbone of the new company.   For us, the strategy of becoming a brokerage pure play makes sense on every level, We're a high-growth platform with a long runway for value creation.   As a new public company with a sole focus on asset-light transportation, we'll continue to deliver best-in-class results for our employees, customers, carriers and investors. I look forward to meeting many of you at our Investor Day this fall, where we'll be sharing our long-term outlook.   That concludes our prepared remarks. I'll turn it over to the operator, and we'll go to Q&A. Allison, this is Drew. On the second part of your question, it was both new and existing customers, but it was also both new and existing carriers that we're working with. When you look at the carrier side, last quarter, we talked about having 88,000 carriers in our network. This quarter, we have 98,000 carriers, but all of our stats on both the carrier side and the customer side, are up and to the right. Our year-over-year registered carriers on XPO Connect are up 47%. The registered customers are up 29%, and the carrier usage is up 74%. So when you look at the outperformance that we've had for the past several quarters, technology is the main reason that we've been able to do that, and that's because we began investing in it in 2011. Ravi, this is Drew. It's coming from both. When you look at the trend that's been going on for years in the brokerage industry, brokerage as a whole is taking share from asset-based carriers. I know I've said this before, but whenever I started in the brokerage industry, brokers had about 10% share of the for-hire trucking market. Today it's 22% and it's continuing to grow, and I'm confident that it will continue to grow for the next several years going forward.   So, it's coming from asset-based carriers; it's coming from other brokers. And it's because of the service that we provide to customers. The technology that creates solutions for customers and the team that they've got strong relationships with. Our top 20 customers have been with us for 13 years on average. We've got a long history of service and continuing to create solutions for the customers. Ravi, I'm going to keep it simple. Right now, we've only got 4% share in the brokerage market, and we've got a long way to go. Yes. So when you look at it, the volume growth started off strong in April, came down just a little bit in May and then peaked back up again in June. So it was pretty consistent throughout overall for Q2. When you talk about the potential of volume falling off in the future, yes, there is the opportunity to expand net revenue margins. And you saw us do that by putting up 21% in the second quarter and July was operating around that same gross profit percentage. I wouldn't call it the floor. There's a lot of unknowns for the back half of the year. So what I'm confident in is that we'll outperform the market because the investments that we've made in technology; that we'll have best-in-class gross profit percentages going forward. Yes. So the spot rates have come down on a year-over-year basis. They're below contract rates. I don't think that they can fall too much further from where they are right now overall. When you look at the back half of the year, there's still some unknowns in the macro, but I'm confident that we'll outperform whether the market tightens or loosens, we've built a model that can perform well in either market. The second part of your question, I forgot. Will you repeat that? Yes. Typically, our annual contracts come up in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter, but rates with customers is always an ongoing discussion. And that's something that we manage through the second quarter and it's why you saw our contract volume go up to 73%, which was perfect for this -- for the market that we're in."

            "name": "Matthew Fassler",
            "content": "Thanks, Ravi. I'll review our second quarter operating results by segment, starting with North American LTL. We grew LTL revenue 15% year-over-year to $1.2 billion, the highest revenue of any quarter in our history. LTL adjusted EBITDA grew by 14% year-over-year, or 16% ex real estate.   We had a 5.5% decline in tonnage per day from the second quarter of 2021. Demand from our major verticals was mixed. The year-over-year trend in agricultural verticals, which are seasonally significant in Q2, decelerated while automotive accelerated.   Industrial, by far, our largest vertical, tracked the overall trend as in our second largest vertical, retail and e-commerce.   Year-over-year growth in tonnage per day improved through the quarter. Yield, excluding fuel accelerated to an 11% improvement year-over-year from 9% in Q1, reflecting a solid pricing backdrop to the industry and the benefit of our proprietary pricing tools. Pricing is a major focus of our technology development in LTL, and we've added top talent to our pricing team. We increased pricing on contract renewals year-over-year by 12%.   Our LTL adjusted operating ratio of 80.4% was 70 basis points better than the second quarter a year ago. It's also a 530 basis point improvement sequentially from Q1.   On our last earnings call, we said we expected to achieve at least 400 basis points of sequential improvement, so we outperformed that expectation. I'll note that these adjusted operating ratios exclude gains from real estate sales.   Our success in improving network fluidity is driving improvement in our cost trends. As we procured third-party line haul capacity more effectively, the year-over-year headwind from purchase transportation, measured as a percent of revenue, moderated from 250 basis points in Q1 to just 10 basis points in Q2. Those are the financial highlights of a solid second quarter performance in North American LTL.   Our other segment is brokerage and other services, and I'll remind you that intermodal was reported in this segment until we sold the business late in Q1 of this year.   Segment revenue, as reported, declined in Q2 by 4% year-over-year, but excluding intermodal, revenue increased by 9% to $2.1 billion.   In addition, FX weighed on revenue growth by 3 percentage points. Adjusted EBITDA increased 17% or 29% ex intermodal to $152 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin for this segment expanded by 140 basis points to 7.4% from 6% a year ago.   The largest revenue and profit driver in the segment is our North American truck brokerage business, which had another outstanding quarter. This will be the core business of our planned spin-off of RXO in the fourth quarter of this year. We increased our brokerage loads per day by 16% versus a year ago and by 61% from 2 years ago.   Second quarter truck brokerage revenue rose 24% year-over-year. Our truck brokerage growth reflects our strong execution in a dynamic market. Drew will speak more about the specific drivers in a minute.   As Brad mentioned, organic revenue in Europe grew 7%, accelerating by 2 percentage points from the first quarter. We saw acceleration in organic revenue growth in all 3 of our major regions. France, U.K. and Iberia and the platform continues to deliver results, both top line and profits despite the geopolitical backdrop.   And lastly, we're grateful for some external recognition we received during the quarter. XPO was named a top 100 3PL by Inbound Logistics magazine for the ninth year. Forbes named XPO a best place to work in Spain for the fourth consecutive year.   We were named a Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion on the Disability Equality Index for the second consecutive year. And we served as the official transport partner for the Tour de France for the 42nd year and expanded our partnership as the official transport partner for the women's edition of the tour.   Now I'll turn it over to Mario for his comments on North American LTL."

We raised the midpoint of our new guidance for 2022 by an additional $5 million beyond that. You can think about that as relating to strong visibility in both LTL and in brokerage services. And you asked about LTL in particular, in the first half of the year, in LTL, ex real estate, we had an adjusted EBITDA increase of about 11%, and we're more like mid- to high teens in the second half of the year. So we have very good visibility on first half to second half acceleration for LTL."

I'll start with our results. We delivered strong year-over-year growth with record second quarter revenue and the highest adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS of any quarter in our history. Revenue in the quarter was $3.2 billion.   Adjusting for the sale of our intermodal business, our year-over-year revenue increased 11%. We grew adjusted EBITDA year-over-year by 23% to $405 million or 29%, excluding intermodal and gains from real estate sales. This reflects the strong earnings growth across all our businesses. FX negatively impacted EBITDA by $6 million in the quarter.   Our adjusted EBITDA margin was a record 12.5%, and this was a year-over-year improvement of 210 basis points. Operating conditions in the quarter were favorable, and the firm pricing environment more than offset inflationary pressures for labor and purchased transportation.   Our corporate costs in the quarter, excluding one-time expenses related to strategic initiatives was down year-over-year by 29%. This reflects continued rationalization of our corporate cost structure. Our interest expense for the second quarter was $31 million compared to $58 million in the year ago period. This reflects the paydown of approximately $3 billion of debt last year and over $600 million of debt during the second quarter.   The effective tax rate for adjusted EPS for the quarter was 24%. Our adjusted earnings per diluted share was $1.81, which was up from $1.22 a year ago, an increase of 48%. The increase was primarily driven by higher adjusted EBITDA and lower interest expense. We generated $199 million of cash flow from continuing operations; spent $130 million on gross CapEx; and received $4 million of proceeds from asset sales. Gross CapEx was up $69 million year-over-year primarily allocated to growing our LTL network.   Our free cash flow was $73 million. This includes $28 million of cash outflows related to transaction costs that were not contemplated in our free cash flow guidance.   Excluding these transaction costs, our free cash flow was $101 million for the quarter.   Looking at the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $436 million of cash. This cash, combined with available debt capacity under committed borrowing facilities gave us $1.4 billion of liquidity at quarter end.   We had no borrowings outstanding under our ABL facility. Our net leverage at quarter end was 1.8x adjusted EBITDA. We are ahead of schedule on our deleveraging plan and are well within our target leverage range of 1 to 2x adjusted EBITDA.   In light of our strong results in the first half and our expectations for the second half, we updated our guidance after market close yesterday. Our new full year guidance for adjusted EBITDA is $1.4 billion to $1.43 billion. This increase primarily reflects our second quarter outperformance and does not include the impacts of our planned spin-off or the divestment of our European operations. We still expect to have up to $50 million of gains from real estate sales and we currently expect all of these gains to be realized in the fourth quarter.   We also issued guidance for the third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $330 million to $345 million. Pro forma for the Intermodal sales, the midpoint of this range implies the third quarter adjusted EBITDA growth rate of 18% over the prior year. Our outlook for full year 2022 adjusted EPS anticipates a range of $5.55 to $5.90. This reflects our higher EBITDA outlook and slightly lower interest expense.   The midpoint of our new full year guidance for adjusted EPS implies year-over-year growth of 33%.   On the cash flow front, our outlook for full year cash flow is now $425 million to $475 million, up $25 million versus our previous outlook.   As a reminder, this excludes all transaction-related cash outflows. We expect interest expense of $145 million to $150 million, which is down from our prior target of $150 million to $160 million. There is no change to our previous guidance for depreciation and amortization expense, CapEx and the tax rate.   In conclusion, we had a very strong first half of 2022 and we are entering the second half with good momentum. The execution of our strategic plan remains on track, and we are excited about creating 2 pure-play transportation powerhouses.   I will now turn things over to Matt."

            "content": "Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I want to thank Brad and the Board for placing their trust in me. XPO has an enormous opportunity ahead and it will be a privilege to lead the company and continue working with Brad as Executive Chairman.   It's also humbling to be entrusted with continuing the transformation we're executing in LTL. I've run the business for almost a year now, and I'm constantly inspired by our best-in-class team, and we're going to accomplish a lot more together.   As Brad said, we continue to see tremendous momentum in our LTL business. This has accelerated over the last quarter with the actions we're taking to drive improvements in network fluidity and service and grow our network capacity.   In the second quarter, we gained significant traction in all these areas with measurable results. We achieved the highest level of network fluidity since before the pandemic. We also reached a new high for customer satisfaction, according to Mastio, a third-party industry consultant that tracks our Net Promoter Score on a quarterly basis.   In addition, our investments in capacity are on track. The 5 terminals we added since October are fully operational. Now we're evaluating sites in Salt Lake City, Houston, Atlanta, Kansas City, Dallas and Philadelphia.   We're being very disciplined about the network expansion. We've done the analysis, and we're adding new terminals or new doors to existing terminals in markets with growing demand for LTL service. We expect these markets to continue to grow over the long term. The 345 net new doors we've added to date bring us over 1/3 of the way to our goal of adding 900 net new doors by the end of next year.   Looking beyond our footprint, we're investing in capacity where we have a competitive advantage. For example, last quarter, we announced that we added a second production line at our trailer manufacturing facility in Arkansas. That investment had an immediate impact. And in the second quarter, we produced a record number of trailers for our fleet. Our target is to manufacture more than 4,700 trailers this year. This will expand our in-house linehaul trailer capacity by over 10% to an all-time high.   We've reaffirmed our plan for LTL CapEx at 8% to 9% of revenue this year. On the driver side, we've been ramping up our hiring with targeted recruitment efforts and training more drivers in-house at our 130 training locations. These 2 channels are working well as solutions to the ongoing driver shortage. June was a particularly strong month for recruitment. The hiring environment overall is still tight, but it loosened significantly in the second quarter. We had a 44% average increase in the number of applications for each job we posted in the quarter.   Now I want to switch gears for a minute and talk about our record Q2 adjusted operating ratio of 80.4%. That's a year-over-year improvement of 70 basis points ex real estate. We had promised a second quarter inflection to year-over-year improvement, and we delivered that. I'm also pleased that we overachieved on sequential improvement which, as Matt noted, was 530 basis points from Q1 to Q2.   We're on track for our target of more than 100 basis points of year-over-year improvement this year. Looking at the underlying drivers. We expect yield to remain strong throughout the balance of the year. Our pricing technology is mission-critical in getting us fair value for our services.   In the second quarter, we saw the early impact of our pricing tools with strong yield on contract renewals. From a sales standpoint, we won a record amount of new business in Q2. And our sales sustained a positive trajectory each month in the quarter.   Last week, I met with a large shipper at our new Atlanta terminal. They just signed on with XPO and they're our newest top 10 customer. They're very happy with their onboarding experience and they've already committed to incremental volume with us.   In addition, we're in discussions with 2 more brands this quarter, both of these would be top 10 LTL customers for XPO. This would set us up well for 2023.   As we onboard more revenue, we'll also focus on cost management. This is another area where our technology excels. In the second quarter, we introduced proprietary cost models to enhance the team's visibility into cost management levers. We also have a new piece-level tracking capability that has the potential to significantly improve customer service and visibility.   One of our largest costs and a large opportunity is purchased transportation. We'll continue to moderate purchased transportation costs as we move through the back half of the year driven by more efficient network operations and newly negotiated carrier rates.   There are times when third-party line haul is the optimal solution. But as we continue to add drivers and equipment, we expect to, over time, insource more third-party line haul-miles. This should drive material cost savings.   We have a lot of initiatives underway. And to sum it up, our goal is pretty simple. We want to be the best. We're creating a world-class LTL carrier by maintaining an intense focus on every part of the business. We have a highly engaged team that's determined to delight our customers.   This year, we expect to generate at least $1 billion of LTL adjusted EBITDA and more than 100 basis points of year-over-year improvement in adjusted operating ratio ex real estate.   Going forward, we have company-specific levers that can expand our margin and improve our operating ratio well into the 70s. We'll take more volume share for our investments in fleet, doors and people and capture a high return on those investments over time.   Over the last 9 months, we've made major advances in positioning XPO to become a world-class LTL carrier from every perspective. And we know exactly where we're going from here. We'll provide more details on our growth plan at our LTL Investor Day as we get closer to the spinoff. We'll also announce our long-term outlook for XPO as a stand-alone company.   Now I'll hand it over to Drew to cover Truck brokerage. Drew? Scott, on the sequential margins and overall LTLs you said, the second quarter, we delivered a great sequential improvement of 530 basis points, an 80.4% adjusted OR.   When we look at the third quarter, we expect an improvement of at least 150 basis points on a year-on-year basis, which is the typical -- in the neighborhood of our typical seasonality going from the second to the third quarter. Yes. So let's start with insourcing. So we do expect purchased transportation costs to continue to moderate through the course of the year. When you look at the second quarter, our linehaul miles that were outsourced were roughly 24.7%, which was up 80 basis points from last year, which is what we said we would do, where we're going to lean a bit more on purchased transportation this year.   Now we don't expect to insource purchased transportation as much in 2022. That's more of a longer-term strategic initiative for us and how we expect to drive that. However, we do expect the rates on a per mile basis to continue to moderate through the course of the year. As we improve network fluidity, we can be much more predictive in how we purchase transportation. And just to give you a few stats, the cost per mile for us in linehaul was up on a year-on-year basis by 33% in the first quarter and it was up 14% in the second quarter with newly negotiated rates with carriers that went into effect in the month of May. So as we head into the back half of the year, we would expect that to continue to moderate and give us a portion of the cost tailwinds we expect in the back half.   Now going back to your question on if we can accelerate further the OR improvement. Obviously, OR goes back to volume, to price and all the cost improvements that we are doing. And there are multiple paths for us to get to our guidance of at least $1 billion of EBITDA and at least 100 basis points of OR improvement. Yes. Sure thing, Chris. So when we look at the -- if we follow sequentially, so from an OR perspective, obviously, we flipped favorable in the second quarter, 70 basis points on a year-on-year basis. And now when we go to the third quarter, starting first with pricing. We expect the pricing environment to remain very robust. Our yield in the second quarter was up 11% versus 8.7% in the first quarter and we expect yield to continue to remain strong for the course of the year, although we'll have tougher comps as we head into the back half.   But our contract renewals were up 12% in the second quarter, and it continues to be up double digits in the month of July.   From a volume perspective, we were down 5.5% in the second quarter, and we expect the third quarter to be down in the low to mid-single digits on the tonnage front, but we're excited about the momentum we have in sales, as I said in my prepared remarks, we saw record new business wins in the second quarter, and that trend improved through the quarter. We landed a new top 10 customer in the second quarter. Just recently here, I met with them and they're sending more business our way. They were very happy with their onboarding experience. We're in top quartile in terms of quality that we offer them, and they're going to send more business our way.   And we're in -- we're having great momentum here early in the third quarter with 2 potential top 10 customers as well. So that would lead to obviously volumes improving through the course of the year.   Then finally, on the cost side, I mentioned third-party linehaul cost, and overall linehaul cost, that will moderate through the course of the year. And we also have a number of efficiency actions. We've had the best network fluidity since pre-pandemic, and that's going to lead to better results as well. Yes. The typical seasonality is in the, call it, 200 to 250 range in terms of OR change from the second quarter to the third quarter. Yes. First, I'll take the customer question and then I'll turn it over to Matt for the guidance piece. I mentioned also earlier that we launched new costing technology in the second quarter. It's a proprietary costing model. So we have a very deep understanding about how a customer, as we onboard them, how they would impact the network as a whole and we price according to where we have excess capacity or imbalanced lanes, where we need to get more volume and lanes that we want to be able to fill the backhaul for and better balance our network.   So this is how we look at these large relationships in terms of, one, how we price them but, two, how we analyze that data for fit with the network. And we have a new technology that helps us make these determinations easier and better. And these will be accretive both in terms of volume and profits as well. When we think overall about getting to the 70s from an OR perspective, that's our goal. So if we think about our strategy that we started in Q4 of last year, we expect to improve our OR by hundreds of basis points to get well into the 70s over the years to come, and the strategy is focused on the customer where we want to delight our customers by providing outstanding service in on-time, damage performance and all the aspects of service. We want to continue to grow volume by adding capacity.   Historically, we've spent maintenance CapEx to expand margins. Now we're pivoting to a strategy where we're investing in more doors, more people and more equipment, leveraging our trailer manufacturing facility there. Obviously, pricing will continue to be firm in our industry moving forward. And then finally, we want to leverage our proprietary technology to keep on optimizing our cost structure.   And in-sourcing linehaul miles where it makes sense. Over the years to come, we expect to improve our OR hundreds of basis points to get well into the 70s. And we'll give more color on that in our Investor Day later, early fall and how the model looks like over the years to come. You got it, Allison. I'll take the first one, then I'll turn it over to Drew.   But first, starting with the macro and the industrial. So today, 2/3 of our customers are industrial companies. And we hear mixed feedback from these customers. When we look at many of these companies have had pent-up demand from their customers where they couldn't produce enough parts to fulfill open POs that they have from their customers. And as things are easing up in their supply chain they're actually being able to move product faster, which is leading to stronger demand. Others aren't seeing that, others are actually seeing softness in demand that is impacting overall how much they're shipping.   But generally, we see the industrial economy very much in recovery, and that's going to become a tailwind as we get through where things are today.   Now in terms of technology and how we use technology. For us, technology has a number of components. Number one is the focus on pricing where we launch proprietary pricing technology. And as I mentioned earlier, we just launched a new proprietary costing model that allows us to better understand the cost structure of a given shipment and how we can price the freight for the customer so we can get the highest yield possible.   And also bridging the yield gap we have with some of our competition as well. It also helps with automation technology like dynamic pricing and reducing manual processing as well. And then we have a slew of technologies around cost efficiency and overall operational excellence and these start with linehaul, and this is where doing things like better balancing the network and our algorithms that operate linehaul to optimize how much headhauls to be built in the network will improve the more than $1.1 billion of spend we spend on line haul over time. And then similarly with pickup and delivery to increase route density and on the docks to optimize labor efficiency.   And finally, from a customer-facing perspective, we believe in technology to help with our service to the customer. And case in point, we just launched new technology called piece-level tracking, where we can give customers visibility to the pallet level of where every pallet is moving through the network and then giving them better visibility on it in terms of when they're going to see their shipments. You got it. First, thank you for the well wishes. But as you said, Q2 tonnage was down 5.5%, which was within our guidance. But when you think about the sequential tonnage trends from Q1 to Q2, these were favorable relative to peers.   Now when we think about what drove that, I mean, some of what I mentioned earlier on, the mixed feedback from customers. When you look at the existing customer base, there was slight softness compared to -- if you compare that to last year, as an example, in the environment that was leading to that.   Now what we are excited about, though, is the momentum we have from a sales perspective. With the significant improvement we've seen in how we're performing and the network fluidity that is back to pre-pandemic levels, we have great sales momentum from our sales force, where we've had record business wins in the second quarter, and that accelerated through the quarter as well. So when we think about it, that's going to be new customers and new volumes that get onboarded in the back half as we head into 2023 and add more volume to our network. Yes, you're spot on, Tom. This is very much ingrained in our culture, where the culture of one continuous improvement but focus on the customer and keep on improving service. And just to give you an example, we have a number of ongoing initiatives that actually help drive that. Starting first, our sales team is working with our customers on freight packaging best practices. And for customers who load their own trailers, we actually have feedback loops where we now give them feedback on how well their dock workers are loading these trailers.   We launched a number of changes in the incentive plan for our people in the field that actually have quality as a whole as part of that incentive plan. And we also have a number of initiatives where -- and these are new technology initiatives that are ingrained now in the culture, where if you're a dock worker or a driver, whenever you open up a, or a freight operations supervisor, whenever you open up or you close a trailer, you actually take a photo of it and you rate the quality of the loading of that trailer in terms of using our quality methods of loading these loads.   So that's very much ingrained in what we're doing. And there is a tremendous amount of momentum in focusing on the customer and the quality we offer our customers. Sure thing, Jason, first, thank you. So when we think about first starting with cost, there is a roughly differential of 30% to 40% cost per mile differential between outsourced linehaul and in-sourced linehaul.   Now in terms of service, if you go back in the back half of last year, on-time service for carriers were generally in a much tougher place. So the differential on on-time service between internal and external was fairly wide. But since then, that gap has narrowed quite a bit. So carriers now are performing at a much better level of on-time service. However, internal is always better because internal, It's always better because internally, obviously, it's your drivers, your employees, your equipment. So you effectively have full control over it, and it's usually 100% of the time there. So it's still slightly better for internal, but that gap has closed significantly since last -- the back half of last year. Yes. On the terminal openings, so obviously, we have a plan to add 900 net new doors that we initiated in October of last year. And so far, we've added a net 345 doors. And these are all in markets that we -- where we are either seeing demand from our customers where we don't have enough capacity to handle that demand or improving the operation of our line haul network. When you think about the freight moving through our network, if we have certain docks where we're seeing that are already tapped out of capacity or running close to capacity, this is where we're looking to expand those.   To give you an example, the Atlanta market is a market where we were seeing both demand in the local market as well as demand for market to flow in the south of the country, for example, down to Florida.   So by us adding the new terminal there, that gives us effectively more capacity to handle that local volume as well as move more freight through the linehaul network. And this is what's driving our strategy. Thanks, Ari, on the best wishes. But when we think about capacity, we think of it as being a long-term investment for us to be able to drive grabbing market share and growing volumes, and historically, since we first acquired Con-way, our CapEx investment strategy in LTL was to actually keep volume steady but expand margins and case in point, we generated $3.8 billion of cash since we acquired Con-way and the goal was not to expand volume.   That said moving forward, when we think about these investments, in the short term, again, we're seeing that mixed feedback from customers and softer demand than what we saw last year. But generally, over the years to come, that demand is going to pick up, and we're going to have the investments in capacity to be able to capture that demand, both from a network perspective, from a real estate doors perspective as well, as adding more fleet to be able to handle that as well.   For 2023 guidance, we'll obviously give more of that later in the year. And I definitely encourage you to attend the Investor Day, we're going to be holding in the fall."

            "name": "Brad Jacobs",
            "content": "Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining our call. With me today in Greenwich are Ravi Tulsyan, our CFO; Matt Fassler, our Chief Strategy Officer; Mario Harik, President of LTL; and Drew Wilkerson, President of North American Transportation.   Before we get into earnings, I want to comment on the succession plan we announced yesterday. Once we complete the spinoff, Mario will succeed me as CEO of XPO, and I'll remain with the company as Executive Chairman. I'll be the Non-Executive Chairman of the spin-off, RXO.   Appointing Mario as my successor was an easy decision for the Board and me. Mario has a deep understanding of the nuts and bolts of our LTL operations. He's been hands on with LTL as CIO for 7 years, because as soon as we acquired the network, we started developing technology for it.   He also worked closely with the LTL sales team in his role as Chief Customer Officer, and he's been running the entire LTL business since last year.   Mario is mission-critical to XPO. He was the third person I hired back in 2011 and we've worked side-by-side on every major initiative since then. He's been instrumental in the successful integration of 18 acquisitions and he spearheaded countless innovations that have given us a tremendous commercial advantage.   Now Mario and his management team will take the reins of our growth strategy for LTL and lead XPO into its next chapter as a pure-play LTL carrier.   I'm proud to report a very strong second quarter. All of our reported metrics were ahead of guidance and consensus. We had our ninth straight beat on adjusted EBITDA and in fact, we generated more adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter than in any quarter in our history.   Like adjusted EBITDA, our adjusted diluted EPS was a new record for any quarter. In our North American LTL business, we're continuing to build tremendous momentum. What a difference 9 months make. Kudos to Mario and the team for delivering LTL revenue and adjusted EBITDA that were records for any quarter.   Our adjusted operating ratio ex-real estate inflected positive in the quarter by 70 basis points to 80.4%. That's another company record for any quarter, and it puts us right on track for an improvement of more than 100 basis points this year compared with 2021.   Also in the second quarter, we maintained our highest level of LTL network fluidity since 2020. So it's not surprising that we've seen a significant increase in our customer satisfaction scores as measured both internally and by third parties. The LTL team has increased its focus on customer service over the last 9 months now, and it's gratifying to see us continue to build high satisfaction levels after a V-shaped recovery in our service metrics.   In North American truck brokerage, we continue to sharply outperform the industry. Our gross profit was a record for any quarter at 20.8%, up year-over-year by 610 basis points.   And it's not just a price play. We grew volume year-over-year in the quarter by 16% in truck brokerage. This is a best-in-class business that's both highly profitable and taking share quarter after quarter.   In Europe, our operations continue to perform well despite the war in Ukraine. Our organic revenue growth in Europe was 7% year-over-year, which was a sequential improvement from the 5% we reported in the first quarter. And in constant currency, we grew adjusted EBITDA year-over-year by a robust 14%.   Company-wide, a key part of our success has been to pay rigorous attention to return on invested capital and free cash flow. And I'm pleased to report that as of the end of the second quarter, our trailing 12-month company-wide ROIC was 38% and significantly higher in our North American LTL and truck brokerage businesses.   It's worth noting that since we bought the LTL business in October 2015, the business has generated net cash of over $3.8 billion.   And lastly, over the first 6 months of the year, we brought our net leverage ratio down from 2.7x to 1.8x. It's gratifying to see XPO perform so well across the board and our strategic actions on track. This includes the planned spin-off of our tech-enabled brokered transportation platform, RXO, in the fourth quarter.   Finally, I'd like to profoundly thank all of our 43,000 XPO employees for delivering a phenomenal quarter en route to a record year.   Now I'll pass the call over to Ravi to go through the financials. Scott. The sales process in Europe remains very lively, very buoyant. It's a great opportunity for a buyer to buy an asset that's got scale and has pan-European strategic value. It's a very attractive platform. The base case scenario is we'd be signing a deal to sell it in the fourth quarter and probably wouldn't close by the time of the spin. It could, but probably not. In that case, we'll just have it as discontinued operations, and we'll show the numbers with and without it. Mario? I couldn't hear the very last part of your question, Ravi. Just the very end. All parties, yes. So obviously, as the Executive Chair at XPO, I'll be spending much more time, but I'll still be involved. I will perform the customary duties that are expected of a Non-Executive Chairman at RXO, and I'll be spending the normal customary duties to be expected for an Executive Chairman at XPO. So there'll be more time invested in XPO than RXO. But I'll also be involved in RXO. I look back over the last 11 years, and I feel very proud. I feel very proud of the team. I feel proud of what the team has accomplished. We started off buying a relatively small company back in 2011, Express-1. It had about $170 million of revenue and less than $10 million of EBITDA and look at what we've grown the business to right now.   And we've done it with being very careful with how we spend the money that our shareholders have given us and our lenders have lent to us, and we've had an intense focus on return on capital and generating free cash flow. And this is what creates value over time. So I like where the company is positioned. I like the fact that we've cultured management and people have grown so much over the last decade to the point where I feel comfortable dividing the company up in 3. We've already divided up the warehousing business with an excellent CEO running that. We're spinning off brokerage, and we got an excellent CEO to run that. And RemainCo will be run by an excellent CEO, Mario Harik and LTL business will be very strong.   The second part of your question is, what do I think about the future of the LTL business and truck brokerage. I think they're both good businesses. I think particularly the way we're approaching those businesses. In truck brokerage, we -- Mario and I, right from the very beginning in 2011, said, we have a vision here. Let's automate this business. And let's make things that are done by humans, done by the computer.   And that's what we did. And we spent so much money investing in developing what was originally Freight Optimizer. We were going to call it Super Mario, but that name was taken. And then developed that into XPO Connect. And XPO Connect, the adoption rates are off the charts. And there's a lot of elements that have gone into making our brokerage business very strong, but the technology is the main one, in my opinion.   So I think brokerage has got a bright future because it's tech-enabled and we provide a service that shippers need, and we provide a service that carriers need. So I'm good with the business.   In terms of LTL, different business plan there. There, that's something completely levered -- not completely, but predominantly levered to the industrial economy. So we have to go up and down with the industrial economy. And we've had an approach there to -- in Phase 1 of LTL up until now, to run the business for cash, to run the business for not growing the top line, not growing tonnage, not growing headcount, not growing the fleet but to run the business more intelligently, run the business more efficiently, run the business more productively.   And as a result of that, we've taken a business that was doing $300-something million of EBITDA when we bought it. Now we're on track to do $1 billion of EBITDA. And we've taken the margins up by 1,290 basis points and all the while generating $3.8 billion of cash. I can't emphasize that enough, because anybody can put a lot of CapEx into your business and you're going to see volume growth, of course, you will. But to take a business and not put money into it in a big way, but instead, generate cash from it, and grow profit growth from that. That's really something I'm very proud of what the team has done.   Now in Phase 2 of LTL, we're going to continue our discipline of growing the margin, eliminating waste, reducing inefficiencies, running the business in a way that customers love us. And at the same time, we're going to invest in the fleet, and we're going to grow the top line as well. Very big inflection point in terms of Phase 1 of LTL, in which we were sweating the assets, and Phase 2 of LTL, where we're going to continue to focus on the optimization of the assets, but also invest in the business and grow the top line.   So I think the future is very, very bright there. And I think Mario is inheriting a very good platform, and I'm confident he's going to bring it to a whole new level over the next few years. Thank you. And congrats on your new position, Ari. You have big shoes to fill. Thank you."

I will now turn the call over to Brad Jacobs. Mr. Jacobs, you may begin.  \nBrad Jacobs:   Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our call. With me today in Greenwich are Ravi Tulsyan, our CFO; Matt Fassler, our Chief Strategy Officer; Mario Harik, our CIO and Acting President of LTL; and Drew Wilkerson, President of North American transportation.   As you saw, we delivered a quarter of record results with solid beats across revenue, net income, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS, including our eighth straight quarterly beat on adjusted EBITDA. We grew revenue by 16% over last year\u2019s first quarter, generating the highest revenue of any quarter in our history. We also had first quarter records for net income, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS, which was up year-over-year by 58%. To reflect our momentum, we raised our full year financial outlook by more than the first quarter beat. We\u2019re now guiding, at the midpoint, to adjusted diluted EPS growth of 26%.   Both of our core North American businesses, LTL and truck brokerage, delivered double-digit revenue growth in the quarter. Our LTL network today is a very different business than it was just 6 months ago. Many of the network improvements we\u2019re driving are ahead of plan.   We expect our adjusted operating ratio to improve sequentially by more than 400 basis points for the second quarter. And we continue to expect our adjusted operating ratio, excluding real estate gains, to inflect to year-over-year improvement later in the quarter, and for the full year to be at least 100 basis points better than 2021. Our goal is to create a world-class LTL carrier that delights our customers and our shareholders.   Turning to North American truck brokerage. We\u2019re continuing to fire on all cylinders there. Our volume growth exceeded 20% for the sixth consecutive quarter. This best-in-class brokerage business is continuing to take share and do it profitably. First quarter margin dollars were up 21% year-over-year and rose 5% sequentially, outperforming typical seasonality in large part due to the effectiveness of our digital platform, XPO Connect.   I\u2019m pleased that we have a brokerage veteran lined up to lead the spin-off: Drew Wilkerson. Drew will be CEO, and he\u2019s been the main architect of our brokerage growth since joining us in 2012, most recently as President of North American transportation. He\u2019ll have a long runway to grow the business as a pure-play brokerage company. The spin-off process is on track, as is the planned divestiture of our European operations, which had an excellent first quarter.   And finally, we\u2019re pleased with the deleveraging we achieved in the first quarter. In 3 months, we brought our net leverage ratio down from 2.7x to 2x, which is at the top edge of our target range.   So in sum, we produced an excellent quarter and raised our outlook. We have multiple company-specific avenues for value creation, including the spin-off of our tech-enabled brokerage platform, the ongoing transformation of our LTL business, the divestiture of our European operations and our continuing deleveraging.   Now I\u2019ll ask Ravi to cover our results and our balance sheet. Ravi?  \nRavi Tulsyan:   Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our first quarter results, our balance sheet and liquidity and our outlook for the balance of 2022.   For the first quarter, we delivered strong year-over-year growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS. Revenue in the quarter was a record $3.5 billion, up 16% year-over-year. The net impact of fuel prices and FX accounted for 2 points. Organic revenue growth for the quarter was 14%.   We grew adjusted EBITDA by 15% to a Q1 record of $321 million. Adjusting for gains from real estate sales, the year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA was 25%. This reflects particularly strong growth in our brokerage and other services segment. Looking at a 2-year stack, adjusted EBITDA was up 55%.   For the quarter, our adjusted EBITDA margin was 9.2%. Excluding gains from real estate sales, this was an improvement of 60 basis points year-over-year.   Operating conditions in the quarter were favorable, and the pricing environment stayed firm. This was partially offset by inflationary pressures on labor and purchased transportation.   Corporate costs in the quarter were down 19% year-over-year as we continue to optimize our corporate cost structure following the spin-off of GXO.   Our interest expense during the quarter was $37 million compared to $65 million in the year-ago period. This reflects the paydown of approximately $3 billion of debt last year.   The effective tax rate for adjusted EPS during the quarter was 23%.   Our adjusted earnings per diluted share for the quarter was $1.25, which was up from $0.79 a year ago, an increase of 58%. This increase was primarily driven by higher adjusted EBITDA and lower interest expense.   We generated $200 million of cash flow from continuing operations, spent $137 million on growth CapEx and received $3 million of proceeds from asset sales. Growth CapEx was up $63 million year-over-year with the majority of the additional spend going towards equipment purchases for the North American LTL business. As a result, our free cash flow was $66 million, which was above our expectation. This includes the impact of $15 million of cash outflows related to transaction costs that were not contemplated in our free cash flow guidance.   We are making significant progress on our strategy to create 2 pure-play transportation powerhouses, and we remain on track to complete the spin-off of our tech-enabled brokerage platform in Q4 of this year. As part of our strategic plan, we took an important step last quarter when we completed the sale of our intermodal business for cash proceeds of $710 million, which represented a multiple of approximately 10x 2021 EBITDA.   Including the proceeds from the sale of the intermodal business, we ended the quarter with $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet. This cash, combined with available debt capacity under committed borrowing facilities, give us $2 billion of liquidity at quarter end.   We had no borrowings outstanding under our ABL facility. After quarter end, we repaid $630 million of 2025 notes. This was another significant step in our plan to reduce our debt and deleverage our balance sheet.   Our net leverage at quarter end was 2x adjusted EBITDA. We are ahead of schedule on our deleveraging plan, and we now expect to be below 2x leverage before year-end.   In light of our strong first quarter results and ongoing earnings visibility, we updated our full year guidance after market close yesterday. Our new full year guidance for adjusted EBITDA is $1.35 billion to $1.39 billion. The update reflects our first quarter outperformance, the sale of the intermodal business and our strong outlook for the remainder of the year. The real estate assumptions we gave you in February remain the same.   For the second quarter, we expect our adjusted EBITDA to be $360 million to $370 million. Pro forma for the intermodal sale, the midpoint of our second quarter EBITDA guidance implies a year-over-year growth rate of 15%.   We have raised our outlook for full year adjusted EPS to a range of $5.20 to $5.60. This increase reflects our new EBITDA guidance and the reduction in interest expense resulting from our paydown of debt. The midpoint of our adjusted EPS guide implies year-over-year growth of 26%.   On the cash flow front, our outlook for full year free cash flow remains $400 million to $450 million. As a reminder, our outlook excludes all transaction-related cash outflows.   Our full year guidance for depreciation and amortization expense is approximately $385 million, down from $400 million, reflecting the sale of the intermodal business.   We expect interest expense of $150 million to $160 million, down from $170 million to $180 million previously.   There is no change to our previous guidance for CapEx and the tax rate.   In conclusion, we are continuing to execute on our strategic plan, and we remain excited about our prospects for the balance of 2022.   I will now turn things over to Matt.  \nMatthew Jeremy Fassler:   Thanks, Ravi. I\u2019ll review our first quarter operating results, starting with our North American LTL segment.   We grew LTL revenue by 15% year-over-year to $1.1 billion, the highest revenue of any quarter in our history. Excluding fuel, we grew revenue by 9% year-over-year. We had a 0.8% decline in tonnage per day, which represented 4.1 percentage points of acceleration from our fourth quarter growth rate as our network flow improved. The 4% increase in the level of weight per day from the fourth quarter nicely outpaced typical seasonality. Yield, excluding fuel, increased 9% year-over-year. Our weight per shipment growth of 2% increased from flat in the fourth quarter, and our length of haul increased 0.2% versus a 1% increase in the fourth quarter. Adjusting for these factors, underlying pricing trends were stronger.   The LTL pricing environment remains firm, and we\u2019re driving yield with our own company-specific pricing initiatives. Our yield growth is even stronger this quarter to date.   Our LTL adjusted operating ratio was 85.7%. That\u2019s 140 basis points higher than the first quarter a year ago and significantly better than the 200 basis point year-over-year increase we guided to in February. Both numbers exclude gains from real estate, and note that, consistent with our guidance, we booked no such gains in the first quarter. And sequentially, our adjusted OR improved by 180 basis points from the fourth quarter, which was notably better than our typical seasonality.   The single biggest driver of the year-over-year increase in our adjusted operating ratio was the higher cost of purchased transportation. Third-party linehaul miles as a proportion of total linehaul miles increased in the quarter to 24.5% from 23.9% a year ago. This aligned with our plan to use more third-party linehaul in the near term as volume recovered prior to our onboarding new capacity.   In addition, most of our purchased transportation is subject to contractual pricing. Headwinds from this pricing are starting to abate as we cycle big truckload price increases from a year ago, and as new linehaul contracts cycle in.   Those are the highlights for North American LTL.   In our brokerage and other services segment, we grew revenue by 17% to a record $2.4 billion and adjusted EBITDA by 31% to a record $164 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin for this segment expanded by 60 basis points to 6.7% from 6.1% a year ago.   The largest revenue and profit driver in this segment is our North American truck brokerage business, which had another outstanding quarter. This will be the core business of our planned spin-off later this year.   We increased our brokerage loads per day by 23% versus a year ago and up 52% from 2 years ago. First quarter truck brokerage revenue rose 38% year-over-year. Margin dollars rose 21% against another tough comp and nearly tripled from the first quarter of 2020. On a sequential basis, margin dollars in the first quarter were 5% higher than in Q4.   Our truck brokerage growth reflects our strong execution in a dynamic market. Drew will speak more about the specific drivers in a minute.   Organic revenue in Europe grew 5%, accelerating by 2 percentage points from the fourth quarter. We saw acceleration in organic revenue growth in both the U.K. and in France, our two largest European geographies, and we\u2019re pleased with our resilience in the context of uncertainty in the European environment. We expect to continue to build on our position as a leading provider of truck brokerage and LTL in the U.K., France and Iberia within our broader pan-European platform.   We\u2019re grateful for some external recognition we received during the quarter. General Motors named us Supplier of the Year for the fourth straight year. In addition, we were recently given VETS Indexes employer status for our strong record of hiring members of the military community.   Last week, we published our fourth annual sustainability report, which details our progress on ESG initiatives and our materiality index for 2021. You can download this report online.   Finally, I want to mention that we plan to hold separate investor events later this year for both our brokerage SpinCo and our LTL RemainCo prior to completing the spin. We\u2019ll use those events to give you a deep dive into our longer-term vision and key financial targets for each stand-alone company.   Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Mario for his comments on North American LTL.  \nMario Harik:   Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. As Brad said, LTL is a very different business than it was 6 months ago. Our network is much more fluid and balanced. We\u2019re realizing significantly stronger service metrics in key areas such as on-site transit and freight handling. The sharp rebound has brought our network efficiency back to pre-pandemic levels.   Our investments in capacity are on track, and we\u2019re rolling out new, proprietary technology to improve pricing and drive further productivity. Most importantly, there is widespread excitement across the LTL team around the many new initiatives we\u2019ve launched to optimize the network.   I\u2019ll give you an example. This month, we kicked off a national initiative to further improve the quality of our trailer loading and on-time delivery. We\u2019re also engaging with customers on best practices in how they package their freight. When we announced this initiative, it triggered a tidal wave of enthusiasm in the field. In just a few weeks, we\u2019ve seen great momentum building in the organization.   Our goal is to create a world-class LTL carrier that delights our customers and our investors. It won\u2019t happen tomorrow, but the commitment is there, and we\u2019re already moving in that direction. I wanted to give you the backdrop first because the transformation we\u2019re undertaking in LTL helped us beat our guide for adjusted operating ratio in the first quarter.   In February, we guided to 200 basis points of year-over-year degradation, reflecting our continuous progress in moving the operating ratio back toward year-over-year improvement. In reality, we did better than the guide. Our Q1 degradation was just 140 basis points. This gave us an adjusted operating ratio ex real estate of 85.7% for the quarter. We expect to inflect to year-over-year improvement in adjusted operating ratio at some point later this quarter, as we said we would. And we\u2019re on target for a year-over-year improvement of more than 100 basis points in adjusted operating ratio ex real estate for the full year.   We plan to drive hundreds of additional basis points of OR improvement in the coming years to get the ratio well into the 70s. And importantly, the underlying trends are favorable. We reported record first quarter revenue of $1.1 billion, which is 15% higher than last year. Our year-over-year yield improvement was a first quarter record at 9%. Tonnage was down slightly year-over-year within the rates we told you to expect.   When you look one step deeper, the sequential trends are also positive. Growth in revenue per shipment accelerated every month in the quarter. Our yield also accelerated throughout the quarter with the strongest gains coming in March. We\u2019re operating in a very robust pricing environment.   Our tonnage in the quarter was up 4% sequentially, which is better than typical seasonality. Usually, our tonnage is flat from Q4 to Q1.   And as I mentioned, the momentum in our operating ratio is building ahead of plan. We expect our second quarter adjusted operating ratio to improve by more than 400 basis points from Q1 to Q2. So the business is very much on track.   Now I want to cover some of the first quarter actions we took to expand our capacity and deploy technology. These are the two main areas where we\u2019re investing in growth.   We recently opened new terminals in California and Georgia. These sites bring our net new doors to 345 since October, against a target of 900 net new doors added by year-end 2023. So we\u2019re more than 1/3 of the way there.   The San Bernardino terminal will serve growing demand from manufacturing and retail in Southern California. And the Atlanta terminal expands our capacity in one of the largest LTL regions in the South. It also gives us a larger gateway into Florida. These 2 sites will be growth levers for us in 2023 and going forward.   We\u2019re also making great progress in expanding our fleet of trailers. In the first quarter, our manufacturing facility in Arkansas produced more trailers than any other quarter in our history. We also opened new fleet maintenance shops in Florida, Ohio, Nevada and New York, which will help us manage maintenance costs. We continue to budget for growth CapEx at 8% to 9% of revenue this year. And, again, we\u2019re on plan.   On the technology front, recent developments include the ongoing application of our proprietary pricing platform, which is driven by advanced automated analytics around customer shipment data. This means our pricing experts are now able to focus more time on analyzing account performance, and we can negotiate with better results. In Q1, our price increases on contract renewals accelerated to 11%.   In April, we brought on board David Phalen as Senior Vice President of Pricing for LTL. David\u2019s career includes decades of success in optimizing pricing for transportation sectors, including the airline industry, where he specialized in pricing and yield management.   In other developments, we launched automated billing for accessorials to make sure we capture those revenue dollars. And we rolled out a new digital dashboard with self-service tools to enhance the customer experience. This quarter, we\u2019ll be introducing proprietary cost models to enhance visibility into cost management levers as well as new piece-level tracking functionality for our network.   So to sum it up, our comprehensive growth and optimization strategy for LTL comes down to one goal: we\u2019re creating a world-class LTL carrier. And we have every confidence that we\u2019ll succeed at this goal, just as we succeeded in dramatically increasing LTL returns over the first 6 years we owned the business.   We continue to expect to generate at least $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA in LTL in 2022. This is nearly triple the adjusted EBITDA generated by the LTL network in 2015, when we acquired it from Con-way. What you\u2019re seeing from us in 2022 is that we\u2019re full steam ahead, laser focused on efficiency and superb customer service. And our momentum will continue to grow, because we have the support of our people, who are some of the best LTL operators in the industry.   Now Drew will cover truck brokerage. Drew?  \nDrew Wilkerson:   Thanks, Mario.   North American truck brokerage had another very strong quarter. We continue to do what we do best, outpace the industry on volume growth, operate at a strong margin and use our experience and technology to make sure our customers\u2019 freight gets where it needs to be.   In the first quarter, our loads were up year-over-year by 23%, driving a 38% increase in revenue. It was our sixth consecutive quarter of load growth over 20%. And margin dollars were up year-over-year by 21%. That\u2019s more than double the increase in the fourth quarter. Gross margin per load increased sequentially from the fourth quarter, and our margin percentage was a very healthy 16%.   So a strong start of the year, and we continued with the same strong trends in April with both volume and margin percentage. We built our model as a growth engine that\u2019s working exactly as we intended.   There are five compelling advantages specific to our platform. First, 68% of our business is contract based, and about 75% of that contract revenue is locked up on an annual basis. This gives us good visibility into the future revenue performance.   Second, we have many long-term customer relationships with blue-chip market leaders across diverse verticals. These customers think of us as a strategic partner. Our top 10 brokerage customers have an average tenure with us of 15 years, and our top 20 customers have a tenure of 13 years.   Third, we\u2019re continuing to expand our pool of independent carriers who provide our customers with truck capacity. This massive capacity is at the heart of our value proposition. As of March, we have relationships with 88,000 carriers in North America and access to more than 1.5 million trucks.   Fourth is our XPO Connect technology, which continues to attract customers and carriers to our business. Our first-mover advantage with brokerage technology is one of the main drivers behind our rapid growth.   XPO Connect lets us capitalize on two interrelated secular trends that work in our favor. More shippers are outsourcing truckload transportation to brokers, and increasingly, these shippers want digital brokerage capabilities. At the same time, more carriers are realizing that we can give them access to thousands of loads on a daily basis.   Carriers and customers love to do business with us because we have a state-of-the-art digital platform. In the first quarter, the number of registered carriers on XPO Connect year-over-year was up 39%, registered customers were up 41% and weekly carrier usage was up 59%. We also surpassed 700,000 cumulative downloads of our mobile app. And 74% of our loads were created or covered digitally in the quarter, which is up 4 points sequentially. That number is already trending higher in the second quarter.   The fifth compelling advantage is our exceptional truck brokerage management team, all of whom will be joining the spin-off. It\u2019s a privilege to work with these great operators and technologists since the early days of XPO. Together, we\u2019ve built a best-in-class brokerage platform that delivers outsized results and puts us in a strong position to spin off as a pure play. As a new company, we\u2019ll manage about $7.5 billion of transportation spend and continue to innovate the business to grow it from there.   From day 1, it will be easier for investors to appreciate our flexible, asset-light business model, our economic resilience and our very high return on invested capital. We\u2019re excited to take this business to the next level as a separate public company when the spin-off is complete.   With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to the operator, and we\u2019ll go to Q&A.   Question-and-Answer Session  \nOperator:   [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.  \nQ - Kenneth Scott Hoexter:\n : Brad and team, nice job on the quarter and outlook. And Drew, congrats.   So if I can start out, Brad. You made some comments during the quarter. You noted some weakness in the trucking market. Matt, you noted that some of the linehaul contracts are cycling in at a lower rate. So I just want to understand, are you seeing contract rates down already? And I guess how does that contrast with your target for hundreds of basis points going forward in LTL margin? Is that more, then, on the cost side? Or is that still on the pricing strength in the industry to continue?  \nA - Mario Harik:\n : Yes, I\u2019ll take this on the linehaul contractual rates. So, we just completed our yearly bid for our third-party linehaul, where we outsource linehaul miles to third parties. Here last week is when we had the new rates come in. And contractual rates have actually gone up slightly versus where they used to be, but nowhere near on the level of increases that we\u2019ve seen, obviously, last year and through Q1, as well, on a year-on-year basis. So, rates are moderating, but the contractual rates are still up. And it was a competitive bid, obviously, across multiple carriers there. But this is what we\u2019re seeing on the linehaul outsourcing side with LTL.  \nQ - Kenneth Scott Hoexter:\n : And your thoughts on the LTL margin then. Is that due to pricing gains solely that \u2013 when you talk about hundreds of basis points going forward?  \nA - Mario Harik:\n : Yes. When we look at the OR improvement in LTL, looking at the second quarter and moving forward, it\u2019s really driven by three categories. One is pricing, one is volume, and one is operational excellence and costs.   On the pricing side, we continue to see very robust pricing. So we ended the first quarter with a full year improvement of 9% year-on-year. And heading into the second quarter, here, we crossed into double-digit territory.   On the volume side, for the second quarter, we expect to be down low- to mid-single digit and then accelerate in the back half of the year.   And then finally on the cost side, the third component is around the cost headwinds last year, such as purchased transportation, would end up being a much lower headwind as we head through the year and starting here with the second quarter in the month of May.   And also, our network is much more efficient. So now that our network fluidity has improved substantially, also overall our cost footprint is down, which leads to the OR improvement of more than 400 basis points in the second quarter.  \nOperator:   Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research.  \nQ - Scott Group:\n : Can you talk about the contractual pricing environment in LTL? And I think last quarter, you talked about the potential for another LTL GRI. If you can give an update there.   And then just separately, Brad, can you give any update on the process in Europe? And does the macro environment in Europe put this at risk or timing of this at risk at all?  \nA - Brad Jacobs:\n : I\u2019ll start with the last part, Scott. The European process is going well. It\u2019s a vibrant process. And to date, the Russia-Ukraine thing has not affected it.  \nA - Mario Harik:\n : And Scott, on the pricing environment in LTL, it continues to be very strong. When we look at the first quarter for us, we \u2013 our contract renewals accelerated to 11%, and our yield in the second quarter accelerated from 9% in the first quarter and crossed double digits so far quarter to date. So, it remains a very strong environment.  \nQ - Scott Group:\n : Brad, do you think that at this point, a sale or a separate listing is more likely?  \nA - Brad Jacobs:   I think a sale is.  \nOperator:   Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup.  \nQ - Christian Wetherbee:\n : Sticking on LTL, I was wondering, could you give us a little sense of sort of maybe the volume progression and how maybe things are looking in April? I know you\u2019re looking for, I think, low single-digit tonnage decline in the second quarter. I just want to get a sense of how April was trending.   And then, Mario, maybe a little bit bigger picture. When you think about where you are in terms of cost takeout \u2013 so we\u2019ve gone through some contracting on the truckload linehaul side. I think you\u2019ve been trying to improve network efficiency. I think you actually set it back to where it was before you had issues. So I want to get a sense of sort of when we can start to expect that to generate positive margin progression from here. Still the guidance is good from a sequential standpoint, and I know you\u2019re guiding for the back half to improve. I just want to get a sense of maybe what the costs that are still needed to be wrung out of the system are and how we should think about that happening over the rest of the year.  \nA - Mario Harik:\n : Thanks, Chris. So first of all, Q2 tonnage. So we expect the tonnage to be down low to mid-single digits, as I just mentioned. And April was within that range. And \u2013 however, when it comes to revenue, when we look so far in April, our revenue growth per day in the month of April has accelerated versus the Q1 revenue growth per day.   Now when we look at the tonnage momentum as a whole, we still expect tonnage momentum to build through the course of the year, because we have great sales momentum and the team is very energized. That team has driven, here in the month of April, the best win rate we\u2019ve had in sales over the past 4 years. We have dozens of multimillion-dollar opportunities that have either closed in the month of April or early May or are about to close in the month of May \u2013 including a new top 10 customer. So when we think about the momentum building through the course of the year, we expect to build that momentum in the back half.   And on the balance, it\u2019s still a very healthy environment, we expect \u2013 and that\u2019s why we expect more than 400 basis points of OR improvement from Q1 going into Q2, and a full year of at least 100 basis points of OR improvement.   Now when we look at the cost side of it, so obviously a big component of our cost is purchased transportation, and these costs will be \u2013 are starting to normalize now as we finalized the bid for linehaul this past week, and the new rates are into effect. So that\u2019s going to be an improvement in the back half of the year.   Similarly, when you think about our dock costs or our P&D costs, when we\u2019re running a much more efficient network, a lot of these metrics are trending up into the right in terms of higher efficiency of dock labor and P&D labor as well.   So when we head into the back half of the year, these would be some \u2013 and also reducing rehandling costs as well. And all of these would lead to the back half of the year having a lot of these cost pressures abate on a year-on-year basis. Now obviously, there\u2019s still inflationary costs with wages and other portions. But all of these would \u2013 again, the pressure on cost is going to abate in the back half.  \nQ - Christian Wetherbee:\n : That\u2019s helpful. One point of clarification on the purchase trans. When you\u2019re thinking about these contract renewals, those contracts are renewing at higher levels, correct? So the costs are higher going forward? Or were you just \u2013 it\u2019ll actually be net lower because you\u2019re just relying less on the spot market? I just want to make sure I understand how that plays out.  \nA - Matthew Jeremy Fassler:\n : The costs are a little bit higher, but the increases are abating as we go through the year. We had big increases in Q1. Those increases diminish as we go through the year. Consequently, the headwind from PT diminishes and flips to a favorable factor for OR as you move to the back half.  \nOperator:   Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.  \nQ - Brandon Robert Oglenski:\n : So I don\u2019t mean to belabor this point, but with the volume trends down low-single to mid-single digits this quarter, do you think that\u2019s where the market is? And have you guys fully recovered from a service perspective with your customers? And I guess longer term, I think in the release and you guys have talked about this before, you\u2019re going to have like 6% or 7% door growth in the network between now and next year. Do you think that\u2019s coming on at the right time?  \nA - Mario Harik:\n : Yes. Let me try to cover all of them. So why \u2013 the first one is on tonnage. So it\u2019s fair to say that there are crosswinds in the freight environment.   Now I\u2019ll tell you, we frequently engage with a group of salespeople in the company and we get their feedback on what\u2019s happening, what feedback they\u2019re hearing from customers. And we just had the last review here yesterday. And we\u2019re still hearing a lot of optimism about demand from customers. But we\u2019re also hearing that the lockdowns in China limited some of the inflows of goods into the country. And some of the shortages, either the chip shortages or the raw material shortages, are also impacting some of our industrial customers. Now we feel overall as these dynamics abate, and they will, these will become natural tailwinds for us in the back half of the year.   And as I mentioned earlier, what we\u2019re excited about is our momentum from a sales perspective, where we have an energized sales team that is driving great results as we head into the back half.   And now in terms of the adding capacity in the door plan, so obviously we don\u2019t look at adding doors as being a short-term lever. LTL is a very attractive industry that has great vitality through the cycles. Today, we\u2019re a top 3 pure-play provider when the spin is completed. And our company-wide ROIC is 38%, and LTL has a higher ROIC than that. So when we think about adding doors, equipment and headcount, it\u2019s supporting the long-term vision of the network, where we are going to gain market share and get back to growing our top line, both from a volume perspective and obviously from capitalizing on the yields as well as the industry.  \nOperator:   Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS.  \nQ - Michael Paul DiMattia:\n : This is Michael DiMattia for Tom. You mentioned that new contract renewals were up 11% in the quarter, which was greater than the revenue per hundredweight growth ex fuel. Does that imply that you expect yields to improve or accelerate in the second quarter? And also, how should we think about new contract wins impacting tonnage per day going forward?  \nA - Matthew Jeremy Fassler:\n : I\u2019ll take the first part of that. First of all, I think I alluded to this in my prepared remarks. We saw weight per day \u2013 or rather, weight per shipment move higher and length of haul growth moderate a bit. So that dampened reported yields a bit relative to underlying pricing trends. We are currently tracking double digits in yield quarter-to-date. So you\u2019re seeing our yield track much closer to price increases on contract renewals. And Mario will take the second part on new contracts.  \nA - Mario Harik:\n : Yes. Based on what we\u2019re getting from customers, it continues to be a very robust pricing environment. If you think of our industry, you have the top 10 players in the business that today manage roughly 76% of the $51 billion LTL industry. And when you think about those dynamics, the pricing environment is still firm in LTL. And as I said earlier, from a sales perspective, we just landed a top 10 customer, and we continue to have great momentum in terms of opportunities in the pipeline as well. And pricing continues to be robust.  \nOperator:   Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Chappell with Evercore ISI.  \nQ - Jonathan Chappell:\n : If we look at the guidance that you gave for the enterprise as a whole and then LTL and try to back into what that means for brokerage and other, there\u2019s obviously a deceleration from the first quarter on the adjusted EBITDA. Clearly, most of that is intermodal. But as you\u2019re thinking about the margin for the brokerage and other business overall, what was the impact that the pro forma intermodal is going to have? Is that margin going to go down tens of basis points more substantially? And how should we think about that run rate EBITDA going forward?  \nA - Matthew Jeremy Fassler:   It\u2019s Matt. I\u2019ll speak about the impact that the divestiture of intermodal had on our guidance for the second \u2013 for the rest of the year. And hopefully, that will help you get an answer to your question..   So if you look at the delta from the guidance that we issued at the end of the fourth quarter entering the year and the guidance that we just gave you today, we had about $60 million of adjusted EBITDA modeled for intermodal for quarters 2 through 4. That\u2019s obviously out. The guidance change reflects that coming out plus the first quarter beat, which versus the midpoint of the range was about at $38 million, and at the midpoint about $12 million of additional EBITDA. So, an intrinsic raise for the rest of the business for quarters 2 through 4. Obviously, the increase in EPS range reflects all those factors as well as the lower interest expense, reflecting the debt paydown from the proceeds of the intermodal transaction.  \nQ - Jonathan Chappell:   That\u2019s helpful, Matt. And obviously, intermodal is a better-margin business. But, I mean, is there any just guide you can give at all, 20, 50, 70 basis points, what that may mean to the pro forma adjusted operating ratio in brokerage going forward? Or is it too early to say?  \nA - Matthew Jeremy Fassler:\n : I don\u2019t think the difference between intermodal and the rest of the business in terms of adjusted EBITDA margin is sufficiently different to really move the needle for segment-level margins.  \nOperator:   Our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.  \nQ - Allison Ann Marie Poliniak-Cusic:\n : Mario, you continue to highlight the technology around pricing, and I think the accessorial charges you mentioned. Is there a way to disaggregate for us the contribution of what those \u2013 I would say, these pricing tools have given to you this quarter?   And then second, with brokerage, you highlighted market share gains, and it\u2019s been a consistent story there. Is there any way to think about how you\u2019re viewing market share gains in the context of your growth expectations for this year?  \nA - Mario Harik:\n : Thanks, Allison. I\u2019ll talk on the pricing platform.   So we\u2019re very excited about the new pricing platform we launched in Q1 with continuous enhancements through the course of the year, because it\u2019s driven by advanced analytics and it allows us \u2013 around customer shipment data. So we analyze customer data more efficiently. And it really helps our pricing experts. It reduces manual tasks and manual data processing by as much as 80%, where it enables the pricing experts to spend more time negotiating with the customer and supporting our sales team to do so. It also enables us to analyze RFP data, of RFPs we submitted in the past, which feed into lead generation tools.   Similarly, we\u2019re also \u2013 this coming quarter, we\u2019re launching new capabilities with a proprietary costing model that allows us to improve how we look at costing in our network across the board. And we also improved dynamic pricing, where we can adjust pricing based on market conditions and customer demand as well.   Now when you look at the overall results, obviously we accelerated our yield from 9% in the first quarter to double digits. We crossed the double-digit mark in the second quarter, with 11% contract renewals in the first quarter. Now it\u2019s tough to be able to get to how much of that was the work that the technology is doing versus the people are doing, but technology is definitely having a big contribution as part of that.  \nA - Drew Wilkerson:   This is Drew. On the second part of your question, we\u2019re in the early innings of continuing to go out and take market share within our truck brokerage team. Obviously, we\u2019ve grown volume by 20% for 6 consecutive quarters. So overall, this is \u2013 the trucking industry is a $400 billion for-hire trucking market. Of that, brokers have about $88 billion. And we\u2019re \u2013 our brokerage is roughly $3 billion. So when you look at it, we\u2019ve only got about 3% share of the market. Our technology has given us first-mover advantage and is allowing us to continue to go out and take share.  \nOperator:   Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.  \nQ - Scott Andrew Schneeberger:\n : First one is kind of a two-parter for you, Drew, and congratulations on the announcement on your new role.   In truck brokerage, on \u2013 where would you say are we in the truck brokerage cycle from what you\u2019ve seen in the past and where you feel we are right now? And then the follow-up there is, you\u2019ve seen great penetration on digitally covered orders, up 74% from 70% last quarter. How high do we anticipate that to go? And any thought on what type of financial contribution a 1,000-basis-point move actually contributes?  \nA - Drew Wilkerson:   Yes. So thank you for the question.   So on the cycle, you look at it right now and rates are up on a year-over-year basis overall. As we start heading into the back half of the year, there are a few indicators that show you that capacity could actually tighten as the year goes on. First, you\u2019ve got beverage season, which is coming in, and that\u2019s going to create about 100, 120 days where your major beverage distributors pick up their volume during that time. You also have DOT checkpoint week that comes in over the summer, which typically causes a little bit of chaos in the market. And the third thing is you have a lot of built-up demand that\u2019s sitting in the ports of China that\u2019s going to come over and hit the U.S. ports. So all of that tells you that it could tighten up a little bit as we head into the back half of the year.   On our digital orders, it\u2019s something that you\u2019re going to continue to see go up into the right. I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s a limit to what we can do. Obviously, we\u2019ve invested in technology from day 1. It\u2019s been an 11-year investment for us, and it\u2019s something that has allowed us to become sticky with both the customers and the carriers that we\u2019re working with. So we expect that to continue to go. And it\u2019s one of the things that \u2013 our technology, as you hit on, is one of the things that allows us to come in and have best-in-class EBITDA margins, and we\u2019ll continue to see gains off of that.  \nQ - Scott Andrew Schneeberger:   Great. Appreciate that. And then Brad, as the founder and largest shareholder, you had in April another transaction in the shares. Could you just update us and remind us kind of your strategy with regard to your ownership in the company going forward?  \nA - Brad Jacobs:\n : Well, we discussed my 10b5-1 plan at length in the last earnings call. I don\u2019t have anything more to add to that.   In terms of my future with the company, I do plan to be with XPO for a very long time. I\u2019m non-Executive Chairman of GXO. I\u2019ll be non-Executive Chairman of the new spin. I\u2019d like to remain Executive Chairman of XPO for as long as investors will have me. And I\u2019ll remain CEO until someone comes along who I think is better than me.  \nOperator:  \nQ - Bascome Majors:\n :  with Susquehanna.  \nQ - Bascome Majors:\n : Brad, can you update us on the LTL President search as kind of a corollary to the last question there? And where do you stand? What\u2019s the time line look like? And what\u2019s the balance of internal versus external candidates that you\u2019re still looking at?  \nA - Brad Jacobs:   Well, our search and the management lineup is still ongoing. We don\u2019t have anything new to add to that.   In terms of timing, as soon as it makes sense. We\u2019re not going to rush it. We\u2019re not going to delay it. As soon as it make sense, then we\u2019ll do it.   In terms of the other question you had about internal versus external, we\u2019re considering all possibilities. So long story short, we\u2019re staying flexible, as we always are.  \nOperator:   Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Kuhn with Benchmark Company.  \nQ - Christopher Glen Kuhn:\n : I just was \u2013 you mentioned digital orders are going up and to the right, and I was just wondering what the margin profile of that will be as the price transparency gets better and better.  \nA - Drew Wilkerson:   Thanks for the question, Christopher. Our digital orders trend in line with our overall orders as far as margin percentage goes. It does allow us to leverage the SG&A leverage, though, Christopher. So the EBITDA margins can be higher.  \nQ - Christopher Glen Kuhn:\n : Right, right. So is it possible that the gross margins could trend down, but EBITDA could be higher as you leverage flows over employees or revenue over fewer employees?  \nA - Drew Wilkerson:\n : Yes, that\u2019s absolutely possible.  \nOperator:   Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan.  \nQ - Brian Patrick Ossenbeck:\n : So maybe a two-parter for you, Drew. Can you just talk about, big picture, what else do you think you\u2019ll be investing in or focused on as a separate entity? And maybe the answer is just more of the same, but I would still like to hear your thoughts on that and how you\u2019re thinking of that going forward.   And then just secondarily on the headcount side, can you just give us a sense in terms of what\u2019s the headcount you\u2019re bringing on the system, how much you have in the pipeline to kind of hit those load growth targets that you\u2019ve been generating here in the last couple of quarters?  \nA - Drew Wilkerson:   Yes, absolutely. Thank you for the question. On big picture, we\u2019ve got a model that is proven as working. So we want to continue to execute the model. It has allowed us to go out and to grow volume by over 20% for the last 6 quarters, and it\u2019s allowed us for the last 8 years to outperform the industry revenue growth by more than 3x. So we\u2019re going to continue to execute on the model.   But there\u2019s three things that I\u2019m focused on right now. The first is continuing to build out an exceptional management team that complements the great operators and technologists that we have in the business.   The second piece is to go out and continue to delight our customers and service our customers extremely well and go out and continue to outperform and take market share.   And the third is to continue to evolve XPO Connect. Our goal for XPO Connect is to have that to be the go-to tool for shippers as they are using that to make their transportation decisions, whether it\u2019s what mode of transportation that they\u2019re using, whether it\u2019s what day of the week they\u2019re shipping something or if they should consolidate something. We want that to be their go-to tool.   On the third \u2013 on your last point on headcount, we are continuing to add headcount as we go forward. And as you look at it, over a 5-year trend, volume still significantly outpaces head count that we\u2019ve added.  \nQ - Brian Patrick Ossenbeck:\n : And on the point on XPO Connect, just to follow up there real quick, is there anything you\u2019re thinking of adding that\u2019s more step change in terms of capabilities? Or are you just adding more \u2013 a little bit more bells and whistles or a little more functionality rather in terms of what you\u2019re rolling out in the next couple of quarters and years?  \nA - Drew Wilkerson:\n : We\u2019re constantly adding the bells and whistles. That\u2019s something that we continue to do. We do that on a biweekly basis. And we\u2019re excited to share more with you as we get closer to the Investor Day and the spinoff.  \nOperator:   Our next question comes from the line of Bruce Chan with Stifel.  \nQ - Bruce Chan:\n : This might go to Brad. There\u2019s just been a \u2013 there\u2019s been a lot of talk about consumer-to-services rotation in the space. Some peers have been saying they probably already happened. When you look across your book of business across your business lines, and especially we\u2019re talking about like final mile here, do you see evidence that, that shift is already taking place or is occurring right now?  \nA - Matthew Jeremy Fassler:   If you think about the consumer to services, obviously we\u2019re in the goods business, so we\u2019re moving both consumer goods and industrial goods. Obviously, the industrial economy is still on its way back. Mario spoke about the opportunity for loosening of supply chains to \u2013 as we see more raw goods and unfinished goods make their way into the \u2013 make their way into our customer supply chains. You\u2019re going to see better revenue momentum from industrial customers, and there have been signs of that continuously in LTL.   The consumer has obviously had a couple of very good years. Consumer has very strong balance sheet and is in very strong shape.   And if you think about our brokerage business, where load growth was up 23%, consumer customers \u2013 or rather consumer companies comprise the majority of our customer base and revenue in that business. So that\u2019s some indication of what we\u2019re seeing from the consumer.  \nQ - Bruce Chan:\n : Got you. I guess my only follow-up there would be, does \u2013 the way the economy is shaking out right now, does \u2013 is any of the current demand, the current cycle change, how you think about the spin when you\u2019re going to talk at the brokerage on the consumer side, industrial on the LTL side, do \u2013 the spin was announced a little while ago, does anything in the current environment change how you guys as a management team think about how you move forward?  \nA - Brad Jacobs:\n : Not really, no. We\u2019re going full speed ahead with the spin because regardless of what happens in the macro or in economy, the rationale for the spin still stands. The rationale for the spin is, when we have separate companies that are pure-plays and the management team is focused on one thing and one thing alone, they\u2019re going to do better. They\u2019re just going to do a better job. They\u2019ll be more focused, they\u2019ll be more fit for purpose.   And from an investor point of view, investors will be able to evaluate those companies on a stand-alone basis and a more comparable basis to the peers, and there\u2019ll be a wider universe of investors who only want an LTL company or only want a truck brokerage company. So no, we\u2019re going full speed ahead on the spin.   End of Q&A  \nOperator:   Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn this call back over to Brad Jacobs for closing remarks.  \nBrad Jacobs:\n : well, thank you, operator. And I\u2019d like to leave everyone with the following points.   Number one, we\u2019re executing on multiple avenues to create outsized shareholder value. In LTL, we\u2019re ahead of plan and we have enormous momentum. If you look at April, the growth in revenue per day in April exceeds the first quarter\u2019s growth.   Year-over-year OR comparisons should flip favorable in the back half of Q2, and we firmly expect to generate more than 100 basis points of improvement in OR for the full year.   In truck brokerage, we continue to perform at best-in-class levels. In the first quarter, we grew loads on a year-over-year basis at 23%. And April was our best month ever for margin dollars in truck brokerage. And we expect to continue to significantly outperform the market.   On the balance sheet side, I\u2019m very pleased that we brought leverage down from 2.7 to 2.0 in the first quarter, and we remain on track to reduce leverage below 2x by the end of this year, which is ahead of plan.   On the spin, we\u2019re progressing nicely, and we expect to turn 1 great company to 2 great companies in the fourth quarter.   So with that, I\u2019d like to thank everyone. We look forward to seeing you at the upcoming conferences. Have a great day.  \nOperator:   This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. Enjoy the rest of your day.",

            "name": "Drew Wilkerson",
            "content": "Thanks, Mario.   North American truck brokerage had another very strong quarter. We continue to do what we do best, outpace the industry on volume growth, operate at a strong margin and use our experience and technology to make sure our customers' freight gets where it needs to be.   In the first quarter, our loads were up year-over-year by 23%, driving a 38% increase in revenue. It was our sixth consecutive quarter of load growth over 20%. And margin dollars were up year-over-year by 21%. That's more than double the increase in the fourth quarter. Gross margin per load increased sequentially from the fourth quarter, and our margin percentage was a very healthy 16%.   So a strong start of the year, and we continued with the same strong trends in April with both volume and margin percentage. We built our model as a growth engine that's working exactly as we intended.   There are five compelling advantages specific to our platform. First, 68% of our business is contract based, and about 75% of that contract revenue is locked up on an annual basis. This gives us good visibility into the future revenue performance.   Second, we have many long-term customer relationships with blue-chip market leaders across diverse verticals. These customers think of us as a strategic partner. Our top 10 brokerage customers have an average tenure with us of 15 years, and our top 20 customers have a tenure of 13 years.   Third, we're continuing to expand our pool of independent carriers who provide our customers with truck capacity. This massive capacity is at the heart of our value proposition. As of March, we have relationships with 88,000 carriers in North America and access to more than 1.5 million trucks.   Fourth is our XPO Connect technology, which continues to attract customers and carriers to our business. Our first-mover advantage with brokerage technology is one of the main drivers behind our rapid growth.   XPO Connect lets us capitalize on two interrelated secular trends that work in our favor. More shippers are outsourcing truckload transportation to brokers, and increasingly, these shippers want digital brokerage capabilities. At the same time, more carriers are realizing that we can give them access to thousands of loads on a daily basis.   Carriers and customers love to do business with us because we have a state-of-the-art digital platform. In the first quarter, the number of registered carriers on XPO Connect year-over-year was up 39%, registered customers were up 41% and weekly carrier usage was up 59%. We also surpassed 700,000 cumulative downloads of our mobile app. And 74% of our loads were created or covered digitally in the quarter, which is up 4 points sequentially. That number is already trending higher in the second quarter.   The fifth compelling advantage is our exceptional truck brokerage management team, all of whom will be joining the spin-off. It's a privilege to work with these great operators and technologists since the early days of XPO. Together, we've built a best-in-class brokerage platform that delivers outsized results and puts us in a strong position to spin off as a pure play. As a new company, we'll manage about $7.5 billion of transportation spend and continue to innovate the business to grow it from there.   From day 1, it will be easier for investors to appreciate our flexible, asset-light business model, our economic resilience and our very high return on invested capital. We're excited to take this business to the next level as a separate public company when the spin-off is complete.   With that, I'll turn it over to the operator, and we'll go to Q&A.

Here last week is when we had the new rates come in. And contractual rates have actually gone up slightly versus where they used to be, but nowhere near on the level of increases that we've seen, obviously, last year and through Q1, as well, on a year-on-year basis. So, rates are moderating, but the contractual rates are still up. And it was a competitive bid, obviously, across multiple carriers there. But this is what we're seeing on the linehaul outsourcing side with LTL. :Yes. When we look at the OR improvement in LTL, looking at the second quarter and moving forward, it's really driven by three categories. One is pricing, one is volume, and one is operational excellence and costs.   On the pricing side, we continue to see very robust pricing. So we ended the first quarter with a full year improvement of 9% year-on-year. And heading into the second quarter, here, we crossed into double-digit territory.   On the volume side, for the second quarter, we expect to be down low- to mid-single digit and then accelerate in the back half of the year.   And then finally on the cost side, the third component is around the cost headwinds last year, such as purchased transportation, would end up being a much lower headwind as we head through the year and starting here with the second quarter in the month of May.   And also, our network is much more efficient. So now that our network fluidity has improved substantially, also overall our cost footprint is down, which leads to the OR improvement of more than 400 basis points in the second quarter. :And Scott, on the pricing environment in LTL, it continues to be very strong. When we look at the first quarter for us, we \u2013 our contract renewals accelerated to 11%, and our yield in the second quarter accelerated from 9% in the first quarter and crossed double digits so far quarter to date. So, it remains a very strong environment. :Thanks, Chris. So first of all, Q2 tonnage. So we expect the tonnage to be down low to mid-single digits, as I just mentioned. And April was within that range. And \u2013 however, when it comes to revenue, when we look so far in April, our revenue growth per day in the month of April has accelerated versus the Q1 revenue growth per day.   Now when we look at the tonnage momentum as a whole, we still expect tonnage momentum to build through the course of the year, because we have great sales momentum and the team is very energized. That team has driven, here in the month of April, the best win rate we've had in sales over the past 4 years. We have dozens of multimillion-dollar opportunities that have either closed in the month of April or early May or are about to close in the month of May \u2013 including a new top 10 customer. So when we think about the momentum building through the course of the year, we expect to build that momentum in the back half.   And on the balance, it's still a very healthy environment, we expect \u2013 and that's why we expect more than 400 basis points of OR improvement from Q1 going into Q2, and a full year of at least 100 basis points of OR improvement.   Now when we look at the cost side of it, so obviously a big component of our cost is purchased transportation, and these costs will be \u2013 are starting to normalize now as we finalized the bid for linehaul this past week, and the new rates are into effect. So that's going to be an improvement in the back half of the year.   Similarly, when you think about our dock costs or our P&D costs, when we're running a much more efficient network, a lot of these metrics are trending up into the right in terms of higher efficiency of dock labor and P&D labor as well.   So when we head into the back half of the year, these would be some \u2013 and also reducing rehandling costs as well. And all of these would lead to the back half of the year having a lot of these cost pressures abate on a year-on-year basis. Now obviously, there's still inflationary costs with wages and other portions. But all of these would \u2013 again, the pressure on cost is going to abate in the back half. :Yes. Let me try to cover all of them. So why \u2013 the first one is on tonnage. So it's fair to say that there are crosswinds in the freight environment.   Now I'll tell you, we frequently engage with a group of salespeople in the company and we get their feedback on what's happening, what feedback they're hearing from customers. And we just had the last review here yesterday. And we're still hearing a lot of optimism about demand from customers. But we're also hearing that the lockdowns in China limited some of the inflows of goods into the country. And some of the shortages, either the chip shortages or the raw material shortages, are also impacting some of our industrial customers. Now we feel overall as these dynamics abate, and they will, these will become natural tailwinds for us in the back half of the year.   And as I mentioned earlier, what we're excited about is our momentum from a sales perspective, where we have an energized sales team that is driving great results as we head into the back half.   And now in terms of the adding capacity in the door plan, so obviously we don't look at adding doors as being a short-term lever. LTL is a very attractive industry that has great vitality through the cycles. Today, we're a top 3 pure-play provider when the spin is completed. And our company-wide ROIC is 38%, and LTL has a higher ROIC than that. So when we think about adding doors, equipment and headcount, it's supporting the long-term vision of the network, where we are going to gain market share and get back to growing our top line, both from a volume perspective and obviously from capitalizing on the yields as well as the industry. :Yes. Based on what we're getting from customers, it continues to be a very robust pricing environment. If you think of our industry, you have the top 10 players in the business that today manage roughly 76% of the $51 billion LTL industry. And when you think about those dynamics, the pricing environment is still firm in LTL. And as I said earlier, from a sales perspective, we just landed a top 10 customer, and we continue to have great momentum in terms of opportunities in the pipeline as well. And pricing continues to be robust. :Thanks, Allison. I'll talk on the pricing platform.   So we're very excited about the new pricing platform we launched in Q1 with continuous enhancements through the course of the year, because it's driven by advanced analytics and it allows us \u2013 around customer shipment data. So we analyze customer data more efficiently. And it really helps our pricing experts. It reduces manual tasks and manual data processing by as much as 80%, where it enables the pricing experts to spend more time negotiating with the customer and supporting our sales team to do so. It also enables us to analyze RFP data, of RFPs we submitted in the past, which feed into lead generation tools.   Similarly, we're also \u2013 this coming quarter, we're launching new capabilities with a proprietary costing model that allows us to improve how we look at costing in our network across the board. And we also improved dynamic pricing, where we can adjust pricing based on market conditions and customer demand as well.   Now when you look at the overall results, obviously we accelerated our yield from 9% in the first quarter to double digits. We crossed the double-digit mark in the second quarter, with 11% contract renewals in the first quarter. Now it's tough to be able to get to how much of that was the work that the technology is doing versus the people are doing, but technology is definitely having a big contribution as part of that."

            "name": "Ravi Tulsyan",
            "content": "Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our first quarter results, our balance sheet and liquidity and our outlook for the balance of 2022.   For the first quarter, we delivered strong year-over-year growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS. Revenue in the quarter was a record $3.5 billion, up 16% year-over-year. The net impact of fuel prices and FX accounted for 2 points. Organic revenue growth for the quarter was 14%.   We grew adjusted EBITDA by 15% to a Q1 record of $321 million. Adjusting for gains from real estate sales, the year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA was 25%. This reflects particularly strong growth in our brokerage and other services segment. Looking at a 2-year stack, adjusted EBITDA was up 55%.   For the quarter, our adjusted EBITDA margin was 9.2%. Excluding gains from real estate sales, this was an improvement of 60 basis points year-over-year.   Operating conditions in the quarter were favorable, and the pricing environment stayed firm. This was partially offset by inflationary pressures on labor and purchased transportation.   Corporate costs in the quarter were down 19% year-over-year as we continue to optimize our corporate cost structure following the spin-off of GXO.   Our interest expense during the quarter was $37 million compared to $65 million in the year-ago period. This reflects the paydown of approximately $3 billion of debt last year.   The effective tax rate for adjusted EPS during the quarter was 23%.   Our adjusted earnings per diluted share for the quarter was $1.25, which was up from $0.79 a year ago, an increase of 58%. This increase was primarily driven by higher adjusted EBITDA and lower interest expense.   We generated $200 million of cash flow from continuing operations, spent $137 million on growth CapEx and received $3 million of proceeds from asset sales. Growth CapEx was up $63 million year-over-year with the majority of the additional spend going towards equipment purchases for the North American LTL business. As a result, our free cash flow was $66 million, which was above our expectation. This includes the impact of $15 million of cash outflows related to transaction costs that were not contemplated in our free cash flow guidance.   We are making significant progress on our strategy to create 2 pure-play transportation powerhouses, and we remain on track to complete the spin-off of our tech-enabled brokerage platform in Q4 of this year. As part of our strategic plan, we took an important step last quarter when we completed the sale of our intermodal business for cash proceeds of $710 million, which represented a multiple of approximately 10x 2021 EBITDA.   Including the proceeds from the sale of the intermodal business, we ended the quarter with $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet. This cash, combined with available debt capacity under committed borrowing facilities, give us $2 billion of liquidity at quarter end.   We had no borrowings outstanding under our ABL facility. After quarter end, we repaid $630 million of 2025 notes. This was another significant step in our plan to reduce our debt and deleverage our balance sheet.   Our net leverage at quarter end was 2x adjusted EBITDA. We are ahead of schedule on our deleveraging plan, and we now expect to be below 2x leverage before year-end.   In light of our strong first quarter results and ongoing earnings visibility, we updated our full year guidance after market close yesterday. Our new full year guidance for adjusted EBITDA is $1.35 billion to $1.39 billion. The update reflects our first quarter outperformance, the sale of the intermodal business and our strong outlook for the remainder of the year. The real estate assumptions we gave you in February remain the same.   For the second quarter, we expect our adjusted EBITDA to be $360 million to $370 million. Pro forma for the intermodal sale, the midpoint of our second quarter EBITDA guidance implies a year-over-year growth rate of 15%.   We have raised our outlook for full year adjusted EPS to a range of $5.20 to $5.60. This increase reflects our new EBITDA guidance and the reduction in interest expense resulting from our paydown of debt. The midpoint of our adjusted EPS guide implies year-over-year growth of 26%.   On the cash flow front, our outlook for full year free cash flow remains $400 million to $450 million. As a reminder, our outlook excludes all transaction-related cash outflows.   Our full year guidance for depreciation and amortization expense is approximately $385 million, down from $400 million, reflecting the sale of the intermodal business.   We expect interest expense of $150 million to $160 million, down from $170 million to $180 million previously.   There is no change to our previous guidance for CapEx and the tax rate.   In conclusion, we are continuing to execute on our strategic plan, and we remain excited about our prospects for the balance of 2022.   I will now turn things over to Matt."

            "name": "A - Drew Wilkerson",
            "content": "This is Drew. On the second part of your question, we're in the early innings of continuing to go out and take market share within our truck brokerage team. Obviously, we've grown volume by 20% for 6 consecutive quarters. So overall, this is \u2013 the trucking industry is a $400 billion for-hire trucking market. Of that, brokers have about $88 billion. And we're \u2013 our brokerage is roughly $3 billion. So when you look at it, we've only got about 3% share of the market. Our technology has given us first-mover advantage and is allowing us to continue to go out and take share. Yes. So thank you for the question.   So on the cycle, you look at it right now and rates are up on a year-over-year basis overall. As we start heading into the back half of the year, there are a few indicators that show you that capacity could actually tighten as the year goes on. First, you've got beverage season, which is coming in, and that's going to create about 100, 120 days where your major beverage distributors pick up their volume during that time. You also have DOT checkpoint week that comes in over the summer, which typically causes a little bit of chaos in the market. And the third thing is you have a lot of built-up demand that's sitting in the ports of China that's going to come over and hit the U.S. ports. So all of that tells you that it could tighten up a little bit as we head into the back half of the year.   On our digital orders, it's something that you're going to continue to see go up into the right. I don't think that there's a limit to what we can do. Obviously, we've invested in technology from day 1. It's been an 11-year investment for us, and it's something that has allowed us to become sticky with both the customers and the carriers that we're working with. So we expect that to continue to go. And it's one of the things that \u2013 our technology, as you hit on, is one of the things that allows us to come in and have best-in-class EBITDA margins, and we'll continue to see gains off of that. Thanks for the question, Christopher. Our digital orders trend in line with our overall orders as far as margin percentage goes. It does allow us to leverage the SG&A leverage, though, Christopher. So the EBITDA margins can be higher. :Yes, that's absolutely possible. Yes, absolutely. Thank you for the question. On big picture, we've got a model that is proven as working. So we want to continue to execute the model. It has allowed us to go out and to grow volume by over 20% for the last 6 quarters, and it's allowed us for the last 8 years to outperform the industry revenue growth by more than 3x. So we're going to continue to execute on the model.   But there's three things that I'm focused on right now. The first is continuing to build out an exceptional management team that complements the great operators and technologists that we have in the business.   The second piece is to go out and continue to delight our customers and service our customers extremely well and go out and continue to outperform and take market share.   And the third is to continue to evolve XPO Connect. Our goal for XPO Connect is to have that to be the go-to tool for shippers as they are using that to make their transportation decisions, whether it's what mode of transportation that they're using, whether it's what day of the week they're shipping something or if they should consolidate something. We want that to be their go-to tool.   On the third \u2013 on your last point on headcount, we are continuing to add headcount as we go forward. And as you look at it, over a 5-year trend, volume still significantly outpaces head count that we've added. :We're constantly adding the bells and whistles. That's something that we continue to do. We do that on a biweekly basis. And we're excited to share more with you as we get closer to the Investor Day and the spinoff."

            "content": "Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. As Brad said, LTL is a very different business than it was 6 months ago. Our network is much more fluid and balanced. We're realizing significantly stronger service metrics in key areas such as on-site transit and freight handling. The sharp rebound has brought our network efficiency back to pre-pandemic levels.   Our investments in capacity are on track, and we're rolling out new, proprietary technology to improve pricing and drive further productivity. Most importantly, there is widespread excitement across the LTL team around the many new initiatives we've launched to optimize the network.   I'll give you an example. This month, we kicked off a national initiative to further improve the quality of our trailer loading and on-time delivery. We're also engaging with customers on best practices in how they package their freight. When we announced this initiative, it triggered a tidal wave of enthusiasm in the field. In just a few weeks, we've seen great momentum building in the organization.   Our goal is to create a world-class LTL carrier that delights our customers and our investors. It won't happen tomorrow, but the commitment is there, and we're already moving in that direction. I wanted to give you the backdrop first because the transformation we're undertaking in LTL helped us beat our guide for adjusted operating ratio in the first quarter.   In February, we guided to 200 basis points of year-over-year degradation, reflecting our continuous progress in moving the operating ratio back toward year-over-year improvement. In reality, we did better than the guide. Our Q1 degradation was just 140 basis points. This gave us an adjusted operating ratio ex real estate of 85.7% for the quarter. We expect to inflect to year-over-year improvement in adjusted operating ratio at some point later this quarter, as we said we would. And we're on target for a year-over-year improvement of more than 100 basis points in adjusted operating ratio ex real estate for the full year.   We plan to drive hundreds of additional basis points of OR improvement in the coming years to get the ratio well into the 70s. And importantly, the underlying trends are favorable. We reported record first quarter revenue of $1.1 billion, which is 15% higher than last year. Our year-over-year yield improvement was a first quarter record at 9%. Tonnage was down slightly year-over-year within the rates we told you to expect.   When you look one step deeper, the sequential trends are also positive. Growth in revenue per shipment accelerated every month in the quarter. Our yield also accelerated throughout the quarter with the strongest gains coming in March. We're operating in a very robust pricing environment.   Our tonnage in the quarter was up 4% sequentially, which is better than typical seasonality. Usually, our tonnage is flat from Q4 to Q1.   And as I mentioned, the momentum in our operating ratio is building ahead of plan. We expect our second quarter adjusted operating ratio to improve by more than 400 basis points from Q1 to Q2. So the business is very much on track.   Now I want to cover some of the first quarter actions we took to expand our capacity and deploy technology. These are the two main areas where we're investing in growth.   We recently opened new terminals in California and Georgia. These sites bring our net new doors to 345 since October, against a target of 900 net new doors added by year-end 2023. So we're more than 1/3 of the way there.   The San Bernardino terminal will serve growing demand from manufacturing and retail in Southern California. And the Atlanta terminal expands our capacity in one of the largest LTL regions in the South. It also gives us a larger gateway into Florida. These 2 sites will be growth levers for us in 2023 and going forward.   We're also making great progress in expanding our fleet of trailers. In the first quarter, our manufacturing facility in Arkansas produced more trailers than any other quarter in our history. We also opened new fleet maintenance shops in Florida, Ohio, Nevada and New York, which will help us manage maintenance costs. We continue to budget for growth CapEx at 8% to 9% of revenue this year. And, again, we're on plan.   On the technology front, recent developments include the ongoing application of our proprietary pricing platform, which is driven by advanced automated analytics around customer shipment data. This means our pricing experts are now able to focus more time on analyzing account performance, and we can negotiate with better results. In Q1, our price increases on contract renewals accelerated to 11%.   In April, we brought on board David Phalen as Senior Vice President of Pricing for LTL. David's career includes decades of success in optimizing pricing for transportation sectors, including the airline industry, where he specialized in pricing and yield management.   In other developments, we launched automated billing for accessorials to make sure we capture those revenue dollars. And we rolled out a new digital dashboard with self-service tools to enhance the customer experience. This quarter, we'll be introducing proprietary cost models to enhance visibility into cost management levers as well as new piece-level tracking functionality for our network.   So to sum it up, our comprehensive growth and optimization strategy for LTL comes down to one goal: we're creating a world-class LTL carrier. And we have every confidence that we'll succeed at this goal, just as we succeeded in dramatically increasing LTL returns over the first 6 years we owned the business.   We continue to expect to generate at least $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA in LTL in 2022. This is nearly triple the adjusted EBITDA generated by the LTL network in 2015, when we acquired it from Con-way. What you're seeing from us in 2022 is that we're full steam ahead, laser focused on efficiency and superb customer service. And our momentum will continue to grow, because we have the support of our people, who are some of the best LTL operators in the industry.   Now Drew will cover truck brokerage. Drew?"

            "name": "Brad Jacobs",
            "content": "Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our call. With me today in Greenwich are Ravi Tulsyan, our CFO; Matt Fassler, our Chief Strategy Officer; Mario Harik, our CIO and Acting President of LTL; and Drew Wilkerson, President of North American transportation.   As you saw, we delivered a quarter of record results with solid beats across revenue, net income, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS, including our eighth straight quarterly beat on adjusted EBITDA. We grew revenue by 16% over last year's first quarter, generating the highest revenue of any quarter in our history. We also had first quarter records for net income, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS, which was up year-over-year by 58%. To reflect our momentum, we raised our full year financial outlook by more than the first quarter beat. We're now guiding, at the midpoint, to adjusted diluted EPS growth of 26%.   Both of our core North American businesses, LTL and truck brokerage, delivered double-digit revenue growth in the quarter. Our LTL network today is a very different business than it was just 6 months ago. Many of the network improvements we're driving are ahead of plan.   We expect our adjusted operating ratio to improve sequentially by more than 400 basis points for the second quarter. And we continue to expect our adjusted operating ratio, excluding real estate gains, to inflect to year-over-year improvement later in the quarter, and for the full year to be at least 100 basis points better than 2021. Our goal is to create a world-class LTL carrier that delights our customers and our shareholders.   Turning to North American truck brokerage. We're continuing to fire on all cylinders there. Our volume growth exceeded 20% for the sixth consecutive quarter. This best-in-class brokerage business is continuing to take share and do it profitably. First quarter margin dollars were up 21% year-over-year and rose 5% sequentially, outperforming typical seasonality in large part due to the effectiveness of our digital platform, XPO Connect.   I'm pleased that we have a brokerage veteran lined up to lead the spin-off: Drew Wilkerson. Drew will be CEO, and he's been the main architect of our brokerage growth since joining us in 2012, most recently as President of North American transportation. He'll have a long runway to grow the business as a pure-play brokerage company. The spin-off process is on track, as is the planned divestiture of our European operations, which had an excellent first quarter.   And finally, we're pleased with the deleveraging we achieved in the first quarter. In 3 months, we brought our net leverage ratio down from 2.7x to 2x, which is at the top edge of our target range.   So in sum, we produced an excellent quarter and raised our outlook. We have multiple company-specific avenues for value creation, including the spin-off of our tech-enabled brokerage platform, the ongoing transformation of our LTL business, the divestiture of our European operations and our continuing deleveraging.   Now I'll ask Ravi to cover our results and our balance sheet. Ravi? :well, thank you, operator. And I'd like to leave everyone with the following points.   Number one, we're executing on multiple avenues to create outsized shareholder value. In LTL, we're ahead of plan and we have enormous momentum. If you look at April, the growth in revenue per day in April exceeds the first quarter's growth.   Year-over-year OR comparisons should flip favorable in the back half of Q2, and we firmly expect to generate more than 100 basis points of improvement in OR for the full year.   In truck brokerage, we continue to perform at best-in-class levels. In the first quarter, we grew loads on a year-over-year basis at 23%. And April was our best month ever for margin dollars in truck brokerage. And we expect to continue to significantly outperform the market.   On the balance sheet side, I'm very pleased that we brought leverage down from 2.7 to 2.0 in the first quarter, and we remain on track to reduce leverage below 2x by the end of this year, which is ahead of plan.   On the spin, we're progressing nicely, and we expect to turn 1 great company to 2 great companies in the fourth quarter.   So with that, I'd like to thank everyone. We look forward to seeing you at the upcoming conferences. Have a great day."

            "name": "Matthew Jeremy Fassler",
            "content": "Thanks, Ravi. I'll review our first quarter operating results, starting with our North American LTL segment.   We grew LTL revenue by 15% year-over-year to $1.1 billion, the highest revenue of any quarter in our history. Excluding fuel, we grew revenue by 9% year-over-year. We had a 0.8% decline in tonnage per day, which represented 4.1 percentage points of acceleration from our fourth quarter growth rate as our network flow improved. The 4% increase in the level of weight per day from the fourth quarter nicely outpaced typical seasonality. Yield, excluding fuel, increased 9% year-over-year. Our weight per shipment growth of 2% increased from flat in the fourth quarter, and our length of haul increased 0.2% versus a 1% increase in the fourth quarter. Adjusting for these factors, underlying pricing trends were stronger.   The LTL pricing environment remains firm, and we're driving yield with our own company-specific pricing initiatives. Our yield growth is even stronger this quarter to date.   Our LTL adjusted operating ratio was 85.7%. That's 140 basis points higher than the first quarter a year ago and significantly better than the 200 basis point year-over-year increase we guided to in February. Both numbers exclude gains from real estate, and note that, consistent with our guidance, we booked no such gains in the first quarter. And sequentially, our adjusted OR improved by 180 basis points from the fourth quarter, which was notably better than our typical seasonality.   The single biggest driver of the year-over-year increase in our adjusted operating ratio was the higher cost of purchased transportation. Third-party linehaul miles as a proportion of total linehaul miles increased in the quarter to 24.5% from 23.9% a year ago. This aligned with our plan to use more third-party linehaul in the near term as volume recovered prior to our onboarding new capacity.   In addition, most of our purchased transportation is subject to contractual pricing. Headwinds from this pricing are starting to abate as we cycle big truckload price increases from a year ago, and as new linehaul contracts cycle in.   Those are the highlights for North American LTL.   In our brokerage and other services segment, we grew revenue by 17% to a record $2.4 billion and adjusted EBITDA by 31% to a record $164 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin for this segment expanded by 60 basis points to 6.7% from 6.1% a year ago.   The largest revenue and profit driver in this segment is our North American truck brokerage business, which had another outstanding quarter. This will be the core business of our planned spin-off later this year.   We increased our brokerage loads per day by 23% versus a year ago and up 52% from 2 years ago. First quarter truck brokerage revenue rose 38% year-over-year. Margin dollars rose 21% against another tough comp and nearly tripled from the first quarter of 2020. On a sequential basis, margin dollars in the first quarter were 5% higher than in Q4.   Our truck brokerage growth reflects our strong execution in a dynamic market. Drew will speak more about the specific drivers in a minute.   Organic revenue in Europe grew 5%, accelerating by 2 percentage points from the fourth quarter. We saw acceleration in organic revenue growth in both the U.K. and in France, our two largest European geographies, and we're pleased with our resilience in the context of uncertainty in the European environment. We expect to continue to build on our position as a leading provider of truck brokerage and LTL in the U.K., France and Iberia within our broader pan-European platform.   We're grateful for some external recognition we received during the quarter. General Motors named us Supplier of the Year for the fourth straight year. In addition, we were recently given VETS Indexes employer status for our strong record of hiring members of the military community.   Last week, we published our fourth annual sustainability report, which details our progress on ESG initiatives and our materiality index for 2021. You can download this report online.   Finally, I want to mention that we plan to hold separate investor events later this year for both our brokerage SpinCo and our LTL RemainCo prior to completing the spin. We'll use those events to give you a deep dive into our longer-term vision and key financial targets for each stand-alone company.   Now I'll turn it over to Mario for his comments on North American LTL."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. Before the call begins, let me read a brief statement on behalf of the company regarding forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. During this call, the company will be making certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws, which by their nature, involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. A discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in the company's SEC filings as well as in its earnings release. The forward-looking statements in the company's earnings release or made on this call are made only as of today, and the company has no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements, except to the extent required by law. During this call, the company may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined under applicable SEC rules. Reconciliations of such non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are contained in the company's earnings release and the related financial tables or on its website. You can find a copy of the company's earnings release, which contains additional important information regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures, in the Investors section of the company's website. I will now turn the call over to XPO's Chief Executive Officer, Mario Harik. Mr. Harik, you may begin.\nMario Harik: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call. I'm here in Greenwich with Kyle Wismans, our Chief Financial Officer; and Ali Faghri, our Chief Strategy Officer. I'm pleased to report that we kept a strong year for the quarter that exceeded expectations, and we've carried that momentum into 2024. Company-wide, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $1.9 billion, which is 6% higher year-over-year. And we grew adjusted EBITDA to $264 million for an increase of 28%, excluding real estate gains in 2022. Our adjusted diluted EPS for the company was $0.77, which was also better than expected. I want to thank our team for delivering these great results in a soft freight environment. Looking at our North American LTL segment, we reported our strongest progress since we launched our LTL 2.0 plan in 2021. We grew adjusted operating income year-over-year by 51% and improved our adjusted operating ratio by 380 basis points. We delivered the best damage claims ratio in our history at 0.3%, as well as a record level of employee satisfaction. And we significantly accelerated our year-over-year yield growth, excluding fuel, to 10.3%. We also improved cost efficiency for the fourth consecutive quarter with further increases in labor productivity and linehaul and sourcing. And we continue to deploy capital efficiently as we reinvest back into the business. All of these are proof points that our plan has strong traction. And the 28 service centers we recently acquired from the Yellow Network will build on this momentum. This acquisition is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to integrate prime locations into our network to support yield growth and margin expansion. When the market recovers and industry capacity tightens, we'll be in a stronger position to serve our customers and drive profitable growth for years to come. Now, I want to share some details of the quarter, starting with the first pillar of our LTL 2.0 plan, service improvements. We improved every major component of customer service quality in the quarter, including our customer satisfaction rating, which has risen by more than 40% since 2021. Our on-time performance was three percentage points better than in the prior fourth quarter. And I mentioned that our damage claims ratio of 0.3% is a new record for us. To put that in context, it's a vast improvement from 1.2% when we launched our plan. These are metrics our customers watch closely as an indicator of service quality. Our top priority is to become the customer service leader in our industry. And we're continuing to equip our team with the tools to make this a reality. One example is the new freight airbags I spoke about on our last call. The rollout has been going well, and this solution is now installed at over 50% of our doors. The airbags have reduced damages by more than 20% at those locations, and the benefit will spread across our network. We expect to finish the installations by the middle of this year. The second pillar of LTL 2.0 is to invest in our network to drive long-term growth. We added more tractors and trailers in 2023 than any year in XPO's history, to both grow and refresh our fleet. This resulted in record network fluidity and supported our strategy to in-source more line-haul miles. On the tractor side, we purchased more than 1,400 units in 2023. This reduced our average fleet age to five years at year-end, compared with 5.9 years in 2022. On the trailer side, we manufactured over 6,400 units at our in-house facility in Arkansas, exceeding our production target. For 2024, we expect our LTL CapEx level to be in the low-teens as a percent of revenue, and again, primarily allocated to our fleet. In terms of the 28 service centers, we acquired from Yellow, the largest impact on our capital strategy is timing. We've put forward dozens of real estate investments that we plan to make over the next several years. I'll add some strategic color to my earlier comments on the acquisition. These service centers will deliver important benefits to the business for years to come. First, they'll get us closer to customers, and give us larger facilities in major metro areas. This should drive substantial cost efficiencies across our line haul, pickup-and-delivery and dock operations. Second, they'll enhance our yield growth by further improving, our service with fewer freight three handles, reduce damages, and better on-time performance. And third, that'll give us more capacity in key metros like Indianapolis, Columbus and Las Vegas. These are markets where we are currently turning away profitable customers, because we don't have enough door capacity. We plan to start bringing these locations online in April and have all of them operational within the next 12 months to 18 months. We expect the transaction to be accretive to EPS and our LTL operating ratio in 2025. This assumes no underlying recovery in industry volumes. Any market rebound would represent an upside to our baseline forecast. The third pillar of our plan is to drive above-market yield growth, which is our single biggest lever for margin improvement. You can see this dynamic in the fourth quarter when we drove yield, excluding fuel, higher year-over-year by 10.3%. This helped us deliver nearly 400 basis points of adjusted operating ratio improvement. We got there by executing on service improvements, accessorials, and volume growth within our local customer base. These are the three levers for our long-term pricing opportunity. The exciting trends in our service metrics translate to value for our customers, with a direct correlation to the price we earn. Increasingly, our customers see XPO as a high-value business partner with the resources to help them succeed. This was reflected in our contract renewal pricing, which was up year-over-year by 9% for the second consecutive quarter. Accessorials are another opportunity to grow our yield, by delivering more value through premium services. We plan to expand our range of offerings this year. We saw an early impact in the fourth quarter with the introduction of our retail store rollout offering. We already have over a dozen customers using this service to distribute critical product launches for retailers. And with the third lever, our local channel, we grew shipment counts by double digits for the third consecutive quarter. Our local sales team at year-end was over 20% larger than in 2022, reflecting the importance we place on this high-yielding margin-accretive business. So, we have a lot of avenues leading to yield growth and each step forward helps to align our pricing with the value we deliver. The fourth and final pillar of LTL 2.0 is cost efficiency. The main opportunities here are with purchase transportation, variable costs, and overhead. In the fourth quarter, we reduced our purchase transportation cost by 22% year-over-year by in-sourcing more miles and paying lower contract rates to third-party providers. We ended the quarter with less than 20% of linehaul miles outsourced, for a year-over-year reduction of 290 basis points. On a sequential basis, we reduced our reliance on outsourcing by 190 basis points. We've come a long way since the beginning of 2022 when we were outsourcing about 25% of our linehaul miles Today we're well on the way to bringing down that percentage to the low teens by 2027. Lastly, a quick update on our initiative to add driver teams and sleeper cab trucks for long hauls. The goal here is to increase the efficiency and flexibility of our linehaul network. We started putting these teams in place last quarter and we currently have over 50 teams in operation. We expect to have a few hundred long-haul teams on the road by the end of this year. This should help to accelerate our in-sourcing plan. We're also continuing to manage our variable labor costs effectively, growing our volume by more than our head count year-over-year for the fourth consecutive quarter. And the spread in the quarter was substantial. Our shipment count was up 5.7%, while our headcount was up just 1.7%. This is a credit to the team's operational discipline, supported by our proprietary technology for labor planning. In summary, in 2023, we made significant progress on our plan across the board, while laying a solid foundation for the future. We improved our operations in all four quarters of the year by generating record service levels, making strategic investments in the network, further accelerating yield growth, and operating more cost efficiently. As a result, the business performed above expectations with robust margin expansion and earnings growth and strong forward momentum. Now I'm going to hand the call over to Kyle to discuss the fourth quarter financial results. Kyle over to you.\nKyle Wismans: Thank you, Mario, and good morning everyone. I'll take you through our key financial results, balance sheet and liquidity. It was a strong fourth quarter overall. Revenue for the total company was $1.9 billion, up 6% year-over-year. This includes a 9% increase in our LTL segment. Excluding fuel, LTL revenue was up 14% year-over-year. Salary wages and benefits for LTL were 10% higher in the quarter than a year ago. This increase primarily reflects wage and benefit inflation as well as incentive compensation aligned with our strong fourth quarter performance. These impacts were mitigated by our productivity gains. We've now improved our labor hours per shipment on a year-over-year basis for four straight quarters throughout 2023. We were also more cost efficient with purchase transportation through a combination of in-sourcing and rate negotiation. Our expense for third-party carriers was $83 million in the quarter, which was down year-over-year by 22%. Depreciation expense increased year-over-year by 23%, or $13 million, as we continued to reinvest in the business. This remains our top priority for capital allocation in LTL. In the fourth quarter, our CapEx was primarily allocated to our fleet, as we purchased new tractors from the manufacturers and build more trailers in-house. Next, I'll add some detail to adjusted EBITDA starting with the company as a whole. We generated adjusted EBITDA of $264 million in the quarter, up 28% from a year ago and improved our adjusted EBITDA margin by 230 basis points. These metrics exclude the impact of real estate gains in the fourth quarter of 2022 to give you a like-to-like comparison. We had no real estate gains in the fourth quarter of 2023. Our fourth quarter corporate expense was $5 million, for a year-over-year savings of 44%, or $4 million. We're continuing to rationalize our corporate structure for the standalone business and expect to report further reductions this year. Looking solely at the LTL segment, we grew our adjusted operating income by 51% year-over-year to $160 million. And we grew adjusted EBITDA to $233 million. The gains we achieved through revenue growth and cost efficiencies more than offset the non-operational headwinds from lower fuel surcharge revenue and pension income. In our European transportation segment, adjusted EBITDA was $36 million for the quarter. Company-wide, we reported operating income of $119 million for the quarter, compared to $4 million in the prior year. Our net income from continuing operations was $58 million for diluted earnings per share of $0.49, compared with a loss of $36 million or $0.31 a year ago. This represents an improvement of $0.80 in diluted EPS from continuing operations, driven by significant year-over-year reductions in transaction and integration costs and restructuring charges. On an adjusted basis, our EPS for the quarter was $0.77, which is down 21% from a year ago. This primarily reflects the impact of real estate gains in 2022, as well as lower pension income and higher interest expense in 2023. Our acquisition of the 28 service centers closed on December 20 and did not have a material impact on our operating results in the income statement. And lastly, we generated $251 million of cash flow from continuing operations in the quarter and deployed $151 million of net CapEx, excluding spend related to the acquisition. Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $412 million of cash on hand. Combined with available capacity under committed borrowing facilities, this gave us $920 million of liquidity. We had no borrowings outstanding under our ABL facility at quarter-end. In December, we raised $985 million through a combination of $585 million of senior notes and $400 million of term loans. We used $870 million of proceeds to complete our acquisition of 28 LTL service centers and we refinanced our existing senior notes due in 2025. We now have no funded debt maturities until 2028. We also maintained all corporate and issue-level credit ratings. Our net debt leverage at year-end was three times trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. The investments we're making in the business will enhance our earnings trajectory for a high return on capital, consistent with our long-term goal of achieving an investment-grade profile. Before I close, I'll summarize the full year 2024 assumptions we provided in our investor presentation to help you with your models. They are as follows. Gross CapEx of $700 million to $800 million, interest expense of $240 million to $260 million, pension income of approximately $25 million and adjusted effective tax rate of 23% to 25% and a diluted share count of 121 million shares. Now, I'll turn it over to Ali who will cover our operating results.\nAli Faghri: Thank you, Kyle. I'll start with our LTL segment, which reported another quarter of profitable growth. On a year-over-year basis, we increased our shipments per day by 5.7% in the quarter, led by 12% growth in our local sales channel. This resulted in growth in tonnage per day of 2%. Our weight per shipment was down 3.4% year-over-year, which was notably less of a decline for the second consecutive quarter. On a monthly basis, our October tonnage per day was up 2.5% year-over-year. November was down 0.5%, and December was up 3.6%. Looking just at shipments per day, October was up 6.2% year-over-year, November was up 3.7%, and December was up 6.6%. In January, our tonnage per day was down 1.1% year-over-year, while shipment count was up 1.4%. The transportation industry was disrupted by weather events in January, but we saw a rebound more recently and ended the month with stronger volumes. And sequentially, both our tonnage and shipment count increased from December to January, outperforming seasonality. We also outperformed on yield in the fourth quarter, delivering a second consecutive quarter of acceleration. We grew yield, excluding fuel, by a strong 10.3% compared with the prior year. Importantly, our underlying pricing trends are strong as we continue to align our pricing with the better service we're providing. Our contract renewal pricing was up 9% in the quarter compared with a year ago. Turning to margin. Our fourth quarter adjusted operating ratio was 86.5%, which was an improvement of 380 basis points year-over-year. Our strong margin performance was primarily driven by yield growth and underpinned by our cost initiatives and productivity gains. Sequentially, our adjusted OR increased by 30 basis points, which outperformed seasonality by 280 basis points. Moving to our European business. We delivered revenue growth of 2% year-over-year, despite ongoing challenges in the macro environment. This growth was supported by strong pricing, which outpaced inflation. And in some regions like the UK, we grew adjusted EBITDA versus the prior year, reflecting disciplined cost control. While our volume declined slightly year-over-year, we outperformed the industry and we mitigated the decline with new customer wins as the quarter progressed. And this trend improved in January. The team is executing well and earning new business from high-caliber customers. This momentum, together with the growth of our sales pipeline, should continue to strengthen our position in key European regions. I'll close with a summary of the three main achievements you heard from us this morning, as they relate to our expectations for a strong 2024. First, we're continuing to deliver more value for customers in the form of service quality with our metrics at record levels. And we're on an excellent trajectory. Second, we accelerated yield growth to double digits as we exited 2023, and we expect to deliver another robust yield performance this year with a direct benefit to profitability. And third, we're showing that we can operate more productively by leveraging our technology and improving our cost to serve. In short, we've taken major strides with our network operations, and we're still in the early innings of significantly improving our operating ratio. Now we'll take your questions. Operator, please open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Any thoughts on how to think about the OR from Q4 to Q1 and maybe full year margin improvement? And then bigger picture Mario, you made a comment that all this terminal growth is additive to yields and margins. I guess, why it should be good for volume, but maybe some thoughts on how it actually helps yield and margin as well?\nMario Harik: Sure, thanks, Scott. First, starting with the first quarter outlook. We typically give tonnage yield and what OR would look like. Starting with tonnage, following the gains we had in the fourth quarter, we do expect to outperform seasonality in Q1. Typically, a normal seasonality for us call it flattish tonnage sequentially from Q4 to Q1, and we expect to do better than that. So we expect Q1 tonnage should be up low single-digit somewhat in the same ZIP code as where we were in the fourth quarter on a year-on-year basis. Now, when you look at January tonnage specifically, it did do better as Ali mentioned earlier compared to seasonality on your old forward December into January. And we had a strong end of the month as well, despite the weather earlier in the month. On the yield front, we expect a strong performance for yield across the board this year. We do expect yield to be up on a year-on-year basis in the first quarter somewhere in the same ZIP code as we were in the fourth quarter year-on-year. And ultimately from our standpoint, usually typical seasonality for us Q4 to Q1 we see OR deteriorate about 40 basis points and we expect to do better than that. Now, how much better will depend on how the rest of the quarter plays out. Usually, Q1 as you know March is the big month of the quarter. But that implies roughly 300 basis points of OR improvement year-on-year. For the full year 2024, we also expect a strong year for us in terms of OR improvement. Given all the things, we're doing in yield and tonnage and cost and efficiency improvement and service improvement we expect OR to be up in the 150 to 250 basis points range for the full year. And there's a path for us to do better than the top end of the range depending here on how the year plays out. Now, taking a step back on your question on the service centers and how they impact yield. So we see a big cost benefit first and that cost benefit comes from higher efficiency and having bigger break bulks that lead to cost savings and line haul having service centers closer to the customer that leads to lower D&D cost and also lowering dock-handling costs associated with that. Now, the way they help yield is because larger service centers help improve your service product and service product in tight yield. But also, we mentioned premium services. And when you think about premium services in some markets like Las Vegas, we're tapped on capacity. And by having now the largest service center in the biggest market, we're going to be able to launch new offerings like trade shows as an example and this comes also at a higher yield and higher margin as well.\nScott Group: Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nKen Hoexter: Hey, great. Good morning. Congrats on some solid performance here on the OR. Maybe just digging into that though. Talk about the ramp of the 28 facilities. How should we anticipate the drag versus your forecast? And I guess with that it seems like you're bumping up against your kind of long-term targets now of the 600 basis point improvement. How \u2013 does that shift \u2013 or the speed with which you can get there start changing in your thought process?\nMario Harik: Thanks, Ken. Well starting with the ramp of the service centers. Well, in terms of getting them up and running, we do expect to get them up and running in \u2013 the first dozen or so service centers over the next three to six months, the next dozen over the next six to 12 months and then the remaining four or five will go live next year call it 12 to 18 months. Now we don't anticipate an OR drag from them that would be material to our numbers. And the reason why because the majority of the service centers are in markets where we already operate. So if you think about it there is one case where we move our team, our existing team from a smaller service center to a larger service center. The carrying cost of real estate is fairly low on a per door basis but we get the immediate benefit of cost efficiencies and cost savings associated with having a larger facility to operate from. In markets where we are adding a service center and keeping the existing one in that particular case we split the team between the two service centers based on volume and we only step up if there is an inflection in volume and we have incremental volumes. So we don't anticipate the service centers to have a drag on OR this year. We do expect them to be accretive for the EBITDA. We do expect a drag on EPS, driven by the incremental debt there. And we expect them to be accretive on all these KPIs in 2025 and beyond. In terms of the long-term targets, we've always said 600 basis points. I mean at least 600 basis points. And there's nothing magical about 600 basis points, there's nothing magical about 2027. With all the momentum that we have here and with all \u2013 with the new service centers, the pricing, the service improvements, we do expect to outperform and I would hold us to get to the 70s and well into the 70s over time from an OR perspective.\nKen Hoexter: Thanks, Mario.\nMario Harik: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.\nJon Chappell: Thank you. Good morning. I'm not sure if Mario or Ali wants to take this, but this is the second straight quarter now with contract renewal pricing up 9%. Where do you stand on the book of business, as it relates to kind of marking to market for the new service? Do you still have a couple more quarters, where you think that kind of high single-digit contract renewal is on the agenda? Or are you kind of close to kind of marking it to market and you think maybe that moderates a little bit to maybe mid-single digits kind of in line more with the GRI levels?\nKyle Wismans: Hey, Jon, it's Kyle. So if you think about contract renewals right now, we did accelerate heavily in the back half from 5% to 9%. And so far in the year or in the back half we negotiated 50% of the book. So there's still some more to work through. I still think we're in a favorable market for renewals and we should expect positive momentum to carry forward here in 2024.\nJon Chappell: Just to be clear though it's kind of like if you're done with 50% is this the first half higher end of that range, reacceleration similar to the back half of 2023, and then kind of more of a normalized level in the back half? Or do you think that what you've done over the last six months as you continue to improve service kind of lead you more towards what you've done in the last six months or so as a percentage basis?\nKyle Wismans: I think renewals are probably going to follow where we see yields for the first half. So we're expecting strong yield to continue. If you think our Q1 yield guide, we think Q1 yield is going to be up high single-digit in line with what we saw in Q4. That should carry forward into our contract renewals at the start of the year.\nOperator: Our next question is from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed.\nChris Wetherbee: Hey thanks. Good morning guys. I guess I want to talk a little bit about some of the initiatives that maybe you guys are thinking about for 2024. So, we've talked about sort of the team drivers you talked about sort of the in-sourcing of line haul. Curious kind of as you start to think about adding those up in the context of the 150 to 250 basis points of OR improvement how much you get from that versus maybe what would be kind of core pricing above cost inflation and maybe a little bit of leverage on the volume? I don't know if you can unpack that but any detail you can give us would be great.\nMario Harik: I'll talk on the initiatives. And Chris the way we look at it I mean our plan involves substantial yield improvement. It does involve continuing our great service momentum or service product improvement momentum. Tonnage improvement, we do see tonnage going up for the full year but we do expect it to be up call it in the same zip code of where we were in the fourth quarter so low single-digit because our goal is to drive more yield than it is to drive volume. Similarly, our goal is to drive cost efficiencies as you mentioned. So, I'll give a quick update on the initiatives. As part of our plan is to in-source more to the third-party linehaul miles because that comes both at a cost benefit but it also comes as a service benefit when we go from using a third-party carrier with a 53-feet trailer versus having two 28-feet pups, which gives us more space gives us safe stack in the trailers where we can separate the freight physically and our drivers show up on time 100% of the time. We can continue to improve that service product. Now, that will come with cost savings here in 2024, but the longer term cost savings also come when you think of an inflection in truckload rates at some point, that's going to be obviously material savings for us from what we would be spending internally on a per mile basis versus what we're spending for third-party carriers. So, our expectation is to continue to -- we insource 290 basis points here in the fourth quarter year-on-year. We are sub-20% at this point, we're at 19 and change. And we're going to drive that in the first phase down to the low teens and beyond that as we amp up those teams as well.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nMario Harik: Thanks Chris.\nOperator: Our next question is from Fadi Chamoun with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nFadi Chamoun: Yes, good morning team. So, my question is you mentioned the double-digit growth that you're seeing in the local account I guess. I'm thinking this has obviously been a pretty decent tailwind for density and cost per shipment and ultimately the yield. Where are you in this kind of trajectory of improving local account penetration? Are we in the first innings of that? Is there an opportunity that is of significant size still in front of you?\nMario Harik: When you look at the local account strategy Fadi, it is a segment that we are planning on growing over the years to come here. Now, if you look back at 2023 we were run-rating at roughly 20% of our volume and revenue is generated from that channel. Now, what we have done through the course of the year is that we increased the size of our local accounts. We hired more than 20% more local sellers through the course of 2023. And the goal here through 2024 is to add roughly another 10%. So, all-in to be 30% higher on the overall sales force size that is selling to that channel. Now, as you can imagine whenever we onboard new people, it does take a ramp usually about six months for them to be fully productive and fully up and running. Now, if you look at the full year, we did improve our local accounts higher -- on a higher run rate than the rest of our book. Here in the fourth quarter, we grew our local shipments in that channel by 12% on a year-on-year basis. And we do expect to continue to see those really strong gains in that channel, since we onboarded 20% more sellers. Now in terms of the inning, I would say, we're still in the early innings in terms of results, but we are very well underway in terms of having the team and having them seen a couple of quarters of ramp here being pretty productive in 2024 and beyond.\nFadi Chamoun: Appreciate that. Thank you and congrats on the strong results.\nMario Harik: Thank you, Fadi.\nOperator: Our next question is from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please proceed.\nStephanie Moore: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. I wanted to maybe touch a bit on the, I guess, continuing on the pricing discussion here. I think pricing accelerated over 10% here in the quarter. I think you guided to more high single digits. Can you maybe walk through the drivers of the upside? What you're seeing and kind of your thoughts as we think about 2024 for further pricing acceleration, especially your view of what can happen if the macro does actually turn? Thanks.\nAli Faghri : Sure, Stephanie. This is Ali. So we're seeing very strong pricing trends, as we enter 2024. For the first quarter in particular, we would expect our yield on an ex fuel basis to be up somewhere in the similar range, as we just delivered here in the fourth quarter. So call it roughly about 10% growth. Now on a full year basis, we would expect yield to be up somewhere in that mid to high single-digit range. I would add that there's certainly a path to do better than that. It's still very early in the year. So we'll update you as the year progresses. A lot of that yield growth and the outperformance versus the industry is being driven by our internal initiatives. If you think about our service improvement, we're at record levels here in the fourth quarter. We're continuing to lean more into premium services. We rolled out retail store rollout here in the fourth quarter. We have a lot of traction there. And as Mario just noted, a lot of momentum on the local side as well too and this is higher yielding and margin-accretive business. So, overall, we feel very good about the yield outlook here in 2024 and expect it to be a strong year for us overall.\nStephanie Moore: Great. Thank you. Maybe just a follow-up to that, but a little bit bigger picture, as you think about incentive comp across the organization, maybe talk a little bit about what metrics that have been possibly realigned just to align interest across the organization yield, margins, EBIT, what's the major metrics we should be focused on based on incentive comp changes in 2024? Thanks.\nMario Harik: Stephanie, this is Mario. I'll take that. So, in 2023 first and 2022, we used to compensate predominantly our field based on EBITDA growth and EBITDA performance. But we have added a good portion of the comp plan to be focused on service quality. So as service centers and group service quality and on-time service, they effectively -- they had a good chunk of their incentive comp is based on that. Now in 2024 will be the first year where we are switching from compensating our field from EBITDA and EBITDA growth and have it be focused on OR improvement. So it's now focused on how can we expand our margins over time. Because as you know we want to incentivize effectively driving that better service product that yields to higher yield, while managing costs effectively, which would lead to OR expansion at the service center level and ultimately at the network level as well.\nOperator: Our next question is from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed.\nTom Wadewitz: Yes. I just had I guess one kind of quick one on the D&A and maybe how we think about the ramp-up in that given you are spending a good level of CapEx. So, on that, but I guess a broader question would be on, how you think about the terminal network. And I guess what's -- as you bring on terminals like where you sit today, what's your excess capacity from a door and a terminal perspective? And as you bring on more terminal capacity kind of where do you want to get to, right? I think we've seen that a high service model you do have some decent amount of excess capacity. But I kind of wanted to see where you're at today, where you'd like to get to on excess capacity and then a specific one just on kind of D&A modeling. Thank you.\nMario Harik: Thanks, Tom. I'll start with the network and the capacity side and turn it over to Kyle for D&A. When you look at our network today, before the 28 service center acquisition, we were run-rating call it in the mid to high teens in terms of excess capacity in the current environment. And if we roll forward, we are adding 28 service centers, out of these roughly half of them would be additive and the other half would be ones where we are relocating from a smaller service center to a larger service center. And we roughly acquired about 3,000 doors and we would be adding a net after we're all said and done with the integration, a net 2,000 doors which is call it a 10%, 15% expansion in capacity. So once we get these service centers online, we will be in the 25% to 30% excess capacity in our network. And that's a great place to be as an LTL network, especially in a soft freight market. So this way whenever there's a freight market recovery and you see higher demand, the sort of our industry has been capacity constrained, real estate comes with a very low carrying cost and this would enable us to flex up whenever that demand comes back. So this is how we look at currently where we are and as we open up those service centers where we'll be adding a capacity perspective.\nKyle Wismans: Yes, Tom. And if you think about the D&A ramp, so we are going to see increased CapEx within the LTL segment. So we'd expect about $74 million to $75 million a quarter for LTL, reflecting the increased CapEx spend.\nTom Wadewitz: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Bruce Chan with Stifel. Please proceed.\nBruce Chan: Yes, thanks, operator and good morning everyone. Maybe just to start Kyle, can you remind us of what your target leverage range is? And then, I know in previous quarters you pulled back on some of the commentary around the sale of the European business. But with the need for more best pay-down potentially with these new facilities, is there any more urgency to sell that business now?\nKyle Wismans: Hey Bruce, it's Kyle. I'm going to start and then I'll hand it over to Mario. So when you think about our long-term leverage outlook, our intention is one to two times trailing 12 months EBITDA. And we think we're in a great spot with the investments we made and the EBITDA we can generate to really make a lot of progress on that here in the next couple of years.\nMario Harik: And on the European sale, Bruce, our long-term plan remains to be a pure-play North American LTL carrier and selling the European business is one of our strategic priorities. But we're going to be patient. Our goal is to maximize the return we get on that business. It is a business that has a scarcity value to it. We're either number one, two or three in less-than-truckload truckload asset-light brokerage in many geographies in Western Europe, think UK, France, Spain Portugal. And it's not a matter of if, but a matter of when. And meanwhile if you take a step back, the business is performing well. Despite a soft economy in Europe with outperforming the tiers, our revenue was up in the quarter. We've improved volume every month of the quarter and further improved in the month of January. And so credit to the team's strong execution. So again, if you take a step back, it's a matter of time and at some point we'll get there.\nBruce Chan: Okay. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jason Seidl with TD Cowen. Please proceed.\nJason Seidl: Thank you, Operator. Mario, I think you talked about accessorials and that there's about 12 different things that XPO was doing to drive them higher. Can you help us understand the timing and your ability to implement these accessorial and the impact we should expect?\nMario Harik: So when you take a step back on these accessorials, they are predominantly what we call premium services. So these are services that our customers are asking for, that go beyond your typical pick up a few skids of freight and get them delivered to a destination. So examples are, Kyle mentioned earlier, the retail store rollouts offering, where in that particular case, you can imagine if you have some sort of a holiday, or a new product launch, a customer needs us to ship many, many shipments, to think, it could be hundreds of shipments in a short time window, and they need somebody to coordinate all of those offerings. And that leads, obviously, to a higher price and the customer is happier because they're getting a service that they need. We do have a number of other offerings. Trade shows is a good example of that. Working with retailers that must arrive by date type offering, and many others that we are launching through the course of the year here. We do expect to get them launched -- they won't all be launched within a few quarters. Some of them will take a bit longer, that can expedite a service as an example. But as we launch these, we expect them to be accretive to yield over time. In terms of magnitude, roughly today, our accessorial as a percent of revenue is roughly around -- call it in the low double digits. And our goal is to grow that to the mid-teens as we launch these programs over the years to come.\nJason Seidl: That's great color. I wanted to also follow-up on the overall pricing discussion. LTL pricing this quarter has been very strong. Your renewals are at 9%, [indiscernible] is almost at 9%. ArcBest is the best they've reported since quarter in 2022. And this is all in a very sluggish demand backdrop and super cheap LTL pricing. As the economy recovers and capacity tightens overall, is it crazy to think about double-digit pricing going forward for you guys?\nMario Harik: We had double-digit pricing up here in the fourth quarter, and we do expect a very strong first half of the year as well. I mean, there is an environment. If you look at our industry, it's been historically capacity constrained. When you go back before Yellow ceased operations, we didn't have enough capacity versus the demand that was out there. We are currently in a sluggish freight environment where demand is down, roughly, call it double-digit low teens, and this is when that capacity went away from the market. So whenever there is any sort \u2013 even with some of that capacity coming back into LTL, whenever there's any form of inflection in demand, there wouldn't be enough doors and service centers in our industry. So you would see pricing accelerate accordingly. For us specifically, we also have all the company specific initiatives we're driving between driving better service, which comes at a premium, between driving premium services, between driving also expansion of our local channels. All of these would be accretive to yield as well. So double-digit pricing is not out of the question.\nJason Seidl: Fantastic. Appreciate the time.\nMario Harik: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed.\nBascome Majors: Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to go back to the incentives focused from earlier. Can you talk more specifically about how you're tactically incentivizing your salespeople specifically and if that has changed at all as the business has evolved and your priorities have evolved over the last 10 months? And separately, from a long-term senior executive management incentive approach, how might those look different this year than they have over the last few years? Thank you.\nMario Harik: Thanks, Bascome. So first, starting with the sales compensation. So it depends on what type of salary you are in the organization. We changed the comp plan accordingly. So if you're in the local channel, the goal is to grow your book as opposed to, for example, if you're into different types of accounts, you're going to have to focus on profitability more. But generally, the theme is that, if you look at a service center they are compensated based on the OR improvement for that specific service center. If you're a local account executive, you're incentivized to grow your book and a component of your compensation is driven by operating ratio as well. If you're handling larger accounts then the lion's share of your compensation is around OR and profit improvement as well associated with that. So this is how typically sales are compensated but it is more driven by your book of business as opposed to your region or the network as a whole. Now in terms of senior exec compensation that's typically part of our proxy. But we incentivize our senior executives based on a combination of OR growth, EBITDA growth and the TSR associate holder value creation as well.\nBascome Majors: And you don't expect the long-term incentive formula to really change other than the targets for this three-year period?\nMario Harik: The framework would be very similar to what we had in the past.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nJordan Alliger: Yes, Hi, morning. Just sort of curious, thanks for the layout in terms of the door opening timing, et cetera. In the context of your thoughts on the economy and the new door openings, is there a way to think about tonnage or volume trajectory as we go through the year sort of like year-over-year growth potential or how you expect it to sort of ramp up? That would be the first question. Thanks.\nAli Faghri: Sure, Jordan. This is Ali. I'll then pass it to Mario. So for the full year, as we noted, we expect a much higher contribution from yield and volume. We're being very disciplined on the type of volume we're onboarding onto the network and you should expect that to continue through this year. So overall for the full year, we'd expect tonnage to be up somewhere in that low single-digit range for the full year and then yield somewhere in that mid- to high single-digits or better. Now keep in mind, we do have tougher comps in the second half of the year. It is still early in the year and obviously the macro can be a swing factor. In terms of the new service centers, we don't expect any sort of meaningful contribution from volume this year. We would expect contribution from volume to be sub 1% of incremental volumes so not a meaningful number overall.\nMario Harik: When we think about the service centers in the near-term ahead of any type of macro infection whenever it comes, there is a big benefit we're going to get from cost savings as I mentioned earlier on by having larger facilities. And if you think about what we bought from the Yellow Network, we bought some of the largest service centers. You look at a site like Carlisle [ph], you can't get any more than 120 acres of land right off I-76 and I-81 where we have a 300-door service center now in that market. Same thing with Nashville. We got a 40, 50-acre facility west of Nashville with more than 200 doors in it. So when you think about those larger facilities that enable you to run more efficiently, your line haul, your D&D, your dock operations, that's going to lead to cost savings as soon as we start moving into them. The other benefit is some markets, when you look at a market like Brooklyn, New York or Columbus or Indianapolis or Las Vegas, we're tapped out on capacity today. So we don't have enough doors in those markets. And by having this incremental capacity, we already have customers that are ready to go where we can onboard them as we open up those service centers. And we have two small service centers. One is in Eau Claire Wisconsin, one is Nogales, Arizona, where we \u2013 these are net adds or new markets. But these are small service centers, where we already have demand lined up based on existing customer relationships we have as well.\nJordan Alliger: Got it. And then just sort of curious, how you're going to manage the terminal opening? So in other words, is there some economic dependency on it how good the economy is? Or is there going to be a certain amount that you're just going to open no matter what strategically or otherwise?\nMario Harik: When we think about the rollout timing, we prioritize those service centers those markets where we are capacity constrained today. So in a softer freight environment, where we see that, we don't have enough capacity. And the second priority is based on cost efficiency, so the service centers that will create the most amount of cost efficiency. And when we think about the opening schedule, I'll call it, over the next 3 months to 18 months, it will be we're going to drive through it regardless of what the freight the markets are doing. This would be a reasonable time frame in terms of bringing those terminals up to our standards and doing the re-branding and these kind of things to get them up and running. And then we -- for us if you -- I mentioned, this earlier on, if you think about the headcount there's no need for us to hire people ahead of volume. So what we do is that we either relocate the existing team into a larger facility, or we add a facility to an existing market where we split a team from an existing facility into two different service centers, so there's no incremental cost associated with that. If we do see an inflection in volume, where the markets are getting better then we step up to be able to support that volume. And importantly, Jordan, if you look at our year in 2023, we were able to improve efficiency every single quarter of the year. So we have the great ability between operational discipline that Dave and the team are bringing to the table, supported by our proprietary technology to be able to run our network very efficiently from a labor standpoint.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Mario, maybe we can follow-up on that one there. I know, you're talking about cost efficiencies of opening new terminals in the network. And it sounds like potentially, you're going to move staff from one to the other. But I guess, just covering transports for 20 years now when you open new nodes in the network, especially scheduled network isn't there like a small up time on capacity efficiencies, especially on like line haul and walk up, pick up and delivery that we should be anticipating? Because it sounds like what you're guiding to that you can instantly match efficiency if not even get better with these new facilities.\nMario Harik: I mean, whenever you open up those sites, you do have a small headwind in cost, but that for us would be a very short lived. I mean, you're talking 30 to 90 days of cost headwind as you move into a larger facility. And predominantly, it comes from the carrying cost of the incremental doors. But Brandon keep in mind that the cost of a door in our P& L is sub 5% as a percent of total. So it's a small incremental cost associated with that. But when you think about the immediate efficiency, you gain in pickup and delivery and line haul in all of those pieces, this is where we see that this again drag that is short-lived. It doesn't have a meaningful impact on the network as a whole. And to give you an example over the last couple of years here, we've opened up a dozen service centers and each one of them was accretive within 30 to 60 days. Each one of them is exceeding our return hurdles as well. So we feel very good about our ability to get those on-boarded with very minimal drag. And that's the reason why, we don't expect any drag from an OR perspective from the service center. And finally, I'd say, also with having Dave on the team, he has an incredible amount of experience in terms of adding capacity to a network and making sure, it's accretive pretty quickly.\nBrandon Oglenski: Appreciate. Congrats on the quarter.\nMario Harik: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from James Monigan with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.\nJames Monigan: Hey, guys. Thanks. Just wanted to come back to pricing a little bit. And of the pricing gap to peers, how much of that pricing gap is sort of attributable to service level differences? And you've improved service a good fit here. So of that gap, how much sort of is accessible to you given where service is today?\nAli Faghri: Sure James, this is Ali. So, overall, we see roughly about a mid-teens pricing upside opportunity in the years to come and it's primarily driven by three levers. First and foremost it's driven by service. So, as we continue to improve our service quality, we're going to be able to better align the price with the value we're delivering. We quantify that about half of that mid-teens pricing gap, so call it about 700, 800 basis points of pricing opportunity as we continue to improve service. And we're realizing that right now. In the third quarter, we delivered a company record damage claims ratio and our yield growth accelerated to double-digits. So, we're in the early innings of realizing that opportunity. Then you have another about 500 basis points or 5% of pricing upside that's tied to accessorials and more specifically premium services. As Mario noted earlier, we want to grow our accessorials as a percentage of overall revenue from roughly that 10% range right now to 15%-plus over time. And that's about five points of pricing upside. And then lastly, the local channel is also an opportunity for us from a pricing perspective. That's higher yielding and higher margin business for us. Currently, that's roughly about 20% of our revenue and we want to grow that to 30%-plus over time. And that's roughly about another 200 to 300 basis points of pricing upside. So, overall there's multiple different levers we can pull to grow pricing. And as we move through 2024, we would expect those to translate to very strong yield growth for us.\nJames Monigan: Got it. But given where service is today full 700 to 800 of price that is tied to service is that like fully accessible to you? Or does service need to improve further in order for you to get that 700 to 800 basis points as you move through the contract repricing?\nMario Harik: It does take time. I mean it's not like a switch where as you improve your service product, your customers will give you that premium immediately. But we're seeing -- we already have been seeing it play out in the course of 2023, when you look at the improvement we've seen in yield quarter after quarter in having those very strong contract renewals. So, currently if you look at it I mean you go back two years ago, we had a damage claims ratio of 1.2%. We're down to 0.3%, which is a company record. But our goal continues to keep on improving that. We're a customer-loving organization. We want to take care of our customers, pick up the freight on time, deliver it on time, deliver damage-free every single time. And if you think about it from that perspective, that over time earns you a premium. So, when we think of that seven to eight-point differential it's going to take us a number of years to plow through it. But that's why when we look forward we think of our ability to get this above market pricing is going to be driven by this continued improvement and continued focus on taking care of our customers.\nOperator: Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions here. So, Mario just to come back to the additional terminals and door counts. Can you give us a sense of what incremental margins overall you're assuming? And it sounds like they're reasonably high for not expecting any real OR dilution. And on that point as well, it's obviously a big purchase price, purchase price accounting takes a while to settle out, but isn't there a big D&A component from this as well? I know Kyle talked about the component before but it sounded like that was primarily for CapEx. So, it would be hopeful to hear a little bit about that. If you can maybe just finish up with what you're seeing on the demand environment haven't talked too much about that seeing a little bit of improvement in PMIs maybe some restocking ahead, but will be curious to see what you're hearing from your customers to start the year. Thanks.\nMario Harik: Thanks Brian. So, I'll start first with the return on the service centers. And we expect that to be in the -- on the long run to be in the 30% to 40% range. And I'll turn it over to Kyle shortly here to discuss the details of that. Now when you think about the customer demand environment, it is a fluid environment. It is tough to call what the macro is going to do through the balance of the year. From one perspective, you see the rates where they are from a Fed [ph] perspective. We're seeing different mixed signals. Now we do survey our customers on a regular basis. And for the first half of the year roughly two-thirds of the customers are expecting either flat or slightly improving demand. So there is a bit more optimism in the first half than what we've seen in the back half of last year. But there's even more optimism for the back half where the majority of the customers did say that they expect a pickup in demand in the back half of 2024. So we're cautiously optimistic, but it's tough to call the macro at this point. Now when you look at it more near term, you look at -- we do watch the ISM manufacturing index given two-thirds of our customers are industrial companies. And when you look through the course here of the fourth quarter, the trough was in October, November, we saw it get better in December and here in January, it even further improved the ISM posted 49 and change, which is very close to 50, which is typically your point where you start seeing an inflationary environment. So again, we're seeing demand hold. We're seeing demand slightly improve and with more optimism towards the back half of the year.\nKyle Wismans: And then just to address the CapEx question associated with Yellow. When you think about the 28 service centers, we're expecting incremental CapEx about $1 million to $2 million per site, so about $50 million to $60 million in total. Now that's not spread evenly across all 28 service centers and that's really largely tied to refreshing and refurbishing the sites bring up to standard. So it's going to cover construction, painting, rebranding. And that CapEx for those sites is included in our overall guide for the year. Some of these sites already started to work on some of the locations. So going back to Mario's earlier comments, we expect something to come online here in Q2.\nOperator: We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mario Harik for closing remarks.\nMario Harik : Thank you operator, and thanks all for joining our call today. As you can see from our results, our plan is working, and our service improvements are delivering revenue growth, margin expansion, and earnings growth. Soon we're going to start integrating to acquired service centers into our network, which is now more productive and more cost efficient. We have a lot of strong momentum here as we start 2024, and we look forward to updating you on the next quarter. Operator, you can now end the call. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Kyle Wismans",
            "content": "Thank you, Mario, and good morning everyone. I'll take you through our key financial results, balance sheet and liquidity. It was a strong fourth quarter overall. Revenue for the total company was $1.9 billion, up 6% year-over-year. This includes a 9% increase in our LTL segment. Excluding fuel, LTL revenue was up 14% year-over-year. Salary wages and benefits for LTL were 10% higher in the quarter than a year ago. This increase primarily reflects wage and benefit inflation as well as incentive compensation aligned with our strong fourth quarter performance. These impacts were mitigated by our productivity gains. We've now improved our labor hours per shipment on a year-over-year basis for four straight quarters throughout 2023. We were also more cost efficient with purchase transportation through a combination of in-sourcing and rate negotiation. Our expense for third-party carriers was $83 million in the quarter, which was down year-over-year by 22%. Depreciation expense increased year-over-year by 23%, or $13 million, as we continued to reinvest in the business. This remains our top priority for capital allocation in LTL. In the fourth quarter, our CapEx was primarily allocated to our fleet, as we purchased new tractors from the manufacturers and build more trailers in-house. Next, I'll add some detail to adjusted EBITDA starting with the company as a whole. We generated adjusted EBITDA of $264 million in the quarter, up 28% from a year ago and improved our adjusted EBITDA margin by 230 basis points. These metrics exclude the impact of real estate gains in the fourth quarter of 2022 to give you a like-to-like comparison. We had no real estate gains in the fourth quarter of 2023. Our fourth quarter corporate expense was $5 million, for a year-over-year savings of 44%, or $4 million. We're continuing to rationalize our corporate structure for the standalone business and expect to report further reductions this year. Looking solely at the LTL segment, we grew our adjusted operating income by 51% year-over-year to $160 million. And we grew adjusted EBITDA to $233 million. The gains we achieved through revenue growth and cost efficiencies more than offset the non-operational headwinds from lower fuel surcharge revenue and pension income. In our European transportation segment, adjusted EBITDA was $36 million for the quarter. Company-wide, we reported operating income of $119 million for the quarter, compared to $4 million in the prior year. Our net income from continuing operations was $58 million for diluted earnings per share of $0.49, compared with a loss of $36 million or $0.31 a year ago. This represents an improvement of $0.80 in diluted EPS from continuing operations, driven by significant year-over-year reductions in transaction and integration costs and restructuring charges. On an adjusted basis, our EPS for the quarter was $0.77, which is down 21% from a year ago. This primarily reflects the impact of real estate gains in 2022, as well as lower pension income and higher interest expense in 2023. Our acquisition of the 28 service centers closed on December 20 and did not have a material impact on our operating results in the income statement. And lastly, we generated $251 million of cash flow from continuing operations in the quarter and deployed $151 million of net CapEx, excluding spend related to the acquisition. Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $412 million of cash on hand. Combined with available capacity under committed borrowing facilities, this gave us $920 million of liquidity. We had no borrowings outstanding under our ABL facility at quarter-end. In December, we raised $985 million through a combination of $585 million of senior notes and $400 million of term loans. We used $870 million of proceeds to complete our acquisition of 28 LTL service centers and we refinanced our existing senior notes due in 2025. We now have no funded debt maturities until 2028. We also maintained all corporate and issue-level credit ratings. Our net debt leverage at year-end was three times trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. The investments we're making in the business will enhance our earnings trajectory for a high return on capital, consistent with our long-term goal of achieving an investment-grade profile. Before I close, I'll summarize the full year 2024 assumptions we provided in our investor presentation to help you with your models. They are as follows. Gross CapEx of $700 million to $800 million, interest expense of $240 million to $260 million, pension income of approximately $25 million and adjusted effective tax rate of 23% to 25% and a diluted share count of 121 million shares. Now, I'll turn it over to Ali who will cover our operating results. Hey, Jon, it's Kyle. So if you think about contract renewals right now, we did accelerate heavily in the back half from 5% to 9%. And so far in the year or in the back half we negotiated 50% of the book. So there's still some more to work through. I still think we're in a favorable market for renewals and we should expect positive momentum to carry forward here in 2024. I think renewals are probably going to follow where we see yields for the first half. So we're expecting strong yield to continue. If you think our Q1 yield guide, we think Q1 yield is going to be up high single-digit in line with what we saw in Q4. That should carry forward into our contract renewals at the start of the year. Yes, Tom. And if you think about the D&A ramp, so we are going to see increased CapEx within the LTL segment. So we'd expect about $74 million to $75 million a quarter for LTL, reflecting the increased CapEx spend. Hey Bruce, it's Kyle. I'm going to start and then I'll hand it over to Mario. So when you think about our long-term leverage outlook, our intention is one to two times trailing 12 months EBITDA. And we think we're in a great spot with the investments we made and the EBITDA we can generate to really make a lot of progress on that here in the next couple of years. And then just to address the CapEx question associated with Yellow. When you think about the 28 service centers, we're expecting incremental CapEx about $1 million to $2 million per site, so about $50 million to $60 million in total. Now that's not spread evenly across all 28 service centers and that's really largely tied to refreshing and refurbishing the sites bring up to standard. So it's going to cover construction, painting, rebranding. And that CapEx for those sites is included in our overall guide for the year. Some of these sites already started to work on some of the locations. So going back to Mario's earlier comments, we expect something to come online here in Q2."

            "name": "Mario Harik",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call. I'm here in Greenwich with Kyle Wismans, our Chief Financial Officer; and Ali Faghri, our Chief Strategy Officer. I'm pleased to report that we kept a strong year for the quarter that exceeded expectations, and we've carried that momentum into 2024. Company-wide, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $1.9 billion, which is 6% higher year-over-year. And we grew adjusted EBITDA to $264 million for an increase of 28%, excluding real estate gains in 2022. Our adjusted diluted EPS for the company was $0.77, which was also better than expected. I want to thank our team for delivering these great results in a soft freight environment. Looking at our North American LTL segment, we reported our strongest progress since we launched our LTL 2.0 plan in 2021. We grew adjusted operating income year-over-year by 51% and improved our adjusted operating ratio by 380 basis points. We delivered the best damage claims ratio in our history at 0.3%, as well as a record level of employee satisfaction. And we significantly accelerated our year-over-year yield growth, excluding fuel, to 10.3%. We also improved cost efficiency for the fourth consecutive quarter with further increases in labor productivity and linehaul and sourcing. And we continue to deploy capital efficiently as we reinvest back into the business. All of these are proof points that our plan has strong traction. And the 28 service centers we recently acquired from the Yellow Network will build on this momentum. This acquisition is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to integrate prime locations into our network to support yield growth and margin expansion. When the market recovers and industry capacity tightens, we'll be in a stronger position to serve our customers and drive profitable growth for years to come. Now, I want to share some details of the quarter, starting with the first pillar of our LTL 2.0 plan, service improvements. We improved every major component of customer service quality in the quarter, including our customer satisfaction rating, which has risen by more than 40% since 2021. Our on-time performance was three percentage points better than in the prior fourth quarter. And I mentioned that our damage claims ratio of 0.3% is a new record for us. To put that in context, it's a vast improvement from 1.2% when we launched our plan. These are metrics our customers watch closely as an indicator of service quality. Our top priority is to become the customer service leader in our industry. And we're continuing to equip our team with the tools to make this a reality. One example is the new freight airbags I spoke about on our last call. The rollout has been going well, and this solution is now installed at over 50% of our doors. The airbags have reduced damages by more than 20% at those locations, and the benefit will spread across our network. We expect to finish the installations by the middle of this year. The second pillar of LTL 2.0 is to invest in our network to drive long-term growth. We added more tractors and trailers in 2023 than any year in XPO's history, to both grow and refresh our fleet. This resulted in record network fluidity and supported our strategy to in-source more line-haul miles. On the tractor side, we purchased more than 1,400 units in 2023. This reduced our average fleet age to five years at year-end, compared with 5.9 years in 2022. On the trailer side, we manufactured over 6,400 units at our in-house facility in Arkansas, exceeding our production target. For 2024, we expect our LTL CapEx level to be in the low-teens as a percent of revenue, and again, primarily allocated to our fleet. In terms of the 28 service centers, we acquired from Yellow, the largest impact on our capital strategy is timing. We've put forward dozens of real estate investments that we plan to make over the next several years. I'll add some strategic color to my earlier comments on the acquisition. These service centers will deliver important benefits to the business for years to come. First, they'll get us closer to customers, and give us larger facilities in major metro areas. This should drive substantial cost efficiencies across our line haul, pickup-and-delivery and dock operations. Second, they'll enhance our yield growth by further improving, our service with fewer freight three handles, reduce damages, and better on-time performance. And third, that'll give us more capacity in key metros like Indianapolis, Columbus and Las Vegas. These are markets where we are currently turning away profitable customers, because we don't have enough door capacity. We plan to start bringing these locations online in April and have all of them operational within the next 12 months to 18 months. We expect the transaction to be accretive to EPS and our LTL operating ratio in 2025. This assumes no underlying recovery in industry volumes. Any market rebound would represent an upside to our baseline forecast. The third pillar of our plan is to drive above-market yield growth, which is our single biggest lever for margin improvement. You can see this dynamic in the fourth quarter when we drove yield, excluding fuel, higher year-over-year by 10.3%. This helped us deliver nearly 400 basis points of adjusted operating ratio improvement. We got there by executing on service improvements, accessorials, and volume growth within our local customer base. These are the three levers for our long-term pricing opportunity. The exciting trends in our service metrics translate to value for our customers, with a direct correlation to the price we earn. Increasingly, our customers see XPO as a high-value business partner with the resources to help them succeed. This was reflected in our contract renewal pricing, which was up year-over-year by 9% for the second consecutive quarter. Accessorials are another opportunity to grow our yield, by delivering more value through premium services. We plan to expand our range of offerings this year. We saw an early impact in the fourth quarter with the introduction of our retail store rollout offering. We already have over a dozen customers using this service to distribute critical product launches for retailers. And with the third lever, our local channel, we grew shipment counts by double digits for the third consecutive quarter. Our local sales team at year-end was over 20% larger than in 2022, reflecting the importance we place on this high-yielding margin-accretive business. So, we have a lot of avenues leading to yield growth and each step forward helps to align our pricing with the value we deliver. The fourth and final pillar of LTL 2.0 is cost efficiency. The main opportunities here are with purchase transportation, variable costs, and overhead. In the fourth quarter, we reduced our purchase transportation cost by 22% year-over-year by in-sourcing more miles and paying lower contract rates to third-party providers. We ended the quarter with less than 20% of linehaul miles outsourced, for a year-over-year reduction of 290 basis points. On a sequential basis, we reduced our reliance on outsourcing by 190 basis points. We've come a long way since the beginning of 2022 when we were outsourcing about 25% of our linehaul miles Today we're well on the way to bringing down that percentage to the low teens by 2027. Lastly, a quick update on our initiative to add driver teams and sleeper cab trucks for long hauls. The goal here is to increase the efficiency and flexibility of our linehaul network. We started putting these teams in place last quarter and we currently have over 50 teams in operation. We expect to have a few hundred long-haul teams on the road by the end of this year. This should help to accelerate our in-sourcing plan. We're also continuing to manage our variable labor costs effectively, growing our volume by more than our head count year-over-year for the fourth consecutive quarter. And the spread in the quarter was substantial. Our shipment count was up 5.7%, while our headcount was up just 1.7%. This is a credit to the team's operational discipline, supported by our proprietary technology for labor planning. In summary, in 2023, we made significant progress on our plan across the board, while laying a solid foundation for the future. We improved our operations in all four quarters of the year by generating record service levels, making strategic investments in the network, further accelerating yield growth, and operating more cost efficiently. As a result, the business performed above expectations with robust margin expansion and earnings growth and strong forward momentum. Now I'm going to hand the call over to Kyle to discuss the fourth quarter financial results. Kyle over to you. Sure, thanks, Scott. First, starting with the first quarter outlook. We typically give tonnage yield and what OR would look like. Starting with tonnage, following the gains we had in the fourth quarter, we do expect to outperform seasonality in Q1. Typically, a normal seasonality for us call it flattish tonnage sequentially from Q4 to Q1, and we expect to do better than that. So we expect Q1 tonnage should be up low single-digit somewhat in the same ZIP code as where we were in the fourth quarter on a year-on-year basis. Now, when you look at January tonnage specifically, it did do better as Ali mentioned earlier compared to seasonality on your old forward December into January. And we had a strong end of the month as well, despite the weather earlier in the month. On the yield front, we expect a strong performance for yield across the board this year. We do expect yield to be up on a year-on-year basis in the first quarter somewhere in the same ZIP code as we were in the fourth quarter year-on-year. And ultimately from our standpoint, usually typical seasonality for us Q4 to Q1 we see OR deteriorate about 40 basis points and we expect to do better than that. Now, how much better will depend on how the rest of the quarter plays out. Usually, Q1 as you know March is the big month of the quarter. But that implies roughly 300 basis points of OR improvement year-on-year. For the full year 2024, we also expect a strong year for us in terms of OR improvement. Given all the things, we're doing in yield and tonnage and cost and efficiency improvement and service improvement we expect OR to be up in the 150 to 250 basis points range for the full year. And there's a path for us to do better than the top end of the range depending here on how the year plays out. Now, taking a step back on your question on the service centers and how they impact yield. So we see a big cost benefit first and that cost benefit comes from higher efficiency and having bigger break bulks that lead to cost savings and line haul having service centers closer to the customer that leads to lower D&D cost and also lowering dock-handling costs associated with that. Now, the way they help yield is because larger service centers help improve your service product and service product in tight yield. But also, we mentioned premium services. And when you think about premium services in some markets like Las Vegas, we're tapped on capacity. And by having now the largest service center in the biggest market, we're going to be able to launch new offerings like trade shows as an example and this comes also at a higher yield and higher margin as well. Thanks, Ken. Well starting with the ramp of the service centers. Well, in terms of getting them up and running, we do expect to get them up and running in \u2013 the first dozen or so service centers over the next three to six months, the next dozen over the next six to 12 months and then the remaining four or five will go live next year call it 12 to 18 months. Now we don't anticipate an OR drag from them that would be material to our numbers. And the reason why because the majority of the service centers are in markets where we already operate. So if you think about it there is one case where we move our team, our existing team from a smaller service center to a larger service center. The carrying cost of real estate is fairly low on a per door basis but we get the immediate benefit of cost efficiencies and cost savings associated with having a larger facility to operate from. In markets where we are adding a service center and keeping the existing one in that particular case we split the team between the two service centers based on volume and we only step up if there is an inflection in volume and we have incremental volumes. So we don't anticipate the service centers to have a drag on OR this year. We do expect them to be accretive for the EBITDA. We do expect a drag on EPS, driven by the incremental debt there. And we expect them to be accretive on all these KPIs in 2025 and beyond. In terms of the long-term targets, we've always said 600 basis points. I mean at least 600 basis points. And there's nothing magical about 600 basis points, there's nothing magical about 2027. With all the momentum that we have here and with all \u2013 with the new service centers, the pricing, the service improvements, we do expect to outperform and I would hold us to get to the 70s and well into the 70s over time from an OR perspective. Thank you. I'll talk on the initiatives. And Chris the way we look at it I mean our plan involves substantial yield improvement. It does involve continuing our great service momentum or service product improvement momentum. Tonnage improvement, we do see tonnage going up for the full year but we do expect it to be up call it in the same zip code of where we were in the fourth quarter so low single-digit because our goal is to drive more yield than it is to drive volume. Similarly, our goal is to drive cost efficiencies as you mentioned. So, I'll give a quick update on the initiatives. As part of our plan is to in-source more to the third-party linehaul miles because that comes both at a cost benefit but it also comes as a service benefit when we go from using a third-party carrier with a 53-feet trailer versus having two 28-feet pups, which gives us more space gives us safe stack in the trailers where we can separate the freight physically and our drivers show up on time 100% of the time. We can continue to improve that service product. Now, that will come with cost savings here in 2024, but the longer term cost savings also come when you think of an inflection in truckload rates at some point, that's going to be obviously material savings for us from what we would be spending internally on a per mile basis versus what we're spending for third-party carriers. So, our expectation is to continue to -- we insource 290 basis points here in the fourth quarter year-on-year. We are sub-20% at this point, we're at 19 and change. And we're going to drive that in the first phase down to the low teens and beyond that as we amp up those teams as well. Thanks Chris. When you look at the local account strategy Fadi, it is a segment that we are planning on growing over the years to come here. Now, if you look back at 2023 we were run-rating at roughly 20% of our volume and revenue is generated from that channel. Now, what we have done through the course of the year is that we increased the size of our local accounts. We hired more than 20% more local sellers through the course of 2023. And the goal here through 2024 is to add roughly another 10%. So, all-in to be 30% higher on the overall sales force size that is selling to that channel. Now, as you can imagine whenever we onboard new people, it does take a ramp usually about six months for them to be fully productive and fully up and running. Now, if you look at the full year, we did improve our local accounts higher -- on a higher run rate than the rest of our book. Here in the fourth quarter, we grew our local shipments in that channel by 12% on a year-on-year basis. And we do expect to continue to see those really strong gains in that channel, since we onboarded 20% more sellers. Now in terms of the inning, I would say, we're still in the early innings in terms of results, but we are very well underway in terms of having the team and having them seen a couple of quarters of ramp here being pretty productive in 2024 and beyond. Thank you, Fadi. Stephanie, this is Mario. I'll take that. So, in 2023 first and 2022, we used to compensate predominantly our field based on EBITDA growth and EBITDA performance. But we have added a good portion of the comp plan to be focused on service quality. So as service centers and group service quality and on-time service, they effectively -- they had a good chunk of their incentive comp is based on that. Now in 2024 will be the first year where we are switching from compensating our field from EBITDA and EBITDA growth and have it be focused on OR improvement. So it's now focused on how can we expand our margins over time. Because as you know we want to incentivize effectively driving that better service product that yields to higher yield, while managing costs effectively, which would lead to OR expansion at the service center level and ultimately at the network level as well. Thanks, Tom. I'll start with the network and the capacity side and turn it over to Kyle for D&A. When you look at our network today, before the 28 service center acquisition, we were run-rating call it in the mid to high teens in terms of excess capacity in the current environment. And if we roll forward, we are adding 28 service centers, out of these roughly half of them would be additive and the other half would be ones where we are relocating from a smaller service center to a larger service center. And we roughly acquired about 3,000 doors and we would be adding a net after we're all said and done with the integration, a net 2,000 doors which is call it a 10%, 15% expansion in capacity. So once we get these service centers online, we will be in the 25% to 30% excess capacity in our network. And that's a great place to be as an LTL network, especially in a soft freight market. So this way whenever there's a freight market recovery and you see higher demand, the sort of our industry has been capacity constrained, real estate comes with a very low carrying cost and this would enable us to flex up whenever that demand comes back. So this is how we look at currently where we are and as we open up those service centers where we'll be adding a capacity perspective. And on the European sale, Bruce, our long-term plan remains to be a pure-play North American LTL carrier and selling the European business is one of our strategic priorities. But we're going to be patient. Our goal is to maximize the return we get on that business. It is a business that has a scarcity value to it. We're either number one, two or three in less-than-truckload truckload asset-light brokerage in many geographies in Western Europe, think UK, France, Spain Portugal. And it's not a matter of if, but a matter of when. And meanwhile if you take a step back, the business is performing well. Despite a soft economy in Europe with outperforming the tiers, our revenue was up in the quarter. We've improved volume every month of the quarter and further improved in the month of January. And so credit to the team's strong execution. So again, if you take a step back, it's a matter of time and at some point we'll get there. So when you take a step back on these accessorials, they are predominantly what we call premium services. So these are services that our customers are asking for, that go beyond your typical pick up a few skids of freight and get them delivered to a destination. So examples are, Kyle mentioned earlier, the retail store rollouts offering, where in that particular case, you can imagine if you have some sort of a holiday, or a new product launch, a customer needs us to ship many, many shipments, to think, it could be hundreds of shipments in a short time window, and they need somebody to coordinate all of those offerings. And that leads, obviously, to a higher price and the customer is happier because they're getting a service that they need. We do have a number of other offerings. Trade shows is a good example of that. Working with retailers that must arrive by date type offering, and many others that we are launching through the course of the year here. We do expect to get them launched -- they won't all be launched within a few quarters. Some of them will take a bit longer, that can expedite a service as an example. But as we launch these, we expect them to be accretive to yield over time. In terms of magnitude, roughly today, our accessorial as a percent of revenue is roughly around -- call it in the low double digits. And our goal is to grow that to the mid-teens as we launch these programs over the years to come. We had double-digit pricing up here in the fourth quarter, and we do expect a very strong first half of the year as well. I mean, there is an environment. If you look at our industry, it's been historically capacity constrained. When you go back before Yellow ceased operations, we didn't have enough capacity versus the demand that was out there. We are currently in a sluggish freight environment where demand is down, roughly, call it double-digit low teens, and this is when that capacity went away from the market. So whenever there is any sort \u2013 even with some of that capacity coming back into LTL, whenever there's any form of inflection in demand, there wouldn't be enough doors and service centers in our industry. So you would see pricing accelerate accordingly. For us specifically, we also have all the company specific initiatives we're driving between driving better service, which comes at a premium, between driving premium services, between driving also expansion of our local channels. All of these would be accretive to yield as well. So double-digit pricing is not out of the question. Thank you. Thanks, Bascome. So first, starting with the sales compensation. So it depends on what type of salary you are in the organization. We changed the comp plan accordingly. So if you're in the local channel, the goal is to grow your book as opposed to, for example, if you're into different types of accounts, you're going to have to focus on profitability more. But generally, the theme is that, if you look at a service center they are compensated based on the OR improvement for that specific service center. If you're a local account executive, you're incentivized to grow your book and a component of your compensation is driven by operating ratio as well. If you're handling larger accounts then the lion's share of your compensation is around OR and profit improvement as well associated with that. So this is how typically sales are compensated but it is more driven by your book of business as opposed to your region or the network as a whole. Now in terms of senior exec compensation that's typically part of our proxy. But we incentivize our senior executives based on a combination of OR growth, EBITDA growth and the TSR associate holder value creation as well. The framework would be very similar to what we had in the past. When we think about the service centers in the near-term ahead of any type of macro infection whenever it comes, there is a big benefit we're going to get from cost savings as I mentioned earlier on by having larger facilities. And if you think about what we bought from the Yellow Network, we bought some of the largest service centers. You look at a site like Carlisle [ph], you can't get any more than 120 acres of land right off I-76 and I-81 where we have a 300-door service center now in that market. Same thing with Nashville. We got a 40, 50-acre facility west of Nashville with more than 200 doors in it. So when you think about those larger facilities that enable you to run more efficiently, your line haul, your D&D, your dock operations, that's going to lead to cost savings as soon as we start moving into them. The other benefit is some markets, when you look at a market like Brooklyn, New York or Columbus or Indianapolis or Las Vegas, we're tapped out on capacity today. So we don't have enough doors in those markets. And by having this incremental capacity, we already have customers that are ready to go where we can onboard them as we open up those service centers. And we have two small service centers. One is in Eau Claire Wisconsin, one is Nogales, Arizona, where we \u2013 these are net adds or new markets. But these are small service centers, where we already have demand lined up based on existing customer relationships we have as well. When we think about the rollout timing, we prioritize those service centers those markets where we are capacity constrained today. So in a softer freight environment, where we see that, we don't have enough capacity. And the second priority is based on cost efficiency, so the service centers that will create the most amount of cost efficiency. And when we think about the opening schedule, I'll call it, over the next 3 months to 18 months, it will be we're going to drive through it regardless of what the freight the markets are doing. This would be a reasonable time frame in terms of bringing those terminals up to our standards and doing the re-branding and these kind of things to get them up and running. And then we -- for us if you -- I mentioned, this earlier on, if you think about the headcount there's no need for us to hire people ahead of volume. So what we do is that we either relocate the existing team into a larger facility, or we add a facility to an existing market where we split a team from an existing facility into two different service centers, so there's no incremental cost associated with that. If we do see an inflection in volume, where the markets are getting better then we step up to be able to support that volume. And importantly, Jordan, if you look at our year in 2023, we were able to improve efficiency every single quarter of the year. So we have the great ability between operational discipline that Dave and the team are bringing to the table, supported by our proprietary technology to be able to run our network very efficiently from a labor standpoint. I mean, whenever you open up those sites, you do have a small headwind in cost, but that for us would be a very short lived. I mean, you're talking 30 to 90 days of cost headwind as you move into a larger facility. And predominantly, it comes from the carrying cost of the incremental doors. But Brandon keep in mind that the cost of a door in our P& L is sub 5% as a percent of total. So it's a small incremental cost associated with that. But when you think about the immediate efficiency, you gain in pickup and delivery and line haul in all of those pieces, this is where we see that this again drag that is short-lived. It doesn't have a meaningful impact on the network as a whole. And to give you an example over the last couple of years here, we've opened up a dozen service centers and each one of them was accretive within 30 to 60 days. Each one of them is exceeding our return hurdles as well. So we feel very good about our ability to get those on-boarded with very minimal drag. And that's the reason why, we don't expect any drag from an OR perspective from the service center. And finally, I'd say, also with having Dave on the team, he has an incredible amount of experience in terms of adding capacity to a network and making sure, it's accretive pretty quickly. Thank you. It does take time. I mean it's not like a switch where as you improve your service product, your customers will give you that premium immediately. But we're seeing -- we already have been seeing it play out in the course of 2023, when you look at the improvement we've seen in yield quarter after quarter in having those very strong contract renewals. So, currently if you look at it I mean you go back two years ago, we had a damage claims ratio of 1.2%. We're down to 0.3%, which is a company record. But our goal continues to keep on improving that. We're a customer-loving organization. We want to take care of our customers, pick up the freight on time, deliver it on time, deliver damage-free every single time. And if you think about it from that perspective, that over time earns you a premium. So, when we think of that seven to eight-point differential it's going to take us a number of years to plow through it. But that's why when we look forward we think of our ability to get this above market pricing is going to be driven by this continued improvement and continued focus on taking care of our customers. Thanks Brian. So, I'll start first with the return on the service centers. And we expect that to be in the -- on the long run to be in the 30% to 40% range. And I'll turn it over to Kyle shortly here to discuss the details of that. Now when you think about the customer demand environment, it is a fluid environment. It is tough to call what the macro is going to do through the balance of the year. From one perspective, you see the rates where they are from a Fed [ph] perspective. We're seeing different mixed signals. Now we do survey our customers on a regular basis. And for the first half of the year roughly two-thirds of the customers are expecting either flat or slightly improving demand. So there is a bit more optimism in the first half than what we've seen in the back half of last year. But there's even more optimism for the back half where the majority of the customers did say that they expect a pickup in demand in the back half of 2024. So we're cautiously optimistic, but it's tough to call the macro at this point. Now when you look at it more near term, you look at -- we do watch the ISM manufacturing index given two-thirds of our customers are industrial companies. And when you look through the course here of the fourth quarter, the trough was in October, November, we saw it get better in December and here in January, it even further improved the ISM posted 49 and change, which is very close to 50, which is typically your point where you start seeing an inflationary environment. So again, we're seeing demand hold. We're seeing demand slightly improve and with more optimism towards the back half of the year. Thank you operator, and thanks all for joining our call today. As you can see from our results, our plan is working, and our service improvements are delivering revenue growth, margin expansion, and earnings growth. Soon we're going to start integrating to acquired service centers into our network, which is now more productive and more cost efficient. We have a lot of strong momentum here as we start 2024, and we look forward to updating you on the next quarter. Operator, you can now end the call. Thank you."

            "name": "Ali Faghri",
            "content": "Thank you, Kyle. I'll start with our LTL segment, which reported another quarter of profitable growth. On a year-over-year basis, we increased our shipments per day by 5.7% in the quarter, led by 12% growth in our local sales channel. This resulted in growth in tonnage per day of 2%. Our weight per shipment was down 3.4% year-over-year, which was notably less of a decline for the second consecutive quarter. On a monthly basis, our October tonnage per day was up 2.5% year-over-year. November was down 0.5%, and December was up 3.6%. Looking just at shipments per day, October was up 6.2% year-over-year, November was up 3.7%, and December was up 6.6%. In January, our tonnage per day was down 1.1% year-over-year, while shipment count was up 1.4%. The transportation industry was disrupted by weather events in January, but we saw a rebound more recently and ended the month with stronger volumes. And sequentially, both our tonnage and shipment count increased from December to January, outperforming seasonality. We also outperformed on yield in the fourth quarter, delivering a second consecutive quarter of acceleration. We grew yield, excluding fuel, by a strong 10.3% compared with the prior year. Importantly, our underlying pricing trends are strong as we continue to align our pricing with the better service we're providing. Our contract renewal pricing was up 9% in the quarter compared with a year ago. Turning to margin. Our fourth quarter adjusted operating ratio was 86.5%, which was an improvement of 380 basis points year-over-year. Our strong margin performance was primarily driven by yield growth and underpinned by our cost initiatives and productivity gains. Sequentially, our adjusted OR increased by 30 basis points, which outperformed seasonality by 280 basis points. Moving to our European business. We delivered revenue growth of 2% year-over-year, despite ongoing challenges in the macro environment. This growth was supported by strong pricing, which outpaced inflation. And in some regions like the UK, we grew adjusted EBITDA versus the prior year, reflecting disciplined cost control. While our volume declined slightly year-over-year, we outperformed the industry and we mitigated the decline with new customer wins as the quarter progressed. And this trend improved in January. The team is executing well and earning new business from high-caliber customers. This momentum, together with the growth of our sales pipeline, should continue to strengthen our position in key European regions. I'll close with a summary of the three main achievements you heard from us this morning, as they relate to our expectations for a strong 2024. First, we're continuing to deliver more value for customers in the form of service quality with our metrics at record levels. And we're on an excellent trajectory. Second, we accelerated yield growth to double digits as we exited 2023, and we expect to deliver another robust yield performance this year with a direct benefit to profitability. And third, we're showing that we can operate more productively by leveraging our technology and improving our cost to serve. In short, we've taken major strides with our network operations, and we're still in the early innings of significantly improving our operating ratio. Now we'll take your questions. Operator, please open the line for Q&A. Sure, Stephanie. This is Ali. So we're seeing very strong pricing trends, as we enter 2024. For the first quarter in particular, we would expect our yield on an ex fuel basis to be up somewhere in the similar range, as we just delivered here in the fourth quarter. So call it roughly about 10% growth. Now on a full year basis, we would expect yield to be up somewhere in that mid to high single-digit range. I would add that there's certainly a path to do better than that. It's still very early in the year. So we'll update you as the year progresses. A lot of that yield growth and the outperformance versus the industry is being driven by our internal initiatives. If you think about our service improvement, we're at record levels here in the fourth quarter. We're continuing to lean more into premium services. We rolled out retail store rollout here in the fourth quarter. We have a lot of traction there. And as Mario just noted, a lot of momentum on the local side as well too and this is higher yielding and margin-accretive business. So, overall, we feel very good about the yield outlook here in 2024 and expect it to be a strong year for us overall. Sure, Jordan. This is Ali. I'll then pass it to Mario. So for the full year, as we noted, we expect a much higher contribution from yield and volume. We're being very disciplined on the type of volume we're onboarding onto the network and you should expect that to continue through this year. So overall for the full year, we'd expect tonnage to be up somewhere in that low single-digit range for the full year and then yield somewhere in that mid- to high single-digits or better. Now keep in mind, we do have tougher comps in the second half of the year. It is still early in the year and obviously the macro can be a swing factor. In terms of the new service centers, we don't expect any sort of meaningful contribution from volume this year. We would expect contribution from volume to be sub 1% of incremental volumes so not a meaningful number overall. Sure James, this is Ali. So, overall, we see roughly about a mid-teens pricing upside opportunity in the years to come and it's primarily driven by three levers. First and foremost it's driven by service. So, as we continue to improve our service quality, we're going to be able to better align the price with the value we're delivering. We quantify that about half of that mid-teens pricing gap, so call it about 700, 800 basis points of pricing opportunity as we continue to improve service. And we're realizing that right now. In the third quarter, we delivered a company record damage claims ratio and our yield growth accelerated to double-digits. So, we're in the early innings of realizing that opportunity. Then you have another about 500 basis points or 5% of pricing upside that's tied to accessorials and more specifically premium services. As Mario noted earlier, we want to grow our accessorials as a percentage of overall revenue from roughly that 10% range right now to 15%-plus over time. And that's about five points of pricing upside. And then lastly, the local channel is also an opportunity for us from a pricing perspective. That's higher yielding and higher margin business for us. Currently, that's roughly about 20% of our revenue and we want to grow that to 30%-plus over time. And that's roughly about another 200 to 300 basis points of pricing upside. So, overall there's multiple different levers we can pull to grow pricing. And as we move through 2024, we would expect those to translate to very strong yield growth for us."

I will now turn the call over to XPO's Chief Executive Officer, Mario Harik. Mr. Harik, you may begin.\nMario Harik: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call. I'm here in Greenwich with Kyle Wismans, our Chief Financial Officer, and Ali Faghri, our Chief Strategy Officer. This morning we reported financial results that were well above expectations for growth and profitability despite a soft market for freight transportation. It was a strong third quarter for us company-wide. We grew revenue year-over-year to $2 billion and improved our adjusted EBITDA to $278 million, an increase of 6% year-over-year. Both segments of the business grew adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS for the company was $0.88, which was also higher than expected. I want to use my comments this morning to give you a progress report on the four pillars of our plan for LTL 2.0, starting with customer service, where we've made great progress this quarter. Our claims ratio for damages was 0.4%, an improvement from 0.7% in the prior quarter. To put that in context, when we launched LTL 2.0 nearly two years ago, our claims ratio was 1.2%. So we've been steadily making good on our promise to elevate service. Our third quarter claims ratio is our best result ever. And in the month of September, we exited the quarter with the best damage frequency level in our history. Another key service metric is on-time performance. This was eight percentage points better in the quarter compared with last year. We're very focused on ensuring that our service standards remain high as we grow. In the third quarter, our shipment count was significantly higher as we took more volume into our network, while at the same time, we delivered meaningful service improvements. And we're already taking the next steps forward with our investments in service. This includes enhancing our training programs and loading procedures and equipping our field operations with new service tools. The high caliber straps and airbag systems we're rolling out are generating positive returns in a short period of time. For example, in the service centers with the new airbag systems, we're already seeing a 20% improvement in damage frequency. Our strong commitment to service is critical for our customers and while we've made significant progress, we can clearly see the runway we have for further improvement. Our top priority is to be the best in class LTL service provider in the coming years. The second pillar of LTL 2.0 is to invest in our network. Our business has historically generated a high return on invested capital. Since the launch of LTL 2.0, we've added 10,000 trailers, 2,000 tractors, and over 500 net new doors. This has allowed us to take on more freight for our customers while maintaining strong network fluidity. More than two-thirds of our 2023 CapEx is being deployed to increase the capacity of our fleet. Year-to-date, we've added more than 1,000 tractors, which brought down the average tractor age to 5.2 years from 5.9 years at the end of 2022. And we're on track to exceed our production target of 6,000 new traders this year. Year-to-date, we've manufactured over 4,900 traders at our in-house facility in Arkansas. In addition, we expanded our service center doors in the Atlanta and Dallas metro areas in July and we broke ground on a new facility in central Florida, which is a key growth market for us. This is consistent with the plan we outlined that we're adding new doors in markets where our investments in capacity can sustain more growth over time. To-date, we've added 531 net new doors against a target of 900 and we expect to open the remainder by early 2024, primarily at existing terminals. These targeted expansions are performing well and exceeding our return hurdles. I want to touch on one of the long-term targets we introduced with LTL 2.0, which was for CapEx allocation of 8% to 12% of revenue on average through 2027. Given the recent market dynamics and the opportunity at hand, we're accelerating the pace of that spend. As a result, our CapEx this year will be 12% to 13% of revenue and will likely continue to exceed our target range in the near term. The third pillar of our plan is to accelerate yield growth. In the third quarter, we focused on strengthening our underlying pricing trends, such as contract renewal pricing and executed a number of other initiatives to align the price we receive with the value we deliver. Yield is our single biggest opportunity for margin improvement, and you saw this impact in our earnings release this morning. We grew yield, excluding fuel, by 6.4% year-over-year, representing a significant acceleration from the first half of the year. We see a double-digit pricing opportunity that we expect to capture over the coming years through three primary levers. First, as we continue to improve our service, customers are willing to pay a premium price for the value we deliver. We're seeing this with both contract renewals and new business. We also see a significant opportunity to grow our accessorial revenue, including a range of value added services such as retail store rollouts and grocery consolidations. These are services that our customers are asking for. And lastly, we're focused on growing our local customer base, which is a higher margin business for us. In the third quarter, we achieved double-digit shipment growth in our local sales channel, and we're expanding our local sales force to reflect the scale of this opportunity. So while we had strong yield growth in the quarter, the key point is the momentum it indicates going forward. We're confident that we'll continue to improve our yield in the coming years. The final pillar of LTL 2.0 is cost efficiency, specifically with purchase transportation, variable costs and overhead. In the third quarter, we reduced our purchase transportation cost by 21% year-over-year by covering more line haul miles in-house while also paying lower contract rates for the miles we outsource. We ended the quarter with 21.5% of line haul miles outsourced to third parties, which was a 200 basis points reduction year-over-year. Even though we purchased more transportation on a short-term basis to cover the recent inflection in volume. Our plan is to accelerate bringing more miles in-house with initiatives tailored to our line hall network. For example, we're in the process of adding more driver teams and sleeper trucks for long distance halls. We're targeting a few hundreds of these teams to be in operation by the end of 2024, which will increase the efficiency and flexibility of our service. We're targeting at least a 50% reduction in third-party line haul miles as a percent of total by 2027 compared with 2021. Another margin opportunity we have with variable costs is labor. We managed this effectively in the third quarter. Our headcount and labor hours per day were roughly flat year-over-year, while our shipment count was up by high single-digits. Our ability to realize these productivity gains while also improving our service metrics reflects the strong execution of our operational teams and the strength of our proprietary technology. That touches on the key points of our plan and the progress we made in the third quarter, with more to follow. We're generating record service levels, gaining profitable market share and driving yield higher. These are the critical levers of margin expansion in our LTL business. We're continuing to make strategic investments in our network and we have the agility to capitalize on changes in market conditions. At the same time, we're becoming more cost-efficient with our operations so we can translate revenue growth into earnings at a higher rate. We remain solidly on track to deliver on our outlook of at least 600 basis points of adjusted operating ratio improvement through 2027. Before I close, I want to mention that this week marks our one year anniversary as a standalone LTL provider in North America. I couldn't be more proud of the progress we've made and will continue to make as we work to realize the full potential of XPO. We're well underway in executing on the strategy we initiated at the end of 2021. We're a focused, high-energy, customer-loving organization, and we'll continue to build on our momentum. I want to take this opportunity to thank our thousands of dedicated employees for their world-class support of XPO. We have a phenomenal team driving our strategy to be the best in the industry. Now I'm going to head the call over to Kyle to discuss the third quarter results. Kyle, over to you.\nKyle Wismans: Thank you, Mario, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through our key financial results, balance sheet, and liquidity. Revenue for the total company was $2 billion, up 2% year-over-year, and up 3% sequentially from the second quarter. In our LTL segment, revenue was up 2% year-over-year, and up 8% sequentially. Excluding fuel, LTL revenue was up 8% year-over-year and up 7% sequentially. Salary, wages and benefits for LTL were 10% higher in the quarter than a year ago. The increase was primarily related to higher incentive compensation to account for the team's strong third quarter performance, as well as the impact of wage inflation. Our improvements in productivity partially offset these costs. We handled more shipments with lower headcount and fewer labor hours than in the third quarter a year ago. Importantly, it was the third consecutive quarter that shipment count grew at a faster pace than labor hours. And the spread has widened sequentially with each period. In the third quarter, our shipment count per day grew by 8% year-over-year, while labor hours increased by less than 1%. We were also more cost-efficient with purchase transportation through a combination of insourcing and rate negotiation. Our expense for third-party carriers was $97 million in the quarter, which was down year-over-year by 21%. Depreciation expense in the quarter increased by 29% or $15 million reflecting our commitment to reinvesting in the business. This remains our top priority for capital allocation. In the third quarter, our CapEx was primarily allocated to producing new tractors from the OEMs and manufacturing more trailers in-house. Next, I'll add some detail to adjusted EBITDA, starting with the company as a whole. We generated Adjusted EBITDA of $278 million in the quarter, which was up 6% from a year ago, reflecting a year-over-year increase in both North American LTL and the European business. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 14%, representing a year-over-year improvement of 50 basis points company-wide. And we reduced third quarter corporate expense to $7 million as we continued to rationalize our corporate cost structure for the standalone business. This was a year-over-year savings of 67% or $14 million. Looking at just the LTL segment, we grew adjusted EBITDA year-over-year to $241 million. Our revenue growth and cost efficiencies more than offset non-operational headwinds from lower fuel surcharge revenue and pension income. In our European transportation segment, adjusted EBITDA increased to $44 million for the quarter. Companywide we reported operating income of $154 million for the quarter, up 11% year-over-year. Our net income from continuing operations was $86 million per quarter, representing diluted earnings per share of $0.72 cents. This compares to income of $92 million and diluted EPS of 79 cents a year ago. The year-over-year decline in third quarter net income was primarily due to an $11 million decrease in pension income and a $6 million increase in interest expense this year. We also had $8 million of transaction and integration costs related to the arts of spin-off and another $1 million of restructuring charges across our segments. These costs stepped down materially from the first half of the year. On an adjusted basis, our EPS for the quarter was $0.88 cents, which is down 7% from a year ago, also reflecting the impact of lower pension income and higher interest expense. And lastly, we generated $236 million cash flow from continuing operations in the quarter and deployed $133 million of net CapEx. Moving to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $355 million cash on hand. Combined with available capacity under committed borrowing facilities, this gave us $944 million of liquidity. We had no borrowings outstanding under our ABL facility at Quarter End. And our net debt leverage was 2.2 times trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. Our capital structure gives us the financial flexibility to execute on the significant growth opportunities we have at XPO. Before I wrap up, I want to highlight some updates to our full year 2023 planning assumptions. We now expect that gross CapEx will be in the range of $675 million to $725 million this year, given the opportunities we have to invest in network capacity to drive long-term growth. We're also projecting interest expense of $170 million to $175 million, pension income of $15 million to $20 million, and an effective tax rate of 23% to 24%. Our assumption for diluted share count remains unchanged at 118 million shares for the full year. Now, I'll turn it over to Ali, who will cover our operating results.\nAli Faghri: Thank you, Kyle. I'll start with the operating results for our LTL segment. In the third quarter, we had a year-over-year increase in shipment count of 7.8%, led by 13% growth in our local sales channel. As a result, our tonnage per day increased by 3.1%. This more than offset the impact of macro conditions, which continue to put pressure on our industry. Our weight per shipment declined 4.3 percent in the quarter compared with a year ago, which was slightly better than in the second quarter. There are two key drivers behind the solid growth we reported. First, we're continuing to gain market share because of the significant service improvements we're making in the network. And second, when Yellow exited the LTL market, we were well positioned to on-board incremental freight given that we've been investing in expanding our network since 2021. We also demonstrated that we have the operational discipline to take on more volume while at the same time continuing to improve our service levels. On a monthly basis, our July tonnage per day was up 4.2% year-over-year, August was up 3.3% and September was up 2.2%. Looking just at shipments per day, July was up 8.8% year-over-year, August was up 8.3% and September was up 6.6%. Our shipment count increased sequentially by more than 1,000 shipments per day every month of the quarter from July to September. On a two-year stack basis, monthly tonnage and shipment count also improved each month throughout the third quarter. With October almost complete, our preliminary tonnage per day is up approximately 2.5% year-over-year and shipment count is up 6%. On a sequential basis from September, October tonnage and shipment count are down 2.5% with both outperforming seasonality. Looking at yield in the third quarter, we grew yield, excluding fuel by 6.4% year-over-year, which is an acceleration from the second quarter. On a sequential basis, we increased yield ex fuel quarter-over-quarter, outperforming typical seasonality by 290 basis points. And importantly, we accelerated yield growth as the quarter progressed, supported by our strong customer relationships and pricing initiatives. Our underlying pricing trends also strengthened with contract renewal pricing up 9% in the quarter compared with a year ago. We expect year-over-year yield growth ex fuel to further accelerate in the fourth quarter and we're excited about the long-term impact that our yield initiatives will have on profitability. Turning to margin performance. Our third quarter adjusted operating ratio was 86.2%, which was 60 basis points higher than a year ago. On a sequential basis, we improved adjusted OR by 140 basis points compared with the second quarter. This outperformed seasonality by 370 basis points. Moving to our European business. We delivered another solid financial quarter with adjusted EBITDA growth of 2% compared with a year ago. This was supported by strong pricing, which outpaced inflation as well as cost discipline. While macro conditions in Europe remain soft overall, our sales pipeline is robust and the team continues to execute well especially in the UK, where we drove positive organic growth in the quarter. I'll close with the drivers behind our momentum, including the strong outperformance of our third quarter operating ratio. First, we continue to make significant improvements in service across the board and delivered record results. We also accelerated yield growth in the quarter and will accelerate it again in the current quarter. We expect our robust yield performance to continue into 2024. And we operated far more productively by leveraging our technology and effectively managing our labor costs. In summary, our strategy is working. XPO in North America is stronger as a standalone LTL company with focused execution and our results will continue to reflect that. Now we'll take your questions. Operator, please open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question today is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions.\nChristian Wetherbee: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Maybe first, if we can start on operating ratio and how you might think about the opportunity as you move through the fourth quarter and then maybe bigger picture for next year. So I guess could you help us a little bit with what you view as normal seasonality and sort of what you think maybe you could do relative to normal seasonality in 4Q?\nMario Harik: Hey, Chris, this is Mario. Starting with first -- with the fourth quarter, we can give you some colors like we usually do on tonnage, yield and ultimately, what OR would do and then given outlook for 2024. On the tonnage side, following our market share gains in the third quarter, we expect to be in line with seasonality in the fourth quarter, which implies Q4 tonnage being up low single digits on a year-on-year basis. Now for us, on the tonnage side, normal seasonality Q3 to Q4 is a 4% sequential decline. October was better than seasonality, but this was also driven by a small increase in volume earlier in the month, given the cyber-attack and another LTL carrier. And we'll give another update on November tonnage and in early December. On the yield front, as we gain traction in our initiatives, yield growth improved through the third quarter, and we do expect Q4 yield ex fuel to accelerate versus Q3 and on a year-on-year basis to be in the high single-digit range improvement. And ultimately, for OR in the fourth quarter, we typically see -- seasonally, we see a deterioration of OR of 310 basis points from Q3 to Q4 and we expect to outperform that seasonality by somewhere in the 100 basis point range. So on a year-on-year basis, this implies an improvement of roughly around 200 basis points in OR and the magnitude of the outperformance will depend on what the tonnage environment does in the back half of the quarter. As you know, Q4 is usually a tough quarter to predict with the holidays. Now for 2024, we do expect a strong year. The biggest swing factor will be the macro and what the macro does through the course of 2024. But as said, we have a lot of company-specific initiatives, as we have mentioned in our opening remarks, our service product continues to improve, heading company records, our yield is accelerating here in the fourth quarter, and we expect a strong year for yield in 2024. And we expect to continue to make great progress driving cost efficiencies including line haul in-sourcing and accelerating that and productivity improvements in labor as well. So from an OR perspective for 2024, we do expect a strong year, but we'll see what the macro takes us here over the quarters to come.\nChristian Wetherbee: That's very helpful. I appreciate all that color. And just one follow-up on 2024. As you think about sort of the longer-term operating ratio targets that you guys laid out through 2027. Given what you've seen with the Post-Yellow world, the pricing opportunity and some of the significant improvements you're making around the service side, is it reasonable to assume or can you give us a sense of what the cadence of that overall OR improvement might look like? Is it front-end loaded? Is it back-end loaded? Any kind of thoughts about how that cadence should present itself, particularly given what we're seeing in the market currently?\nMario Harik: Yes. So first, on the number itself, we've always said it's at least 600 basis points by 2027. But we're not stopping at 600, and we're not starting in 2027. And I think there's a cadence of improvement based on what we're seeing short term, it's fair to assume that we can get there faster. But obviously, as we execute, we're going to keep on posting these numbers and going from there. And it will depend a bit, obviously, short term, what the macro does in 2024. But we expect, obviously, a strong outlook going from here.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. I want to dig into the pricing opportunity a little bit. So I think you said contract renewal is up 9%. Is that a number that you view as sustainable over the next few quarters? Help us think about -- I don't know if you guys announced a GRI or what you're planning on the GRI. And then maybe touch on the accessorial value-added opportunity. Are we seeing any of that benefit yet? Or is that still all incremental?\nKyle Wismans: Hey, Scott, it's Kyle. So getting about the contract renewal rates that you said, 9% is what we're seeing in Q3. And relative to GRI, just one clarification, too, is that the contract renewals will impact most of the business. So we'll go through annual cycle increase. So we expect those to be in the high single-digit range. And then when you think about the GRI for us, we're going to go through our annual process and we'll follow our normal time line. So we communicate to customers here in the fourth quarter and then go live with increases in Q1. And then I think your second question was on accessorial, Scott. Accessorials are one of many yield initiatives we're excited about. Currently, that accessorials are about 10% of our revenue. We're targeting to get close to 15%. That's a combination of offerings we have today as well as some new service offerings. And then in Q2, we did begin rolling out new tools. That helped us really capture more location-based and time-based accessorials. We started seeing impact from that in Q3. We also have a team that's working on growing our premium service offering. So those should help us really drive that high single-digit impact in Q4 as well as positive yield in 2024.\nScott Group: Okay. Thanks. And then you guys are talking a lot about the claims, seeing some nice improvement. Is there any way to help us think about what does lower claims actually mean for the model? Does it mean lower cost? Does it mean better price? And how quickly do we see any sort of benefit of lower claims showing up in the model?\nMario Harik: Thanks, Scott. This is Mario. When you look at claims, it's one of our core areas of focus as a company is improving service for the customers. And in our industry, whenever we provide better service and we keep on that trajectory, and eventually, our goal is to be the best-in-class and to get to 8.1% claims ratio. Customers are willing to pay a higher premium for the value that we would offer there. So what you would see is an impact on pricing. And we already are seeing that here in the third quarter. As Kyle just mentioned, our contract renewals are up to 9%, and most of that was driven by these improvements in service. And to keep in mind, Scott, also when we started LTL 2.0, our damage claims were at 1.2%. And we've been able to take this here in the third quarter to accompany best through a multitude of initiatives all the way from incentive comp to local incentive comp programs for, we call the Gladiator to incentivize our supervisors to load with quality to rolling out new technology and how we rate our traders and moving forward, the combination of airbags as we're launching in all service centers, higher-quality straps and improvements across the board, all of these would lead to an even need higher premium on price over time. So that's how -- what we see the impact on the medium to long term of that continued improvement in service. There is a benefit on the P&L. Obviously, our claims dollars amount would go down, but that's small in comparison when you look at it versus the improvements in pricing we can pick up over the quarters and years to come.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.\nKenneth Hoexter: Great. Thank morning, Mario and team. Just talk about the accelerating yield yet you only target about 100 basis points to outperform seasonality when you just did 370 basis points. Maybe you can kind of delve into the why we should or what the opportunity is to see better versus why you think it maybe takes a step back from outperforming seasonality versus what you just posted?\nAli Faghri: Sure, Ken. This is Ali. So we do expect to outperform seasonality by 100 basis points. That's going to be primarily driven by our stronger yield growth. Just keep in mind, we are coming off nearly 400 basis points of outperformance versus seasonality in the third quarter. So we're delivering 100 basis points on top of that 400 that we delivered in the third quarter. I'd also point out that on a year-over-year basis, that 100 basis points of outperformance versus seasonality would imply 200 basis points of year-over-year OR improvement and about 20% EBITDA growth in our LTL segment ex real estate. There are also a few short-term impacts to consider from the investments we're making. As we continue to invest in incremental capacity that comes with higher depreciation. That was about 120 basis points year-over-year headwind to OR in the third quarter. We would expect a similar impact in Q4. We're also investing and growing our local sales force. And overall, we do expect these investments to generate strong returns for us over the medium to long term, but they will have a modest cost impact over the next few quarters. So we feel comfortable with the roughly 100 basis points of outperformance versus seasonality for OR. It is still very early in a dynamic environment. And ultimately, that magnitude of outperformance is going to depend on how tonnage progresses through the rest of this quarter.\nKenneth Hoexter: Great. Thanks for the clarification, Ali. That's great stuff. And great detail on the progress so far. So congratulations on a great quarter. Can you talk a bit about your thoughts on, I guess, two things. One, on the yellow, I guess you have 294 service centers. So how are you thinking about positioning into this? Are there different locations you may want to expand on? How do you think that process goes? Do you think it brings more than needed capacity into the sector? And does that impact the ability to get pricing? And then on that pricing, can you talk about how much of -- have you already renewed versus what is still to come?\nMario Harik: Yes. Sure, Ken. This is Mario. On the yellow service centers, it is an opportunity for us to potentially accelerate our capacity growth. We are participating in the process, and we'll see how things play out over the next few months. Now our focus from a physical network capacity perspective has been to grow the network in markets where we see higher demand from our customers over time. And we don't look at these things for the next couple of years, but we look at it over the next 10-plus years in terms of where the freight markets will be. We'll have more demand in them over time as well. So as I mentioned earlier, we've opened up so far more than 500 net new doors. Here in the quarter, we expanded two service centers into Atlanta and Dallas Metro areas, and we just broke out in a service center in Central Florida and we're going to continue executing on that plan. But I get these yellow service centers, we'll see where the process rolls out, and it will help us accelerate that plan over the years to come. Now in terms of capacity coming back into the network, it's tough to estimate what percent of these service centers would be back in the hands of LTL carriers. We estimate it to be roughly around 50%, but it will depend on other users for the land or these locations for other industrial-type applications. Now for the service centers that will come back into LTL, it will take time. Keep in mind that a lot of these service centers to go back as the process has to play out. And then a lot of these service centers to get back into operations, they take time to get up to the standards of the different carriers. That could be -- we estimate it to be in the year plus range for them to get back into the industry. And they will get back into the hands of more premium priced operator. So you'd have a rising tide for pricing across the entire industry. And the last thing I'll say also, Ken, that capacity went out at a time where shipment count in our industry is down, the underlying demand is down 10% across all the different carriers. So whenever the macro tightens again, you don't have enough capacity in LTL to handle all of that freight. I'll turn it over to Kyle to discuss yield.\nKyle Wismans: Yes. From a renewal standpoint, Ken, the cadence for contract renewals is pretty level across the year. We have a disproportionately slightly higher amount in Q4 that will cycle through here in the quarter. But it's fairly even across the year.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Fadi Chamoun with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.\nFadi Chamoun: Thank you. Good morning, Mario and team. Just a question on yield. You mentioned double-digit pricing opportunity in coming years from service, accessorial and local customer base. When you look at this kind of past quarter, third quarter, where are you having more success? It sounds like you're getting some decent penetration in the local customer base side? And what's the kind of areas where you're seeing greater contribution to the year? Accessorials, local customer base or is fairly spread across the three kind of levers of pricing?\nMario Harik: So Fadi, when you look at the three of them, the biggest impact in the third quarter was the improvement of service because when you look at our claims ratio, I think 0.4%, customers seeing the trend of improvement and those relationships with our customers to keep on improving over time as well. This is where we're seeing the most amount of success that these contract renewals are coming in, and customers understand that we are investing in the network, we're investing in people and to be able to support and service them the right way, and that's leading to higher yield and price gains. On the accessorials side, we're still early innings, and we believe these over the quarters to come as we launch the premium services we mentioned and as we sell them to existing customers and new customers, we see that's going to happen again over the quarters and years to come to bridge that accessorial gap. On the local side, we're making a lot of progress. I mean, here in the third quarter, we increased our shipment count in the local channel by 13% on a year-on-year basis. However, this channel is more impacted by the softer macro. So the weight per shipment is still significantly down in the local channel, so although we're making progress on it, we're still not seeing the impact on yield, but as we start seeing tonnage in that channel improved because we're gaining market share, you would see that becoming a tailwind for yield over the quarters and years to come as well.\nFadi Chamoun: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your questions\nThomas Wadewitz: Yeah, good morning, and congratulations on the strong progress on the OR and service and pricing, all those things that I think are really positive. Wanted to see, Mario, if you could comment a little bit on the kind of underlying trend in freight and how you kind of weave that in? It seems like the, I guess, the monthly tonnage numbers are I don't know if it's kind of stabilizing or how you want to view it, but they're a little bit lighter maybe at the end of the quarter. So I don't know if you think underlying freight market is stable or if you could offer some trends, some thoughts on that. And also, how do you think about that change in weight per shipment looking forward? Does that become more neutral? Or should we think about that even into '24 that that's maybe a bit of a continuing reduction in weight per shipment?\nMario Harik: Thanks, Tom. I'll start by first covering the demand side, and Ali can walk through the cadence in the quarter as well because our comps are not similar to the other carriers in the back half of this year compared to last year. So there are a few things we can drill into it with more details. But if you take a step back on the customer demand side, it is a fluid environment, and it's hard to call what the macro will do when we look at the demand environment. More recently, the underlying environment has been bouncing along the bottom since the month of April of this year. So it's been softer demand overall for LTLs. Now in terms of outlook, we do survey our customers on a quarterly basis, our top customers. And even the last survey last week, for the fourth quarter, our customers were more balanced. So some customers were seeing some strength in demand, while others were seeing softer in demand. But generally, it was balanced in terms of where we were earlier in the year. Heading into 2024, we are hearing more optimism from customers about demand picking up. But again, it's not a big number, but it's still -- that is more customers that expect a demand pickup versus customers that expect more softness or flat. Now when you look at some of the indices we look at, well, two-thirds of our customers are industrial companies and the ISM manufacturing index is a good proxy that pick up a bit to 49% last month. It's still under 50%, but it did pick up a bit. And same thing on the retail side, we saw retail sales accelerate to 0.7% month-over-month in September. And that was also slightly better than expected. So we're seeing things remain soft, slightly improving with a bit more optimism going to the first half of next year, but it's still very tough to call the macro at this point. There's a lot of cross signals here.\nAli Faghri: Good morning, Tom. This is Ali. In terms of the cadence through the quarter, as Mario mentioned, we did have tougher compares in the second half of the year last year as our market share gains were accelerating. So if you look at it on a two-year stack basis, our shipment counts and tonnage both accelerated throughout the third quarter and that two-year acceleration continued into the month of October. Also, if you look at it just on a shipment count basis, we saw our shipment counts improve by more than 1,000 shipments each month of the third quarter from July to September. And then as we moved into October, as we noted, October outperformed seasonality relative to the month of September.\nThomas Wadewitz: One quick follow-up. Do you have any thoughts you can offer on line haul miles and kind of where you're going in terms of making further gains? You've improved that quite a bit with the in-sourcing. Just wondering how you think about the opportunity is going forward. Do you improve a lot from that? I think you said like 21.5% outsourced. Thanks.\nMario Harik: Yes. So for the third quarter, we were outsourced 21.5%, where we in-sourced roughly 200 basis points on a year-on-year basis. Now keep in mind, Tom, it's something we did invest in on a sequential basis, Q2 to Q3. We did get a bit more third-party line haul miles given the inflection in volume. But moving forward, we expect to move quickly on in-sourcing. As I mentioned earlier, we are excited about the program we're launching called the Road Flex operation. It's a program where we have teams of drivers and sleeper cap trucks that move freight across longer hauls. And this will enable us to move faster on the in-sourcing process. We do expect to be -- to in-source at least 50% of the miles by 2027. But given this new program, we're launching, we expect to accelerate that over the quarters and years to come here.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions\nRavi Shanker: Thanks, everyone. So good traction with the service improvements. I'm just trying to get an understanding of what percentage of the fruit on this tree are low-hanging versus higher up? I'm just trying to get a sense of whether we can expect this traction of improvement to continue in the coming quarters? Or does it get incrementally a little bit harder from here?\nMario Harik: Yes. So Ravi, from our perspective, our top priority, one of the top priorities is to improve service and continue to improve service for our customers. And our goal is to be best in class and get to a 0.1% claims ratio over time. Now we've made tremendous progress. You look from end of 2021 through Q3 of this year, we went from 1.2% damage claims ratio down to 0.4%. However, the improvement from here won't be linear, and it will take time. It's not something that every quarter, we're going to post a 0.3% improvement from 0.7% to a 0.4%. Now we have rolled out multiple new initiatives heading into 2024 with Dave coming on board and the operating team are implementing a number of initiatives, including higher-quality straps, new airbag systems that we are launching across all of our service centers, and Ravi, I'll tell you here from the first couple of service centers we've launched, we've seen an incremental reduction of more than 20% of damages just with these new tools and programs that we launch that we're very excited about. And we're also enhancing our training programs and how we load trailers taking it to the next level as well. And I mentioned earlier line haul in-sourcing. That's another measure of service improvement because today, when we use a third-party carrier, they typically have 53 feet trailers that don't have the bars in them. We call it the SaveStack system to separate freight from effectively having 2 decks of freight. But we have that in our equipment. So as we make progress on in-sourcing third-party line haul, we will continue to see these improvements in service as well as we all these things out. But again, the progress is fantastic. September was a company record in damage frequency. So how many damages do we cause versus the shipments that we move. And October got even better than the month of September. So great trajectory ahead. But again, it won't be linear over the quarters and years to come.\nRavi Shanker: Got it. Very helpful, Mario. Maybe just a follow-up on the same topic. And as you had said earlier that better service begets better pricing and better share. What does that conversion process look like? How does that take? Is that kind of immediate? Is that one contract cycle? Does that take a couple of years? Again just trying to figure out kind of what the longer-term trajectory of this improvement looks like.\nKyle Wismans: Hey, Ravi, it's Kyle. So when you think about it, we're going to go through all of our -- again, about 20% of our customers are using a standard tariff really that will get impacted by the GRI. The other 80% will go through contract renegotiations. That cycle is fairly consistent, meaning we cover the same number of contracts almost every quarter. The fourth quarter is slightly higher. But we'll see that improvement basically progress for the next several quarters to capture a lot of the service improvements that we're seeing right now in the network.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your questions.\nJason Seidl: Thank you, Operator. Mario and team, good morning, guys. Congrats on the progress in the LTL 2.0. I wanted to focus a little bit on your cost per shipment. How should we think about the increases in the cost per shipment or the decreases as we roll into 2024, especially around you rolling out that airbag system throughout the rest of the network?\nKyle Wismans: Hey, Jason. It's Kyle. So when you think about cost per shipment, let me start a little bit with Q3 and then some of the costs we saw that were slightly higher in the quarter. So from a cost per shipment standpoint, overall, we're down about 2%. There's progress made in a lot of areas. Mario talked about the insurance and claims. That was down almost 35% in the quarter. We also saw a drop in fuel. There's a couple of areas where we saw kind of higher transitory costs in the third quarter. That's going to include some of the purchased transportation expense. So we were about $10 million sequentially, and that's reflecting the effort needed really to make sure we can service the additional shipments in the network. We'd expect as we continue to ramp up the line haul and sourcing for that to come down both in Q4 and into '24.\nJason Seidl: So overall, you would expect cost per shipment to trend down into '24. Just wanted to clarify that?\nKyle Wismans: No, I think we're expecting more cost productivity into Q4 and into '24.\nJason Seidl: Okay. Fair enough. And then as a follow-up, I know we haven't really brought it up because it hasn't been a focus, but maybe a little bit of an update on Europe. And then as we roll into the New Year, do you think the M&A market might be favorable enough to bring that back up again?\nMario Harik: Jason, our long-term plan remains to be a pure-play North American LTL carrier. But in the meantime, our European business continues to perform really well. When you look at the European economy, it's been softer here over the last couple of quarters, but the team was able to deliver great results, growing EBITDA on a year-on-year basis. I'm just fighting on all cylinders. We're onboarding more customers, we are getting more cost efficient in our European business and the team is performing well. But long-term, our goal continues to be a pure-play North American LTL company.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to see if you could comment, Mario, on capacity available in the network and what's actually the limitation of the bottleneck now. I know last quarter, you talked about needing to add some more. You talked about the doors you're adding, the new service center you broke ground on. Where does that stand? And how do you see the limitations at this point you're running up into any conditions that need a little bit more capital expenditure, especially when you're boosting that up here in the fourth quarter looks like a pretty big increase to get to that midyear target -- midpoint of the target rather you just raised?\nMario Harik: In the third quarter, we had high-teens excess capacity in our network from a physical perspective, so in terms of how many doors we have. But as you know, this is not evenly distributed across our network. In some markets, we are bumping against capacity limits, but in many, many markets, we have available capacity from a doors perspective. And our service center expansion plan thus contemplate those markets where we see that higher demand from customers, where we're going to expand physical capacity. But we were run rating in the high teens. Our goal is to be in the 20% to 25% range is where we would like to be on a longer-term basis. Now in terms of rolling stock capacity, we have had tremendous progress since the beginning of LTL 2.0. We've added more than 10,000 new traders over the last 1.5 years, 2 years. We've added 2,000 tractors to our fleet, and this is enabling us to be able to take on more customers, but also run more efficiently. You see it here in the third quarter, we were able to handle 8% more shipments, while gaining productivity, I mean, our headcount was down on a year-on-year basis, and our labor hours were up slightly versus an 8% increase in shipments and equipment help us manage that. And on the people side, we're staffed for current volumes, but we do have headroom as well. And if the demand continues to increase, we can step up for that. The current paper markets are much easier to hire into. We have our driver schools as well. So we feel good from a people perspective. But generally, if you take a step back, we feel great from a capacity perspective, and we continue to invest in the network, and we're well positioned to capitalize on any upswings in freight.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Okay. Great. So as a quick follow-up. Maybe you can -- looking longer term, you've been able to sort of bridge the different buckets performance and productivity of pricing yield accessorials all things we're talking about here in terms of starting to narrow the gap with some of your peers. I just wondered if you could lay out some of the thoughts in terms of where those pieces are going to come from and if you're able to quantify them in some of those buckets like accessorials, yields, productivity, et cetera? Thanks.\nMario Harik: Thank you. The biggest component is going to come from yield. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we see a double-digit incremental yield opportunity over the coming years through the three main levers I mentioned, which is one is around service and continuing to get this higher price from customers who understand we're investing in the network and investing in the business, that's roughly half the yield opportunity to bridge the gap. And the other half is we expect for the accessorials go from roughly 10% of revenue to the 15-plus percent of revenue range based on the premium services we are implementing. What I like about this program, these are services that our customers are asking for. So we're taking care of the customer, and we're making a higher yield and a higher margin. And then finally, on the local channel side, by growing our local sales force. And here so far this year, we've increased our sales team account by 10% to 15% so far. And our goal is to get to more than 30% increase in overall sales headcount by end of next year, and that's enabling us to gain market share in that local channel that would also help bridge the gap. But the lion's share of the opportunity does come from price. The second category is around in-sourcing third-party line haul and we are accelerating that with our Road Flex team out and our new program for key drivers, and we will get higher service and lower cost, which is also really good. And we're going to continue to improve efficiency as well. So when you combine all of these things, again, yield is number one by a long shot, and then all the other areas will help making sure that we are running more efficiently as well.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions.\nStephanie Moore: Hi. Good morning. Thank you.\nMario Harik: Thank you.\nStephanie Moore: I guess you touched on a little bit of this and just in the previous question, but maybe just to double-click on it a little bit more. Can you talk a little bit about kind of the labor additions that you've had to make, just given the disruption from the post-yellow bankruptcy, where you think you kind of are positioned today, adequately staffed? What areas were you have added? Maybe you noted a little bit on the sales force and then kind of your view as we go through 2024 kind of incremental hiring needs. Thanks.\nAli Faghri: Sure, Stephanie. This is Ali. So if you look at the third quarter, our headcount was down slightly on a year-over-year basis, and that's relative to shipment counts up high single-digits. So we did a great job managing headcount relative to the volumes in the network. Also, if you look at it at a labor hours perspective, labor hours were up less than 1% year-over-year, again, versus shipment counts up 8% year-over-year. And more importantly, that spread between labor hours and shipment counts accelerated through the year from low single-digits in the first quarter to high single-digits in the third quarter. Now as we think about the fourth quarter, we would expect total headcount and labor hours for 4Q to be roughly the same as the third quarter on both a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis. We've done a really good job again in managing productivity in the third quarter. We expect that to continue into 4Q and then into 2024 as well. So we are staffed for current volumes, and we have some headroom. If demand does increase, we want to make sure we're staffed for that as well. I think the positive side is the labor market is looser than it has been in recent years. So we're confident in our ability to flex up labor as needed. And we're going to continue to manage headcount effectively relative to the volumes we're moving through the network.\nStephanie Moore: Got it. Thank you. And then just a follow-up. Can you talk a little bit about as you think about kind of going into 2024, your thoughts in terms of incentive compensation, if maybe you're looking to align metrics both from the top and then all the way down to the terminal level with kind of new targets? Any changes in philosophy there as you kind of prepare for 2024.\nMario Harik: Thanks, Stephanie. This is Mario. So this last year and the one prior in 2022 as well, we did change our incentive comp structure. It used to be only based on EBITDA growth on a year-on-year basis, but we had a good portion of the incentive comp plan switch to also focus on quality and on-time service. And that was part of the reason why we were able to drive meaningful improvement in both of these categories here through the course of the year since we started LTL 2.0. Now if you look moving forward, we are contemplating a change to switch from having EBITDA as being the compensation driver. And this is for field operations at the service center level and at the regional level to using OR expansion as being the key metric for profit improvement for the compensation program. We're still in the early innings here, there's still a few months here before we saw 2024, but that's one change we are contemplating for next year.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your questions.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks. Good morning. Mario, I was hoping you could touch on CapEx. You mentioned it's going to be above your long-term guidance range here in the end of the year for this year. And it sounds -- I heard that it was going to be elevated again next year in the way you positioned it. Just kind of curious if that's your anticipation? And is it predominantly tractor shares or new doors. Just if you could kind of hone in a little bit on where the excess spending will be? And curious if you're spending anything in Europe because that is picking up. I know that, that's an asset that may not be with you forever, but it's -- just curious if that's an area where you're having to increase CapEx as well. Thanks.\nKyle Wismans: Hey, Scott, it's Kyle. So as we mentioned earlier, this year, we think we're going to be in that 12% to 13% range. And if you think about the investments we made in the last 18 months, that includes over 2,000 tractors and 10,000 trailers, that's really helped enable the share gains in recent disruption. So if you think about more specifically what's -- what we're investing in right now put us above that 12% range, really two things I can point to. One, we're going to produce more trailers at our Searcy facility. Initially in the year, we're thinking 6,000. We're not going to produce more about 7,000 trailers, and the second thing is something we mentioned earlier on the call, our sleeper cab initiative. So we're going to bring about 100 tractors in the network to do that. For us, it's going to do a couple of things. It will help us accelerate line haul in-sourcing, there's obviously a service benefit and a cost benefit there. But both of these efforts are really pull forward of capacity investments for us. And if you think about the investments we make in total, in general, we expect very high returns from our LTL investments in upwards of 30%. So we think this is the right place for us to be investing in the company.\nScott Schneeberger: Great. Thanks. I appreciate that. Go ahead.\nKyle Wismans: Yes, I was going to say, the only thing to touch on from your question was Europe. So Europe is about 10% of our gross CapEx in general. That's been about pretty consistent for the business and will remain there.\nScott Schneeberger: All right. Thanks, Kyle. I appreciate that. For my follow-up real quick. Just you mentioned at the top of the call, the eight percentage points of on-time improvement year-over-year. That sounds impressive. I'm sure that goes into helping you interact for your sales folks on new business wins. Just curious if you could put that a little bit more into perspective, how is that trending? Is that something that's now that you've seen the first month of the fourth quarter? Is that something that you're going to continue to see trending very well here through the end of the year?\nMario Harik: Yes. Absolutely. When you look at all of our service metrics here in the month of October, we've seen a step-up from where we were in the third quarter as well. I mentioned earlier, for example, I mean, on time continues to do really well and our network fluidity best it's been in a long, long while, which is great to see. And our customers appreciate that. And similarly on the damages side in terms of damage frequency, we've seen a further improvement from September was a company record, dating back to 1996, and October was even better than September.\nOperator: Thank you. We've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call over to Mario Harik for closing remarks.\nMario Harik: Thank you, operator, and thank you all for joining us today. As you saw from what we reported this morning, we're in a strong position as we begin our second year as a standalone LTL business in North America. Our solid momentum is driven by continued execution of our LTL 2.0 plan and expands our entire business from revenue, earnings and yield growth to significant service improvements, operating efficiencies and market share gains. We're still in the early innings here, and there's a lot more we'll achieve. We look forward to speaking with you all on our next call. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kyle Wismans",
            "content": "Thank you, Mario, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through our key financial results, balance sheet, and liquidity. Revenue for the total company was $2 billion, up 2% year-over-year, and up 3% sequentially from the second quarter. In our LTL segment, revenue was up 2% year-over-year, and up 8% sequentially. Excluding fuel, LTL revenue was up 8% year-over-year and up 7% sequentially. Salary, wages and benefits for LTL were 10% higher in the quarter than a year ago. The increase was primarily related to higher incentive compensation to account for the team's strong third quarter performance, as well as the impact of wage inflation. Our improvements in productivity partially offset these costs. We handled more shipments with lower headcount and fewer labor hours than in the third quarter a year ago. Importantly, it was the third consecutive quarter that shipment count grew at a faster pace than labor hours. And the spread has widened sequentially with each period. In the third quarter, our shipment count per day grew by 8% year-over-year, while labor hours increased by less than 1%. We were also more cost-efficient with purchase transportation through a combination of insourcing and rate negotiation. Our expense for third-party carriers was $97 million in the quarter, which was down year-over-year by 21%. Depreciation expense in the quarter increased by 29% or $15 million reflecting our commitment to reinvesting in the business. This remains our top priority for capital allocation. In the third quarter, our CapEx was primarily allocated to producing new tractors from the OEMs and manufacturing more trailers in-house. Next, I'll add some detail to adjusted EBITDA, starting with the company as a whole. We generated Adjusted EBITDA of $278 million in the quarter, which was up 6% from a year ago, reflecting a year-over-year increase in both North American LTL and the European business. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 14%, representing a year-over-year improvement of 50 basis points company-wide. And we reduced third quarter corporate expense to $7 million as we continued to rationalize our corporate cost structure for the standalone business. This was a year-over-year savings of 67% or $14 million. Looking at just the LTL segment, we grew adjusted EBITDA year-over-year to $241 million. Our revenue growth and cost efficiencies more than offset non-operational headwinds from lower fuel surcharge revenue and pension income. In our European transportation segment, adjusted EBITDA increased to $44 million for the quarter. Companywide we reported operating income of $154 million for the quarter, up 11% year-over-year. Our net income from continuing operations was $86 million per quarter, representing diluted earnings per share of $0.72 cents. This compares to income of $92 million and diluted EPS of 79 cents a year ago. The year-over-year decline in third quarter net income was primarily due to an $11 million decrease in pension income and a $6 million increase in interest expense this year. We also had $8 million of transaction and integration costs related to the arts of spin-off and another $1 million of restructuring charges across our segments. These costs stepped down materially from the first half of the year. On an adjusted basis, our EPS for the quarter was $0.88 cents, which is down 7% from a year ago, also reflecting the impact of lower pension income and higher interest expense. And lastly, we generated $236 million cash flow from continuing operations in the quarter and deployed $133 million of net CapEx. Moving to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $355 million cash on hand. Combined with available capacity under committed borrowing facilities, this gave us $944 million of liquidity. We had no borrowings outstanding under our ABL facility at Quarter End. And our net debt leverage was 2.2 times trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. Our capital structure gives us the financial flexibility to execute on the significant growth opportunities we have at XPO. Before I wrap up, I want to highlight some updates to our full year 2023 planning assumptions. We now expect that gross CapEx will be in the range of $675 million to $725 million this year, given the opportunities we have to invest in network capacity to drive long-term growth. We're also projecting interest expense of $170 million to $175 million, pension income of $15 million to $20 million, and an effective tax rate of 23% to 24%. Our assumption for diluted share count remains unchanged at 118 million shares for the full year. Now, I'll turn it over to Ali, who will cover our operating results. Hey, Scott, it's Kyle. So getting about the contract renewal rates that you said, 9% is what we're seeing in Q3. And relative to GRI, just one clarification, too, is that the contract renewals will impact most of the business. So we'll go through annual cycle increase. So we expect those to be in the high single-digit range. And then when you think about the GRI for us, we're going to go through our annual process and we'll follow our normal time line. So we communicate to customers here in the fourth quarter and then go live with increases in Q1. And then I think your second question was on accessorial, Scott. Accessorials are one of many yield initiatives we're excited about. Currently, that accessorials are about 10% of our revenue. We're targeting to get close to 15%. That's a combination of offerings we have today as well as some new service offerings. And then in Q2, we did begin rolling out new tools. That helped us really capture more location-based and time-based accessorials. We started seeing impact from that in Q3. We also have a team that's working on growing our premium service offering. So those should help us really drive that high single-digit impact in Q4 as well as positive yield in 2024. Yes. From a renewal standpoint, Ken, the cadence for contract renewals is pretty level across the year. We have a disproportionately slightly higher amount in Q4 that will cycle through here in the quarter. But it's fairly even across the year. Hey, Ravi, it's Kyle. So when you think about it, we're going to go through all of our -- again, about 20% of our customers are using a standard tariff really that will get impacted by the GRI. The other 80% will go through contract renegotiations. That cycle is fairly consistent, meaning we cover the same number of contracts almost every quarter. The fourth quarter is slightly higher. But we'll see that improvement basically progress for the next several quarters to capture a lot of the service improvements that we're seeing right now in the network. Hey, Jason. It's Kyle. So when you think about cost per shipment, let me start a little bit with Q3 and then some of the costs we saw that were slightly higher in the quarter. So from a cost per shipment standpoint, overall, we're down about 2%. There's progress made in a lot of areas. Mario talked about the insurance and claims. That was down almost 35% in the quarter. We also saw a drop in fuel. There's a couple of areas where we saw kind of higher transitory costs in the third quarter. That's going to include some of the purchased transportation expense. So we were about $10 million sequentially, and that's reflecting the effort needed really to make sure we can service the additional shipments in the network. We'd expect as we continue to ramp up the line haul and sourcing for that to come down both in Q4 and into '24. No, I think we're expecting more cost productivity into Q4 and into '24. Hey, Scott, it's Kyle. So as we mentioned earlier, this year, we think we're going to be in that 12% to 13% range. And if you think about the investments we made in the last 18 months, that includes over 2,000 tractors and 10,000 trailers, that's really helped enable the share gains in recent disruption. So if you think about more specifically what's -- what we're investing in right now put us above that 12% range, really two things I can point to. One, we're going to produce more trailers at our Searcy facility. Initially in the year, we're thinking 6,000. We're not going to produce more about 7,000 trailers, and the second thing is something we mentioned earlier on the call, our sleeper cab initiative. So we're going to bring about 100 tractors in the network to do that. For us, it's going to do a couple of things. It will help us accelerate line haul in-sourcing, there's obviously a service benefit and a cost benefit there. But both of these efforts are really pull forward of capacity investments for us. And if you think about the investments we make in total, in general, we expect very high returns from our LTL investments in upwards of 30%. So we think this is the right place for us to be investing in the company. Yes, I was going to say, the only thing to touch on from your question was Europe. So Europe is about 10% of our gross CapEx in general. That's been about pretty consistent for the business and will remain there."

            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call. I'm here in Greenwich with Kyle Wismans, our Chief Financial Officer, and Ali Faghri, our Chief Strategy Officer. This morning we reported financial results that were well above expectations for growth and profitability despite a soft market for freight transportation. It was a strong third quarter for us company-wide. We grew revenue year-over-year to $2 billion and improved our adjusted EBITDA to $278 million, an increase of 6% year-over-year. Both segments of the business grew adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS for the company was $0.88, which was also higher than expected. I want to use my comments this morning to give you a progress report on the four pillars of our plan for LTL 2.0, starting with customer service, where we've made great progress this quarter. Our claims ratio for damages was 0.4%, an improvement from 0.7% in the prior quarter. To put that in context, when we launched LTL 2.0 nearly two years ago, our claims ratio was 1.2%. So we've been steadily making good on our promise to elevate service. Our third quarter claims ratio is our best result ever. And in the month of September, we exited the quarter with the best damage frequency level in our history. Another key service metric is on-time performance. This was eight percentage points better in the quarter compared with last year. We're very focused on ensuring that our service standards remain high as we grow. In the third quarter, our shipment count was significantly higher as we took more volume into our network, while at the same time, we delivered meaningful service improvements. And we're already taking the next steps forward with our investments in service. This includes enhancing our training programs and loading procedures and equipping our field operations with new service tools. The high caliber straps and airbag systems we're rolling out are generating positive returns in a short period of time. For example, in the service centers with the new airbag systems, we're already seeing a 20% improvement in damage frequency. Our strong commitment to service is critical for our customers and while we've made significant progress, we can clearly see the runway we have for further improvement. Our top priority is to be the best in class LTL service provider in the coming years. The second pillar of LTL 2.0 is to invest in our network. Our business has historically generated a high return on invested capital. Since the launch of LTL 2.0, we've added 10,000 trailers, 2,000 tractors, and over 500 net new doors. This has allowed us to take on more freight for our customers while maintaining strong network fluidity. More than two-thirds of our 2023 CapEx is being deployed to increase the capacity of our fleet. Year-to-date, we've added more than 1,000 tractors, which brought down the average tractor age to 5.2 years from 5.9 years at the end of 2022. And we're on track to exceed our production target of 6,000 new traders this year. Year-to-date, we've manufactured over 4,900 traders at our in-house facility in Arkansas. In addition, we expanded our service center doors in the Atlanta and Dallas metro areas in July and we broke ground on a new facility in central Florida, which is a key growth market for us. This is consistent with the plan we outlined that we're adding new doors in markets where our investments in capacity can sustain more growth over time. To-date, we've added 531 net new doors against a target of 900 and we expect to open the remainder by early 2024, primarily at existing terminals. These targeted expansions are performing well and exceeding our return hurdles. I want to touch on one of the long-term targets we introduced with LTL 2.0, which was for CapEx allocation of 8% to 12% of revenue on average through 2027. Given the recent market dynamics and the opportunity at hand, we're accelerating the pace of that spend. As a result, our CapEx this year will be 12% to 13% of revenue and will likely continue to exceed our target range in the near term. The third pillar of our plan is to accelerate yield growth. In the third quarter, we focused on strengthening our underlying pricing trends, such as contract renewal pricing and executed a number of other initiatives to align the price we receive with the value we deliver. Yield is our single biggest opportunity for margin improvement, and you saw this impact in our earnings release this morning. We grew yield, excluding fuel, by 6.4% year-over-year, representing a significant acceleration from the first half of the year. We see a double-digit pricing opportunity that we expect to capture over the coming years through three primary levers. First, as we continue to improve our service, customers are willing to pay a premium price for the value we deliver. We're seeing this with both contract renewals and new business. We also see a significant opportunity to grow our accessorial revenue, including a range of value added services such as retail store rollouts and grocery consolidations. These are services that our customers are asking for. And lastly, we're focused on growing our local customer base, which is a higher margin business for us. In the third quarter, we achieved double-digit shipment growth in our local sales channel, and we're expanding our local sales force to reflect the scale of this opportunity. So while we had strong yield growth in the quarter, the key point is the momentum it indicates going forward. We're confident that we'll continue to improve our yield in the coming years. The final pillar of LTL 2.0 is cost efficiency, specifically with purchase transportation, variable costs and overhead. In the third quarter, we reduced our purchase transportation cost by 21% year-over-year by covering more line haul miles in-house while also paying lower contract rates for the miles we outsource. We ended the quarter with 21.5% of line haul miles outsourced to third parties, which was a 200 basis points reduction year-over-year. Even though we purchased more transportation on a short-term basis to cover the recent inflection in volume. Our plan is to accelerate bringing more miles in-house with initiatives tailored to our line hall network. For example, we're in the process of adding more driver teams and sleeper trucks for long distance halls. We're targeting a few hundreds of these teams to be in operation by the end of 2024, which will increase the efficiency and flexibility of our service. We're targeting at least a 50% reduction in third-party line haul miles as a percent of total by 2027 compared with 2021. Another margin opportunity we have with variable costs is labor. We managed this effectively in the third quarter. Our headcount and labor hours per day were roughly flat year-over-year, while our shipment count was up by high single-digits. Our ability to realize these productivity gains while also improving our service metrics reflects the strong execution of our operational teams and the strength of our proprietary technology. That touches on the key points of our plan and the progress we made in the third quarter, with more to follow. We're generating record service levels, gaining profitable market share and driving yield higher. These are the critical levers of margin expansion in our LTL business. We're continuing to make strategic investments in our network and we have the agility to capitalize on changes in market conditions. At the same time, we're becoming more cost-efficient with our operations so we can translate revenue growth into earnings at a higher rate. We remain solidly on track to deliver on our outlook of at least 600 basis points of adjusted operating ratio improvement through 2027. Before I close, I want to mention that this week marks our one year anniversary as a standalone LTL provider in North America. I couldn't be more proud of the progress we've made and will continue to make as we work to realize the full potential of XPO. We're well underway in executing on the strategy we initiated at the end of 2021. We're a focused, high-energy, customer-loving organization, and we'll continue to build on our momentum. I want to take this opportunity to thank our thousands of dedicated employees for their world-class support of XPO. We have a phenomenal team driving our strategy to be the best in the industry. Now I'm going to head the call over to Kyle to discuss the third quarter results. Kyle, over to you. Hey, Chris, this is Mario. Starting with first -- with the fourth quarter, we can give you some colors like we usually do on tonnage, yield and ultimately, what OR would do and then given outlook for 2024. On the tonnage side, following our market share gains in the third quarter, we expect to be in line with seasonality in the fourth quarter, which implies Q4 tonnage being up low single digits on a year-on-year basis. Now for us, on the tonnage side, normal seasonality Q3 to Q4 is a 4% sequential decline. October was better than seasonality, but this was also driven by a small increase in volume earlier in the month, given the cyber-attack and another LTL carrier. And we'll give another update on November tonnage and in early December. On the yield front, as we gain traction in our initiatives, yield growth improved through the third quarter, and we do expect Q4 yield ex fuel to accelerate versus Q3 and on a year-on-year basis to be in the high single-digit range improvement. And ultimately, for OR in the fourth quarter, we typically see -- seasonally, we see a deterioration of OR of 310 basis points from Q3 to Q4 and we expect to outperform that seasonality by somewhere in the 100 basis point range. So on a year-on-year basis, this implies an improvement of roughly around 200 basis points in OR and the magnitude of the outperformance will depend on what the tonnage environment does in the back half of the quarter. As you know, Q4 is usually a tough quarter to predict with the holidays. Now for 2024, we do expect a strong year. The biggest swing factor will be the macro and what the macro does through the course of 2024. But as said, we have a lot of company-specific initiatives, as we have mentioned in our opening remarks, our service product continues to improve, heading company records, our yield is accelerating here in the fourth quarter, and we expect a strong year for yield in 2024. And we expect to continue to make great progress driving cost efficiencies including line haul in-sourcing and accelerating that and productivity improvements in labor as well. So from an OR perspective for 2024, we do expect a strong year, but we'll see what the macro takes us here over the quarters to come. Yes. So first, on the number itself, we've always said it's at least 600 basis points by 2027. But we're not stopping at 600, and we're not starting in 2027. And I think there's a cadence of improvement based on what we're seeing short term, it's fair to assume that we can get there faster. But obviously, as we execute, we're going to keep on posting these numbers and going from there. And it will depend a bit, obviously, short term, what the macro does in 2024. But we expect, obviously, a strong outlook going from here. Thanks, Scott. This is Mario. When you look at claims, it's one of our core areas of focus as a company is improving service for the customers. And in our industry, whenever we provide better service and we keep on that trajectory, and eventually, our goal is to be the best-in-class and to get to 8.1% claims ratio. Customers are willing to pay a higher premium for the value that we would offer there. So what you would see is an impact on pricing. And we already are seeing that here in the third quarter. As Kyle just mentioned, our contract renewals are up to 9%, and most of that was driven by these improvements in service. And to keep in mind, Scott, also when we started LTL 2.0, our damage claims were at 1.2%. And we've been able to take this here in the third quarter to accompany best through a multitude of initiatives all the way from incentive comp to local incentive comp programs for, we call the Gladiator to incentivize our supervisors to load with quality to rolling out new technology and how we rate our traders and moving forward, the combination of airbags as we're launching in all service centers, higher-quality straps and improvements across the board, all of these would lead to an even need higher premium on price over time. So that's how -- what we see the impact on the medium to long term of that continued improvement in service. There is a benefit on the P&L. Obviously, our claims dollars amount would go down, but that's small in comparison when you look at it versus the improvements in pricing we can pick up over the quarters and years to come. Yes. Sure, Ken. This is Mario. On the yellow service centers, it is an opportunity for us to potentially accelerate our capacity growth. We are participating in the process, and we'll see how things play out over the next few months. Now our focus from a physical network capacity perspective has been to grow the network in markets where we see higher demand from our customers over time. And we don't look at these things for the next couple of years, but we look at it over the next 10-plus years in terms of where the freight markets will be. We'll have more demand in them over time as well. So as I mentioned earlier, we've opened up so far more than 500 net new doors. Here in the quarter, we expanded two service centers into Atlanta and Dallas Metro areas, and we just broke out in a service center in Central Florida and we're going to continue executing on that plan. But I get these yellow service centers, we'll see where the process rolls out, and it will help us accelerate that plan over the years to come. Now in terms of capacity coming back into the network, it's tough to estimate what percent of these service centers would be back in the hands of LTL carriers. We estimate it to be roughly around 50%, but it will depend on other users for the land or these locations for other industrial-type applications. Now for the service centers that will come back into LTL, it will take time. Keep in mind that a lot of these service centers to go back as the process has to play out. And then a lot of these service centers to get back into operations, they take time to get up to the standards of the different carriers. That could be -- we estimate it to be in the year plus range for them to get back into the industry. And they will get back into the hands of more premium priced operator. So you'd have a rising tide for pricing across the entire industry. And the last thing I'll say also, Ken, that capacity went out at a time where shipment count in our industry is down, the underlying demand is down 10% across all the different carriers. So whenever the macro tightens again, you don't have enough capacity in LTL to handle all of that freight. I'll turn it over to Kyle to discuss yield. So Fadi, when you look at the three of them, the biggest impact in the third quarter was the improvement of service because when you look at our claims ratio, I think 0.4%, customers seeing the trend of improvement and those relationships with our customers to keep on improving over time as well. This is where we're seeing the most amount of success that these contract renewals are coming in, and customers understand that we are investing in the network, we're investing in people and to be able to support and service them the right way, and that's leading to higher yield and price gains. On the accessorials side, we're still early innings, and we believe these over the quarters to come as we launch the premium services we mentioned and as we sell them to existing customers and new customers, we see that's going to happen again over the quarters and years to come to bridge that accessorial gap. On the local side, we're making a lot of progress. I mean, here in the third quarter, we increased our shipment count in the local channel by 13% on a year-on-year basis. However, this channel is more impacted by the softer macro. So the weight per shipment is still significantly down in the local channel, so although we're making progress on it, we're still not seeing the impact on yield, but as we start seeing tonnage in that channel improved because we're gaining market share, you would see that becoming a tailwind for yield over the quarters and years to come as well. Thanks, Tom. I'll start by first covering the demand side, and Ali can walk through the cadence in the quarter as well because our comps are not similar to the other carriers in the back half of this year compared to last year. So there are a few things we can drill into it with more details. But if you take a step back on the customer demand side, it is a fluid environment, and it's hard to call what the macro will do when we look at the demand environment. More recently, the underlying environment has been bouncing along the bottom since the month of April of this year. So it's been softer demand overall for LTLs. Now in terms of outlook, we do survey our customers on a quarterly basis, our top customers. And even the last survey last week, for the fourth quarter, our customers were more balanced. So some customers were seeing some strength in demand, while others were seeing softer in demand. But generally, it was balanced in terms of where we were earlier in the year. Heading into 2024, we are hearing more optimism from customers about demand picking up. But again, it's not a big number, but it's still -- that is more customers that expect a demand pickup versus customers that expect more softness or flat. Now when you look at some of the indices we look at, well, two-thirds of our customers are industrial companies and the ISM manufacturing index is a good proxy that pick up a bit to 49% last month. It's still under 50%, but it did pick up a bit. And same thing on the retail side, we saw retail sales accelerate to 0.7% month-over-month in September. And that was also slightly better than expected. So we're seeing things remain soft, slightly improving with a bit more optimism going to the first half of next year, but it's still very tough to call the macro at this point. There's a lot of cross signals here. Yes. So for the third quarter, we were outsourced 21.5%, where we in-sourced roughly 200 basis points on a year-on-year basis. Now keep in mind, Tom, it's something we did invest in on a sequential basis, Q2 to Q3. We did get a bit more third-party line haul miles given the inflection in volume. But moving forward, we expect to move quickly on in-sourcing. As I mentioned earlier, we are excited about the program we're launching called the Road Flex operation. It's a program where we have teams of drivers and sleeper cap trucks that move freight across longer hauls. And this will enable us to move faster on the in-sourcing process. We do expect to be -- to in-source at least 50% of the miles by 2027. But given this new program, we're launching, we expect to accelerate that over the quarters and years to come here. Yes. So Ravi, from our perspective, our top priority, one of the top priorities is to improve service and continue to improve service for our customers. And our goal is to be best in class and get to a 0.1% claims ratio over time. Now we've made tremendous progress. You look from end of 2021 through Q3 of this year, we went from 1.2% damage claims ratio down to 0.4%. However, the improvement from here won't be linear, and it will take time. It's not something that every quarter, we're going to post a 0.3% improvement from 0.7% to a 0.4%. Now we have rolled out multiple new initiatives heading into 2024 with Dave coming on board and the operating team are implementing a number of initiatives, including higher-quality straps, new airbag systems that we are launching across all of our service centers, and Ravi, I'll tell you here from the first couple of service centers we've launched, we've seen an incremental reduction of more than 20% of damages just with these new tools and programs that we launch that we're very excited about. And we're also enhancing our training programs and how we load trailers taking it to the next level as well. And I mentioned earlier line haul in-sourcing. That's another measure of service improvement because today, when we use a third-party carrier, they typically have 53 feet trailers that don't have the bars in them. We call it the SaveStack system to separate freight from effectively having 2 decks of freight. But we have that in our equipment. So as we make progress on in-sourcing third-party line haul, we will continue to see these improvements in service as well as we all these things out. But again, the progress is fantastic. September was a company record in damage frequency. So how many damages do we cause versus the shipments that we move. And October got even better than the month of September. So great trajectory ahead. But again, it won't be linear over the quarters and years to come. Jason, our long-term plan remains to be a pure-play North American LTL carrier. But in the meantime, our European business continues to perform really well. When you look at the European economy, it's been softer here over the last couple of quarters, but the team was able to deliver great results, growing EBITDA on a year-on-year basis. I'm just fighting on all cylinders. We're onboarding more customers, we are getting more cost efficient in our European business and the team is performing well. But long-term, our goal continues to be a pure-play North American LTL company. In the third quarter, we had high-teens excess capacity in our network from a physical perspective, so in terms of how many doors we have. But as you know, this is not evenly distributed across our network. In some markets, we are bumping against capacity limits, but in many, many markets, we have available capacity from a doors perspective. And our service center expansion plan thus contemplate those markets where we see that higher demand from customers, where we're going to expand physical capacity. But we were run rating in the high teens. Our goal is to be in the 20% to 25% range is where we would like to be on a longer-term basis. Now in terms of rolling stock capacity, we have had tremendous progress since the beginning of LTL 2.0. We've added more than 10,000 new traders over the last 1.5 years, 2 years. We've added 2,000 tractors to our fleet, and this is enabling us to be able to take on more customers, but also run more efficiently. You see it here in the third quarter, we were able to handle 8% more shipments, while gaining productivity, I mean, our headcount was down on a year-on-year basis, and our labor hours were up slightly versus an 8% increase in shipments and equipment help us manage that. And on the people side, we're staffed for current volumes, but we do have headroom as well. And if the demand continues to increase, we can step up for that. The current paper markets are much easier to hire into. We have our driver schools as well. So we feel good from a people perspective. But generally, if you take a step back, we feel great from a capacity perspective, and we continue to invest in the network, and we're well positioned to capitalize on any upswings in freight. Thank you. The biggest component is going to come from yield. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we see a double-digit incremental yield opportunity over the coming years through the three main levers I mentioned, which is one is around service and continuing to get this higher price from customers who understand we're investing in the network and investing in the business, that's roughly half the yield opportunity to bridge the gap. And the other half is we expect for the accessorials go from roughly 10% of revenue to the 15-plus percent of revenue range based on the premium services we are implementing. What I like about this program, these are services that our customers are asking for. So we're taking care of the customer, and we're making a higher yield and a higher margin. And then finally, on the local channel side, by growing our local sales force. And here so far this year, we've increased our sales team account by 10% to 15% so far. And our goal is to get to more than 30% increase in overall sales headcount by end of next year, and that's enabling us to gain market share in that local channel that would also help bridge the gap. But the lion's share of the opportunity does come from price. The second category is around in-sourcing third-party line haul and we are accelerating that with our Road Flex team out and our new program for key drivers, and we will get higher service and lower cost, which is also really good. And we're going to continue to improve efficiency as well. So when you combine all of these things, again, yield is number one by a long shot, and then all the other areas will help making sure that we are running more efficiently as well. Thank you. Thanks, Stephanie. This is Mario. So this last year and the one prior in 2022 as well, we did change our incentive comp structure. It used to be only based on EBITDA growth on a year-on-year basis, but we had a good portion of the incentive comp plan switch to also focus on quality and on-time service. And that was part of the reason why we were able to drive meaningful improvement in both of these categories here through the course of the year since we started LTL 2.0. Now if you look moving forward, we are contemplating a change to switch from having EBITDA as being the compensation driver. And this is for field operations at the service center level and at the regional level to using OR expansion as being the key metric for profit improvement for the compensation program. We're still in the early innings here, there's still a few months here before we saw 2024, but that's one change we are contemplating for next year. Yes. Absolutely. When you look at all of our service metrics here in the month of October, we've seen a step-up from where we were in the third quarter as well. I mentioned earlier, for example, I mean, on time continues to do really well and our network fluidity best it's been in a long, long while, which is great to see. And our customers appreciate that. And similarly on the damages side in terms of damage frequency, we've seen a further improvement from September was a company record, dating back to 1996, and October was even better than September. Thank you, operator, and thank you all for joining us today. As you saw from what we reported this morning, we're in a strong position as we begin our second year as a standalone LTL business in North America. Our solid momentum is driven by continued execution of our LTL 2.0 plan and expands our entire business from revenue, earnings and yield growth to significant service improvements, operating efficiencies and market share gains. We're still in the early innings here, and there's a lot more we'll achieve. We look forward to speaking with you all on our next call. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Kyle. I'll start with the operating results for our LTL segment. In the third quarter, we had a year-over-year increase in shipment count of 7.8%, led by 13% growth in our local sales channel. As a result, our tonnage per day increased by 3.1%. This more than offset the impact of macro conditions, which continue to put pressure on our industry. Our weight per shipment declined 4.3 percent in the quarter compared with a year ago, which was slightly better than in the second quarter. There are two key drivers behind the solid growth we reported. First, we're continuing to gain market share because of the significant service improvements we're making in the network. And second, when Yellow exited the LTL market, we were well positioned to on-board incremental freight given that we've been investing in expanding our network since 2021. We also demonstrated that we have the operational discipline to take on more volume while at the same time continuing to improve our service levels. On a monthly basis, our July tonnage per day was up 4.2% year-over-year, August was up 3.3% and September was up 2.2%. Looking just at shipments per day, July was up 8.8% year-over-year, August was up 8.3% and September was up 6.6%. Our shipment count increased sequentially by more than 1,000 shipments per day every month of the quarter from July to September. On a two-year stack basis, monthly tonnage and shipment count also improved each month throughout the third quarter. With October almost complete, our preliminary tonnage per day is up approximately 2.5% year-over-year and shipment count is up 6%. On a sequential basis from September, October tonnage and shipment count are down 2.5% with both outperforming seasonality. Looking at yield in the third quarter, we grew yield, excluding fuel by 6.4% year-over-year, which is an acceleration from the second quarter. On a sequential basis, we increased yield ex fuel quarter-over-quarter, outperforming typical seasonality by 290 basis points. And importantly, we accelerated yield growth as the quarter progressed, supported by our strong customer relationships and pricing initiatives. Our underlying pricing trends also strengthened with contract renewal pricing up 9% in the quarter compared with a year ago. We expect year-over-year yield growth ex fuel to further accelerate in the fourth quarter and we're excited about the long-term impact that our yield initiatives will have on profitability. Turning to margin performance. Our third quarter adjusted operating ratio was 86.2%, which was 60 basis points higher than a year ago. On a sequential basis, we improved adjusted OR by 140 basis points compared with the second quarter. This outperformed seasonality by 370 basis points. Moving to our European business. We delivered another solid financial quarter with adjusted EBITDA growth of 2% compared with a year ago. This was supported by strong pricing, which outpaced inflation as well as cost discipline. While macro conditions in Europe remain soft overall, our sales pipeline is robust and the team continues to execute well especially in the UK, where we drove positive organic growth in the quarter. I'll close with the drivers behind our momentum, including the strong outperformance of our third quarter operating ratio. First, we continue to make significant improvements in service across the board and delivered record results. We also accelerated yield growth in the quarter and will accelerate it again in the current quarter. We expect our robust yield performance to continue into 2024. And we operated far more productively by leveraging our technology and effectively managing our labor costs. In summary, our strategy is working. XPO in North America is stronger as a standalone LTL company with focused execution and our results will continue to reflect that. Now we'll take your questions. Operator, please open the line for Q&A. Sure, Ken. This is Ali. So we do expect to outperform seasonality by 100 basis points. That's going to be primarily driven by our stronger yield growth. Just keep in mind, we are coming off nearly 400 basis points of outperformance versus seasonality in the third quarter. So we're delivering 100 basis points on top of that 400 that we delivered in the third quarter. I'd also point out that on a year-over-year basis, that 100 basis points of outperformance versus seasonality would imply 200 basis points of year-over-year OR improvement and about 20% EBITDA growth in our LTL segment ex real estate. There are also a few short-term impacts to consider from the investments we're making. As we continue to invest in incremental capacity that comes with higher depreciation. That was about 120 basis points year-over-year headwind to OR in the third quarter. We would expect a similar impact in Q4. We're also investing and growing our local sales force. And overall, we do expect these investments to generate strong returns for us over the medium to long term, but they will have a modest cost impact over the next few quarters. So we feel comfortable with the roughly 100 basis points of outperformance versus seasonality for OR. It is still very early in a dynamic environment. And ultimately, that magnitude of outperformance is going to depend on how tonnage progresses through the rest of this quarter. Good morning, Tom. This is Ali. In terms of the cadence through the quarter, as Mario mentioned, we did have tougher compares in the second half of the year last year as our market share gains were accelerating. So if you look at it on a two-year stack basis, our shipment counts and tonnage both accelerated throughout the third quarter and that two-year acceleration continued into the month of October. Also, if you look at it just on a shipment count basis, we saw our shipment counts improve by more than 1,000 shipments each month of the third quarter from July to September. And then as we moved into October, as we noted, October outperformed seasonality relative to the month of September. Sure, Stephanie. This is Ali. So if you look at the third quarter, our headcount was down slightly on a year-over-year basis, and that's relative to shipment counts up high single-digits. So we did a great job managing headcount relative to the volumes in the network. Also, if you look at it at a labor hours perspective, labor hours were up less than 1% year-over-year, again, versus shipment counts up 8% year-over-year. And more importantly, that spread between labor hours and shipment counts accelerated through the year from low single-digits in the first quarter to high single-digits in the third quarter. Now as we think about the fourth quarter, we would expect total headcount and labor hours for 4Q to be roughly the same as the third quarter on both a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis. We've done a really good job again in managing productivity in the third quarter. We expect that to continue into 4Q and then into 2024 as well. So we are staffed for current volumes, and we have some headroom. If demand does increase, we want to make sure we're staffed for that as well. I think the positive side is the labor market is looser than it has been in recent years. So we're confident in our ability to flex up labor as needed. And we're going to continue to manage headcount effectively relative to the volumes we're moving through the network."

I will now turn the call over to XPO\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Mario Harik. Mr. Harik, you may begin.\nMario Harik: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call. I'm here in Greenwich with Kyle Wismans, our incoming Chief Financial Officer; Carl Anderson, our outgoing CFO; and Ali Faghri, our Chief Strategy Officer. This morning, you saw us report a solid quarter despite a soft operating environment. Company-wide, we generated revenue of $1.9 billion, and adjusted EPS of $0.71. We also delivered adjusted EBITDA of $244 million, coming in above expectations. In our North American LTL segment, adjusted EBITDA was $208 million, also above expectation. I want to focus my comments this morning on the progress we are making with the four pillars of our plan for LTL 2.0. The first pillar is to provide industry leading customer service. Last year, we implemented multiple initiatives to elevate our customer service levels, including a new incentive compensation structure for the field. We've made it clear to the team that customer service is our top priority and we're seeing the impact of that in our key service metrics. In the second quarter our claims ratio for damages was 0.7%, which is an improvement compared with 0.9% in 2022, and 1.2% at the end of 2021. And in the month of June, our damage claims per shipment came in at the best in over seven years. Another key metric is on time performance, we improved this by 10 percentage points in the quarter year-over-year. Going forward, we're keeping up the momentum as we begin to roll out new tools for the field, including higher quality straps, airbag systems, and new storage racks in our service centers. More recently with the acceleration in July volumes, we've continued to improve key service metrics. During this period of industry disruption, we're protecting capacity for our existing customers and being disciplined in what freight we bring on into our network. While we've made considerable progress with service in a relatively short time, there's a lot more we can do. Our entire organization is laser focused on providing the best LTL service in the industry. The second pillar of our plan is to invest in our network for the long term. As you know, we anticipate allocating CapEx of 8% to 12% of revenue on average over the next several years. Now that we've completed our two spin offs, we have more opportunities to invest in driving long term growth in LTL, a business that generates a high return on invested capital. Most of our CapEx this year is being deployed to increase the capacity of our fleet. We've added more than 900 tractors which has brought down the average age of our fleet to 5.1 years from 5.9 years at the end of 2022. We've also produced nearly 3,100 new trailers at our manufacturing facility in Arkansas. And we're on track to meet our targets for over 6000 new trailers this year. In addition, we expanded capacity at our service centers in Norcross, Georgia and in Salt Lake City. This aligns with our plan to add new doors and markets where more capacity can sustain more growth over time. At this point, we've added more than half of the 900 net new doors contemplated in our plan and we expect to open the remainder by early 2024, primarily by expanding existing terminals. These targeted expansions will help improve network density and fluidity over the long term. Given the recent market dynamics, we're evaluating the pace of our CapEx plan to see if we want to accelerate our investments in network capacity. There is a potential for our annual CapEx as a percent of revenue to exceed the high end of our target range in the near term. The third pillar of our plan is to accelerate yield growth. We grew yields excluding fuel by 1.4% year-over-year, in line with our outlook for the second quarter. We still had a headwind from mix as we described last quarter. However, our underlying pricing trends remained solid with contract renewal pricing up by mid-single digits. Yield is our single biggest lever for margin improvement going forward. And we have multiple initiatives underway to leverage the gains we're making in service quality and operating excellence. We started to see the impact of these initiatives grow in the second quarter and we expect this acceleration to continue. The fourth and final pillar of LTL 2.0 is to continue to drive cost efficiencies. The main opportunities here are in purchased transportation, our variable cost structure and overhead expense. In the second quarter, we reduced our purchased transportation costs by 35% year-over-year by utilizing two levers. First, we continue to reprice contracts with third party carriers to capitalize on favorable market conditions. At the same time, we reduced third party linehaul miles in the quarter by 400 basis points versus last year. This aligns with our plan to achieve a 50% reduction in purchased transportation costs as a percent of revenue by 2027. Labor is another opportunity to control variable costs in our field operation. We did that effectively in the second quarter. Our headcount and labor hours were down year-over-year, while our shipment count was up. We also made significant progress in reducing our corporate overhead as we continue to rationalize our cost structure after the latest spin off. While we're committed to becoming continuously more cost efficient, we're also careful to set the company up for long term growth. This includes investments in new tools for the field to further improve service quality and the significant expansion of our local sales force. Turning to Europe, our business continued to perform well in a soft operating environment, with organic revenue largely unchanged. Despite the macro uncertainty in parts of Europe, we continue to see a strong pricing environment across the segments and our sales pipeline is robust. I'll wrap up my remarks on the quarter by summarizing the progress we've made to date with our LTL 2.0 plan. We're continuing to generate some of our best service levels in years and this is enabling us to gain profitable market share. This has put the business on a path to stronger yield growth as we're able to price based on the increasing value we're providing customers. We're also continuing to make strategic investments in our network to capitalize on upturns in demand. We have a long track record of delivering high returns on investments in this business. And we're becoming more cost efficient by reducing our use of purchased transportation, managing variable labor costs effectively, and rationalizing our cost structure at the corporate level. With our operational momentum and disciplined investments in long term growth, we remain on track to deliver on our outlook for at least 600 basis points of adjusted operating ratio improvement through 2027. In closing, I want to comment on the CFO transition we announced in July. Some of you already know Kyle, who will take over as our Chief Financial Officer next week. Kyle has been a senior finance leader with public companies for over 17 years, including a long career with General Electric. And he's been immersed in our business for the past four years, most recently as our Head of Revenue Management and Finance in LTL. This will be a seamless transition. I also want to thank Carl, our outgoing CFO for his leadership of our finance team. Carl is rejoining a former colleague in an industry where he worked for over a decade, where I'm confident he'll have continued success. Now I'm going to hand the call over to Kyle to discuss the second quarter results. Kyle, over to you.\nKyle Wismans: Thank you, Mario, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to step into the CFO role. We have a significant opportunity ahead of us to create even more shareholder value with a clear line of sight to our goals. And I\u2019m looking forward to building on our momentum as we continue to execute on the LTL 2.0 plan. Now turning to the second quarter. Revenue for the total company was $1.9 billion, down 6% year-over-year, and up 1% sequentially from the first quarter. In our LTL segment, revenue was down 8% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. Almost all of the decline was related to fuel surcharge revenue. Excluding fuel, revenue was down just 1% year-over-year, and up 4% sequentially. LTL salaries, wages and benefits in total were 4.6% higher than a year ago, primarily due to wage increases. As Mario noted, we did a good job of managing our field labor costs in the quarter. We handled more shipments per day, with lower headcount and fewer hours than in the second quarter a year ago. Purchased transportation expense was down year-over-year by 35% or $47 million, as we insourced more linehaul miles to reduce our use of third-party carriers. We ended the quarter at 20.7% of linehaul miles outsourced, which was a 400 basis point improvement from the same quarter last year. We also paid significantly lower contract rates in the quarter as our renegotiated contracts cycled in with the carriers. Depreciation expense in the quarter increased by 24% or $12 million, driven by our investments in the LTL network. Our CapEx spend was primarily related to bringing in new tractors from the OEMs and manufacturing more trailers in-house. Next, I'll add some detail to adjusted EBITDA, starting with the company as a whole. We generated adjusted EBITDA of $244 million in the quarter, down 16% year-over-year. We reduced corporate expenses by 71% for savings of $24 million, which we achieved by rationalizing our corporate cost structure following the RXO spinoff. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 12.7%, representing a year-over-year deterioration of 140 basis points. Looking at just the LTL segment, adjusted EBITDA was $208 million, down 24% from a year ago. Our gains and cost efficiency were offset by the aggregate impact of the current operating environment. Namely, lower fuel surcharge revenue, tonnage, wage inflation, and lower pension income. In our European Transportation segment, adjusted EBITDA was $46 million, down $3 million year-over-year. Company-wide, we reported net income from continuing operations of $31 million in the quarter, representing diluted earnings per share of $0.27. This compares to income of $96 million and earnings of $0.83 per diluted share a year ago. The year-over-year decline in income from continuing operations was partially due to higher transaction and integration costs and restructuring charges. We had $17 million of transaction and integration costs related to the RXO spin-off and another $10 million of restructuring charges across the segments. We expect that costs in both categories will step down materially by the end of this year. On an adjusted basis, our EPS for the quarter was $0.71, which is down 38% from a year ago. And lastly, we generated $131 million of cash flow from continuing operations and deployed $126 million of net CapEx. Reinvesting in the business remains our top priority for capital allocation. Moving to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $290 million of cash on hand. Combined, with available capacity under committed borrowing facilities, this gave us $802 million of liquidity at quarter end. We had no borrowings outstanding under our ABL facility at quarter end and our net debt leverage was 2.3 times trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. In May, we completed the refinancing of our $2 billion term loan. This doubled our weighted average maturity timeline to approximately six years, while our interest expense is effectively unchanged this year. And notably, we received upgrades on our secured debt from Moody\u2019s and S&P. We also now have two investment-grade ratings on our secured debt. Our capital structure gives us the financial flexibility to execute on the significant opportunities we have at XPO. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Ali, who will cover our operating results.\nAli Faghri: Thank you, Kyle. I\u2019ll start with the review of the second quarter operating results for our LTL segment. During the quarter, demand for LTL stayed below historical levels. This drove a 4.7% decline in our weight per shipment in the quarter. We offset some of this with a 1.9% increase in shipment count, led by 15% growth in our local sales channel. These share gains are a direct reflection of the service improvements we're making in the network. As a result, we were able to limit the decline in tonnage per day to 2.8%. On a monthly basis, April tonnage per day was down 2% year-over-year, May was down 2.3%, and June was down 4%. Looking just at shipments per day, April was up 3.1% year-over-year, May was up 1.8%, and June was up 0.9%. On a two-year stack basis, monthly tonnage improved each month throughout the second quarter. In July, we moved even more freight through the network with tonnage up 4.2% year-over-year and shipment count up 8.8%. On a sequential basis from June, July tonnage was up 2.6% and shipment count was up 3.2%. Looking at yield, on an ex-fuel basis, increased by 1.4% versus last year, in line with our outlook. On a sequential basis, we increased yield ex-fuel quarter-over-quarter, outperforming typical seasonality. While mix has continued to be a headwind to yield, our underlying trends remain solid, with contract renewal pricing up 5% in the quarter versus last year. Also, our yield initiatives are continuing to gain traction and resulted in stronger yield growth as the quarter progressed, into July. As we look ahead, we are excited about the trends we see in yield and our outlook for the third quarter, as well as the long term. We expect our year-over-year yield growth, ex-fuel, to further accelerate in the third quarter versus Q2. Turning to margin performance, our second quarter adjusted operating ratio was 87.6%, which is unfavorable by 440 basis points compared with second quarter a year ago. As part of our LTL 2.0 strategy, we have been increasing our capital investments to drive long-term growth. In the near term, there is a headwind to our margins from higher depreciation as these investments ramp. If we exclude the impacts of depreciation as well as fuel, our adjusted operating ratio in the quarter would have improved on a year-over-year basis. On a sequential basis, we improved adjusted OR by 200 basis points compared with the first quarter. This outperformed our expectations. Moving to our European business, we delivered another solid financial quarter with organic revenue down slightly despite a soft macro backdrop. This was supported by a mix of new customer wins and contract renewals. Two of our key markets, the UK and Central Europe, outperformed the European segment as a whole. And our pricing in Europe was higher than the same period last year, outpacing inflation. Before we go to Q&A, I want to highlight our significant progress we're making toward becoming a world-class LTL provider. We've meaningfully improved service and are rolling out new initiatives to drive further improvements. As we take on more volume, like we did in July, we're maintaining strong service levels and being disciplined about the freight we accept into our network. We're also building yield growth and expect an acceleration in the second half of this year as our initiatives continue to ramp up. And importantly, we are carefully managing variable costs, while continuing to make strategic investments in the network. For all these reasons, we're excited about our trajectory and our momentum towards achieving our long-term targets. With that, we'll take your questions. Operator, please open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nKen Hoexter: Great. Good morning. Mario, maybe talk about the ramp in July post-Yellow. It seems like you were a little bit more guarded on adding freight in the discussion, but yet you're also targeting to accelerate. So should we see maybe an above-industry average yield growth as you are selective on the freight you're adding? Is it that the freight moved really quickly and now it's realigning itself over time? And then contrast that with your comments on CapEx and how we think about how fast you want to grow to maybe absorb some more of those volumes? Thanks.\nMario Harik: Good morning, Ken, and thanks for the question. Well, first starting with the July tonnage, so when you look at our tonnage, it was up 4.2% year-on-year in the month of July and shipment count was up 8.8% in the month of July. Now when you compare that to typical seasonality, usually June to July, we see shipment count be down 2.8%, but for us, this July we went up 3.2%, so call it a 6% swing above typical seasonality. And same thing on the tonnage side, we usually see seasonality June to July go down 4.1%, while this July we saw it go up 2.6%, so that also 6% to 7% higher. Now, when you look at the beginning of the month versus the end of the month, we already had seen positive tonnage and shipments at the beginning of July, and we saw that accelerate -- the shipment count accelerated in the high-single-digit range from the beginning of the month till the end of the month. Now, it's tough to tell what the rest of the quarter is going to do. It is a very fluid situation at this point and we'll see how these numbers obviously shakeout here for August and beyond. On the capital side, so we have been investing more capital into our business as part of our LTL 2.0 plan to add more capacity. And with this much capacity coming out of the industry, we're looking to accelerate these capacity adds. And this would be in doors, in tractors, and trailers. And just to give you an example, at our Searcy facility we have the ability to produce 7,500 trailers per year. And initially, we have planned to produce slightly north of 6,000 trailers for the year, but we could expand that production here to 7,500 trailers for the year, given what we're seeing. Our long term guide is 8% to 12% of the CapEx as a percent of revenue. And we'd expect to be at the high-end of the range or above the high-end of the range in the near-term as we add more capacity.\nOperator: Our next question is from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed.\nTom Wadewitz: Yes, good morning. Wanted to see if you could put it in like shipment count terms for us in terms of maybe like how many shipments per day, you're seeing at the present time. And what that would have been in, I don't know, two weeks ago, something like that, just to give a little additional perspective. I think you talked maybe in percentage terms. And then, I guess related to that, how well do you handle those shipments in terms of you get pretty strong incremental margins on those? Or is it something where you have to stretch to handle a big step-up. So that the kind of margin impact, maybe not -- I don't know. How do we think about the margin impact on that? Thank you.\nAli Faghri: Good morning, Tom. This is Ali. So as Mario noted, we did see positive tonnage and shipment counts on a year-over-year basis in the early part of July, but we did see that accelerate towards the end of the month. At the end of July, we saw roughly about a high single digit increase in our shipment count versus the beginning of the month. So, call it, somewhere in that 3,000 shipments per day increase. I'll pass to Mario.\nMario Harik: In terms of the flow-through. So when we think about it, we have been adding quite a bit of capacity over the last year and a half. So we've added, first on the rolling stock perspective, we've added more than 1,900 tractors, more than 8,000 trailers over the last year and a half. We've also added more doors in markets where we needed more capacity. Last year we opened up six new service centers, this year so-far we expanded two service centers. So on the rolling stock and actual physical capacity, we're feeling good about where we are. And on the people side, we have had headroom on the headcount side, but at the same time, in some locations where we're seeing higher demand, we're going be adding more headcount and potentially lean into more purchased transportation if it makes sense as well. The flow-through --these additions of additional capacity do have a shorter-term cost impact associated with them, but at the same time we do expect good flow-through on the additional business we're adding, so being very selective.\nOperator: Our next question is from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks, good morning guys. I just wanted to try one different way. Can you maybe -- because we don't really know intra-month seasonality. Just in the last like week or so, what is tonnage or shipments tracking up year-over-year. I'm guessing something better than that 4% and 9%, but any color on the year-over-year just in the last week or so. And then just -- we wanted to sort of get a sense in the run-rate into August. And then any color on how to think about the OR sequentially Q2 to Q3. That would be helpful. Thank you.\nAli Faghri: Good morning, Scott. This is Ali. So in terms of the tonnage and shipment count, as we mentioned, in the month of July tonnage was just up over 4% year-over-year and shipment counts were up about 9%. Given the acceleration we did see towards the end of the month, you can assume that the year-over-year growth rates for both tonnage and shipment counts were up more than we thought for the full month. As we mentioned, from the beginning of the month to the end of the month, shipment counts were up about high single digits sequentially. Now, when you think about the third quarter, I'll walk you through the moving pieces here. So from a tonnage perspective, normal seasonality is about a 4% sequential decline in tonnage Q3 versus Q2. Now, that would imply Q3 tonnage down in that low to mid-single digit range on a year-over-year basis. We would expect to do better than that. July clearly outperformed with tonnage up slightly over 4%, but I would point out that the monthly compares do get more difficult as the quarter progresses. Last September, we saw tonnage inflect positive year-over-year. So overall, we would expect positive tonnage year-over-year in the third quarter and we'll give another update on August in early September. On the yield side, we did have strong momentum even before the recent industry disruption. Yield growth accelerated through the second quarter and that continued into July. Our current baseline forecast is that Q3 yield ex-fuel will accelerate versus 2Q on a year-over-year basis, call it, somewhere in that 3% year-over-year growth range. And then lastly, from an operating ratio perspective, a typical seasonality is about 230 basis points deterioration Q3 versus Q2. Given how the month of July played out, we would expect to outperform seasonality for OR by at least 100 basis points. Now the magnitude of that outperformance versus seasonality, that's going to be driven by how tonnage performs through the rest of the quarter. And as Mario noted, there are some incremental cost to consider related to that uptick in volume. For example, we may need to increase field labor and also tap into purchased transportation as a source of supplemental capacity on a short-term basis. But overall, we would expect to outperform seasonality by at least 100 basis points and we'll have a better idea on the magnitude as the quarter progresses.\nScott Group: Okay. Helpful. And then just, Mario, just real quick like, Yellow leaving, how does it change in your mind the timeline of getting to that low 80s, 80% operating ratio that you want to get to?\nMario Harik: When you look at the long-term target, Scott, there is a good likelihood that the current market disruption would enable us to accelerate price and volume growth beyond our original targets. Now, with what's happened over the last few weeks, it's a bit too early to tell how it kind of manifests itself for the long term. Our focus continues to drive OR meaningfully lower in the years to come. And that's why we've always said there's at least 600 basis points by 2027. And we still feel very comfortable with that.\nScott Group: Thank you, guys.\nMario Harik: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Fadi Chamoun with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nFadi Chamoun: Yes, good morning. Thank you. So, Mario, given kind of the focus on service and obviously the -- that being strategic priority for the long-term, how is the network handling this kind of uptick in volume seen in July versus Q2? And how are you making sure that, kind of, you maintain that momentum on the service side? And related to that, maybe like from a pricing perspective, is there an opportunity to accelerate the mid-single digit in the back half of this year, just given the environment we\u2019re in now?\nMario Harik: Thanks, Fadi. I\u2019ll start with the service fees and turn it over to Kyle for yield and pricing. Well, service is our top priority and it will continue to be our top priority. And Dave and the team are doing a great job, being able to handle that additional influx in freight that we\u2019re seeing here. And just to give you an example, Fadi, in the month of July, we\u2019ve seen shipment count go up 9% year-on-year, yet, our service metrics improved relative to June. When you think about claims filed per shipment, when you think about on-time service, we see those continue to pick up in the month of July. Now, there\u2019s a few reasons for that. One is that, as I mentioned earlier, we have been investing in capacity over the last year and a half where we\u2019ve added more doors in markets where we needed to have those doors, recently in Salt Lake City and Norcross, Georgia. We've been adding more to our rolling stock, we've added more than 1,900 tractors since we initiated LTL 2.0. We've added more than 8,000 trailers since we initiated the program as well. Also, we -- a lot of the changes we implemented on improving service are now cultural, that's part of what we do every day, including incentive comp changes, including new technology, and how we load trailers, including overall recognition programs around service. And moving forward, that momentum is building through new training programs we're launching, new tools we are launching, our people in the field as well now that we have Dave on-board driving a lot of these initiatives. On the labor side, as Ali mentioned, if we need more labor in some of the sites where we're seeing more volume, we are adding the headcount where we need it. We could also lean more into purchased transportation in the near term if we need it as well. Then finally, we're very focused on being selective on the freight we take on. A lot of it goes down to being picky on the freight. We want four by four feet pallets or skids that we on-board from our customers that fits well in LTL network. And at the same time, we're looking for margin-accretive business that will improve our OR over time. So we're being very disciplined and our service product continues to be our top priority as we move forward from here.\nKyle Wismans: Hey, Fadi, it's Kyle. So as Ali mentioned, our yield growth strengthened in the second quarter and into July as a lot of our internal initiatives gained traction. And as Mario mentioned, our focus continues to be on providing excellent service. But given there is less near-term capacity, we are taking pricing action with customers. We implemented a GRI with our transactional 3PL business and we've also moved up our target for contract renewals. Now some of these actions will take hold very quickly like the GRI. Others with annual contracts will take time to realize. But our customers understand, when you take 10% of capacity out of the market, it's going to cost more to move freight. But as we said, our baseline expectation is 3% year-over-year growth. And these initiatives could help us move above that range. But it's too early to tell what that's going to look like and we'll update you later on.\nFadi Chamoun: Thank you.\nKyle Wismans: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nRavi Shanker: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Mario, just obviously you guys kind of have been on the growth path for a while. So it makes sense that you're stepping up your investments. But what would you say to those who believe, I mean, just to reference the point that was just made that you take 10% of capacity out of the market and pricing goes up for everyone. But do you think there is a natural backstop to how much capacity this industry will add so that that rising tide stays high or do you think that the industry kind of backfills that capacity over time?\nMario Harik: Thanks, Ravi. When you look at the overall industry capacity, it has been fairly tight for a long time. Over the last decade, the number of service centers in our industry has stayed flat. And now when you look at taking out 10% of capacity, that's obviously a big hole in terms of the amount of capacity that is available. But there are a few carriers adding more capacity, us included, but these adds will take time to materialize when you think about the service centers and doors that -- to be added across the network. These won't happen overnight. So we do think that over time -- so the freight gets absorbed first and then over time, you will see us and a few other carriers add that capacity, but it's going to be a longer-term process to be able to get there. As Kyle said, it's still early to tell what the impact on pricing is going to be. When you look at LTL, pricing has always been very disciplined, given the dynamic of shortage of capacity versus demand and growth. And when you take out this amount of capacity, we would expect yield to see tailwinds in the quarters and years to come here. And you couple that with the potential freight recovery as we head into 2024, that's going to accelerate from there as well.\nRavi Shanker: Got it. I guess squeezing a really quick follow-up kind of shifting gears a little bit kind of away from the cycle and what's going on in LTL. Obviously, you are a tech geek. I don't think you mind me calling you that. So if you can just kind of help us with kind of understanding everything you're seeing out there within AI, ML? Kind of, obviously, XPO has been leveraging on the LTL side for a long-time, but kind of what are some of the one or two things that really excite you about new [technology] (ph) at your disposal?\nMario Harik: Well, first, as you know, Ravi, technology has been part of our DNA since the onset of the company and all of our systems in LTL that operate the network are proprietary. And when you think about an LTL business, we're very much in the data business, because we move more than 50,000 shipments a day and we have a lot of data points on how we move those shipments across the network. But just to give you a couple of examples how we operate our linehaul network, our models do use AI and ML to optimize how many loads we are building in each hub in the network, and we're launching new technology and how we do things like directed loading, as an example, to improve how we build trailers to bypass service centers and improve efficiency. Similar thing on how we plan labor and how we manage labor in the field, similar technology on how we run our pickup and delivery routes. And on a net-net basis, at the end of the day, all of these things lead to better results to the bottom line. Just to give you an example, in the second quarter, our shipment count was up roughly 2%, but our labor hours and headcount was down 2%. And these tools enable us to build these efficiencies into the operation.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So just wanted to come back, I guess, maybe for, Kyle, how do you -- I think you mentioned that there is a GRI that was already implemented and maybe you can just touch on that in terms of the timing and what you'd expect for the rest of the year. What I'm trying to get at is, is there a little bit of a lag here in terms of the additional cost, offset by a little bit of operating leverage on the new volumes before you can really get some of that -- some of those pricing gains to be reflected in the network, whether it's through additional GRIs or new contract negotiations?\nKyle Wismans: Yes, thanks, Brian. So when you think about the GRI we took, that was in the transactional 3PL business. So that's really the broker business. There was an expected GRI later in the year. So that's kind of steady-state maybe pull-forward slightly. So we wouldn't expect too many differences there. We're not anticipating at this point other GRIs as we progress and we'll continue with our yield initiatives to drive-up profitability in the back half. But when you think about the initiatives, again, some of those are going to be immediate impact like a GRI and others as you work through contractual renewals will take time to realize.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Great. Then if I can just ask a quick one for Mario. You mentioned accelerating the CapEx as the capacity comes out of the market. Is there any opportunities? I'm sure you are evaluating them. Maybe pick up some stuff that comes to the market or do you feel like this is something that you'd rather do internally based on your current network versus what might be available out there? Thanks.\nMario Harik: Thanks, Brian. If there is an opportunity for us to accelerate our capacity growth, we would definitely look at it. Now our focus is to continue to execute on our long-term plan to expand capacity, which has been a pillar -- a core pillar in our LTL 2.0 plan. Now, regardless of if this capacity becomes available, we are looking at continuing also our expansion where, so far I mentioned earlier, we expanded two service centers so far this year and we have another dozen or so projects for expanding other service centers in key markets, especially in the Texas area and Florida and Arizona, so in a number of markets. Now, again, if these facilities go on the market, then we'll definitely look at them as well.\nOperator: Our next question is from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please proceed.\nStephanie Moore: Hi, good morning. Thank you. I wanted to touch a little bit on kind of maybe the strategy in which you're managing this dislocation in the market. And if you could touch a little bit on if your immediate focus is more so on kind of capturing the volume opportunity and how do you kind of manage that strategy with pricing and kind of maybe more of a longer-term opportunity here? So maybe just talk a little bit about the initial reaction to the volume and flow.\nMario Harik: Thanks, Stephanie. Well, we are looking at it in a very balanced approach. Step number one is, making sure that we safeguard the capacity to existing customers and we keep on honoring the capacity commitments we had with them. But when you think about the influx of volume, we are assessing those opportunities to bring incremental freight on a case-by-case basis, both from existing and from new customers. We are using that as an opportunity to improve the mix as a whole for our customers. And as I mentioned earlier, we're looking at it in two main criteria. One is, making sure that the customers that we're onboarding freight for have four-by-four feet type skids that fits well in an LTL network. And we're also looking at it from an OR perspective and making sure that we are on-boarding margin-accretive business as we are adding. So we're being very disciplined into the shipments and tonnage we're bringing on to our network. And now, on the pricing side, when you take out, as Kyle mentioned earlier, 10% of the capacity in the market, it does cost more to move freight for your customers and also we want to make sure we're charging a fair price given the value that we are offering our customers as well with the improvements we're seeing in our service product over time as well. So we're looking at it in a very balanced way in terms of being disciplined how we add volume, while leaning onto the price lever as well.\nStephanie Moore: Great. No, that's very clear. And then maybe switching gears entirely, could you give us an update on your European business and any strategic changes you might have selling that business and kind of where we stand today? Thanks.\nMario Harik: Thank you. Well, we announced stopping that process in the near term in the month of December. But our goal long-term continues to be a -- being a pure-play North American LTL company. Now that said, this business is operating really well. As you heard from Ali and Kyle, we're doing really well despite the softer macroeconomic environment in Europe. Our organic revenue is largely unchanged on a year-on-year basis and the team there is doing a fantastic job servicing customers.\nOperator: Our next question is from Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed.\nChris Wetherbee: I guess, Mario, you talked about the potential for pricing improvement and closing the gap with peers. And I think when we talked to you guys back in May, there was the opportunity for maybe double-digit over a multi-year basis. But obviously what's going on I think is accelerating pricing and yield opportunities. As you think about that, particularly as it relates to your longer-term operating ratio targets, how much return -- is there a way to think about what the sort of nearer-term opportunity is on that 10% of that operating ratio? I wanted to get a sense of sort of what the pricing dynamic -- how much of that's being pulled forward over the next couple of years and to maybe the next couple of quarters.\nMario Harik: Yes. So when you think about it, I think this is still a very fluid situation here given the disruption that happened in the market. So Chris, it's tough to evaluate how quickly the pace of improvement is going to go here in the near term. But over the next weeks and months, we're going to have a better picture on where things are shaking out. But it's fair to assume that you would see an overall yield and price acceleration. And also the way we look at it, it's all about charging a fair price for the service that we are offering our customers. When you look at these service improvements, I'm incredibly excited about having Dave on the team and all the progress that our operating teams are doing on keep on improving the service product. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we are adding new tools to the field such as higher-quality straps, airbag systems, racks in service centers. We are improving the instructions of how we load trailers and training associated with that. And all of these will lead to better service, which over time would also lead to a higher yield. Now again, the pace of the disruption here that we're seeing would accelerate, but it's tough at this point to predict what it's going to look like given it's all fairly new over the last few weeks.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay, that's very helpful. And one point of clarification. Do you expect more share to come over in the coming weeks? We talked about the run rate exiting July, entering August, but is that share shift largely done or do you think there's incremental room for that to go from here?\nAli Faghri: Good morning, Chris. This is Ali. It's hard to know at this point how much incremental share is going to come our way. As Mario mentioned, we're being very disciplined with the freight that we're bringing into the network. Our priority is to make sure that it's good freight that fits our network, and most importantly is margin-accretive. And so, that's our strategy as it relates to the incremental volumes. And then we'll give you another update in terms of August trends in early September.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.\nJon Chappell: Thank you and good morning. Ali, quick one on Europe. I mean, is there any update there on the sales process or even the desire to do that as the market continues to improve? And I ask mostly for an update, but also there is this gain on equipment and sales. Are you looking to maybe sell that off in piecemeal when you get opportunities, or are you still kind of holding off for a big sale when the market is conducive?\nAli Faghri: Good morning, Jon. So in the fourth quarter of last year, we did announce that we won't be selling the European business in the near term. And we're not going to address the potential sale further beyond what we had said in that December filing. That being said, our long term plan remains to be a pure-play North American LTL carrier. Having said that, as Mario noted, that business continues to perform well in a soft macro backdrop. Our organic revenue was down slightly. And we saw constant currency revenue growth in both our UK business as well as our Central Europe business as well.\nJon Chappell: So what did the gains then relate to?\nKyle Wismans: The gains are related to the asset turn-in, so it's part of a normal process, Jon, for turning in equipment out there. So, part of normal business.\nJon Chappell: Okay. Thanks, Kyle. Thanks, Ali.\nKyle Wismans: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nJordan Alliger: Yeah. Hi, good morning. When we sort of thinking about volumes differently from a capacity perspective, I think, if memory serves, last quarter I think you talked about maybe 20% spare capacity at the terminals, given the soft demand conditions. Maybe I might not be right on that, but given all that's going on with Yellow and given where your network is today. Where you feel comfortable drawing that down to. I mean, can you go to 5%, 0%, just curious. Thanks.\nMario Harik: Thanks, Jordan. Well, first on the capacity side. We ended the second quarter at roughly 20% excess capacity from a physical capacity perspective. So think doors and service centers. And that moderated down, call it, to the mid-teens here in the month of July as we've seen that impact in higher volumes. Now, usually on a longer-term basis, we want to be in that 20% to 25% range of excess capacity. Now, as you know, in an LTL network, it's not linear. So you have some markets where we had excess capacity. And then we have other markets where we already are -- we are at capacity and the goal is to add these -- in these markets where we need those extra doors the additional physical capacity. On the rolling stock side, we are feeling very good based on where we are now over the last year and a half. As I mentioned earlier, we've added more than 1,900 tractors and we've added more than 8,000 new trailers. So the rolling stock side is feeling very good for us. And we are planning on accelerating some of these investments here in the near term. The third part of capacity is on the people side. Today, we are staffed to current volumes and we have some headroom, but also in some markets we also are looking to add more headcount and potentially lean into purchased transportation if we needed as well. The good news there is that the labor markets are very ripe for hiring people. And just to give you an example, Jordan, in the second quarter the applicants per open req that we had went up three-folds on a year-on-year basis. So it's a very good market to be able to add people, but these are the different aspects of capacity. And again, on the door side, we're going to continue on adding doors to get to that 20%, 25% excess free capacity that we can leverage for longer-term growth.\nJordan Alliger: So just as a -- in the near-term at least, I get the 20%, 25%, but the near-term at least between rolling stock, headcount, et cetera, you could probably drawdown that excess capacity further, if need be?\nMario Harik: Yes, that's correct. And again, it will depend on some of the markets where we are at capacity. Then these, obviously, we will need to add more in the near term as well.\nJordan Alliger: Thank you.\nMario Harik: You bet.\nOperator: Our next question is from Eric Morgan with Barclays. Please proceed.\nEric Morgan: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question and best of luck to Carl and congrats to Kyle. I wanted to come back to service, maybe from just a higher level. Obviously, you've made some good progress here in a pretty short timeframe just looking specifically at the claims ratio. And so, just kind of wondering if you have any thoughts on the runway from here? Have you captured most of the low-hanging fruit and maybe the next 50 bps improvement in that number is tougher, it takes a little bit longer than the first 50 bps or do you have line of sight to improving at a similar pace going forward?\nMario Harik: Our long-term goal is to get the claims ratio of 0.1% and -- but the improvement won't be linear, and it will take a number of years for us to get there. And now having Dave on the team and the experience of him driving a better service product over time is going to allow us to get there on a faster timeline. But it still will take us a number of years to get there. Now when you look at what we've done so far, I mentioned earlier, over the last year and a half we tied incentive compensation plans to improvements in service. We tied the recognition programs at the service center level to the improvements in service and we've also launched technology that enables us to rate every trailer that we load across the network every single night and having a rating of quality of loading at that particular -- for that particular load. And moving forward, we are launching new tools, as I mentioned earlier, for the field, including new airbag system across all of our service centers, storage racks that help with how you unload and reload appointment freight, higher-quality straps. We're also improving how we are operating training and loading procedures for our dockworkers to further improve service. Again, our June claims per shipment was the best in seven years and our goal is to keep on improving. But again, it won't be linear from here, all the way down to 0.1%, but the expectation is to continue to see that service product improvement over the years to come.\nEric Morgan: Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Our next question is from Bruce Chan with Stifel. Please proceed.\nBruce Chan: Thanks and good morning, everyone. Mario, maybe just to come back to your comments about people, you recently had a terminal that voted to decertify the union. That's probably perhaps even more of an achievement given the current climate, but just wanted to see if you could talk about some of the work that you've done on the employee engagement side. And then you had your annual wage increase. Any comments on where you stand relative to peers and whether you anticipate any maybe wage cost pressure, given some of the new contracts that have come through in the rest of the industry?\nMario Harik: Thanks, Bruce. So this is a topic in terms of employee engagement and satisfaction that is very important for all of us. And here recently, our latest quarterly employee engagement service -- survey we did here in the month of July had another record of employee engagement and satisfaction across our organization. And our latest frontline employees survey for dockworkers and drivers was a company record since Conway started measuring it back in 2009. And the way we've been able to achieve those numbers is that, the entire organization is spending a lot of time in the field. Just to give you an idea, last year, for me personally, I visited 50 to 60 service centers. So one to two per week where we \u2013 and this applies for -- Dave has been with us now for three months, he is out in the field every single week. Same thing with the folks who run our east and west divisions. And all -- the entire leadership team is spending time in the field getting feedback from our employees and how we can improve what we're doing with them. And some of these could be how we manage work, some of it could be around compensation, some of it could be around tools that we offer them. And when you listen and take action, you see that your workforce wants to be part of the company -- a growing company and providing great service for the customers as well. So lot of these are things that we're doing and we continue to see here record employee engagement. On the wage increases, we typically do those on April 1 and this year, we have taken -- we've also given all of our folks in the field their wage increases in the beginning of April.\nOperator: Our next question is from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer and Company. Please proceed.\nScott Schneeberger: Thank you very much. Good morning and congrats, Kyle. Mario, could you just speak to what you see out there as far as the demand environment across your end markets? Obviously, a lot of focus on what happens post-Yellow, but just on the general environment heading into the back half of the back-to-school season, the peak holiday, just what are you seeing, how are you feeling about where we are in the cycle? Thanks.\nMario Harik: Thank you. I'll first start with the first half of the year and then what we're seeing pre-disruption and what we saw post-disruption. Well, we saw the trough in the first half of the year from a freight demand perspective in the month of March and volumes modestly improved in April and May and then got weaker again in the month of June. Now, July ahead of the disruption, in the first half of the month, we had seen our shipment count and tonnage flip to positive, signaling a slightly improved freight demand environment. Now, if you break it down to date, two-thirds of our customers are industrial companies and what we're seeing there is that, the ISM, which is an index we look at for manufacturing, has been trailing below 50 for the past nine months, it did modestly improve in the month of July versus June. And we're hearing that from our customers, there is mixed feedback. Some portions of the industrial economy are doing well, others are seeing softer demand in the back half. So it's fairly mixed. Namely, automotive and the industrials are doing very, very strongly here. On the retail side, we continue to see improvements in managing elevated inventory levels. Most of our retail customers have worked through that inventory and do expect stronger demand in the back half and they do expect also a decent holiday season coming up here. So it does look like the freight markets have troughed from a demand perspective, but we'll see how things roll forward here over the next couple of quarters.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks. Appreciate the overview. And then I was just curious, accessorial charges is an initiative of yours. I don't think you're going to really delve into that too much until the back half of this year and that's a long-term initiative, but could the Yellow situation help you jumpstart it? I know you're about low double digits of overall revenue right now. Where do you see that moving, how quickly, and just a progress report on where that is? Thanks.\nKyle Wismans: Sure. Thanks for the question. So when you think about accessorials, it's one of our many pricing initiatives we're excited about and certainly this disruption will enable us to drive some pricing actions more quickly. When you think about what we're doing, most recently, we've put in place technology and process improvements to ensure we're consistently capturing location-based accessorials. We're also consistently making updates to our tariffs, not just to make sure we get paid fairly for the services we provide. We also see opportunities around certain services we don't have now, really value-added services and all these things can help us accelerate really in the back half.\nOperator: We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Harik for closing comments.\nMario Harik: Thank you, operator, and thanks all for joining us today and for all your questions. This is a very dynamic environment in our industry and we remain focused on unlocking the massive potential we have in our company by continuing to provide great service to our customers. One month into this quarter and we have a lot of great momentum. We're making further investments in capacity. We're moving more freight in our network and we're driving higher yield growth. We look forward to seeing you guys again in the call in November. Thanks, all.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kyle Wismans",
            "content": "Thank you, Mario, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to step into the CFO role. We have a significant opportunity ahead of us to create even more shareholder value with a clear line of sight to our goals. And I'm looking forward to building on our momentum as we continue to execute on the LTL 2.0 plan. Now turning to the second quarter. Revenue for the total company was $1.9 billion, down 6% year-over-year, and up 1% sequentially from the first quarter. In our LTL segment, revenue was down 8% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. Almost all of the decline was related to fuel surcharge revenue. Excluding fuel, revenue was down just 1% year-over-year, and up 4% sequentially. LTL salaries, wages and benefits in total were 4.6% higher than a year ago, primarily due to wage increases. As Mario noted, we did a good job of managing our field labor costs in the quarter. We handled more shipments per day, with lower headcount and fewer hours than in the second quarter a year ago. Purchased transportation expense was down year-over-year by 35% or $47 million, as we insourced more linehaul miles to reduce our use of third-party carriers. We ended the quarter at 20.7% of linehaul miles outsourced, which was a 400 basis point improvement from the same quarter last year. We also paid significantly lower contract rates in the quarter as our renegotiated contracts cycled in with the carriers. Depreciation expense in the quarter increased by 24% or $12 million, driven by our investments in the LTL network. Our CapEx spend was primarily related to bringing in new tractors from the OEMs and manufacturing more trailers in-house. Next, I'll add some detail to adjusted EBITDA, starting with the company as a whole. We generated adjusted EBITDA of $244 million in the quarter, down 16% year-over-year. We reduced corporate expenses by 71% for savings of $24 million, which we achieved by rationalizing our corporate cost structure following the RXO spinoff. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 12.7%, representing a year-over-year deterioration of 140 basis points. Looking at just the LTL segment, adjusted EBITDA was $208 million, down 24% from a year ago. Our gains and cost efficiency were offset by the aggregate impact of the current operating environment. Namely, lower fuel surcharge revenue, tonnage, wage inflation, and lower pension income. In our European Transportation segment, adjusted EBITDA was $46 million, down $3 million year-over-year. Company-wide, we reported net income from continuing operations of $31 million in the quarter, representing diluted earnings per share of $0.27. This compares to income of $96 million and earnings of $0.83 per diluted share a year ago. The year-over-year decline in income from continuing operations was partially due to higher transaction and integration costs and restructuring charges. We had $17 million of transaction and integration costs related to the RXO spin-off and another $10 million of restructuring charges across the segments. We expect that costs in both categories will step down materially by the end of this year. On an adjusted basis, our EPS for the quarter was $0.71, which is down 38% from a year ago. And lastly, we generated $131 million of cash flow from continuing operations and deployed $126 million of net CapEx. Reinvesting in the business remains our top priority for capital allocation. Moving to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $290 million of cash on hand. Combined, with available capacity under committed borrowing facilities, this gave us $802 million of liquidity at quarter end. We had no borrowings outstanding under our ABL facility at quarter end and our net debt leverage was 2.3 times trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. In May, we completed the refinancing of our $2 billion term loan. This doubled our weighted average maturity timeline to approximately six years, while our interest expense is effectively unchanged this year. And notably, we received upgrades on our secured debt from Moody's and S&P. We also now have two investment-grade ratings on our secured debt. Our capital structure gives us the financial flexibility to execute on the significant opportunities we have at XPO. Now, I'll turn it over to Ali, who will cover our operating results. Hey, Fadi, it's Kyle. So as Ali mentioned, our yield growth strengthened in the second quarter and into July as a lot of our internal initiatives gained traction. And as Mario mentioned, our focus continues to be on providing excellent service. But given there is less near-term capacity, we are taking pricing action with customers. We implemented a GRI with our transactional 3PL business and we've also moved up our target for contract renewals. Now some of these actions will take hold very quickly like the GRI. Others with annual contracts will take time to realize. But our customers understand, when you take 10% of capacity out of the market, it's going to cost more to move freight. But as we said, our baseline expectation is 3% year-over-year growth. And these initiatives could help us move above that range. But it's too early to tell what that's going to look like and we'll update you later on. Thank you. Yes, thanks, Brian. So when you think about the GRI we took, that was in the transactional 3PL business. So that's really the broker business. There was an expected GRI later in the year. So that's kind of steady-state maybe pull-forward slightly. So we wouldn't expect too many differences there. We're not anticipating at this point other GRIs as we progress and we'll continue with our yield initiatives to drive-up profitability in the back half. But when you think about the initiatives, again, some of those are going to be immediate impact like a GRI and others as you work through contractual renewals will take time to realize. The gains are related to the asset turn-in, so it's part of a normal process, Jon, for turning in equipment out there. So, part of normal business. Thank you. Sure. Thanks for the question. So when you think about accessorials, it's one of our many pricing initiatives we're excited about and certainly this disruption will enable us to drive some pricing actions more quickly. When you think about what we're doing, most recently, we've put in place technology and process improvements to ensure we're consistently capturing location-based accessorials. We're also consistently making updates to our tariffs, not just to make sure we get paid fairly for the services we provide. We also see opportunities around certain services we don't have now, really value-added services and all these things can help us accelerate really in the back half."

            "name": "Mario Harik",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call. I'm here in Greenwich with Kyle Wismans, our incoming Chief Financial Officer; Carl Anderson, our outgoing CFO; and Ali Faghri, our Chief Strategy Officer. This morning, you saw us report a solid quarter despite a soft operating environment. Company-wide, we generated revenue of $1.9 billion, and adjusted EPS of $0.71. We also delivered adjusted EBITDA of $244 million, coming in above expectations. In our North American LTL segment, adjusted EBITDA was $208 million, also above expectation. I want to focus my comments this morning on the progress we are making with the four pillars of our plan for LTL 2.0. The first pillar is to provide industry leading customer service. Last year, we implemented multiple initiatives to elevate our customer service levels, including a new incentive compensation structure for the field. We've made it clear to the team that customer service is our top priority and we're seeing the impact of that in our key service metrics. In the second quarter our claims ratio for damages was 0.7%, which is an improvement compared with 0.9% in 2022, and 1.2% at the end of 2021. And in the month of June, our damage claims per shipment came in at the best in over seven years. Another key metric is on time performance, we improved this by 10 percentage points in the quarter year-over-year. Going forward, we're keeping up the momentum as we begin to roll out new tools for the field, including higher quality straps, airbag systems, and new storage racks in our service centers. More recently with the acceleration in July volumes, we've continued to improve key service metrics. During this period of industry disruption, we're protecting capacity for our existing customers and being disciplined in what freight we bring on into our network. While we've made considerable progress with service in a relatively short time, there's a lot more we can do. Our entire organization is laser focused on providing the best LTL service in the industry. The second pillar of our plan is to invest in our network for the long term. As you know, we anticipate allocating CapEx of 8% to 12% of revenue on average over the next several years. Now that we've completed our two spin offs, we have more opportunities to invest in driving long term growth in LTL, a business that generates a high return on invested capital. Most of our CapEx this year is being deployed to increase the capacity of our fleet. We've added more than 900 tractors which has brought down the average age of our fleet to 5.1 years from 5.9 years at the end of 2022. We've also produced nearly 3,100 new trailers at our manufacturing facility in Arkansas. And we're on track to meet our targets for over 6000 new trailers this year. In addition, we expanded capacity at our service centers in Norcross, Georgia and in Salt Lake City. This aligns with our plan to add new doors and markets where more capacity can sustain more growth over time. At this point, we've added more than half of the 900 net new doors contemplated in our plan and we expect to open the remainder by early 2024, primarily by expanding existing terminals. These targeted expansions will help improve network density and fluidity over the long term. Given the recent market dynamics, we're evaluating the pace of our CapEx plan to see if we want to accelerate our investments in network capacity. There is a potential for our annual CapEx as a percent of revenue to exceed the high end of our target range in the near term. The third pillar of our plan is to accelerate yield growth. We grew yields excluding fuel by 1.4% year-over-year, in line with our outlook for the second quarter. We still had a headwind from mix as we described last quarter. However, our underlying pricing trends remained solid with contract renewal pricing up by mid-single digits. Yield is our single biggest lever for margin improvement going forward. And we have multiple initiatives underway to leverage the gains we're making in service quality and operating excellence. We started to see the impact of these initiatives grow in the second quarter and we expect this acceleration to continue. The fourth and final pillar of LTL 2.0 is to continue to drive cost efficiencies. The main opportunities here are in purchased transportation, our variable cost structure and overhead expense. In the second quarter, we reduced our purchased transportation costs by 35% year-over-year by utilizing two levers. First, we continue to reprice contracts with third party carriers to capitalize on favorable market conditions. At the same time, we reduced third party linehaul miles in the quarter by 400 basis points versus last year. This aligns with our plan to achieve a 50% reduction in purchased transportation costs as a percent of revenue by 2027. Labor is another opportunity to control variable costs in our field operation. We did that effectively in the second quarter. Our headcount and labor hours were down year-over-year, while our shipment count was up. We also made significant progress in reducing our corporate overhead as we continue to rationalize our cost structure after the latest spin off. While we're committed to becoming continuously more cost efficient, we're also careful to set the company up for long term growth. This includes investments in new tools for the field to further improve service quality and the significant expansion of our local sales force. Turning to Europe, our business continued to perform well in a soft operating environment, with organic revenue largely unchanged. Despite the macro uncertainty in parts of Europe, we continue to see a strong pricing environment across the segments and our sales pipeline is robust. I'll wrap up my remarks on the quarter by summarizing the progress we've made to date with our LTL 2.0 plan. We're continuing to generate some of our best service levels in years and this is enabling us to gain profitable market share. This has put the business on a path to stronger yield growth as we're able to price based on the increasing value we're providing customers. We're also continuing to make strategic investments in our network to capitalize on upturns in demand. We have a long track record of delivering high returns on investments in this business. And we're becoming more cost efficient by reducing our use of purchased transportation, managing variable labor costs effectively, and rationalizing our cost structure at the corporate level. With our operational momentum and disciplined investments in long term growth, we remain on track to deliver on our outlook for at least 600 basis points of adjusted operating ratio improvement through 2027. In closing, I want to comment on the CFO transition we announced in July. Some of you already know Kyle, who will take over as our Chief Financial Officer next week. Kyle has been a senior finance leader with public companies for over 17 years, including a long career with General Electric. And he's been immersed in our business for the past four years, most recently as our Head of Revenue Management and Finance in LTL. This will be a seamless transition. I also want to thank Carl, our outgoing CFO for his leadership of our finance team. Carl is rejoining a former colleague in an industry where he worked for over a decade, where I'm confident he'll have continued success. Now I'm going to hand the call over to Kyle to discuss the second quarter results. Kyle, over to you. Good morning, Ken, and thanks for the question. Well, first starting with the July tonnage, so when you look at our tonnage, it was up 4.2% year-on-year in the month of July and shipment count was up 8.8% in the month of July. Now when you compare that to typical seasonality, usually June to July, we see shipment count be down 2.8%, but for us, this July we went up 3.2%, so call it a 6% swing above typical seasonality. And same thing on the tonnage side, we usually see seasonality June to July go down 4.1%, while this July we saw it go up 2.6%, so that also 6% to 7% higher. Now, when you look at the beginning of the month versus the end of the month, we already had seen positive tonnage and shipments at the beginning of July, and we saw that accelerate -- the shipment count accelerated in the high-single-digit range from the beginning of the month till the end of the month. Now, it's tough to tell what the rest of the quarter is going to do. It is a very fluid situation at this point and we'll see how these numbers obviously shakeout here for August and beyond. On the capital side, so we have been investing more capital into our business as part of our LTL 2.0 plan to add more capacity. And with this much capacity coming out of the industry, we're looking to accelerate these capacity adds. And this would be in doors, in tractors, and trailers. And just to give you an example, at our Searcy facility we have the ability to produce 7,500 trailers per year. And initially, we have planned to produce slightly north of 6,000 trailers for the year, but we could expand that production here to 7,500 trailers for the year, given what we're seeing. Our long term guide is 8% to 12% of the CapEx as a percent of revenue. And we'd expect to be at the high-end of the range or above the high-end of the range in the near-term as we add more capacity. In terms of the flow-through. So when we think about it, we have been adding quite a bit of capacity over the last year and a half. So we've added, first on the rolling stock perspective, we've added more than 1,900 tractors, more than 8,000 trailers over the last year and a half. We've also added more doors in markets where we needed more capacity. Last year we opened up six new service centers, this year so-far we expanded two service centers. So on the rolling stock and actual physical capacity, we're feeling good about where we are. And on the people side, we have had headroom on the headcount side, but at the same time, in some locations where we're seeing higher demand, we're going be adding more headcount and potentially lean into more purchased transportation if it makes sense as well. The flow-through --these additions of additional capacity do have a shorter-term cost impact associated with them, but at the same time we do expect good flow-through on the additional business we're adding, so being very selective. When you look at the long-term target, Scott, there is a good likelihood that the current market disruption would enable us to accelerate price and volume growth beyond our original targets. Now, with what's happened over the last few weeks, it's a bit too early to tell how it kind of manifests itself for the long term. Our focus continues to drive OR meaningfully lower in the years to come. And that's why we've always said there's at least 600 basis points by 2027. And we still feel very comfortable with that. Thank you. Thanks, Fadi. I'll start with the service fees and turn it over to Kyle for yield and pricing. Well, service is our top priority and it will continue to be our top priority. And Dave and the team are doing a great job, being able to handle that additional influx in freight that we're seeing here. And just to give you an example, Fadi, in the month of July, we've seen shipment count go up 9% year-on-year, yet, our service metrics improved relative to June. When you think about claims filed per shipment, when you think about on-time service, we see those continue to pick up in the month of July. Now, there's a few reasons for that. One is that, as I mentioned earlier, we have been investing in capacity over the last year and a half where we've added more doors in markets where we needed to have those doors, recently in Salt Lake City and Norcross, Georgia. We've been adding more to our rolling stock, we've added more than 1,900 tractors since we initiated LTL 2.0. We've added more than 8,000 trailers since we initiated the program as well. Also, we -- a lot of the changes we implemented on improving service are now cultural, that's part of what we do every day, including incentive comp changes, including new technology, and how we load trailers, including overall recognition programs around service. And moving forward, that momentum is building through new training programs we're launching, new tools we are launching, our people in the field as well now that we have Dave on-board driving a lot of these initiatives. On the labor side, as Ali mentioned, if we need more labor in some of the sites where we're seeing more volume, we are adding the headcount where we need it. We could also lean more into purchased transportation in the near term if we need it as well. Then finally, we're very focused on being selective on the freight we take on. A lot of it goes down to being picky on the freight. We want four by four feet pallets or skids that we on-board from our customers that fits well in LTL network. And at the same time, we're looking for margin-accretive business that will improve our OR over time. So we're being very disciplined and our service product continues to be our top priority as we move forward from here. Thanks, Ravi. When you look at the overall industry capacity, it has been fairly tight for a long time. Over the last decade, the number of service centers in our industry has stayed flat. And now when you look at taking out 10% of capacity, that's obviously a big hole in terms of the amount of capacity that is available. But there are a few carriers adding more capacity, us included, but these adds will take time to materialize when you think about the service centers and doors that -- to be added across the network. These won't happen overnight. So we do think that over time -- so the freight gets absorbed first and then over time, you will see us and a few other carriers add that capacity, but it's going to be a longer-term process to be able to get there. As Kyle said, it's still early to tell what the impact on pricing is going to be. When you look at LTL, pricing has always been very disciplined, given the dynamic of shortage of capacity versus demand and growth. And when you take out this amount of capacity, we would expect yield to see tailwinds in the quarters and years to come here. And you couple that with the potential freight recovery as we head into 2024, that's going to accelerate from there as well. Well, first, as you know, Ravi, technology has been part of our DNA since the onset of the company and all of our systems in LTL that operate the network are proprietary. And when you think about an LTL business, we're very much in the data business, because we move more than 50,000 shipments a day and we have a lot of data points on how we move those shipments across the network. But just to give you a couple of examples how we operate our linehaul network, our models do use AI and ML to optimize how many loads we are building in each hub in the network, and we're launching new technology and how we do things like directed loading, as an example, to improve how we build trailers to bypass service centers and improve efficiency. Similar thing on how we plan labor and how we manage labor in the field, similar technology on how we run our pickup and delivery routes. And on a net-net basis, at the end of the day, all of these things lead to better results to the bottom line. Just to give you an example, in the second quarter, our shipment count was up roughly 2%, but our labor hours and headcount was down 2%. And these tools enable us to build these efficiencies into the operation. Thanks, Brian. If there is an opportunity for us to accelerate our capacity growth, we would definitely look at it. Now our focus is to continue to execute on our long-term plan to expand capacity, which has been a pillar -- a core pillar in our LTL 2.0 plan. Now, regardless of if this capacity becomes available, we are looking at continuing also our expansion where, so far I mentioned earlier, we expanded two service centers so far this year and we have another dozen or so projects for expanding other service centers in key markets, especially in the Texas area and Florida and Arizona, so in a number of markets. Now, again, if these facilities go on the market, then we'll definitely look at them as well. Thanks, Stephanie. Well, we are looking at it in a very balanced approach. Step number one is, making sure that we safeguard the capacity to existing customers and we keep on honoring the capacity commitments we had with them. But when you think about the influx of volume, we are assessing those opportunities to bring incremental freight on a case-by-case basis, both from existing and from new customers. We are using that as an opportunity to improve the mix as a whole for our customers. And as I mentioned earlier, we're looking at it in two main criteria. One is, making sure that the customers that we're onboarding freight for have four-by-four feet type skids that fits well in an LTL network. And we're also looking at it from an OR perspective and making sure that we are on-boarding margin-accretive business as we are adding. So we're being very disciplined into the shipments and tonnage we're bringing on to our network. And now, on the pricing side, when you take out, as Kyle mentioned earlier, 10% of the capacity in the market, it does cost more to move freight for your customers and also we want to make sure we're charging a fair price given the value that we are offering our customers as well with the improvements we're seeing in our service product over time as well. So we're looking at it in a very balanced way in terms of being disciplined how we add volume, while leaning onto the price lever as well. Thank you. Well, we announced stopping that process in the near term in the month of December. But our goal long-term continues to be a -- being a pure-play North American LTL company. Now that said, this business is operating really well. As you heard from Ali and Kyle, we're doing really well despite the softer macroeconomic environment in Europe. Our organic revenue is largely unchanged on a year-on-year basis and the team there is doing a fantastic job servicing customers. Yes. So when you think about it, I think this is still a very fluid situation here given the disruption that happened in the market. So Chris, it's tough to evaluate how quickly the pace of improvement is going to go here in the near term. But over the next weeks and months, we're going to have a better picture on where things are shaking out. But it's fair to assume that you would see an overall yield and price acceleration. And also the way we look at it, it's all about charging a fair price for the service that we are offering our customers. When you look at these service improvements, I'm incredibly excited about having Dave on the team and all the progress that our operating teams are doing on keep on improving the service product. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we are adding new tools to the field such as higher-quality straps, airbag systems, racks in service centers. We are improving the instructions of how we load trailers and training associated with that. And all of these will lead to better service, which over time would also lead to a higher yield. Now again, the pace of the disruption here that we're seeing would accelerate, but it's tough at this point to predict what it's going to look like given it's all fairly new over the last few weeks. Thanks, Jordan. Well, first on the capacity side. We ended the second quarter at roughly 20% excess capacity from a physical capacity perspective. So think doors and service centers. And that moderated down, call it, to the mid-teens here in the month of July as we've seen that impact in higher volumes. Now, usually on a longer-term basis, we want to be in that 20% to 25% range of excess capacity. Now, as you know, in an LTL network, it's not linear. So you have some markets where we had excess capacity. And then we have other markets where we already are -- we are at capacity and the goal is to add these -- in these markets where we need those extra doors the additional physical capacity. On the rolling stock side, we are feeling very good based on where we are now over the last year and a half. As I mentioned earlier, we've added more than 1,900 tractors and we've added more than 8,000 new trailers. So the rolling stock side is feeling very good for us. And we are planning on accelerating some of these investments here in the near term. The third part of capacity is on the people side. Today, we are staffed to current volumes and we have some headroom, but also in some markets we also are looking to add more headcount and potentially lean into purchased transportation if we needed as well. The good news there is that the labor markets are very ripe for hiring people. And just to give you an example, Jordan, in the second quarter the applicants per open req that we had went up three-folds on a year-on-year basis. So it's a very good market to be able to add people, but these are the different aspects of capacity. And again, on the door side, we're going to continue on adding doors to get to that 20%, 25% excess free capacity that we can leverage for longer-term growth. Yes, that's correct. And again, it will depend on some of the markets where we are at capacity. Then these, obviously, we will need to add more in the near term as well. You bet. Our long-term goal is to get the claims ratio of 0.1% and -- but the improvement won't be linear, and it will take a number of years for us to get there. And now having Dave on the team and the experience of him driving a better service product over time is going to allow us to get there on a faster timeline. But it still will take us a number of years to get there. Now when you look at what we've done so far, I mentioned earlier, over the last year and a half we tied incentive compensation plans to improvements in service. We tied the recognition programs at the service center level to the improvements in service and we've also launched technology that enables us to rate every trailer that we load across the network every single night and having a rating of quality of loading at that particular -- for that particular load. And moving forward, we are launching new tools, as I mentioned earlier, for the field, including new airbag system across all of our service centers, storage racks that help with how you unload and reload appointment freight, higher-quality straps. We're also improving how we are operating training and loading procedures for our dockworkers to further improve service. Again, our June claims per shipment was the best in seven years and our goal is to keep on improving. But again, it won't be linear from here, all the way down to 0.1%, but the expectation is to continue to see that service product improvement over the years to come. Thanks, Bruce. So this is a topic in terms of employee engagement and satisfaction that is very important for all of us. And here recently, our latest quarterly employee engagement service -- survey we did here in the month of July had another record of employee engagement and satisfaction across our organization. And our latest frontline employees survey for dockworkers and drivers was a company record since Conway started measuring it back in 2009. And the way we've been able to achieve those numbers is that, the entire organization is spending a lot of time in the field. Just to give you an idea, last year, for me personally, I visited 50 to 60 service centers. So one to two per week where we \u2013 and this applies for -- Dave has been with us now for three months, he is out in the field every single week. Same thing with the folks who run our east and west divisions. And all -- the entire leadership team is spending time in the field getting feedback from our employees and how we can improve what we're doing with them. And some of these could be how we manage work, some of it could be around compensation, some of it could be around tools that we offer them. And when you listen and take action, you see that your workforce wants to be part of the company -- a growing company and providing great service for the customers as well. So lot of these are things that we're doing and we continue to see here record employee engagement. On the wage increases, we typically do those on April 1 and this year, we have taken -- we've also given all of our folks in the field their wage increases in the beginning of April. Thank you. I'll first start with the first half of the year and then what we're seeing pre-disruption and what we saw post-disruption. Well, we saw the trough in the first half of the year from a freight demand perspective in the month of March and volumes modestly improved in April and May and then got weaker again in the month of June. Now, July ahead of the disruption, in the first half of the month, we had seen our shipment count and tonnage flip to positive, signaling a slightly improved freight demand environment. Now, if you break it down to date, two-thirds of our customers are industrial companies and what we're seeing there is that, the ISM, which is an index we look at for manufacturing, has been trailing below 50 for the past nine months, it did modestly improve in the month of July versus June. And we're hearing that from our customers, there is mixed feedback. Some portions of the industrial economy are doing well, others are seeing softer demand in the back half. So it's fairly mixed. Namely, automotive and the industrials are doing very, very strongly here. On the retail side, we continue to see improvements in managing elevated inventory levels. Most of our retail customers have worked through that inventory and do expect stronger demand in the back half and they do expect also a decent holiday season coming up here. So it does look like the freight markets have troughed from a demand perspective, but we'll see how things roll forward here over the next couple of quarters. Thank you, operator, and thanks all for joining us today and for all your questions. This is a very dynamic environment in our industry and we remain focused on unlocking the massive potential we have in our company by continuing to provide great service to our customers. One month into this quarter and we have a lot of great momentum. We're making further investments in capacity. We're moving more freight in our network and we're driving higher yield growth. We look forward to seeing you guys again in the call in November. Thanks, all."

            "name": "Ali Faghri",
            "content": "Thank you, Kyle. I'll start with the review of the second quarter operating results for our LTL segment. During the quarter, demand for LTL stayed below historical levels. This drove a 4.7% decline in our weight per shipment in the quarter. We offset some of this with a 1.9% increase in shipment count, led by 15% growth in our local sales channel. These share gains are a direct reflection of the service improvements we're making in the network. As a result, we were able to limit the decline in tonnage per day to 2.8%. On a monthly basis, April tonnage per day was down 2% year-over-year, May was down 2.3%, and June was down 4%. Looking just at shipments per day, April was up 3.1% year-over-year, May was up 1.8%, and June was up 0.9%. On a two-year stack basis, monthly tonnage improved each month throughout the second quarter. In July, we moved even more freight through the network with tonnage up 4.2% year-over-year and shipment count up 8.8%. On a sequential basis from June, July tonnage was up 2.6% and shipment count was up 3.2%. Looking at yield, on an ex-fuel basis, increased by 1.4% versus last year, in line with our outlook. On a sequential basis, we increased yield ex-fuel quarter-over-quarter, outperforming typical seasonality. While mix has continued to be a headwind to yield, our underlying trends remain solid, with contract renewal pricing up 5% in the quarter versus last year. Also, our yield initiatives are continuing to gain traction and resulted in stronger yield growth as the quarter progressed, into July. As we look ahead, we are excited about the trends we see in yield and our outlook for the third quarter, as well as the long term. We expect our year-over-year yield growth, ex-fuel, to further accelerate in the third quarter versus Q2. Turning to margin performance, our second quarter adjusted operating ratio was 87.6%, which is unfavorable by 440 basis points compared with second quarter a year ago. As part of our LTL 2.0 strategy, we have been increasing our capital investments to drive long-term growth. In the near term, there is a headwind to our margins from higher depreciation as these investments ramp. If we exclude the impacts of depreciation as well as fuel, our adjusted operating ratio in the quarter would have improved on a year-over-year basis. On a sequential basis, we improved adjusted OR by 200 basis points compared with the first quarter. This outperformed our expectations. Moving to our European business, we delivered another solid financial quarter with organic revenue down slightly despite a soft macro backdrop. This was supported by a mix of new customer wins and contract renewals. Two of our key markets, the UK and Central Europe, outperformed the European segment as a whole. And our pricing in Europe was higher than the same period last year, outpacing inflation. Before we go to Q&A, I want to highlight our significant progress we're making toward becoming a world-class LTL provider. We've meaningfully improved service and are rolling out new initiatives to drive further improvements. As we take on more volume, like we did in July, we're maintaining strong service levels and being disciplined about the freight we accept into our network. We're also building yield growth and expect an acceleration in the second half of this year as our initiatives continue to ramp up. And importantly, we are carefully managing variable costs, while continuing to make strategic investments in the network. For all these reasons, we're excited about our trajectory and our momentum towards achieving our long-term targets. With that, we'll take your questions. Operator, please open the line for Q&A. Good morning, Tom. This is Ali. So as Mario noted, we did see positive tonnage and shipment counts on a year-over-year basis in the early part of July, but we did see that accelerate towards the end of the month. At the end of July, we saw roughly about a high single digit increase in our shipment count versus the beginning of the month. So, call it, somewhere in that 3,000 shipments per day increase. I'll pass to Mario. Good morning, Scott. This is Ali. So in terms of the tonnage and shipment count, as we mentioned, in the month of July tonnage was just up over 4% year-over-year and shipment counts were up about 9%. Given the acceleration we did see towards the end of the month, you can assume that the year-over-year growth rates for both tonnage and shipment counts were up more than we thought for the full month. As we mentioned, from the beginning of the month to the end of the month, shipment counts were up about high single digits sequentially. Now, when you think about the third quarter, I'll walk you through the moving pieces here. So from a tonnage perspective, normal seasonality is about a 4% sequential decline in tonnage Q3 versus Q2. Now, that would imply Q3 tonnage down in that low to mid-single digit range on a year-over-year basis. We would expect to do better than that. July clearly outperformed with tonnage up slightly over 4%, but I would point out that the monthly compares do get more difficult as the quarter progresses. Last September, we saw tonnage inflect positive year-over-year. So overall, we would expect positive tonnage year-over-year in the third quarter and we'll give another update on August in early September. On the yield side, we did have strong momentum even before the recent industry disruption. Yield growth accelerated through the second quarter and that continued into July. Our current baseline forecast is that Q3 yield ex-fuel will accelerate versus 2Q on a year-over-year basis, call it, somewhere in that 3% year-over-year growth range. And then lastly, from an operating ratio perspective, a typical seasonality is about 230 basis points deterioration Q3 versus Q2. Given how the month of July played out, we would expect to outperform seasonality for OR by at least 100 basis points. Now the magnitude of that outperformance versus seasonality, that's going to be driven by how tonnage performs through the rest of the quarter. And as Mario noted, there are some incremental cost to consider related to that uptick in volume. For example, we may need to increase field labor and also tap into purchased transportation as a source of supplemental capacity on a short-term basis. But overall, we would expect to outperform seasonality by at least 100 basis points and we'll have a better idea on the magnitude as the quarter progresses. Good morning, Chris. This is Ali. It's hard to know at this point how much incremental share is going to come our way. As Mario mentioned, we're being very disciplined with the freight that we're bringing into the network. Our priority is to make sure that it's good freight that fits our network, and most importantly is margin-accretive. And so, that's our strategy as it relates to the incremental volumes. And then we'll give you another update in terms of August trends in early September. Good morning, Jon. So in the fourth quarter of last year, we did announce that we won't be selling the European business in the near term. And we're not going to address the potential sale further beyond what we had said in that December filing. That being said, our long term plan remains to be a pure-play North American LTL carrier. Having said that, as Mario noted, that business continues to perform well in a soft macro backdrop. Our organic revenue was down slightly. And we saw constant currency revenue growth in both our UK business as well as our Central Europe business as well."

I will now turn the call over to XPO's Chief Executive Officer, Mario Harik. Mr. Harik, you may begin.\nMario Harik: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call. I'm here in Greenwich with Carl Anderson, our CFO; and Ali Faghri, our Chief Strategy Officer. This morning, you saw us report a solid quarter despite a challenging macro environment. Company-wide, we generated revenue of $1.9 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth in a soft market. And we grew adjusted EPS by 22%. We also delivered adjusted EBITDA growth of 14%, which was better than our outlook for low double-digit growth. In our North American LTL segment, adjusted EBITDA was down 2%, within our guided range. This was primarily driven by weaker tonnage trends in the industry in March. I want to focus my comments this morning on the progress we're making with the four pillars of our plan for LTL 2.0. The first pillar is to provide industry-leading service. In early 2022, we changed the incentive plan for thousands of LTL employees to tie their compensation to service quality in addition to profits. This was one of multiple initiatives we implemented to elevate our customer service levels. Our focus on service excellence is having a tangible impact on the metrics our customers track. In the first quarter, our claims ratio for damages was 0.7%, which was an improvement from 1.1% last year. This is one of our best claims ratios in more than a decade. And our on-time performance in the quarter was back to pre-COVID levels. We've made considerable progress in a relatively short time, and there's a lot more we can do. Our entire organization is laser-focused on providing the industry's best service. The second pillar of our plan is to invest in our network for the long-term. Now that the spin-offs are complete, we have more opportunity to invest in driving long-term growth in LTL, a business that generates a high return on invested capital. Our business model is more streamlined now with higher visibility into opportunities to optimize our network. We plan to continue to invest in all parts of the cycle. Our LTL CapEx as a percentage of revenue was typically in the mid-single digits each year. That changed in 2022 when we launched our plan for LTL 2.0. And going forward, we anticipate CapEx of 8% to 12% of revenue on average over the next several years. The investments we're making are mostly tied to our fleet. In the first quarter, we added more than 700 tractors, which brought the average age of the fleet down to 5.2 years from 5.9 years at year-end. We also produced nearly 1,800 new trailers at our in-house manufacturing facility in Arkansas. And we're on track to meet our target for over 6,000 trailers produced this year. Our plan calls for adding new doors in a market that can use more capacity and sustain growth over time. These are targeted additions that help improve network density and fluidity over the long-term. In 2023, we expect to grow our total door count by a percentage in the low single digits. When industry volumes rebound, we'll capitalize on these highly turned investments. The third pillar of our plan is to accelerate yield growth. In the first quarter, we grew yield, excluding fuel, by 1.4% year-over-year. That was in line with our outlook. We still had a headwind from mix, as we described last quarter. However, our underlying pricing trends remained solid with contract renewal pricing up by mid-single digits. Yield remains a key area of focus for us, and we have multiple new initiatives underway to leverage the gains we\u2019re making and service quality and operating excellence. This will lead to stronger yield growth over time. The fourth and final pillar of LTL 2.0 is to continue to drive cost efficiencies. The main opportunities here are in purchased transportation, the cost structure in the field and overhead expense. In the first quarter, we reduced our purchased transportation costs by 27% versus last year by utilizing two levers; first, we proactively pulled forward the bid cycle with third-party carriers to capitalize on favorable market conditions. At the same time, we have reduced third-party line-haul miles in the quarter by nearly three percentage points versus last year. And we're accelerating this to capitalize on the weak macro when we have more capacity available. We're targeting a 50% reduction in purchased transportation as a percent of revenue by 2027. On the labor side, we're executing on a plan to align our field cost structure more closely with the current demand environment and reduce some of our salaried headcount. You'll see the full run rate benefit of these actions starting in the third quarter. Turning to Europe, our business continued to perform ahead of expectations in the quarter, delivering mid single-digit organic revenue growth. Despite the macro uncertainty in parts of Europe, we're seeing a strong pricing environment overall, and our sales pipeline continues to be robust. I'll wrap up my remarks by summarizing the progress we've made to date on our LTL 2.0 plan. We're continuing to elevate service as a top priority, and it's generating some of our best service levels in years. Customers like what they're seeing, and it's allowing us to gain profitable market share and grow share of wallet. This will translate to stronger yield growth over time. We're being proactive on this by executing multiple initiatives to accelerate yield over the long-term. We're also continuing to make strategic investments in our network to capitalize when demand recovers. We have a long track record of delivering high returns on investments in this business. And we're executing on cost efficiencies by reducing our use of purchased transportation and rationalizing our cost structure at the corporate level and in the field. While we expect the near-term operating conditions to be challenging for the industry, at XPO, we remain on track to deliver on our long-term outlook for at least 600 basis points of adjusted operating ratio improvement through 2027. We're confident in our ability to deliver superior shareholder value as we increasingly drive financial and operational excellence in the business. Before I close, I want to thank our thousands of dedicated employees for helping XPO be world class in every aspect of our business. Our people at every level are our great differentiator, and we continue to attract the best talent. This includes two top talents who see the significant potential in XPO. Wes Frye is now a member of our Board, and Dave Bates is our new Chief Operating Officer. These LTL veterans will help accelerate the execution of our plan. Now I'm going to hand the call over to Carl to discuss the first quarter results. Carl, over to you.\nCarl Anderson: Thank you, Mario, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through our first quarter results, balance sheet and liquidity. Revenue in the quarter for the total company was $1.9 billion, up 1% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially from the fourth quarter. In our North American LTL business, revenue was up 1% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Revenue per hundred weight, excluding fuel, was up 1.4%, while higher shipments per day were offset by lower tonnage. LTL salaries, wages and employee benefits were 6.7% higher than a year ago, due primarily to wage increases granted to employees last year. We are taking action to reduce labor costs and drive productivity as we move through the year. Purchased transportation expense was down 27% or $37 million in the quarter as we in-source more third-party linehaul. We ended the quarter at approximately 22% of linehaul miles outsourced, which was also a 270 basis point improvement from the same quarter last year. We also benefited from implementing significantly lower contract rates with carriers in the quarter. In addition, we brought down our costs for insurance and claims compared with the first quarter last year. We're continuing to make great progress in reducing damage claims expense as we elevate our service levels. As part of our LTL 2.0 plan, we are continuing to reinvest back in the business as we bring on new tractors and trailers. The increased level of investment in 2022 and through the first quarter of this year resulted in a $12 million or 21% increase in depreciation expense this quarter. Now I'll turn to adjusted EBITDA, starting with the company as a whole. We grew adjusted EBITDA by 14% year-over-year to $210 million. This was primarily driven by a year-over-year reduction of $31 million in corporate expense as we rationalize our corporate cost structure following the RXO spin-off. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 11%, representing a year-over-year improvement of 130 basis points. For our LTL segment, adjusted EBITDA was $182 million, down 2% from a year ago, as our revenue growth and cost efficiencies were offset by the aggregate impact of lower tonnage, wage inflation and lower pension income. LTL adjusted EBITDA excludes $6 million of restructuring costs relating to the downsizing of administrative office. Excluding the impact from pension income, LTL adjusted EBITDA would have been up 4% versus last year. And finally, in our European Transportation segment, adjusted EBITDA was $37 million, roughly in line with last year. Company-wide, we reported net income from continuing operations of $17 million in the quarter, representing diluted earnings per share of $0.15. This compares to income of $32 million and earnings of $0.28 per share a year ago. The year-over-year decline in income from continuing operations is primarily attributable to higher restructuring and transaction and integration costs. In the first quarter, we had $24 million of restructuring charges that impacted all of our segments. In addition, we had $22 million of transaction and integration costs related to the spin-off last year. We expect that these costs will materially step down as we move forward in the year. Our adjusted tax rate was approximately 19% due to the benefit of some discrete tax items this quarter. And on an adjusted basis, our earnings per diluted share for the quarter was $0.56, which is up 22% from a year ago. And we generated $76 million of cash flow from continuing operations and deployed $224 million of CapEx. Moving to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $309 million of cash on hand. This cash, combined with available capacity under committed borrowing facilities, gave us $811 million of liquidity at quarter end. We had no borrowings outstanding under our ABL facility, and our net debt leverage at the end of the quarter was 2.2 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Earlier this week, we extended our \u20ac200 million securitization facility in Europe to July of 2026. And we're currently evaluating opportunities to refinance our term loan maturing in 2025 with new secured and/or unsecured debt. Now, I'll turn it over to Ali, who will provide an overview of our operating results.\nAli Faghri: Thank you, Carl. I'll start with a review of the first quarter operating results for our North American LTL segment. The impact of the economy was evident throughout the quarter, as demand for LTL stayed below historical levels, driving a 3.3% decline in our weight per shipment. We partially offset this with a 1.5% increase in shipment count, led by 9% growth in our local channel. This is a direct reflection of service improvements in the network. As a result, we were able to limit the decline in tonnage per day to 1.8%. On a monthly basis, compared with 2022, January tonnage was up 2.8%, February was down 2% and March was down 5.5%. Looking just at shipment count, January was up 5%, February was up 1.1% and March was down 0.5%. Yield, ex-fuel, increased by 1.4%, in line with our outlook. The year-over-year improvement held relatively steady on a monthly basis throughout the quarter. As Mario mentioned, mix has continued to be a headwind to yield, but our underlying trends remain solid, with contract renewal pricing up 4.5% in the quarter versus last year. In April, tonnage was down 2% compared with last year, while shipment count was up 3%. On a sequential basis, our April tonnage was up 2% versus March and shipment count was up 3%, both outperforming typical seasonality. Regarding yield, we expect second quarter yield, ex-fuel, to continue to be up year-over-year at approximately the same level as the first quarter improvement. We're very focused on driving yield growth by elevating service and being able to price based on the increasing value we're providing customers. This will naturally translate to more yield over time. And beyond that, there are a number of other levers we're pulling to accelerate growth. For example, we're taking additional pricing on accounts that aren't meeting our expectations. We're also growing accessorials, ensuring we're getting compensated for the value-added services we're providing. Turning to our margin performance, our first quarter adjusted operating ratio was 89.6%, which is unfavorable by 70 basis points compared to a year ago. We had a headwind of 110 basis points from depreciation expense, driven by a higher capital investment in the business. Excluding this headwind, adjusted OR would have improved versus last year. On a sequential basis, we improved adjusted OR by 70 basis points compared to the fourth quarter, which is an outperformance of 120 basis points versus typical seasonality. Moving to our European business, we delivered another solid quarterly performance with organic revenue growth of 5% despite a soft macro backdrop. This was propelled by a mix of new customer wins and contract renewals. Volume and pricing in Europe were both higher than the year-ago period by low single digits. And two of our key markets, Spain and the UK generated constant currency revenue growth of 11% and 9%, respectively, outperforming the European business overall. On the same basis, France was slightly positive year-over-year. Before I wrap up, I want to mention the 8-K we released last month, which outlined some updates to our financial reporting. It also includes our damage claims ratio data as a key measure of our service performance. Starting with the current quarter, we'll be reporting monthly tonnage numbers as well. These changes improve disclosure and make our reporting more comparable with industry peers. The recasting and the new performance metrics should give you greater visibility into our business. With that, we'll now take your questions. Operator, please open the line.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Fadi Chamoun with BMO. Please proceed with your question.\nFadi Chamoun: Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Mario, maybe not many companies form a Board Operating Excellence Committee. I just wanted to get your thoughts about how should investors think about the role of this committee and the purpose of this committee as we move forward in the next couple of years?\nMario Harik: Thanks for the question, Fadi. Well, first, we obviously recently added Wes Frye to our Board. And Wes is a fantastic LTL operator. He's an LTL legend. So what that committee would do is effectively both Wes Frye and Allison Landry sit on it as well as myself. And it's focused on the big needle-movers, it's focused on the big levers of how we're going to improve operationally over the years to come to expand our operating ratio meaningfully as we execute on our LTL 2.0 plan. So that's the purpose of the operational excellence goal the committee on the Board.\nFadi Chamoun: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good morning. So maybe just a follow-up there. So how engaged is Wes? It's very recent with Dave, where has Dave been focused to start? Do you think these additions change either the timeline or the magnitude of margin improvement you've been talking about? And then more near-term, just as you try and act and sound and talk more like the other LTLs, just we typically get some near-term operating ratio expectations from the others. So any thoughts there on Q2 operating ratio?\nMario Harik: You got it, Scott. So when the -- so Dave, obviously, has just joined our team, and he's been a fantastic addition to our team. He's one of the best operators in the industry, and he will help us accelerate the LTL 2.0 plan. He already has spent quite a bit of time in the field with our frontline employees. And both Wes and Dave see what we see, which is a massive opportunity to improve our operating ratio over the years to come. Now early feedback from Dave, obviously, he's very impressed with the progress we've made in improving our service quality in a very short period of time. He's impressed by our people and the culture and the winning momentum that we have across the team and by our technology platform, which will enable us to unlock further opportunities in operations, sales and how we service our customers. He's already identified many areas for improvement as well in terms of how we run the business. Just to give you a couple of examples, Scott, part of it is how we organize our field organizational structure, how we align sales and ops, as an example, or enhancing our compensation programs, including a greater emphasis on OR expansion and many other capabilities and items of how we operate the business. Overall, both Wes and Dave will have a great impact on improving our service quality, improving our operational efficiency and density in the network and finding the optimal freight to add to our network. We're incredibly excited to have both of them on board.\nAli Faghri: And Scott, this is Ali. Good morning. On your second question about the second quarter, so from a tonnage perspective, normal seasonality is about a 5% sequential improvement in the second quarter versus the first quarter. And based on what we're seeing currently, we'd expect that to be up about low single-digits sequentially. And just keep in mind, we're going to be providing monthly tonnage data starting this quarter. So that should give you more visibility into inter-quarter trends. And then from an OR perspective, typical seasonality is about a 400 basis point sequential improvement second quarter versus the first quarter. We'd expect to be a little less than half of that typical seasonality. And again, that's driven by the softer tonnage environment.\nScott Group: Okay. Helpful. Thank you, guys.\nMario Harik: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nJon Chappell: Thank you. Good morning. Ali, on the headcount side, I think you're saying trying to drive productivity there. I'm just trying to understand where the productivity savings are going to come from. You've already taken a fair amount of PT out, which has really been helpful to the margin. But are you cutting heads while growing doors? Is this just a function of attrition? Is it something with negotiating contract terms? How do we think about labor cost being so important kind of trending down amid kind of the LTL 2.0 growth initiatives?\nAli Faghri: Thanks for the question, Jon. So the current plan that we talked about today, that represents greater than $50 million of annualized headcount-related cost savings, and that's going to be spread across LTL, Europe and corporate. But more than two-thirds of those cost savings are going to benefit LTL specifically. And you'll start to see the full run rate benefit of those cost savings starting in the third quarter. And look, even beyond that, we see further opportunities to reduce cost in LTL while continuing to invest in the network. If you look at our variable labor hours, we've done a great job there while holding on to drivers. So for example, if you look at the first quarter, labor hours were down 30 basis points year-over-year, while our shipment count was up 1.5%. And we'd expect to see a sequential improvement in those labor hours in the second quarter and then into the second half of the year.\nJon Chappell: Okay. But just to be clear, is headcount coming down amid those, two-thirds of the savings coming within LTL, or is it just, kind of, productivity through technology, attrition, cost per employee? I'm just trying to figure out how to model that important line item going forward?\nAli Faghri: So Jon, it's actually both. So if you look at the first quarter, for example, headcount was down about 1% sequentially. And given the cost actions that we announced, you should see a bigger step down in the second quarter in headcount, and then we should see further reductions in headcount in the second half of the year.\nJon Chappell: Got it. That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks Ali.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Wetherbee: Hey, thanks. Good morning guys. Maybe we talk a little bit about pricing. So when we look at what you guys have been reporting ex-fuel as revenue per hundredweight, we've seen growth there, but maybe sequential deceleration over the course of the last couple of quarters. And it sounds like the core contracted piece of the business is still trending up in the mid-single digits. I guess, as we look at forward guidance, it seems like maybe we'll see some acceleration on the absolute dollars of revenue per hundred weight into 2Q. Just wanted to get maybe if you could help us break down what's going on from a mix perspective as well as how you're looking at the contracted side plus what you're doing with dynamic pricing. Just want to get a sense of where the pricing environment stands if we can see maybe more consistent sequential increases quarter-to-quarter as we move forward through the rest of this year?\nAli Faghri: Thanks for the question, Chris. This is Ali. So the mix headwind related to the local channel that we described last quarter that continued into the first quarter. So while we're growing shipment count in the local channel, weight per shipment remained under pressure due to the macro impact. And so that resulted in less tonnage in that higher yielding local channel, and that was about a few hundred basis points headwind to our reported yield. And this headwind was actually greater in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter. Now if you take a step back, as you pointed out, underlying pricing trends remained strong. Contract renewal pricing was up mid-single digits. And we're implementing a number of initiatives on the yield side that we would expect to drive stronger yield growth over time.\nChris Wetherbee: But just to be clear about the sequential, is that headwind from the mix you expect to continue into 2Q, or does that begin to abate as we move through the rest of the year?\nAli Faghri: So as we look forward, that mix headwind has continued into April, but has stabilized on a year-over-year basis. So we'd expect that to continue in the near-term as the macro remains challenged. But again, we're excited about some of the levers we're pulling on the yield side that should help us mitigate that mix impact and drive stronger growth over time.\nChris Wetherbee: Thank you very much.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hey good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So maybe just stepping back and looking at the strategy, you've been working on in the last couple of quarters, leaning into some of these channels a bit differently than you have in the past. Do you think it's getting the impact you expected so far from a density and a shipment customer retention perspective? Is that really working out how you would have thought or there's a bit more challenging on the macro and you might have to force a little bit go through the rest of this year?\nMario Harik: Well, our strategy is actually working. And we have a strong strategy with our LTL 2.0 plan. And the first part of it is focusing on providing best-in-class service. And when you see those service improvements, what we hear from our customers is excitement to give us a bigger share of wallet. And we have a bigger or a higher pick on the freight that we get into our network. Just to give you an example here recently, I was meeting with some of our customers in the South, and you could hear the feedback where they see us improving our service product on their scorecards, and they are giving us bigger access to the freight that they have. The second piece is around investing in our network. And when you look on that portion of it, we've made tremendous progress. We've added more trucks to our fleet. Our fleet age is down to 5.2 years, which helps with efficiency, helps with lower maintenance cost, but it also helps with us insourcing our third-party line haul. And then we can have capacity in the right places where we need it, where we see stronger demand from the customer. And then on the yield side, the initiatives that Ali just mentioned that we're driving to improve our yield performance over time as well. So all of these things are leading to us having high-quality freight. We're growing our local account business as well. We've grown shipment count 9% in that channel here in the first quarter.\nBrian Ossenbeck: And just to clarify on the yield, it sounds like accessorials are going to be a bigger part of that moving forward here. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on that? Is this something you're just kind of catching up to in the market, or are these additional opportunities you're digging into as you step forward into this year?\nAli Faghri: Hey, Brian, this is Ali. So it's a bit of both. So we want to make sure that we're getting paid consistently and fairly for the premium services we're providing. So a few examples are, if a customer wants to get a delivery during a certain time window, we charge them for an appointment-based delivery. Or if a customer wants a guaranteed delivery before noon, we would charge them for that. Accessorials right now are roughly about low double digits of overall revenue. And so, we see a great opportunity to improve that over time.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Okay. Thank you. Very helpful.\nMario Harik: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good morning and thanks for taking my question. I guess, can you guys talk about what network changes you might be affecting both in line haul and local operations, to drive both service improvement but also maybe better cost productivity?\nMario Harik: Yes. So first, starting on the network side, our investments in the network are about expanding capacity in those markets where we have a need for having more doors or more physical space. To give you an example here, just this last month, we just expanded our Salt Lake City terminal where we added another 16 net new doors because we needed that additional space given the amount of freight we were handling there. And we are in the process of expanding other markets, which include further expansion in Atlanta, Georgia, includes expansion in Texas and a few other areas like Phoenix, Arizona, Florida as well. So all of these are markets where we are seeing stronger demand from our customers and being able to have this additional space will have -- will give us long-term tailwinds in terms of increasing capacity. In terms of line haul, one of our big goals is to in-source third-party line haul. So here on the short term, we're getting a benefit from the rates that we're seeing in the truckload markets. But over time, by 2027, we want to cut our line haul as a percent of revenue in half by in-sourcing more of these miles and having our own drivers and our own assets moving that freight, which is good both for service and for cost reasons as well, as well as additional improvements in how we optimize the movement of freight and our line haul network there.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you, Mario.\nMario Harik: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nTom Wadewitz: Yeah. Good morning. I wanted to ask you, Mario, a bit about -- you made some pretty interesting hires in addition, obviously, to the Board with Wes and then with Dave as well. How do you think about the change in what you're focused on and the split of responsibilities, kind of, who's making the call on big pricing decisions or capacity operational decisions? Is that clearly handing that off to Dave, or is that something you'll collaborate on, or how should we think about that -- some of those changes as -- in particular, as Dave comes -- is on board?\nMario Harik: Well, Tom, Dave is our Chief Operating Officer, overseeing North American LTL. So our field operations, our pricing, our sales teams in LTL report up to him. But Dave is obviously one of the top leaders in the organization, and he and I work very closely on all of these decisions. Generally, when you look at our strategy, the LTL 2.0 plan that was one of the main reasons why Dave joined our team. Again, it's a strategy focused on service and investing in the network, on driving yield growth and strengthening our cost discipline. And Dave is going to play a critical part in all of these areas on how we improve them. And, obviously, him and I are working very closely together to deliver on these goals over the years to come. And again, our goal is to accelerate our rate improvement, and this is where the massive opportunity for us exists. And there's no reason why there shouldn't be a seven-handle in front of our OR over the years to come.\nTom Wadewitz: I guess that makes sense, but like how much discretion should we think of that he has or control in terms of changing things within the broader plan, or is that just the wrong way to look at it?\nMario Harik: I mean, as our Chief Operating Officer, Dave is fully empowered to do what he thinks is best for the business from an operational perspective. He has more than 30 years of LTL experience. But again, as a team, we're working very closely together to accelerate the plan and execute over the years to come.\nTom Wadewitz: Okay. That makes sense. Yeah, it certainly seems like you're seeing the improvement in the quality metric, which is great. Thank you.\nMario Harik: Thanks Tom.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Hoexter: Hey, great. Good morning, Mario. Just trying to parse some of the commentary from you and Ali and just on your thoughts on April, are you seeing a change in the economic backdrop, or if tonnage is up low single digits sequentially, then I guess we're seeing larger year-over-year declines to maybe almost mid-single digits. Should we read this, I don't know, as winning more share? Is there a way to parse economic impacts versus the share? And then, Ali, you mentioned half the 400 basis points operating ratio impact. So does that mean you're targeting upper 80s OR for 2Q, so a 400 basis point deterioration year-over-year? I just want to understand how we should parse those two comments? Thanks.\nMario Harik: Yeah, you got it, Ken. I'll get started and then I'll turn it over to Ali. When you look at April, our tonnage was down 2% year-on-year, but our shipment count was up 3% year-on-year. And when you compare these to March, they both outperformed typical seasonality sequentially from the month of March to the month of April. Now we said a lot of these things for us are with the improvements in service quality. We're seeing a very robust pipeline, and we're being able to onboard either exit the more business from existing customers or growing new customers. As Ali mentioned earlier, our local accounts have grown by 9% shipment count in the first quarter. Now when you look at that from a macro perspective, there's still a lot of uncertainty in the environment. We're seeing a bit more strength in the month of April. When you look at the ISM, which today, two-thirds of our customers are industrial customers, so that's an important index for us. It has picked up in April versus March by roughly 1 point. So we're seeing a bit stronger demand there. On the retail side, we've seen that softer consumer in the month of March. The flip side though is that retailers have worked through the higher inventory levels they used to have. But again, a lot of these things are company-specific, but we're seeing a slightly better demand environment in April than we did see in March.\nAli Faghri: And then, Ken, this is Ali, for the second part of your question on OR, so again, typical seasonality, about 400 basis points sequential improvement Q2 versus Q1. We would expect to be a little bit less than half of that on a sequential basis. So that would get you to somewhere in that 88% range from an adjusted OR perspective.\nKen Hoexter: Perfect. Appreciate the time and thoughts, guys. Thanks.\nAli Faghri: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Stephanie Miller [ph] with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nJoe Hafling: Thanks. Good morning. This is Joe Hafling on for Stephanie Moore. Thanks for taking our questions. I think a lot of my questions have been asked, but I wanted to maybe get your thoughts on the progress through the quarter heading into April. It looks like, at least, through the first quarter, the monthly tonnage was going down, but I'm not sure if there was something in the comps that we need to be aware of. And then, I just wanted to maybe get your thoughts on how we should put the 9% growth in local accounts, but still a lot of pressure coming from the national accounts. It looks like there is outsized growth in those local accounts.\nAli Faghri: So maybe starting with your second question first, we're seeing about 9% growth in the local channel on the shipment count basis, as you mentioned. On the national side, shipment counts have been relatively flat. So that mixed headwind that we're describing, that's more related to that local channel and more specifically the weight per shipment pressure due to the macro we're seeing in that local channel. In terms of the intra-quarter tonnage trends, on a year-over-year basis, they did decelerate through the quarter. So tonnage in March was down about mid-single digits. However, as we said in April, we have seen a modest improvement. Tonnage is down about low single digits in April. As Mario mentioned, we've seen a bit of a tick up on the industrial side, but the majority of that improvement is being driven by our initiatives and more specifically the service improvements we've driven in the network.\nMario Harik: And also to add to Ali's comments, April did outpace seasonality from March. So when you look at both tonnage and shipments, we have seen an outplacement there coming from March to April.\nJoe Hafling: And then a quick clarification. Earlier in your prepared remarks, you mentioned taking the PT cost as a percentage of sales as a percentage, down 50%. Just to clarify, is that a company-wide metric, or are you talking specifically LTL? And if it's company-wide, just rough numbers, are we talking about the number coming from a 25% number to roughly a 13% number?\nAli Faghri: We're referring to LTL specifically. And so, it would apply to both line haul miles, which we would take it from roughly around 24% to that 12% range by 2027. You could also look at it as a purchased transportation cost on our P&L as a percentage of revenue. We would also expect that to get cut in half by 2027.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of James Monigan with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nJames Monigan: Hey guys. I just wanted to touch on CapEx and the ongoing investments. Ali, essentially, what's the appetite or ability to flex that down either in the back half of this year in 2024 and slowness at a point where you might consider that. And also, just wanted to understand the investment impact on OR. And if there was one, sort of, the ability to flex that down and at what point you might do that in terms of like what you need to see in the macro and the softness? Thanks.\nAli Faghri: So we really view these investments as long-term. And the best-in-class LTL playbook historically has been really to invest through the cycle, and that's both in good times and softer times. Historically, we've been at more maintenance CapEx levels, call it, mid-single digits CapEx as a percentage of revenue. And going forward, we're targeting 8% to 12% in the years to come. And really, those investments in capacity are much more long-term and are going to allow us to capitalize on the eventual freight recovery. Just keep in mind, James, that the majority of that CapEx spend is on equipment like tractors and trailers that not only allows us to reduce our fleet age and reduce maintenance costs, but it also supports our line haul in-sourcing initiative as well. The door expansion part of our CapEx plan is a much smaller part of it. It's about 15% of our total CapEx spend, and that implies only about low single-digit door growth this year. In terms of your second question about the depreciation headwind, it was about 110 basis point headwind to our OR for the quarter. So excluding that depreciation headwind, our OR would have improved on a year-over-year basis. As we look forward, that depreciation headwind will continue as we're making long-term investments in our network, but as we start to see stronger returns on these investments, we'll be able to offset that headwind. And that's ultimately what's going to drive meaningful OR improvement for us in the years to come.\nJames Monigan: Got it. And just real quickly, though, is there any sort of productivity drag from the -- on expansions or investments that you have?\nAli Faghri: So in the near-term, there are some, but over time it's a pretty modest drag. But as we move forward, and again, we start to see the returns on these investments we're making in both our network and service, that should become smaller and over time, flip to a positive for us.\nMario Harik: And James, for -- this is Mario. For this year, most of the real estate expansions we're doing are adding additional doors to existing terminals. I mentioned earlier on, for example, Salt Lake City, this is where we just have enough land where we can grade the yard and then add, in that case, 60 doors to that particular facility. And we have half a dozen to a dozen projects that follow that same goal of making some of these terminals larger to be able to handle the additional freight.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks very much. Good morning, all. I wanted to inquire about new business wins in the quarter. You had some large, in 2022, some large national accounts. Just curious, contract mid single-digit contract pricing still sounds solid. But Mario, could you address how business wins were in the quarter, maybe a mix of local versus new and how that will -- local versus national and how that should play out over the course of the year? Thanks.\nMario Harik: Thank you. When we are making profitable market share across all channels driven by our improved service. Now we are seeing more of that growth here in the first quarter come from our local accounts, where we grew shipment counts considerably. But as Ali said, the macro is having an impact there on the overall weight per shipment. So we're seeing some tonnage pressure. But overall, a lot of gains in shipment counts that are backed up by the good service quality. Now from a mix perspective, the mix continues to be fairly flat, and we expect it to be the case. Typically, roughly national accounts are 80% of the business, local are 20% of the business, which is usually consistent across LTL providers. But when we onboard business, it's all based on how they performed from a margin perspective. And we're not afraid to walk away from business if it doesn't meet our OR expectations. So when you look at that growth, again, backed up by service and then we're growing across channels based on the service product we're offering our customers.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks. And it looks like you're continuing to take share. Is that -- are you seeing it more in national account, more on local? Do you know from whom you're taking the share?\nAli Faghri: So the share gains are being driven by the local channel. Local shipment count was up 9% on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter. That's relative to the national channel shipping count, which was relatively flattish in the quarter. So if you look at where we're seeing the most share gains driven by our service improvement, it really is that local channel.\nMario Harik: In terms of who we're taking that share from, it's a combination of all carriers. There's no specific carrier. It's just across the footprint there.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJordan Alliger: Yes. Hi. Good morning. Don't really hear as much about some of the tech initiatives as part of Network 2.0 this morning. I'm just curious how impactful has that been thus far on some of the improvements that you've been making and plan to make, for instance, going forward around service and yield, et cetera? Thanks.\nMario Harik: Yes, absolutely. Overall, Jordan, our technology platform is enabling us to run more efficiently. And it's one of the big drivers for us to achieve our 2027 objectives. If you recall, when we spoke about our profit improvement plan with the 11% to 13% EBITDA CAGR, 3 to 4 points of that will come from efficiency, driven by our technology platform and other process changes we're doing in the field. Now, when you look at it, here in the first quarter, our labor hours were down roughly 30 basis points, while shipment count was up 1.5 points. And the way we identify where we flex those labor hours is driven by our technology platform and the efficiencies there. And our focus on technology continues to be on improving our line haul performance and how we optimize what loads we move anywhere in our network. It also includes focusing on our pickup and delivery environment, how we optimize routes and add more density, more stops per hour per driver in terms of how we organize these pickup and delivery routes. And then optimizing our labor in the docks with our smart platform and how we manage that. And, of course, technology plays a big part in helping us with quality and helping us with pricing and helping us with how we integrate with our customers as well. That continues to be a big competitive advantage for us, and we'd expect that to be the case over the years to come.\nJordan Alliger: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Elliot Alper with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.\nElliot Alper: Great. Thank you. Maybe just following up on a previous question. Can you maybe talk about what customers are telling you right now? I mean, are you still cautiously optimistic about the second half recovery, and maybe does your commentary around maybe the stronger industrial and slightly weaker retail changed that dynamic at all?\nMario Harik: Yeah. So when we look at the macro generally, it's still -- there's still uncertainty in the environment. And, obviously, it's a softer macro than what we've seen. Now we are hearing mixed things from customers where some customers in the industrial space are seeing a pickup, while others are seeing more softness and lower demand as well. So there is still softness in the environment as we see it. Now again, the ISM did pick up in April. However, it's still below 50, which shows that softer demand in the industrial economy. On the retail side, it's also a mix. The retailers that have done a good job in how they operate their supply chain and depending on the type of product that they're selling, we're also seeing mixed feedback there. Some customers are seeing flat demand year-on-year or slightly up in some cases, while others are seeing softer demand and it depends on the type of product that they are selling. But generally you do see a shift from the consumer spending more on discretionary type items that focus more on services, and you can see that evident in the retail space where these customers again are seeing the softness. Again for us in April, we've seen the trends accelerate. We outpace typical seasonality from the month of March to the month of April. But that feedback again from the customer is mixed at this point.\nElliot Alper: Thank you.\nMario Harik: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nJeff Kauffman: Thank you very much, and good morning everyone. I wanted to address the fleet age question and just get an idea as you continue to ramp up this capital spending and you ramp up the trailer output, where does that average age go by the end of 2023? Where is that average age, let's say, your target is 2024, 2025, where are we bringing that 5.2 years down to?\nMario Harik: Thanks, Jeff. Well, our long-term goal is to be below five, to be somewhere between four and five years would be the ideal average fleet age. Obviously, for us in LTL, we usually get the younger trucks, the newer trucks on our line haul runs to capitalize on fuel efficiency in those runs. And then, obviously, the tractors in the city, we run these considerably longer. Now we took this down from 5.9 years at the end of last year to 5.2 years at the end of the first quarter. But we did front-load a good amount of our CapEx here in the first quarter where we got 700 new trucks through the course of the first quarter. Now when we think about the end of the year, it all depends on what the OEMs can do for us. We have seen it's still tight to get trucks so that you can get all the units you want to get. But at the same time, it is getting better where they're giving us a higher allocation in the back half, but we'll see how that will play out in terms of fleet age. But we'd expect that to keep on coming down as we add more of these newer trucks to the fleet.\nJeff Kauffman: And just to follow-up on that point, thank you. We have new rules coming out of the California Resource Board last week. I know the EPA came out with their 27 mandate, nothing that needs to be done right away. But where are you in terms of switching to things like electric vehicles, fuel cell trucks, nat gas trucks, looking at the zero-emission rules that, for California at least, are going to start to kick in 2024?\nMario Harik: Yeah. So when we look at that, we do have pilots going on, and a truck order for electric trucks here in 2023 for California. Now, today, a lot of what we're seeing is some of these larger Class A trucks are -- it's so tough to get the amount of mileage. We need to get on them and have the charging infrastructure to be able to charge those trucks to use them both in the P&D environment as well as the line haul environment. However, we do have a number of these trucks ordered here for the year. And a lot of these are straight trucks to operate in the city for steady deliveries. And we're obviously working locally on how we meet all of the mandates from the state of California, but also very close to the American Trucking Association, which is obviously helping drive a lot of these regulations as well in terms of how we obviously drive our fleet there to meet all of these.\nOperator: At this time, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mario Harik for any closing comments.\nMario Harik: Thank you for all your time today. And as you can see, we're moving forward with a realistic view of the macro, but it doesn't impact the execution of our plan, which is elevating customer service to new heights, investing in capacity for the long term, accelerating our yield growth over time and driving further cost efficiencies. These four avenues are the key to unlocking the massive potential within XPO. We'll give you an update on our progress on our next earnings call. Operator, you can now end the call. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. This does conclude today's teleconference, everyone. Thank you for your participation, and have a great day.",

            "name": "Carl Anderson",
            "content": "Thank you, Mario, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through our first quarter results, balance sheet and liquidity. Revenue in the quarter for the total company was $1.9 billion, up 1% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially from the fourth quarter. In our North American LTL business, revenue was up 1% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Revenue per hundred weight, excluding fuel, was up 1.4%, while higher shipments per day were offset by lower tonnage. LTL salaries, wages and employee benefits were 6.7% higher than a year ago, due primarily to wage increases granted to employees last year. We are taking action to reduce labor costs and drive productivity as we move through the year. Purchased transportation expense was down 27% or $37 million in the quarter as we in-source more third-party linehaul. We ended the quarter at approximately 22% of linehaul miles outsourced, which was also a 270 basis point improvement from the same quarter last year. We also benefited from implementing significantly lower contract rates with carriers in the quarter. In addition, we brought down our costs for insurance and claims compared with the first quarter last year. We're continuing to make great progress in reducing damage claims expense as we elevate our service levels. As part of our LTL 2.0 plan, we are continuing to reinvest back in the business as we bring on new tractors and trailers. The increased level of investment in 2022 and through the first quarter of this year resulted in a $12 million or 21% increase in depreciation expense this quarter. Now I'll turn to adjusted EBITDA, starting with the company as a whole. We grew adjusted EBITDA by 14% year-over-year to $210 million. This was primarily driven by a year-over-year reduction of $31 million in corporate expense as we rationalize our corporate cost structure following the RXO spin-off. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 11%, representing a year-over-year improvement of 130 basis points. For our LTL segment, adjusted EBITDA was $182 million, down 2% from a year ago, as our revenue growth and cost efficiencies were offset by the aggregate impact of lower tonnage, wage inflation and lower pension income. LTL adjusted EBITDA excludes $6 million of restructuring costs relating to the downsizing of administrative office. Excluding the impact from pension income, LTL adjusted EBITDA would have been up 4% versus last year. And finally, in our European Transportation segment, adjusted EBITDA was $37 million, roughly in line with last year. Company-wide, we reported net income from continuing operations of $17 million in the quarter, representing diluted earnings per share of $0.15. This compares to income of $32 million and earnings of $0.28 per share a year ago. The year-over-year decline in income from continuing operations is primarily attributable to higher restructuring and transaction and integration costs. In the first quarter, we had $24 million of restructuring charges that impacted all of our segments. In addition, we had $22 million of transaction and integration costs related to the spin-off last year. We expect that these costs will materially step down as we move forward in the year. Our adjusted tax rate was approximately 19% due to the benefit of some discrete tax items this quarter. And on an adjusted basis, our earnings per diluted share for the quarter was $0.56, which is up 22% from a year ago. And we generated $76 million of cash flow from continuing operations and deployed $224 million of CapEx. Moving to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $309 million of cash on hand. This cash, combined with available capacity under committed borrowing facilities, gave us $811 million of liquidity at quarter end. We had no borrowings outstanding under our ABL facility, and our net debt leverage at the end of the quarter was 2.2 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Earlier this week, we extended our \u20ac200 million securitization facility in Europe to July of 2026. And we're currently evaluating opportunities to refinance our term loan maturing in 2025 with new secured and/or unsecured debt. Now, I'll turn it over to Ali, who will provide an overview of our operating results."

            "name": "Mario Harik",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call. I'm here in Greenwich with Carl Anderson, our CFO; and Ali Faghri, our Chief Strategy Officer. This morning, you saw us report a solid quarter despite a challenging macro environment. Company-wide, we generated revenue of $1.9 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth in a soft market. And we grew adjusted EPS by 22%. We also delivered adjusted EBITDA growth of 14%, which was better than our outlook for low double-digit growth. In our North American LTL segment, adjusted EBITDA was down 2%, within our guided range. This was primarily driven by weaker tonnage trends in the industry in March. I want to focus my comments this morning on the progress we're making with the four pillars of our plan for LTL 2.0. The first pillar is to provide industry-leading service. In early 2022, we changed the incentive plan for thousands of LTL employees to tie their compensation to service quality in addition to profits. This was one of multiple initiatives we implemented to elevate our customer service levels. Our focus on service excellence is having a tangible impact on the metrics our customers track. In the first quarter, our claims ratio for damages was 0.7%, which was an improvement from 1.1% last year. This is one of our best claims ratios in more than a decade. And our on-time performance in the quarter was back to pre-COVID levels. We've made considerable progress in a relatively short time, and there's a lot more we can do. Our entire organization is laser-focused on providing the industry's best service. The second pillar of our plan is to invest in our network for the long-term. Now that the spin-offs are complete, we have more opportunity to invest in driving long-term growth in LTL, a business that generates a high return on invested capital. Our business model is more streamlined now with higher visibility into opportunities to optimize our network. We plan to continue to invest in all parts of the cycle. Our LTL CapEx as a percentage of revenue was typically in the mid-single digits each year. That changed in 2022 when we launched our plan for LTL 2.0. And going forward, we anticipate CapEx of 8% to 12% of revenue on average over the next several years. The investments we're making are mostly tied to our fleet. In the first quarter, we added more than 700 tractors, which brought the average age of the fleet down to 5.2 years from 5.9 years at year-end. We also produced nearly 1,800 new trailers at our in-house manufacturing facility in Arkansas. And we're on track to meet our target for over 6,000 trailers produced this year. Our plan calls for adding new doors in a market that can use more capacity and sustain growth over time. These are targeted additions that help improve network density and fluidity over the long-term. In 2023, we expect to grow our total door count by a percentage in the low single digits. When industry volumes rebound, we'll capitalize on these highly turned investments. The third pillar of our plan is to accelerate yield growth. In the first quarter, we grew yield, excluding fuel, by 1.4% year-over-year. That was in line with our outlook. We still had a headwind from mix, as we described last quarter. However, our underlying pricing trends remained solid with contract renewal pricing up by mid-single digits. Yield remains a key area of focus for us, and we have multiple new initiatives underway to leverage the gains we're making and service quality and operating excellence. This will lead to stronger yield growth over time. The fourth and final pillar of LTL 2.0 is to continue to drive cost efficiencies. The main opportunities here are in purchased transportation, the cost structure in the field and overhead expense. In the first quarter, we reduced our purchased transportation costs by 27% versus last year by utilizing two levers; first, we proactively pulled forward the bid cycle with third-party carriers to capitalize on favorable market conditions. At the same time, we have reduced third-party line-haul miles in the quarter by nearly three percentage points versus last year. And we're accelerating this to capitalize on the weak macro when we have more capacity available. We're targeting a 50% reduction in purchased transportation as a percent of revenue by 2027. On the labor side, we're executing on a plan to align our field cost structure more closely with the current demand environment and reduce some of our salaried headcount. You'll see the full run rate benefit of these actions starting in the third quarter. Turning to Europe, our business continued to perform ahead of expectations in the quarter, delivering mid single-digit organic revenue growth. Despite the macro uncertainty in parts of Europe, we're seeing a strong pricing environment overall, and our sales pipeline continues to be robust. I'll wrap up my remarks by summarizing the progress we've made to date on our LTL 2.0 plan. We're continuing to elevate service as a top priority, and it's generating some of our best service levels in years. Customers like what they're seeing, and it's allowing us to gain profitable market share and grow share of wallet. This will translate to stronger yield growth over time. We're being proactive on this by executing multiple initiatives to accelerate yield over the long-term. We're also continuing to make strategic investments in our network to capitalize when demand recovers. We have a long track record of delivering high returns on investments in this business. And we're executing on cost efficiencies by reducing our use of purchased transportation and rationalizing our cost structure at the corporate level and in the field. While we expect the near-term operating conditions to be challenging for the industry, at XPO, we remain on track to deliver on our long-term outlook for at least 600 basis points of adjusted operating ratio improvement through 2027. We're confident in our ability to deliver superior shareholder value as we increasingly drive financial and operational excellence in the business. Before I close, I want to thank our thousands of dedicated employees for helping XPO be world class in every aspect of our business. Our people at every level are our great differentiator, and we continue to attract the best talent. This includes two top talents who see the significant potential in XPO. Wes Frye is now a member of our Board, and Dave Bates is our new Chief Operating Officer. These LTL veterans will help accelerate the execution of our plan. Now I'm going to hand the call over to Carl to discuss the first quarter results. Carl, over to you. Thanks for the question, Fadi. Well, first, we obviously recently added Wes Frye to our Board. And Wes is a fantastic LTL operator. He's an LTL legend. So what that committee would do is effectively both Wes Frye and Allison Landry sit on it as well as myself. And it's focused on the big needle-movers, it's focused on the big levers of how we're going to improve operationally over the years to come to expand our operating ratio meaningfully as we execute on our LTL 2.0 plan. So that's the purpose of the operational excellence goal the committee on the Board. You got it, Scott. So when the -- so Dave, obviously, has just joined our team, and he's been a fantastic addition to our team. He's one of the best operators in the industry, and he will help us accelerate the LTL 2.0 plan. He already has spent quite a bit of time in the field with our frontline employees. And both Wes and Dave see what we see, which is a massive opportunity to improve our operating ratio over the years to come. Now early feedback from Dave, obviously, he's very impressed with the progress we've made in improving our service quality in a very short period of time. He's impressed by our people and the culture and the winning momentum that we have across the team and by our technology platform, which will enable us to unlock further opportunities in operations, sales and how we service our customers. He's already identified many areas for improvement as well in terms of how we run the business. Just to give you a couple of examples, Scott, part of it is how we organize our field organizational structure, how we align sales and ops, as an example, or enhancing our compensation programs, including a greater emphasis on OR expansion and many other capabilities and items of how we operate the business. Overall, both Wes and Dave will have a great impact on improving our service quality, improving our operational efficiency and density in the network and finding the optimal freight to add to our network. We're incredibly excited to have both of them on board. Thank you. Well, our strategy is actually working. And we have a strong strategy with our LTL 2.0 plan. And the first part of it is focusing on providing best-in-class service. And when you see those service improvements, what we hear from our customers is excitement to give us a bigger share of wallet. And we have a bigger or a higher pick on the freight that we get into our network. Just to give you an example here recently, I was meeting with some of our customers in the South, and you could hear the feedback where they see us improving our service product on their scorecards, and they are giving us bigger access to the freight that they have. The second piece is around investing in our network. And when you look on that portion of it, we've made tremendous progress. We've added more trucks to our fleet. Our fleet age is down to 5.2 years, which helps with efficiency, helps with lower maintenance cost, but it also helps with us insourcing our third-party line haul. And then we can have capacity in the right places where we need it, where we see stronger demand from the customer. And then on the yield side, the initiatives that Ali just mentioned that we're driving to improve our yield performance over time as well. So all of these things are leading to us having high-quality freight. We're growing our local account business as well. We've grown shipment count 9% in that channel here in the first quarter. Thank you. Yes. So first, starting on the network side, our investments in the network are about expanding capacity in those markets where we have a need for having more doors or more physical space. To give you an example here, just this last month, we just expanded our Salt Lake City terminal where we added another 16 net new doors because we needed that additional space given the amount of freight we were handling there. And we are in the process of expanding other markets, which include further expansion in Atlanta, Georgia, includes expansion in Texas and a few other areas like Phoenix, Arizona, Florida as well. So all of these are markets where we are seeing stronger demand from our customers and being able to have this additional space will have -- will give us long-term tailwinds in terms of increasing capacity. In terms of line haul, one of our big goals is to in-source third-party line haul. So here on the short term, we're getting a benefit from the rates that we're seeing in the truckload markets. But over time, by 2027, we want to cut our line haul as a percent of revenue in half by in-sourcing more of these miles and having our own drivers and our own assets moving that freight, which is good both for service and for cost reasons as well, as well as additional improvements in how we optimize the movement of freight and our line haul network there. Thank you. Well, Tom, Dave is our Chief Operating Officer, overseeing North American LTL. So our field operations, our pricing, our sales teams in LTL report up to him. But Dave is obviously one of the top leaders in the organization, and he and I work very closely on all of these decisions. Generally, when you look at our strategy, the LTL 2.0 plan that was one of the main reasons why Dave joined our team. Again, it's a strategy focused on service and investing in the network, on driving yield growth and strengthening our cost discipline. And Dave is going to play a critical part in all of these areas on how we improve them. And, obviously, him and I are working very closely together to deliver on these goals over the years to come. And again, our goal is to accelerate our rate improvement, and this is where the massive opportunity for us exists. And there's no reason why there shouldn't be a seven-handle in front of our OR over the years to come. I mean, as our Chief Operating Officer, Dave is fully empowered to do what he thinks is best for the business from an operational perspective. He has more than 30 years of LTL experience. But again, as a team, we're working very closely together to accelerate the plan and execute over the years to come. Thanks Tom. Yeah, you got it, Ken. I'll get started and then I'll turn it over to Ali. When you look at April, our tonnage was down 2% year-on-year, but our shipment count was up 3% year-on-year. And when you compare these to March, they both outperformed typical seasonality sequentially from the month of March to the month of April. Now we said a lot of these things for us are with the improvements in service quality. We're seeing a very robust pipeline, and we're being able to onboard either exit the more business from existing customers or growing new customers. As Ali mentioned earlier, our local accounts have grown by 9% shipment count in the first quarter. Now when you look at that from a macro perspective, there's still a lot of uncertainty in the environment. We're seeing a bit more strength in the month of April. When you look at the ISM, which today, two-thirds of our customers are industrial customers, so that's an important index for us. It has picked up in April versus March by roughly 1 point. So we're seeing a bit stronger demand there. On the retail side, we've seen that softer consumer in the month of March. The flip side though is that retailers have worked through the higher inventory levels they used to have. But again, a lot of these things are company-specific, but we're seeing a slightly better demand environment in April than we did see in March. And also to add to Ali's comments, April did outpace seasonality from March. So when you look at both tonnage and shipments, we have seen an outplacement there coming from March to April. And James, for -- this is Mario. For this year, most of the real estate expansions we're doing are adding additional doors to existing terminals. I mentioned earlier on, for example, Salt Lake City, this is where we just have enough land where we can grade the yard and then add, in that case, 60 doors to that particular facility. And we have half a dozen to a dozen projects that follow that same goal of making some of these terminals larger to be able to handle the additional freight. Thank you. When we are making profitable market share across all channels driven by our improved service. Now we are seeing more of that growth here in the first quarter come from our local accounts, where we grew shipment counts considerably. But as Ali said, the macro is having an impact there on the overall weight per shipment. So we're seeing some tonnage pressure. But overall, a lot of gains in shipment counts that are backed up by the good service quality. Now from a mix perspective, the mix continues to be fairly flat, and we expect it to be the case. Typically, roughly national accounts are 80% of the business, local are 20% of the business, which is usually consistent across LTL providers. But when we onboard business, it's all based on how they performed from a margin perspective. And we're not afraid to walk away from business if it doesn't meet our OR expectations. So when you look at that growth, again, backed up by service and then we're growing across channels based on the service product we're offering our customers. In terms of who we're taking that share from, it's a combination of all carriers. There's no specific carrier. It's just across the footprint there. Yes, absolutely. Overall, Jordan, our technology platform is enabling us to run more efficiently. And it's one of the big drivers for us to achieve our 2027 objectives. If you recall, when we spoke about our profit improvement plan with the 11% to 13% EBITDA CAGR, 3 to 4 points of that will come from efficiency, driven by our technology platform and other process changes we're doing in the field. Now, when you look at it, here in the first quarter, our labor hours were down roughly 30 basis points, while shipment count was up 1.5 points. And the way we identify where we flex those labor hours is driven by our technology platform and the efficiencies there. And our focus on technology continues to be on improving our line haul performance and how we optimize what loads we move anywhere in our network. It also includes focusing on our pickup and delivery environment, how we optimize routes and add more density, more stops per hour per driver in terms of how we organize these pickup and delivery routes. And then optimizing our labor in the docks with our smart platform and how we manage that. And, of course, technology plays a big part in helping us with quality and helping us with pricing and helping us with how we integrate with our customers as well. That continues to be a big competitive advantage for us, and we'd expect that to be the case over the years to come. Yeah. So when we look at the macro generally, it's still -- there's still uncertainty in the environment. And, obviously, it's a softer macro than what we've seen. Now we are hearing mixed things from customers where some customers in the industrial space are seeing a pickup, while others are seeing more softness and lower demand as well. So there is still softness in the environment as we see it. Now again, the ISM did pick up in April. However, it's still below 50, which shows that softer demand in the industrial economy. On the retail side, it's also a mix. The retailers that have done a good job in how they operate their supply chain and depending on the type of product that they're selling, we're also seeing mixed feedback there. Some customers are seeing flat demand year-on-year or slightly up in some cases, while others are seeing softer demand and it depends on the type of product that they are selling. But generally you do see a shift from the consumer spending more on discretionary type items that focus more on services, and you can see that evident in the retail space where these customers again are seeing the softness. Again for us in April, we've seen the trends accelerate. We outpace typical seasonality from the month of March to the month of April. But that feedback again from the customer is mixed at this point. Thank you. Thanks, Jeff. Well, our long-term goal is to be below five, to be somewhere between four and five years would be the ideal average fleet age. Obviously, for us in LTL, we usually get the younger trucks, the newer trucks on our line haul runs to capitalize on fuel efficiency in those runs. And then, obviously, the tractors in the city, we run these considerably longer. Now we took this down from 5.9 years at the end of last year to 5.2 years at the end of the first quarter. But we did front-load a good amount of our CapEx here in the first quarter where we got 700 new trucks through the course of the first quarter. Now when we think about the end of the year, it all depends on what the OEMs can do for us. We have seen it's still tight to get trucks so that you can get all the units you want to get. But at the same time, it is getting better where they're giving us a higher allocation in the back half, but we'll see how that will play out in terms of fleet age. But we'd expect that to keep on coming down as we add more of these newer trucks to the fleet. Yeah. So when we look at that, we do have pilots going on, and a truck order for electric trucks here in 2023 for California. Now, today, a lot of what we're seeing is some of these larger Class A trucks are -- it's so tough to get the amount of mileage. We need to get on them and have the charging infrastructure to be able to charge those trucks to use them both in the P&D environment as well as the line haul environment. However, we do have a number of these trucks ordered here for the year. And a lot of these are straight trucks to operate in the city for steady deliveries. And we're obviously working locally on how we meet all of the mandates from the state of California, but also very close to the American Trucking Association, which is obviously helping drive a lot of these regulations as well in terms of how we obviously drive our fleet there to meet all of these. Thank you for all your time today. And as you can see, we're moving forward with a realistic view of the macro, but it doesn't impact the execution of our plan, which is elevating customer service to new heights, investing in capacity for the long term, accelerating our yield growth over time and driving further cost efficiencies. These four avenues are the key to unlocking the massive potential within XPO. We'll give you an update on our progress on our next earnings call. Operator, you can now end the call. Thank you."

            "name": "Ali Faghri",
            "content": "Thank you, Carl. I'll start with a review of the first quarter operating results for our North American LTL segment. The impact of the economy was evident throughout the quarter, as demand for LTL stayed below historical levels, driving a 3.3% decline in our weight per shipment. We partially offset this with a 1.5% increase in shipment count, led by 9% growth in our local channel. This is a direct reflection of service improvements in the network. As a result, we were able to limit the decline in tonnage per day to 1.8%. On a monthly basis, compared with 2022, January tonnage was up 2.8%, February was down 2% and March was down 5.5%. Looking just at shipment count, January was up 5%, February was up 1.1% and March was down 0.5%. Yield, ex-fuel, increased by 1.4%, in line with our outlook. The year-over-year improvement held relatively steady on a monthly basis throughout the quarter. As Mario mentioned, mix has continued to be a headwind to yield, but our underlying trends remain solid, with contract renewal pricing up 4.5% in the quarter versus last year. In April, tonnage was down 2% compared with last year, while shipment count was up 3%. On a sequential basis, our April tonnage was up 2% versus March and shipment count was up 3%, both outperforming typical seasonality. Regarding yield, we expect second quarter yield, ex-fuel, to continue to be up year-over-year at approximately the same level as the first quarter improvement. We're very focused on driving yield growth by elevating service and being able to price based on the increasing value we're providing customers. This will naturally translate to more yield over time. And beyond that, there are a number of other levers we're pulling to accelerate growth. For example, we're taking additional pricing on accounts that aren't meeting our expectations. We're also growing accessorials, ensuring we're getting compensated for the value-added services we're providing. Turning to our margin performance, our first quarter adjusted operating ratio was 89.6%, which is unfavorable by 70 basis points compared to a year ago. We had a headwind of 110 basis points from depreciation expense, driven by a higher capital investment in the business. Excluding this headwind, adjusted OR would have improved versus last year. On a sequential basis, we improved adjusted OR by 70 basis points compared to the fourth quarter, which is an outperformance of 120 basis points versus typical seasonality. Moving to our European business, we delivered another solid quarterly performance with organic revenue growth of 5% despite a soft macro backdrop. This was propelled by a mix of new customer wins and contract renewals. Volume and pricing in Europe were both higher than the year-ago period by low single digits. And two of our key markets, Spain and the UK generated constant currency revenue growth of 11% and 9%, respectively, outperforming the European business overall. On the same basis, France was slightly positive year-over-year. Before I wrap up, I want to mention the 8-K we released last month, which outlined some updates to our financial reporting. It also includes our damage claims ratio data as a key measure of our service performance. Starting with the current quarter, we'll be reporting monthly tonnage numbers as well. These changes improve disclosure and make our reporting more comparable with industry peers. The recasting and the new performance metrics should give you greater visibility into our business. With that, we'll now take your questions. Operator, please open the line. And Scott, this is Ali. Good morning. On your second question about the second quarter, so from a tonnage perspective, normal seasonality is about a 5% sequential improvement in the second quarter versus the first quarter. And based on what we're seeing currently, we'd expect that to be up about low single-digits sequentially. And just keep in mind, we're going to be providing monthly tonnage data starting this quarter. So that should give you more visibility into inter-quarter trends. And then from an OR perspective, typical seasonality is about a 400 basis point sequential improvement second quarter versus the first quarter. We'd expect to be a little less than half of that typical seasonality. And again, that's driven by the softer tonnage environment. Thanks for the question, Jon. So the current plan that we talked about today, that represents greater than $50 million of annualized headcount-related cost savings, and that's going to be spread across LTL, Europe and corporate. But more than two-thirds of those cost savings are going to benefit LTL specifically. And you'll start to see the full run rate benefit of those cost savings starting in the third quarter. And look, even beyond that, we see further opportunities to reduce cost in LTL while continuing to invest in the network. If you look at our variable labor hours, we've done a great job there while holding on to drivers. So for example, if you look at the first quarter, labor hours were down 30 basis points year-over-year, while our shipment count was up 1.5%. And we'd expect to see a sequential improvement in those labor hours in the second quarter and then into the second half of the year. So Jon, it's actually both. So if you look at the first quarter, for example, headcount was down about 1% sequentially. And given the cost actions that we announced, you should see a bigger step down in the second quarter in headcount, and then we should see further reductions in headcount in the second half of the year. Thanks for the question, Chris. This is Ali. So the mix headwind related to the local channel that we described last quarter that continued into the first quarter. So while we're growing shipment count in the local channel, weight per shipment remained under pressure due to the macro impact. And so that resulted in less tonnage in that higher yielding local channel, and that was about a few hundred basis points headwind to our reported yield. And this headwind was actually greater in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter. Now if you take a step back, as you pointed out, underlying pricing trends remained strong. Contract renewal pricing was up mid-single digits. And we're implementing a number of initiatives on the yield side that we would expect to drive stronger yield growth over time. So as we look forward, that mix headwind has continued into April, but has stabilized on a year-over-year basis. So we'd expect that to continue in the near-term as the macro remains challenged. But again, we're excited about some of the levers we're pulling on the yield side that should help us mitigate that mix impact and drive stronger growth over time. Hey, Brian, this is Ali. So it's a bit of both. So we want to make sure that we're getting paid consistently and fairly for the premium services we're providing. So a few examples are, if a customer wants to get a delivery during a certain time window, we charge them for an appointment-based delivery. Or if a customer wants a guaranteed delivery before noon, we would charge them for that. Accessorials right now are roughly about low double digits of overall revenue. And so, we see a great opportunity to improve that over time. And then, Ken, this is Ali, for the second part of your question on OR, so again, typical seasonality, about 400 basis points sequential improvement Q2 versus Q1. We would expect to be a little bit less than half of that on a sequential basis. So that would get you to somewhere in that 88% range from an adjusted OR perspective. Thank you. So maybe starting with your second question first, we're seeing about 9% growth in the local channel on the shipment count basis, as you mentioned. On the national side, shipment counts have been relatively flat. So that mixed headwind that we're describing, that's more related to that local channel and more specifically the weight per shipment pressure due to the macro we're seeing in that local channel. In terms of the intra-quarter tonnage trends, on a year-over-year basis, they did decelerate through the quarter. So tonnage in March was down about mid-single digits. However, as we said in April, we have seen a modest improvement. Tonnage is down about low single digits in April. As Mario mentioned, we've seen a bit of a tick up on the industrial side, but the majority of that improvement is being driven by our initiatives and more specifically the service improvements we've driven in the network. We're referring to LTL specifically. And so, it would apply to both line haul miles, which we would take it from roughly around 24% to that 12% range by 2027. You could also look at it as a purchased transportation cost on our P&L as a percentage of revenue. We would also expect that to get cut in half by 2027. So we really view these investments as long-term. And the best-in-class LTL playbook historically has been really to invest through the cycle, and that's both in good times and softer times. Historically, we've been at more maintenance CapEx levels, call it, mid-single digits CapEx as a percentage of revenue. And going forward, we're targeting 8% to 12% in the years to come. And really, those investments in capacity are much more long-term and are going to allow us to capitalize on the eventual freight recovery. Just keep in mind, James, that the majority of that CapEx spend is on equipment like tractors and trailers that not only allows us to reduce our fleet age and reduce maintenance costs, but it also supports our line haul in-sourcing initiative as well. The door expansion part of our CapEx plan is a much smaller part of it. It's about 15% of our total CapEx spend, and that implies only about low single-digit door growth this year. In terms of your second question about the depreciation headwind, it was about 110 basis point headwind to our OR for the quarter. So excluding that depreciation headwind, our OR would have improved on a year-over-year basis. As we look forward, that depreciation headwind will continue as we're making long-term investments in our network, but as we start to see stronger returns on these investments, we'll be able to offset that headwind. And that's ultimately what's going to drive meaningful OR improvement for us in the years to come. So in the near-term, there are some, but over time it's a pretty modest drag. But as we move forward, and again, we start to see the returns on these investments we're making in both our network and service, that should become smaller and over time, flip to a positive for us. So the share gains are being driven by the local channel. Local shipment count was up 9% on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter. That's relative to the national channel shipping count, which was relatively flattish in the quarter. So if you look at where we're seeing the most share gains driven by our service improvement, it really is that local channel."

I will now turn the call over to XPO's Chief Executive Officer, Mario Harik. Mr. Harik, you may begin.\nMario Harik: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call. I'm here in Greenwich with Kyle Wismans, our Chief Financial Officer; and Ali Faghri, our Chief Strategy Officer. This morning, we reported strong third quarter results and a soft backdrop for freight transportation with above-market earnings growth and margin expansion. Company-wide, we grew revenue year-over-year by 4% to $2.1 billion, and we achieved significant operating leverage on that growth, delivering a 20% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $333 million. Our adjusted diluted EPS was $1.02, which is a 16% increase from a year-ago. The standout result of the quarter was a strong margin expansion with a year-over-year improvement in LTL adjusted operating ratio of 200 basis points. This improvement was at the high end of our target range. What drives our results are the four levers of our strategy; service quality, yield growth, investments in the network and cost efficiency. These levers are closely aligned and each one has a distinct role in driving outperformance. I'll start with service quality. We delivered a damage claims ratio of 0.2%, which is an improvement from 0.4% last year. Importantly, damage frequency continued to improve each month in the quarter to record levels. We also improved our on-time performance year-over-year for the 10th consecutive quarter. The speed and reliability of our network are the primary reasons why our customers trust us with their freight and they experience these benefits on a daily basis. Our second lever is the targeted investments we're making in capacity ahead of the strong demand we anticipate in a freight market recovery. These ongoing investments are designed to deliver world-class service at every stage of the freight market cycle. Over the past three years, we've added nearly 15,000 trailers and more than 4,000 tractors to our fleet. We're using our rolling stock to accelerate our linehaul in-sourcing with a broad benefit to service across our network. In addition, we've now opened up 21 of the 28 service centers we acquired last December, and we expect to open the last seven sites by early next year. This is on track with our plan. The majority of these sites are in markets where we want to build density and leverage our existing teams. Each new service center helps our network operate more efficiently. When they're all online, we'll have roughly 30% excess door capacity in the network. Strategically, this positions us to capitalize quickly in an upcycle, driving substantial operating leverage and profitable market share gains. Yield is our third lever and the primary driver of our margin improvement. We've been reporting above-market yield growth throughout this year, as we align our pricing with the value we deliver. In the third quarter, we grew yield excluding fuel by 6.7% year-over-year. This underpinned the 200 basis points of OR improvement we reported. We achieved this by executing on multiple initiatives that are yield and margin-accretive. With our customers under contract, we increased renewal pricing by high-single-digits year-over-year for the fifth consecutive quarter, supported by the service improvements we're making. And we're earning more market share from local customers due to the investments we made in our sales force. In the third quarter, we increased shipments from local customers by over 10% compared with a year ago. Our new premium services are another benefit to yield. We've continued to increase our revenue mix from high-margin accessorial services and we expect this revenue stream to grow substantially over time. The final lever of our strategy is cost efficiency, where we have three areas of focus; purchased transportation, variable costs and overhead. In the third quarter, we reduced our purchased transportation costs by 40% year-over-year, primarily driven by our linehaul insourcing initiative. We ended the quarter with 13.6% of linehaul miles outsourced to third parties, which was a reduction of nearly 800 basis points year-over-year. This is the lowest level of outsourcing in our company's history and we are on track to meet our 2027 target by year-end 2024, three years ahead of plan. We now expect our outsourced miles to be below 10% next year. And to support this trajectory, we're deploying more driver teams and sleeper cab trucks for long-distance linehaul runs. And we're continuing to manage labor costs effectively using our proprietary technology. We can realign labor hours quickly to address changes in volume and do that at the service center levels. Turning to Europe, where transportation remains soft in most countries, we continue to outperform the industry. On a year-over-year basis, we increased third quarter segment revenue by 7%. It was our strongest quarterly revenue growth since 2021 with volume accelerating for the fifth consecutive quarter. The strongest revenue performance was in the U.K., where our year-over-year organic revenue growth was up mid-teens. Importantly, our sales pipeline in Europe is growing at near-record levels as we close new business and replenish new leads. This should support ongoing above-market growth across our key geographies. In summary, the strong third quarter we delivered highlights the effectiveness of our strategy and our company-specific initiatives regardless of the macro. The world-class service we provide is within our control. It creates value for our customers and enables us to outpace the industry with yield growth and margin expansion. In addition, we've made significant progress in becoming more cost-efficient with our operations. Even in the current environment, our strategy is driving robust financial and operational results and our investments in capacity will accelerate those results when the freight market rebounds. We have a long runway for additional market share and earnings growth, and we're well-positioned to capture that opportunity. Now, I'm going to hand the call over to Kyle to discuss the financial results. Kyle, over to you.\nKyle Wismans: Thank you, Mario, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through our key financial results, balance sheet and liquidity. We reported a strong third quarter across the company with revenue up 4% year-over-year to $2.1 billion. This includes top line growth of 2% in our LTL segment. Excluding fuel, our LTL revenue was up 5% year-over-year. On the cost side in LTL, we made another significant reduction in purchased transportation. Our expense for third-party carriers was down year-over-year by 40%, largely due to insourcing more of our linehaul runs. This equated to a savings of $39 million in the quarter. And we continue to manage labor effectively with hours per shipment improving by 1% sequentially. This helped to mitigate the year-over-year increase in total salary, wages and benefits of 4%, primarily due to inflation. Additionally, we were more cost-efficient with fleet maintenance, which brought down our cost per mile by 12% year-over-year. Depreciation expense increased by 21% or $14 million, reflecting the investments we're making in the business. This continues to be our top priority for capital allocation in LTL. Next, I'll cover adjusted EBITDA, starting with the company as a whole. We generated adjusted EBITDA of $333 million in the quarter, up 20% from a year ago. Our adjusted EBITDA margin of 16.2% was a year-over-year improvement of 220 basis points. Looking at just the LTL segment, we grew adjusted EBITDA by 18% to $284 million, underpinned by an increase of approximately 17% in adjusted operating income. In our European Transportation segment, adjusted EBITDA was unchanged from a year ago at $44 million. And our corporate adjusted EBITDA was $5 million compared to a loss of $7 million a year ago. Excluding a $9 million gain from a past investment in a private company, which was sold in the quarter, corporate adjusted EBITDA was a loss of approximately $4 million. Returning to the company as a whole, we reported third quarter operating income of $176 million, up 14% year-over-year. And we grew net income from continuing operations by approximately 11% to $95 million, representing diluted earnings per share of $0.79. On an adjusted basis, diluted EPS increased by 16% year-over-year to $1.02. And lastly, we generated $264 million of cash flow from operating activities in the quarter and deployed $123 million of net CapEx. Moving to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $378 million of cash on hand. Combined with available capacity under our committed borrowing facility, this gave us $934 million of liquidity. We had no borrowings outstanding under our ABL facility at quarter-end. Our net debt leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.5 times trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. This was an improvement from 2.7 times at the end of the second quarter and 3 times at the end of last year. We'll continue to make investments that enhance our earnings growth trajectory and support our long-term goal of an investment-grade profile. Now before I wrap up, I want to highlight some updates to our full year 2024 planning assumptions. We now expect interest expense will be in the range of $225 million to $230 million. We're also narrowing our expected adjusted effective tax rate to the range of 24% to 25% for the full year. And we expect diluted share count to be 120 million shares. Our other planning assumptions this year remain unchanged. Now, I'll turn it over to Ali, who will cover operating results.\nAli Faghri: Thank you, Kyle. I'll start with LTL, where we executed well in a soft freight market to deliver another quarter of margin improvement and earnings growth. On a year-over-year basis, our third quarter shipments per day were down by 3.2% overall, but they were up in our local channel by double digits, accelerating from the second quarter. Local accounts are a key part of our strategy and an opportunity to earn market share at a favorable margin. Our weight per shipment continued to moderate this quarter and was down 0.7%. Collectively, these dynamics resulted in a 3.9% decline in tonnage per day, which largely tracks the seasonality and outperformed the industry as a whole. On a monthly basis, our July tonnage per day was down 0.8%, August was down 4.7% and September was down 6.1%. Looking just at shipments per day, July was up 0.1%, August was down 4.6% and September was down 4.9%. For October, we estimate that tonnage will be down 8% from the prior year, tracking roughly in line with seasonality, excluding the impact of a cyberattack at a peer last year. Our pricing trends remain strong as customers continue to recognize the value of our service quality and premium offerings. This enabled us to deliver another quarter of above-market pricing growth. On a year-over-year basis, we grew yield ex fuel by 6.7% and revenue per shipment by 6.6%. Importantly, both yields and revenue per shipment increased sequentially from the second quarter this year and also on a two-year stack basis. We expect these trends to continue for the fourth quarter, reflecting ongoing momentum with our pricing initiatives. Turning to margin, we improved our third quarter adjusted operating ratio by 200 basis points year-over-year to 84.2%. Sequentially, our adjusted OR increased by 100 basis points, coming in at the top of our guided range. Our robust margin performance was primarily driven by yield growth and bolstered by our cost initiatives and productivity gains. We've now delivered significant year-over-year OR improvement for four consecutive quarters, all in a historically soft freight environment. And it's notable that we were the only public LTL carrier to expand margin in the third quarter. Our full year outlook is for an adjusted OR improvement of 150 to 250 basis points, and we expect to be at or above the high end of that range. Moving to the European business, we executed well in the quarter to outperform the industry in a challenging market for freight transportation. Our pricing outpaced inflation and we managed cost to mitigate the impact on earnings. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA for the segment was flat compared with last year, and we generated double-digit growth in the U.K., which is a key market for us. The improvements we've made in the business will accelerate results in Europe when the macro recovers. I'll close with a summary of the major drivers behind the record margins we're reporting in the trough of the freight cycle. We're making significant progress with service quality and we expect this to propel margin expansion for years to come. Our pricing is outpacing the market and continues to gain traction. We believe we're just beginning to capture the massive yield opportunity ahead of us. And we're operating far more productively by reducing third-party linehaul miles to historic lows and effectively managing our variable costs. These initiatives are all in the early innings with strong momentum and their impact will accelerate when demand begins to recover. Now, we'll take your questions. Operator, please open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Hoexter: Hi, great. Good morning and nice job on the continued margin improvement. So Mario, sticking on that, where is the pricing gap now versus the margin as you think about the path you started on with Network 2.0, I guess, ultimately the margin potential? And then thinking about the volumes down 8% in October, if you normalize for SDs, how is the underlying market progressing there?\nMario Harik: Thanks, Ken. First, if you look at the margin gap on the pricing side, so when we started our plan that was roughly, call it, a mid-teens pricing gap between us and best-in-class on the pricing opportunity. And so far this year, we were able to claw a couple of points out of that given our outperformance in yield versus the market. And that was a combination of, one, our service product continues to improve tremendously and we get great accolades from our customers who understand that we are investing more in our network, we are investing in rolling stock and that comes at a premium. But we are also seeing great contributions from premium services that we are onboarding. We launched about half a dozen either expanded or new premium services and these come at a higher yield and higher revenue. And we're also growing our local account segment here in the third quarter. We grew shipment count in that segment more than 10% and that also comes at a higher yield and a higher-margin as well. And over the years to come, roughly half that gap is driven by premium price to service and we expect to keep on bridging that gap. And then the other half comes from both accessorial revenue or premium services, as well as local accounts. In terms of volume trends, what we're seeing here in quarters -- first, if you look at the third quarter, August was the most sub-seasonal month. It was a few points below seasonality compared to where we were in July. September was roughly around -- we were down about 6.1%, and that was roughly a point below seasonality versus October -- versus August. But that started with -- the beginning of the month was better than the end of the month that was impacted by the hurricane. And ultimately, in October, we are down -- there's still a couple of days here to go, but roughly around 8%, which is roughly in line with seasonality. So we're seeing the sub-seasonal demand normalize here in the month of October. And as you said, a portion of the year-on-year delta is the cyberattack that's happened at one of our peers, and we estimate the impact of that cyberattack to have been 2 points on the year-on-year comp when you look at October of last year compared to October this year.\nKen Hoexter: Great. Thank you.\nMario Harik: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Group: Hi, thanks. Good morning. So Mario, with tonnage down a lot, is it limiting the pricing upside in the near term? I don't know, maybe talk about pricing renewals. And then Ali, if I just take the implied fourth quarter guide, it doesn't imply a lot of year-over-year margin improvement. I know it's early, but any early thoughts on how to think about LTL margin improvement in '25?\nMario Harik: Yes, I'll start on the overall pricing environment, Scott, and I'll turn it over to Kyle to discuss contract renewal and Ali can discuss our outlook. But if you look at pricing overall, we continue to see a very constructive pricing environment out there. And if you take a step back, a year ago, a significant amount of capacity exited the market and we continue to see that industry pricing backdrop be constructive. I mean, you heard our peers report here last week and this week and all the commentary leans toward a strong pricing environment. Now, typically in our industry, we typically price 100 to 200 basis points ahead of cost inflation, and we're seeing that play out here. And we are outperforming on the pricing side, given what I mentioned earlier on. So from one perspective, we are being rewarded for the better service product from our customers, but we also have these avenues in terms of local accounts generating higher-yielding and higher-margin freight and incremental accessorial revenue that is coming from the incremental services that we are launching that our customers are asking for. So it's a win-win, where the customer gets a new service from us, they get to experience the great service, and obviously, we get the yield benefit from that as well. And, look, here in the third quarter, we were able to deliver a great yield outcome, accelerating on a quarter-over-quarter basis, accelerating on a two-year stack basis. The absolute number for revenue per shipment is up, the yield per -- for 100 weight is up. So all of these KPIs are moving in the right direction for us here as we go towards the back half of the year.\nKyle Wismans: And Scott, when you think about renewals, so renewals were up high-single-digit in Q3. So again, another strong performance, driven by a lot of our service improvements. It's important to note it's our fifth consecutive quarter to be in that range. And the other thing I think important here is it's flowing through. So we're seeing revenue per shipment in the quarter up 6.6%. That's our seventh consecutive quarter of sequential growth. So we're confident in our ability to deliver strong above-market renewals, both in Q4 and next year.\nAli Faghri: And Scott, just on the OR side, we do expect a strong quarter here in the fourth quarter, driven by continued strength in yield and cost management. Typically, Q4 is a more volatile quarter, which does give a wider range of outcomes and volume trends can be impacted by the holidays and weather. However, if you take a step back and you look at the five-year average for the sequential OR change from Q3 to Q4, it's been in that 250 basis points range and we would expect to do better than that normal seasonal trend as we roll into the -- as we roll into the fourth quarter. And I think more importantly, when you roll that into the full year for 2024, we expect to now be at or above the high end of our 150 to 250 basis points OR improvement range, which is very strong performance at the trough of the cycle.\nScott Group: Thank you, guys.\nMario Harik: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Daniel Imbro with Stephens, Inc. Please proceed with your question.\nReed Seay: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. This is Reed Seay on for Daniel. Mario, services remained pretty solid. I think you held on the gains in the Mastio survey this year. Other than in-sourcing linehaul, can you talk about where you see some remaining opportunities for service that could potentially still be pain points for customers?\nMario Harik: Yes. So, overall, we're on a great trajectory of service improvement. If you look at our damage claims ratio here in the third quarter, we were at 0.2% damage claims. Compared to that when we started our strategy a few years ago, we were at 1.2%. So a tremendous reduction of more than 80% of damages in our network and our customers appreciate that tremendously. On the on-time side, we are -- this is the 10th consecutive quarter of improvement. We get a ton of accolades from customers on the speed and reliability of our network when it comes to picking up the freight and delivering the freight on time as well. Now a lot of the initiatives, Reed, that we have so far implemented were all around changing incentive comp plans, launching airbags, having more capacity, having technology that enables us to track damages down to the person level, to the shift level, and all of that has enabled us to completely change how we load the freight and then the trailers here over the last few years. And we only see upside. I mentioned this in my opening remarks, in the quarter, we saw every month of the quarter reach a year record of better damage frequency than the prior month and we continue that trend to continue here over the quarters and years to come. Our teams in the field operationally are just doing a fantastic job executing on all of that. Now when you look forward, we have a number of initiatives that will continue to improve service. As you said, first, starting with our insourcing of third-party linehaul. Typically when we move the freight on our equipment, we are more efficient at doing it. We get more space in the trailers. We are -- we have much better on-time performance. Here in the month of October, our Road Flex operation on-time performance was nearly 100% in terms of being on time. And as we continue to in-source more third-party linehaul, we're going to continue to see our on-time get higher and higher. And obviously, our goal is to be in the high 99% when all of these things are completed. Similarly, on the improving of damages, we are continuing to work. As we expand the footprint of our network in some locations, we can build more pure trailers to destination, which reduces rehandling in our network that will further take that damage performance even in a better place. And our goal is to get to a 0.1% damage claims ratio over the quarters and years to come here. So, overall, again, the trajectory is very strong. We have a great plan that we're executing on and I'm very proud of the team of the progress they're making.\nReed Seay: Awesome. Thanks for the color.\nKyle Wismans: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Fadi Chamoun with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nFadi Chamoun: Thank you. Good morning. I just wanted to see if you can give us some feedback on maybe 2025, just thinking about some of these levers that you have been able to use this year from the accessorial, the local channels and ultimately what you're doing on the PT side, which seems like has a little bit more to go as we go into 2025, like, your tonnage per day or overall, likely flat this year, like if we don't see material kind of macro cyclical improvement over the next few quarters. What does 2025 look like? Is there more room for kind of OR improvement without the macro-environment? If you can give us kind of any high-level way to think about 2025 would be great.\nMario Harik: Yes, when you look at 2025, we expect a strong year, both from an OR improvement perspective and an earnings growth perspective. And this is very even in the current soft macro-environment. And obviously, any improvement in the demand backdrop will only accelerate our results even further. If you look at 2024, we're going to be at or above our guided range for OR improvement in a fairly soft freight market. Now, we will talk more about the specifics of 2025 next quarter once we close out the year. But that said, if you look at the levers, we are heading into next year with another great year of service under our belt and that leads to us having -- being able to price the freight accordingly. We also have launched a, call it, half a dozen or so premium services or expanded premium services here in-year, in 2024, and our sales team and customers are incredibly excited about those services. We're building momentum. We're building the pipeline. We're converting more of that revenue on our trucks and that comes at a higher-margin and a higher yield and it's a service that our customers are asking for. When you look at our local customers, we have added so far year-to-date more than 8,000 new local customers. And here this last quarter, despite shipment count being down in the low-to mid-single-digit range, our local customer shipments were up more than 10%, and that's going to continue to accelerate as we head into next year. And the 25% more local centers we have added to the team, will have effectively a longer runway to build that book, to be able to convert more of those customers into next year. Then you look at linehaul insourcing, where we expect to reach our 2027 target by end of this year in terms of how many miles are outsourced to third parties, and we're going to get that down to-single digits next year and that's going to be a tailwind on the cost side. And ultimately, we opened up 21 of the 28 service centers so far. We're going to be adding another -- the remaining of them by end of Q1 of next year. And these are making us more efficient and they will be OR-accretive and EPS-accretive as we head into 2025. So that's tailwinds for margin improvement as well. So again, we expect a strong year in 2025. And we're not stopping there. When you think about the next up-cycle with all the initiatives we have and the investments and capacity, we're incredibly excited about the years to come and eventually driving our OR down to the 70s and beyond.\nFadi Chamoun: Appreciate it, Mario. Thank you.\nMario Harik: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Wetherbee with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Wetherbee: Hi, thanks. Good morning, guys. Mario, I guess I wanted to pick up on that commentary, particularly around the new facilities. So I guess 21 of 28 opened at this point. I guess, I'm curious how you think about the relative profitability of the new centers. I know they're not necessarily for pure expansion. There's a lot of efficiency and density opportunity within these facilities. But how do you think about their performance relative to the sort of core network from an OR perspective? And I guess as you think about the potential for incremental margins as you move forward, maybe in either a neutral environment to a potentially positive environment, kind of how do those facilities play into that incremental profitability as you want to push that OR towards a 70s or better?\nMario Harik: Yes. So, Chris, if you look at the service centers we opened up so far, so we opened up 21 out of the 28 and eight of these were net adds, so they are in incremental sites we are adding to a market or a new market we are expanding into, and 13 were relocations from a smaller location to a larger location. Now we do expect these sites to be OR-neutral here in 2024. And so far, this has been playing out the way we expected and we expect them to be OR accretive by next year. Now, keep in mind, with 21 service centers we opened up, we've only added 80 net headcount to our staff, so 80 people to support the opening of these sites. And we're gaining efficiency improvement from them. So when you look at these sites, we are seeing an improvement in pickup and delivery efficiency. So our city operations is, call it, low-to mid-single digit more efficient on a percentage basis in those markets given the larger sites. And similarly, our linehaul efficiency has increased in that low-to mid-single-digit as well, which is what gives us the efficiency improvement here in the near term and that's going to ramp as we head into next year. When you look at the incremental margins we're seeing from these sites, it's 40% plus and all of the sites are operating at or above our expectations so far since we have opened them up. So again, when you roll that forward into next year, in the near term, we're going to continue to see that efficiency improvement help us from an overall cost standpoint to drive higher margins. And whenever the freight market turns, this is what gets us really excited. I mean, today's LTL demand is down, call it, anywhere between the low-teens on the low end to the high-teens on the high end compared -- as an industry, when you compare either pre-COVID or 2021 to current volume levels. So we are in a prime position when that market starts turning, to be able to use that incremental capacity to get more freight with high incremental margins as we move forward as well.\nChris Wetherbee: Very helpful. Thanks, Mario. Appreciate it.\nMario Harik: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nJon Chappell: Thank you. Good morning. I want to focus on revenue per shipment trends. Not only were they up sequentially, but it actually accelerated, the biggest sequential improvement, over 3%, in the last several quarters. I know you talked about some of the accessorials and some of the volume challenges as well. But as we think about going forward, do you feel like a lot of that -- I don't know if you want to call it low-hanging fruit, but a lot of the opportunity in this downturn has been plucked, or do we think about that kind of reaccelerating at some point next year when you do get freight tailwinds behind you?\nKyle Wismans: Hi, Jonathan. When you think about the revenue per shipment opportunities, I still think there's a lot of opportunity here. I mentioned the renewals already. So renewals have been strong and continue to be strong. I think the other thing to think about there is some of the accessorial pieces. So even though we have made some progress, and as Mario mentioned, the goal there is to get to 15% of revenue, we're north of 10% now, but there's still a lot more we can do there. So that's about 5 points of pricing upside that's still in front of us, which we can capitalize on. And again, some of the services are starting to gain traction, we're building a backlog. So that includes some of the premium offerings, including the retail store rollouts, Must Arrive By Date Trade Show, our recently expanded Mexico cross-border services. So a lot we can do there. And I think on top of that, we're continuing to improve mix. Mario mentioned the growth in the local shipment accounts. As that moves and that continues to grow, that's going to be a tailwind to yield. So I think we're still early innings here and a lot more to do. And just one more last brining on accessorial. To get to 15% of revenue, it's probably a five-year path to get there and we're about one point through it. So still a lot more to go there.\nJon Chappell: Okay. Thanks, Kyle.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nTom Wadewitz: Yes. Good morning. Let's see -- and it's nice to see the continuing momentum in the results of pricing and the margin. I'm wondering, you've had quite a few questions on price. I think, Mario, you've been very clear on the levers for that to continue. What do you think is kind of a, I guess, normalized pricing we should expect if we look at like 2025, I think, maybe for the better players 4%, 5% would be a thought on normal LTL pricing. I don't know if you agree with that. I know it depends on the loan freight backdrop. And then is it appropriate to expect you to be higher than that given everything you're mentioning? So for normal four to five-year, you stay in that 6 or 7 range. Just wanted to see if you could give a little bit more of kind of bringing it toward numbers. Not obviously looking for guidance, but just kind of how to frame it and think about it in terms of what you get on pricing and what's normal? Thanks.\nAli Faghri: Sure, Tom. This is Ali. So you've seen us deliver very strong yield growth over the last several quarters. And as Kyle noted, many of our yield initiatives are still in the very early innings. You think about our ongoing service improvements, that's going to continue to earn us a higher price with our customers. We're also growing the mix of our local business and premium services, which are both accretive to both yield and margin. In the case of premium services, these are services that our customers are asking for. And we also expect the favorable industry pricing trends to continue as well. You've seen a significant amount of capacity that's exited the market over the last 12 to 18 months. And the overall industry backdrop -- pricing backdrop remains very constructive. And our expectation is, Tom, we're going to continue outperforming the industry from a pricing standpoint, as you've seen us do over the last -- over the last year. We have a lot of pricing initiatives that we're executing on and we would expect that momentum to continue here into the fourth quarter and into 2025 as well.\nMario Harik: And in a high level, if you look at it, Tom, from a -- versus market perspective, I mean, we expect to continue to outperform the market into '25 and beyond. And as Kyle and Ali mentioned earlier on, when you look at these incremental opportunities, typically in LTL it will be priced, call it, 100 to 200 points above cost inflation. And you add on top of that roughly a point from accessorial revenue and 0.5 point from that local account mix is what will give us the incremental, effectively, outperformance versus market. We saw that here play out in 2024, as Ali mentioned, and we expect that to continue in '25 and '26 and beyond. Now, the actual number could depend on the macro. In the macro recovery, we can see pricing being higher than the numbers you gave, but it depends on the -- obviously what the macro does as well and what cost inflation is doing as well.\nTom Wadewitz: So do you agree with the characterization on market though that kind of normal market might be 4 to 5, especially if you look at kind of the better players in LTL?\nMario Harik: That looks like reasonable assumption for next year.\nTom Wadewitz: Okay. Great. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So just a quick follow-up first on October. Obviously, the hurricane impacted a lot of the freight markets in the quarter, but maybe all the way through the month. Just wanted to see if there's any weakness from that. Maybe you're seeing it down 8%. Now you called out the cyberattack is part of the noise there. And then just, Mario, I think it would be helpful going into the fourth quarter and this next year, if you can just give us a sense of some of the customer conversations you're getting in terms of the different types of customers, local, national, and then also across the industrial and retail end-markets as you look into the end of this year and next year?\nMario Harik: Yes. As you said, Brian, when you look at the month of October, we have seen that impact -- the year-on-year impact from the cyberattack last year at one of our peers. So when you look at it, the back half of the month-on a year-on-year basis was obviously much better than the first half of the month that was impacted by the cyberattack. But when you look at it, this is what we said last year, the impact of the cyberattack for last October was, call it, roughly around 1,000 shipments of incremental shipments per day when you average the entire month, which is roughly around a 2% impact on tonnage. So when you normalize for that, obviously, you got to take that out of the 8%. Now in the hurricane impact, we did see -- we did see also the impact both at the end of September and at the beginning of October that impacted overall the volume trend, given some of the markets when you got -- if you go to the Southeast of the country, they were actually obviously impacted by not being able to ship product in and out of those regions for a few weeks, although we were up and running very quickly. And I was very proud of the team, all of our employees were safe and we were able to support our customers within 24 hours where needed. But at the same time, obviously, that the market was impacted. Now when you look at customer demand trends, it has been -- when you look at the -- over the summer, it has been softer, sub-seasonal. When you look at the month of August, as I mentioned earlier on, it was roughly around a few points lower than seasonality, normalized a point lower than seasonality in September, normalized, so roughly in line with seasonality in October. Now what we saw in the quarter was the industrials being more impacted than retail. We saw industrial shipments be down at twice the rate of that corresponding retail customers through the course of the quarter. And you see that in the ISM index, obviously hovered at 46, 47 in the quarter, which was a deceleration from earlier in the year. Now, as you know, I spent a lot of time with customers in the field. And what we've heard from customers is some sub-sectors of the industrial economy, so electrical equipment manufacturing or machinery, are much more bullish about the outlook when they look forward. But if you look at construction or industrial, or agriculture, they are more bearish. They are seeing more softness in demand looking forward. On the retail side, they were down still, but down less than their corresponding industrial side. Inventories are mostly normalized. Consumer demand is holding. So we're seeing a -- we saw a retail sector that was constructive, but still down on a year-on-year basis, but less than the industrial counterpart. In terms of local versus large customers, for us, local is growing. Our local sales team is doing an impeccable job onboarding new customers. Year-to-date, we have onboarded more than 8,000 new logos in that channel and we saw shipment count in that segment grow more than 10% here in the third quarter, but that's more company-specific. And given the improvements in service and the execution of our sales force, we are able to deliver on those outcomes. But again, if you look forward, tough to predict where things will go from here through the rest of Q4 or early next year. I mean, there's a scenario where we start seeing an inflection in the -- at the end of the first-quarter or first half of next year if rates continue to come down and the overhang of the election is behind us. But we'll see -- it's very tough to predict. There's a lot of mixed signals in terms of what the outlook would do here in the near term.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Okay. Thank you, Mario.\nOperator: Our next question is from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer & Company. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks very much. Mario, could you please elaborate on the half dozen premium services you rolled out? Are there more to come and maybe a little anecdote about what you've done there so far? And then just on top of that, how is the investment in the sales force? Is that something that you're continuing to build or is that at a pause right here? Thanks.\nMario Harik: Yes. So starting with the premium services, I'll give you a few examples, Scott. For example, in the retail side, we launched a new service called retail store rollouts. So you can imagine whenever you have a consumer packaged goods company that wants to -- for a certain holiday like Halloween here coming out this week, they want to send a lot of product to a lot of stores simultaneously. So we effectively have a desk for them that can support dealing with a project where they are shipping 500 shipments or 1,000 shipments to all different locations, getting a consolidated bill at the end of it and making sure that all of their freight is being tracked in conjunction as one unit. Similarly, we launched a product called Retail Solutions or Must Arrive By Date. So when you think of -- again of a company shipping into a large retailer, typically they have charge-back programs and deliver the product within a certain time window that obviously as a shipper or supplier to that retailer, you get a charge-back as a percent of the value of the goods. So given the tremendous improvement in service product, we actually now offered that service for our customers where we can again make sure that we're taking -- we're tracking the freight all the way through destination and it needs to be stored at destination for a period of time before it gets delivered in a certain time window, we can make all of that happen for the customer. Similarly, on trade shows, when you look, we opened up here over the last few quarters a new service center in Las Vegas that is massive, one of the largest in the city. And you can imagine when people want to ship things into a trade show, they get it to our location. We offer five days of free storage. We offer again a service desk to coordinate the product getting delivered to the trade show floor and pickup from the trade show floor. So we handle all of these things for our customers. And finally, on Mexico, we expanded our Mexico offering. We've been doing Mexico for more than 30 years. We're one of the oldest carriers in doing that service, but we've added more border crossing locations and expanded our reach within Mexico and that's resonating with customers as well. So all of these are extra services that we are offering to the customer. They come at a cost on our side, but usually a smaller cost, but more importantly, they are very important for our customers in terms of getting the freight picked up and delivered with these extra requirements along with it. In terms of moving forward, we are looking to launch a number of incremental services as well. A security divider is one of them. Today, we do, for example, exclusive use of trailers, so where we ship -- where you can, as a customer, book an entire trailer. But in the future, you can also do partial trailers if you have high-value products you want to protect. We are looking at services like expedited services within the network -- intra-network and a number of others as well that we're working with our customers on too. In terms of the local investment in our -- investment in sales or our local sales team, so we had a plan to grow the local sales force by 25% and we reached that plan effectively where we are now. We are still adding incremental headcount to our sales force, but we still have to define going into next year whether we want to further grow our local sales force or whether we feel good about where we are. At this point, we're feeling good about the size of the sales force. We're still incrementally adding new roles, including business development roles on the team, but we'll see if we are going to expand the local sales force beyond that as we finalize here budgets for 2025.\nScott Schneeberger: Great. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Our next question is from Bruce Chan with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nBruce Chan: Hi, good morning, gents. Thanks for the question. Kyle, you talked about your top priority for capital allocation here. And I'm wondering if you think about the potential for a sale of the European business, how would that maybe alter those priorities and what would be the planned use of those proceeds? And if you have won any update on that process would be great.\nKyle Wismans: Sure. So when you think about it, let me start, first of all, with overall capital allocation. Obviously, our priority is to continue to reinvest in the business now. And outside of that, we want to achieve an investment-grade profile. With that said, when we're looking at our leverage now at 2.5 times, obviously, a European transaction can help meaningfully reduce that. But I would say, we've made meaningful progress on our leverage so far this year. You think about the end of last year, we were at 3 times, we were at 2.7 times last quarter and 2.5 times this quarter. So we're making a lot of progress. And again, we're committed to maintaining or pursuing an investment-grade profile for the business. And I think we can achieve that both through the increase in EBITDA as well as cash flow generation. And again, a European transaction can obviously accelerate some of those efforts. And the one other piece I'd like to mention as well is just when you think about leverage and how it progresses, it's really CapEx, because for us, CapEx this year-on a percent of revenue for LTL is somewhere in the 13.5% to 14%. And if you think about the future, that's going to come down. So if you think about '25, we'll have the ability to ratchet that down. You think about bringing the service centers online, those 28 service centers were about $2 million of CapEx per site. So that comes down next year, that will help us drop that number, probably a point. And then outside of that, with all the insourcing we've been doing with linehaul, the need to increase the fleet next year is also likely to come down. So when you think about that 13.5%, 14%, probably comes down a couple of points. So I think the outlook from a capital allocation standpoint is going to give us a lot more flexibility moving forward with or without the sale of Europe. And then I'll turn to Mario to talk about Europe.\nMario Harik: Yes. So if you look at the European sale, our strategy continues to be, we want to be a North American LTL carrier over time. Now we're patient on the sale of Europe, because we want to make sure we're getting the right value for it. It is a business that has high scarcity value. I mean, when you look at it, we're either number one, two or three in LTL in dedicated solutions and warehousing by trucking and brokerage in the Western European geographies, including U.K., France, Spain, Portugal and many other countries. And again, we're going to be patient to make sure we are getting the right value for it. Meanwhile, when you look at it, Bruce, we are performing really well in Europe. I mean, you look at the third quarter here, we grew revenue 7% on a year-on-year basis. It's the strongest quarterly volume and revenue growth since 2021 post-pandemic. It's the fifth consecutive quarter of accelerating year-on-year volume growth. And we're well-positioned to capitalize on the market over there. And again, long term, we're going to be a pure-play North American LTL carrier. Now when you look at what Kyle just mentioned, that's another avenue for value-creation for our shareholders, because when you think about it, overall, our earnings are compounding. As I mentioned earlier on, we expect to be either at or above the target range of margin improvement for us here in LTL in 2024. And there is only upside from here. At some point, whether it's the next couple of quarters, whether it's next year, we're going to see freight market cycle starting to inflect. And when that starts happening, we're going to compound our results, our growth, our earnings growth faster. And when you look at CapEx normalizing, what Kyle just mentioned, call it, a point or so a year till 2027, that's only going to expand our free cash flow conversion. You couple that with proceeds from Europe, at some point in time, we're going to start returning that larger cash flow conversion, that capital back to shareholders, which will be another avenue of value creation for shareholders as well.\nBruce Chan: Okay, very good. Thanks for the color, gents.\nMario Harik: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Morning, guys. A two-parter on service if I may. You mentioned at the top of the call that damage claims getting much better to 0.2 from 0.4. Does that start running into diminishing returns here? And also maybe part two, kind of on the Mastio survey, you guys made progress in the overall ranking and have held your place in the national ranking. Does that take time for that service to kind of penetrate into the national ranking and kind of what's your target on that ranking, kind, of maybe three years from now? Thanks.\nMario Harik: So, Ravi, first looking at damage claims, our goal is to be best-in-class when it comes to no damages in our network. And over the last few years, again, we reduced damages by more than 80%. Here in-quarter, we reached a new company record every month of the quarter and we're going to keep on improving there. Our view is very simple. When we take care of the customer, they give us more freight and they're also willing to pay a higher price for the freight because that causes less disruption in their supply chain. So we're going to keep on working that until we become best-in-class when it comes to service. Now when it comes to the Mastio surveys, as you said, we were the most improved on a two-year stack in terms of NPS scores. It's just one data point we look at in terms of overall outperformance. But more importantly, Ravi, we measure satisfaction of our customers on a weekly basis. We effectively get to do a survey for customers who are actually shipping with us and we get to see that satisfaction and how it performs. Over the last few years, it's up by more than 40% over that period of time. And ultimately, customers vote with their wallet and we're seeing effectively growth in our numbers and yield, we're seeing growth in margin, and all of that's driven, rooted by the improvements in service that we are making.\nRavi Shanker: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jason Seidl with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Seidl: Thank you, operator. Hi, Mario and team. Good morning. Really nice job in the operational improvements in the quarter. I wanted to ask a question. Some of your peers have talked about freight continuing to shift to truckload with the weakness in the truckload marketplace with that multi-stop LTL or LTL consolidation, whatever you like to call it. I guess two-parts. One, are you guys still seeing a lot of that out there? And two, how quickly do you think that could jump back to the LTL market in '25 once the TL market recovers?\nMario Harik: First, Jason, it's tough to estimate how much of the freight have moved to truckload in terms of consolidation because that portion of it, typically, we don't have as much visibility into it. But generally, TMS have been -- TMS systems have been around for a long time. And usually, what more shippers do, they automatically look at the service requirement per shipment that they have and they compare rates between truckload and LTL and they compare it also based on the service requirement to move that freight. So that's not something new that we're seeing here. I mean, customers who have TMS systems usually move fairly quickly on whether they want to consolidate or not based on what they're seeing in the environment. So we expect whenever truckload, the rates go back up again, you get to see effectively the TMS system will do the computation and figure out that it's better to actually move a shipment with LTL. But that percentage is tough to estimate. Now there is also what we call direct mode conversion between LTL to TL, which is where there is a -- it's more cost-efficient just for one shipment. And in that particular case, if you look at our network, last quarter, our average length of haul was about 855 miles. When you apply in the trough of the market a $2 truckload rate to that, it's probably -- a corresponding truckload shipment would be about $1,700 to move that. You compare that to an average revenue per shipment for us was $380. So there's a big dislocation between $380 and $1,700 revenue per shipment in truckload versus LTL. Now, sometimes I get the question, well, Mario, what about heavy shipment? So I had the team on the breakeven point, and that breakeven point for shipments over 15,000 pounds, and today less than 0.3% of our shipments are that heavy. So there is a small conversion there. We estimate it to be 0.5 point, maybe less than a point. But again, once truckload rates go up, we'll come back to LTL as well.\nJason Seidl: That's fantastic color. Appreciate it, Mario.\nMario Harik: You got it.\nOperator: Our next question is from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nStephanie Moore: Hi, good morning. Thank you. Maybe sticking on some of these last couple of questions on the service side, can you talk a bit about your level of confidence of keeping these strong service levels even in an upswing as the environment tightens and there's a bit more strain on your network?\nMario Harik: Yes. Well, Stephanie, if you look at it from our perspective, all of these service improvements were done, were not driven by lower volumes. They were driven by action plans to specifically improve service between incentive compensation for our employees that incentivizes on improving service between adding effectively technology that enables us to track damages down to the person level and the shift level and the supervisor level by doing a big cultural change and training and holding people accountable and our employees holding each other accountable to provide great service for the customer. So all of these are foundational changes in what we've done to improve service. Now I'll give you a couple of proof points. When you look at last year, when Yellow went bankrupt, we saw an above-seasonality increase in shipment count from Q2 to Q3 of plus 7%. So think about the macro recovery. Think of a cycle recovery. A 7 point higher than seasonality increase in volume is massive. And during that period of time, in the summer of last year, we saw our service product, our damages and our on-time improve every month in Q3 of last year, Q4 of last year, and that trend continued through 2024 here. So effectively, we already have done it once in an upcycle through the bankruptcy of one of our peers. Now, when you look at moving forward, a lot of it goes also to having capacity. So far we are loving the position we are in because we have -- we are in -- we have invested a lot in real estate, a lot in rolling stock. By Q1 of next year, we're going to have more than 30% excess capacity in our network to be able to handle that incremental freight for the customer. And similarly, on the rolling stock side, we've added more than 15,000 trailers and more than 4,000 trucks. So all of that capacity is going to put us in a prime position to provide great service for the customers and be able to capitalize on the upswing of demand when it comes.\nStephanie Moore: Great. Appreciate the color. Thank you.\nMario Harik: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ari Rosa with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nAri Rosa: Hi, good morning. Congrats here on the strong results, guys. So Mario, I wanted to stay on that line of thinking. Talking about the 30% excess capacity, it seems like a lot of your peers also are sitting on quite a bit of excess capacity. From an industry structure perspective, what gives you confidence? If the market doesn't tighten, I guess, how long are you willing to sit on that excess capacity? And what gives you confidence that some of your peers don't also start to maybe chase a little bit of volume by kind of cutting rates? Is there any risk of that or what gives you confidence that that doesn't start to happen? Thanks.\nMario Harik: Thanks Ari. Ari, I don't see a risk in that for a simple reason, which is usually real estate as a cost footprint in an LTL network is a low to mid-single digit as a percent of revenue. So in other terms, as an LTL carrier, you're not going to use that cost to justify onboarding freight that doesn't operate at or better profile than the rest of your network, because otherwise, you're going to take down your margins, you're going to take down your earnings and you're going to work harder to move that freight for a cost category that is very low on the P&L. So if you think about it as a capacity, though, from the industry as a whole, as I mentioned earlier on, when you look at all the publicly traded LTL carriers, shipment counts. When you look at pre-COVID 2018-'19 or 2021, which was post-COVID, it was still slightly lower than '18-'19. Compared to where we are in 2024, shipment demand in our industry on the low end is down in the low teens, and on the high end is down in the high teens. Now when Yellow went bankrupt last year, it was at a time where demand was depressed. So you took out 10% of the industry capacity through them ceasing operation. Since then they've sold about, call it, roughly half of their service centers. About 90% of these service centers went back into the hands of LTL carrier. So even in a year from now, you're going to have 94%, 95% of the industry capacity that existed a year ago. So that's what gives us a lot of confidence in the next up-cycle. And I'll give you just some anecdotal examples. Here, last week, I was actually visiting some of our customers in the Minneapolis area and based on those meetings I was with them, their main concern was what's going to happen in the next up-cycle. And they wanted to make sure that we have enough capacity to be able to grow with them during that period of time. So currently, on our customers' mind they see the fact that capacity have gone out, they see that some of it came back, but they also do understand that demand is very depressed. And when you start seeing that demand come back into LTL, it's going to be the cycle of all cycles for LTL companies.\nAri Rosa: Very helpful. Thank you.\nMario Harik: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJordan Alliger: Yes, hi. So just a couple quick things. First, I'm just sort of curious. It's great the talking about price and five points left of price, et cetera. I'm just of curious, how does the elasticity of demand work versus price? Do you find customers, do they balk at it or do they say, you know what, your service is better, so we're going to stick even though you guys are pushing price? I'm just sort of curious how that interplay works on elasticity. And then just as a quick follow-up, I know you mentioned October was about in line with normal seasonality. Is the expectation November and December will track normal seasonality, and if so, what does that mean for tonnage for the quarter? Thanks.\nAli Faghri: Jordan, I'll start here. So if you look at our pricing strategy, what we're doing is we're aligning our price with the increased value we're providing our customers. And our customers understand that for us to provide better service, we need to invest in our business. And there's a premium associated with that. And a better service product means a total lower cost for them as well to move goods through their supply chain. And as Mario noted, we've seen significant improvements in our service over the last few years. You think about our damage claims ratio improving from 1.2% a few years ago to 0.2%. Our on-time performance has improved for 10 consecutive quarters on a year-over-year basis. And those service improvements are earning us a higher price with our customers. And that's translating to above-market contract renewals and pricing growth. I'd also point out that there's other ways for us to improve our yield just beyond price. You think about growing the revenue mix of premium services in the local channel, both of which are both yield and margin accretive for us and go beyond just raising prices to the end customer. And so, we're going to continue to take a disciplined approach to grow our market share. As Mario noted, in the local channel, for example, we're growing shipments by more than 10% and that accelerated from the second quarter. So, overall, our top priority is to continue to drive OR improvement. For us, yield is going to be the main lever for that margin expansion. You look here in the third quarter and likely for the full year as well, we're going to be the only public LTL carrier to expand margin. And we're going to continue to optimize revenue quality to continue to drive that margin expansion going forward. And as you think about the outlook from a tonnage perspective, as Mario noted, if you roll forward seasonality from October, that would imply tonnage for the full quarter being down somewhere in that mid-single-digit-plus range year-over-year for the fourth quarter overall. Now macro will be the biggest swing factor, but if you just roll forward that normal seasonality into November and December, you'll get to somewhere in that mid-single-digit decline range.\nJordan Alliger: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That is all the time we have for questions today. I would like to hand the floor back over to Mario Harik, CEO, for any closing comments.\nMario Harik: Thank you, operator, and thanks everyone for joining us today. As you saw from our results, we are able to deliver strong margin improvement in a soft market for freight transportation. Now our strategy is working and we have the right team behind it executing on it. Our service has never been better and keeps on improving. Our yield is above-market in terms of growth and our customers are seeing those service improvements where we're launching. Our premium services are gaining momentum. Our local accounts are growing. We've added more than 8,000 local accounts so far year to date. And on the cost side, our technology is enabling us to run the business very efficiently and insourcing linehaul at a pace of three years ahead of plan. And importantly, all the investments we're making in capacity are positioning us to be able to do really well in the eventual freight market recovery and getting fantastic incremental margins as we grow the business. We look forward to updating you over the next quarter. And operator, you can now end the call. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Kyle Wismans",
            "content": "Thank you, Mario, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through our key financial results, balance sheet and liquidity. We reported a strong third quarter across the company with revenue up 4% year-over-year to $2.1 billion. This includes top line growth of 2% in our LTL segment. Excluding fuel, our LTL revenue was up 5% year-over-year. On the cost side in LTL, we made another significant reduction in purchased transportation. Our expense for third-party carriers was down year-over-year by 40%, largely due to insourcing more of our linehaul runs. This equated to a savings of $39 million in the quarter. And we continue to manage labor effectively with hours per shipment improving by 1% sequentially. This helped to mitigate the year-over-year increase in total salary, wages and benefits of 4%, primarily due to inflation. Additionally, we were more cost-efficient with fleet maintenance, which brought down our cost per mile by 12% year-over-year. Depreciation expense increased by 21% or $14 million, reflecting the investments we're making in the business. This continues to be our top priority for capital allocation in LTL. Next, I'll cover adjusted EBITDA, starting with the company as a whole. We generated adjusted EBITDA of $333 million in the quarter, up 20% from a year ago. Our adjusted EBITDA margin of 16.2% was a year-over-year improvement of 220 basis points. Looking at just the LTL segment, we grew adjusted EBITDA by 18% to $284 million, underpinned by an increase of approximately 17% in adjusted operating income. In our European Transportation segment, adjusted EBITDA was unchanged from a year ago at $44 million. And our corporate adjusted EBITDA was $5 million compared to a loss of $7 million a year ago. Excluding a $9 million gain from a past investment in a private company, which was sold in the quarter, corporate adjusted EBITDA was a loss of approximately $4 million. Returning to the company as a whole, we reported third quarter operating income of $176 million, up 14% year-over-year. And we grew net income from continuing operations by approximately 11% to $95 million, representing diluted earnings per share of $0.79. On an adjusted basis, diluted EPS increased by 16% year-over-year to $1.02. And lastly, we generated $264 million of cash flow from operating activities in the quarter and deployed $123 million of net CapEx. Moving to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $378 million of cash on hand. Combined with available capacity under our committed borrowing facility, this gave us $934 million of liquidity. We had no borrowings outstanding under our ABL facility at quarter-end. Our net debt leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.5 times trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. This was an improvement from 2.7 times at the end of the second quarter and 3 times at the end of last year. We'll continue to make investments that enhance our earnings growth trajectory and support our long-term goal of an investment-grade profile. Now before I wrap up, I want to highlight some updates to our full year 2024 planning assumptions. We now expect interest expense will be in the range of $225 million to $230 million. We're also narrowing our expected adjusted effective tax rate to the range of 24% to 25% for the full year. And we expect diluted share count to be 120 million shares. Our other planning assumptions this year remain unchanged. Now, I'll turn it over to Ali, who will cover operating results. And Scott, when you think about renewals, so renewals were up high-single-digit in Q3. So again, another strong performance, driven by a lot of our service improvements. It's important to note it's our fifth consecutive quarter to be in that range. And the other thing I think important here is it's flowing through. So we're seeing revenue per shipment in the quarter up 6.6%. That's our seventh consecutive quarter of sequential growth. So we're confident in our ability to deliver strong above-market renewals, both in Q4 and next year. Thank you. Hi, Jonathan. When you think about the revenue per shipment opportunities, I still think there's a lot of opportunity here. I mentioned the renewals already. So renewals have been strong and continue to be strong. I think the other thing to think about there is some of the accessorial pieces. So even though we have made some progress, and as Mario mentioned, the goal there is to get to 15% of revenue, we're north of 10% now, but there's still a lot more we can do there. So that's about 5 points of pricing upside that's still in front of us, which we can capitalize on. And again, some of the services are starting to gain traction, we're building a backlog. So that includes some of the premium offerings, including the retail store rollouts, Must Arrive By Date Trade Show, our recently expanded Mexico cross-border services. So a lot we can do there. And I think on top of that, we're continuing to improve mix. Mario mentioned the growth in the local shipment accounts. As that moves and that continues to grow, that's going to be a tailwind to yield. So I think we're still early innings here and a lot more to do. And just one more last brining on accessorial. To get to 15% of revenue, it's probably a five-year path to get there and we're about one point through it. So still a lot more to go there. Sure. So when you think about it, let me start, first of all, with overall capital allocation. Obviously, our priority is to continue to reinvest in the business now. And outside of that, we want to achieve an investment-grade profile. With that said, when we're looking at our leverage now at 2.5 times, obviously, a European transaction can help meaningfully reduce that. But I would say, we've made meaningful progress on our leverage so far this year. You think about the end of last year, we were at 3 times, we were at 2.7 times last quarter and 2.5 times this quarter. So we're making a lot of progress. And again, we're committed to maintaining or pursuing an investment-grade profile for the business. And I think we can achieve that both through the increase in EBITDA as well as cash flow generation. And again, a European transaction can obviously accelerate some of those efforts. And the one other piece I'd like to mention as well is just when you think about leverage and how it progresses, it's really CapEx, because for us, CapEx this year-on a percent of revenue for LTL is somewhere in the 13.5% to 14%. And if you think about the future, that's going to come down. So if you think about '25, we'll have the ability to ratchet that down. You think about bringing the service centers online, those 28 service centers were about $2 million of CapEx per site. So that comes down next year, that will help us drop that number, probably a point. And then outside of that, with all the insourcing we've been doing with linehaul, the need to increase the fleet next year is also likely to come down. So when you think about that 13.5%, 14%, probably comes down a couple of points. So I think the outlook from a capital allocation standpoint is going to give us a lot more flexibility moving forward with or without the sale of Europe. And then I'll turn to Mario to talk about Europe."

            "name": "Mario Harik",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call. I'm here in Greenwich with Kyle Wismans, our Chief Financial Officer; and Ali Faghri, our Chief Strategy Officer. This morning, we reported strong third quarter results and a soft backdrop for freight transportation with above-market earnings growth and margin expansion. Company-wide, we grew revenue year-over-year by 4% to $2.1 billion, and we achieved significant operating leverage on that growth, delivering a 20% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $333 million. Our adjusted diluted EPS was $1.02, which is a 16% increase from a year-ago. The standout result of the quarter was a strong margin expansion with a year-over-year improvement in LTL adjusted operating ratio of 200 basis points. This improvement was at the high end of our target range. What drives our results are the four levers of our strategy; service quality, yield growth, investments in the network and cost efficiency. These levers are closely aligned and each one has a distinct role in driving outperformance. I'll start with service quality. We delivered a damage claims ratio of 0.2%, which is an improvement from 0.4% last year. Importantly, damage frequency continued to improve each month in the quarter to record levels. We also improved our on-time performance year-over-year for the 10th consecutive quarter. The speed and reliability of our network are the primary reasons why our customers trust us with their freight and they experience these benefits on a daily basis. Our second lever is the targeted investments we're making in capacity ahead of the strong demand we anticipate in a freight market recovery. These ongoing investments are designed to deliver world-class service at every stage of the freight market cycle. Over the past three years, we've added nearly 15,000 trailers and more than 4,000 tractors to our fleet. We're using our rolling stock to accelerate our linehaul in-sourcing with a broad benefit to service across our network. In addition, we've now opened up 21 of the 28 service centers we acquired last December, and we expect to open the last seven sites by early next year. This is on track with our plan. The majority of these sites are in markets where we want to build density and leverage our existing teams. Each new service center helps our network operate more efficiently. When they're all online, we'll have roughly 30% excess door capacity in the network. Strategically, this positions us to capitalize quickly in an upcycle, driving substantial operating leverage and profitable market share gains. Yield is our third lever and the primary driver of our margin improvement. We've been reporting above-market yield growth throughout this year, as we align our pricing with the value we deliver. In the third quarter, we grew yield excluding fuel by 6.7% year-over-year. This underpinned the 200 basis points of OR improvement we reported. We achieved this by executing on multiple initiatives that are yield and margin-accretive. With our customers under contract, we increased renewal pricing by high-single-digits year-over-year for the fifth consecutive quarter, supported by the service improvements we're making. And we're earning more market share from local customers due to the investments we made in our sales force. In the third quarter, we increased shipments from local customers by over 10% compared with a year ago. Our new premium services are another benefit to yield. We've continued to increase our revenue mix from high-margin accessorial services and we expect this revenue stream to grow substantially over time. The final lever of our strategy is cost efficiency, where we have three areas of focus; purchased transportation, variable costs and overhead. In the third quarter, we reduced our purchased transportation costs by 40% year-over-year, primarily driven by our linehaul insourcing initiative. We ended the quarter with 13.6% of linehaul miles outsourced to third parties, which was a reduction of nearly 800 basis points year-over-year. This is the lowest level of outsourcing in our company's history and we are on track to meet our 2027 target by year-end 2024, three years ahead of plan. We now expect our outsourced miles to be below 10% next year. And to support this trajectory, we're deploying more driver teams and sleeper cab trucks for long-distance linehaul runs. And we're continuing to manage labor costs effectively using our proprietary technology. We can realign labor hours quickly to address changes in volume and do that at the service center levels. Turning to Europe, where transportation remains soft in most countries, we continue to outperform the industry. On a year-over-year basis, we increased third quarter segment revenue by 7%. It was our strongest quarterly revenue growth since 2021 with volume accelerating for the fifth consecutive quarter. The strongest revenue performance was in the U.K., where our year-over-year organic revenue growth was up mid-teens. Importantly, our sales pipeline in Europe is growing at near-record levels as we close new business and replenish new leads. This should support ongoing above-market growth across our key geographies. In summary, the strong third quarter we delivered highlights the effectiveness of our strategy and our company-specific initiatives regardless of the macro. The world-class service we provide is within our control. It creates value for our customers and enables us to outpace the industry with yield growth and margin expansion. In addition, we've made significant progress in becoming more cost-efficient with our operations. Even in the current environment, our strategy is driving robust financial and operational results and our investments in capacity will accelerate those results when the freight market rebounds. We have a long runway for additional market share and earnings growth, and we're well-positioned to capture that opportunity. Now, I'm going to hand the call over to Kyle to discuss the financial results. Kyle, over to you. Thanks, Ken. First, if you look at the margin gap on the pricing side, so when we started our plan that was roughly, call it, a mid-teens pricing gap between us and best-in-class on the pricing opportunity. And so far this year, we were able to claw a couple of points out of that given our outperformance in yield versus the market. And that was a combination of, one, our service product continues to improve tremendously and we get great accolades from our customers who understand that we are investing more in our network, we are investing in rolling stock and that comes at a premium. But we are also seeing great contributions from premium services that we are onboarding. We launched about half a dozen either expanded or new premium services and these come at a higher yield and higher revenue. And we're also growing our local account segment here in the third quarter. We grew shipment count in that segment more than 10% and that also comes at a higher yield and a higher-margin as well. And over the years to come, roughly half that gap is driven by premium price to service and we expect to keep on bridging that gap. And then the other half comes from both accessorial revenue or premium services, as well as local accounts. In terms of volume trends, what we're seeing here in quarters -- first, if you look at the third quarter, August was the most sub-seasonal month. It was a few points below seasonality compared to where we were in July. September was roughly around -- we were down about 6.1%, and that was roughly a point below seasonality versus October -- versus August. But that started with -- the beginning of the month was better than the end of the month that was impacted by the hurricane. And ultimately, in October, we are down -- there's still a couple of days here to go, but roughly around 8%, which is roughly in line with seasonality. So we're seeing the sub-seasonal demand normalize here in the month of October. And as you said, a portion of the year-on-year delta is the cyberattack that's happened at one of our peers, and we estimate the impact of that cyberattack to have been 2 points on the year-on-year comp when you look at October of last year compared to October this year. Thank you. Yes, I'll start on the overall pricing environment, Scott, and I'll turn it over to Kyle to discuss contract renewal and Ali can discuss our outlook. But if you look at pricing overall, we continue to see a very constructive pricing environment out there. And if you take a step back, a year ago, a significant amount of capacity exited the market and we continue to see that industry pricing backdrop be constructive. I mean, you heard our peers report here last week and this week and all the commentary leans toward a strong pricing environment. Now, typically in our industry, we typically price 100 to 200 basis points ahead of cost inflation, and we're seeing that play out here. And we are outperforming on the pricing side, given what I mentioned earlier on. So from one perspective, we are being rewarded for the better service product from our customers, but we also have these avenues in terms of local accounts generating higher-yielding and higher-margin freight and incremental accessorial revenue that is coming from the incremental services that we are launching that our customers are asking for. So it's a win-win, where the customer gets a new service from us, they get to experience the great service, and obviously, we get the yield benefit from that as well. And, look, here in the third quarter, we were able to deliver a great yield outcome, accelerating on a quarter-over-quarter basis, accelerating on a two-year stack basis. The absolute number for revenue per shipment is up, the yield per -- for 100 weight is up. So all of these KPIs are moving in the right direction for us here as we go towards the back half of the year. Thank you. Yes. So, overall, we're on a great trajectory of service improvement. If you look at our damage claims ratio here in the third quarter, we were at 0.2% damage claims. Compared to that when we started our strategy a few years ago, we were at 1.2%. So a tremendous reduction of more than 80% of damages in our network and our customers appreciate that tremendously. On the on-time side, we are -- this is the 10th consecutive quarter of improvement. We get a ton of accolades from customers on the speed and reliability of our network when it comes to picking up the freight and delivering the freight on time as well. Now a lot of the initiatives, Reed, that we have so far implemented were all around changing incentive comp plans, launching airbags, having more capacity, having technology that enables us to track damages down to the person level, to the shift level, and all of that has enabled us to completely change how we load the freight and then the trailers here over the last few years. And we only see upside. I mentioned this in my opening remarks, in the quarter, we saw every month of the quarter reach a year record of better damage frequency than the prior month and we continue that trend to continue here over the quarters and years to come. Our teams in the field operationally are just doing a fantastic job executing on all of that. Now when you look forward, we have a number of initiatives that will continue to improve service. As you said, first, starting with our insourcing of third-party linehaul. Typically when we move the freight on our equipment, we are more efficient at doing it. We get more space in the trailers. We are -- we have much better on-time performance. Here in the month of October, our Road Flex operation on-time performance was nearly 100% in terms of being on time. And as we continue to in-source more third-party linehaul, we're going to continue to see our on-time get higher and higher. And obviously, our goal is to be in the high 99% when all of these things are completed. Similarly, on the improving of damages, we are continuing to work. As we expand the footprint of our network in some locations, we can build more pure trailers to destination, which reduces rehandling in our network that will further take that damage performance even in a better place. And our goal is to get to a 0.1% damage claims ratio over the quarters and years to come here. So, overall, again, the trajectory is very strong. We have a great plan that we're executing on and I'm very proud of the team of the progress they're making. Yes, when you look at 2025, we expect a strong year, both from an OR improvement perspective and an earnings growth perspective. And this is very even in the current soft macro-environment. And obviously, any improvement in the demand backdrop will only accelerate our results even further. If you look at 2024, we're going to be at or above our guided range for OR improvement in a fairly soft freight market. Now, we will talk more about the specifics of 2025 next quarter once we close out the year. But that said, if you look at the levers, we are heading into next year with another great year of service under our belt and that leads to us having -- being able to price the freight accordingly. We also have launched a, call it, half a dozen or so premium services or expanded premium services here in-year, in 2024, and our sales team and customers are incredibly excited about those services. We're building momentum. We're building the pipeline. We're converting more of that revenue on our trucks and that comes at a higher-margin and a higher yield and it's a service that our customers are asking for. When you look at our local customers, we have added so far year-to-date more than 8,000 new local customers. And here this last quarter, despite shipment count being down in the low-to mid-single-digit range, our local customer shipments were up more than 10%, and that's going to continue to accelerate as we head into next year. And the 25% more local centers we have added to the team, will have effectively a longer runway to build that book, to be able to convert more of those customers into next year. Then you look at linehaul insourcing, where we expect to reach our 2027 target by end of this year in terms of how many miles are outsourced to third parties, and we're going to get that down to-single digits next year and that's going to be a tailwind on the cost side. And ultimately, we opened up 21 of the 28 service centers so far. We're going to be adding another -- the remaining of them by end of Q1 of next year. And these are making us more efficient and they will be OR-accretive and EPS-accretive as we head into 2025. So that's tailwinds for margin improvement as well. So again, we expect a strong year in 2025. And we're not stopping there. When you think about the next up-cycle with all the initiatives we have and the investments and capacity, we're incredibly excited about the years to come and eventually driving our OR down to the 70s and beyond. Thank you. Yes. So, Chris, if you look at the service centers we opened up so far, so we opened up 21 out of the 28 and eight of these were net adds, so they are in incremental sites we are adding to a market or a new market we are expanding into, and 13 were relocations from a smaller location to a larger location. Now we do expect these sites to be OR-neutral here in 2024. And so far, this has been playing out the way we expected and we expect them to be OR accretive by next year. Now, keep in mind, with 21 service centers we opened up, we've only added 80 net headcount to our staff, so 80 people to support the opening of these sites. And we're gaining efficiency improvement from them. So when you look at these sites, we are seeing an improvement in pickup and delivery efficiency. So our city operations is, call it, low-to mid-single digit more efficient on a percentage basis in those markets given the larger sites. And similarly, our linehaul efficiency has increased in that low-to mid-single-digit as well, which is what gives us the efficiency improvement here in the near term and that's going to ramp as we head into next year. When you look at the incremental margins we're seeing from these sites, it's 40% plus and all of the sites are operating at or above our expectations so far since we have opened them up. So again, when you roll that forward into next year, in the near term, we're going to continue to see that efficiency improvement help us from an overall cost standpoint to drive higher margins. And whenever the freight market turns, this is what gets us really excited. I mean, today's LTL demand is down, call it, anywhere between the low-teens on the low end to the high-teens on the high end compared -- as an industry, when you compare either pre-COVID or 2021 to current volume levels. So we are in a prime position when that market starts turning, to be able to use that incremental capacity to get more freight with high incremental margins as we move forward as well. Thank you. And in a high level, if you look at it, Tom, from a -- versus market perspective, I mean, we expect to continue to outperform the market into '25 and beyond. And as Kyle and Ali mentioned earlier on, when you look at these incremental opportunities, typically in LTL it will be priced, call it, 100 to 200 points above cost inflation. And you add on top of that roughly a point from accessorial revenue and 0.5 point from that local account mix is what will give us the incremental, effectively, outperformance versus market. We saw that here play out in 2024, as Ali mentioned, and we expect that to continue in '25 and '26 and beyond. Now, the actual number could depend on the macro. In the macro recovery, we can see pricing being higher than the numbers you gave, but it depends on the -- obviously what the macro does as well and what cost inflation is doing as well. That looks like reasonable assumption for next year. Yes. As you said, Brian, when you look at the month of October, we have seen that impact -- the year-on-year impact from the cyberattack last year at one of our peers. So when you look at it, the back half of the month-on a year-on-year basis was obviously much better than the first half of the month that was impacted by the cyberattack. But when you look at it, this is what we said last year, the impact of the cyberattack for last October was, call it, roughly around 1,000 shipments of incremental shipments per day when you average the entire month, which is roughly around a 2% impact on tonnage. So when you normalize for that, obviously, you got to take that out of the 8%. Now in the hurricane impact, we did see -- we did see also the impact both at the end of September and at the beginning of October that impacted overall the volume trend, given some of the markets when you got -- if you go to the Southeast of the country, they were actually obviously impacted by not being able to ship product in and out of those regions for a few weeks, although we were up and running very quickly. And I was very proud of the team, all of our employees were safe and we were able to support our customers within 24 hours where needed. But at the same time, obviously, that the market was impacted. Now when you look at customer demand trends, it has been -- when you look at the -- over the summer, it has been softer, sub-seasonal. When you look at the month of August, as I mentioned earlier on, it was roughly around a few points lower than seasonality, normalized a point lower than seasonality in September, normalized, so roughly in line with seasonality in October. Now what we saw in the quarter was the industrials being more impacted than retail. We saw industrial shipments be down at twice the rate of that corresponding retail customers through the course of the quarter. And you see that in the ISM index, obviously hovered at 46, 47 in the quarter, which was a deceleration from earlier in the year. Now, as you know, I spent a lot of time with customers in the field. And what we've heard from customers is some sub-sectors of the industrial economy, so electrical equipment manufacturing or machinery, are much more bullish about the outlook when they look forward. But if you look at construction or industrial, or agriculture, they are more bearish. They are seeing more softness in demand looking forward. On the retail side, they were down still, but down less than their corresponding industrial side. Inventories are mostly normalized. Consumer demand is holding. So we're seeing a -- we saw a retail sector that was constructive, but still down on a year-on-year basis, but less than the industrial counterpart. In terms of local versus large customers, for us, local is growing. Our local sales team is doing an impeccable job onboarding new customers. Year-to-date, we have onboarded more than 8,000 new logos in that channel and we saw shipment count in that segment grow more than 10% here in the third quarter, but that's more company-specific. And given the improvements in service and the execution of our sales force, we are able to deliver on those outcomes. But again, if you look forward, tough to predict where things will go from here through the rest of Q4 or early next year. I mean, there's a scenario where we start seeing an inflection in the -- at the end of the first-quarter or first half of next year if rates continue to come down and the overhang of the election is behind us. But we'll see -- it's very tough to predict. There's a lot of mixed signals in terms of what the outlook would do here in the near term. Yes. So starting with the premium services, I'll give you a few examples, Scott. For example, in the retail side, we launched a new service called retail store rollouts. So you can imagine whenever you have a consumer packaged goods company that wants to -- for a certain holiday like Halloween here coming out this week, they want to send a lot of product to a lot of stores simultaneously. So we effectively have a desk for them that can support dealing with a project where they are shipping 500 shipments or 1,000 shipments to all different locations, getting a consolidated bill at the end of it and making sure that all of their freight is being tracked in conjunction as one unit. Similarly, we launched a product called Retail Solutions or Must Arrive By Date. So when you think of -- again of a company shipping into a large retailer, typically they have charge-back programs and deliver the product within a certain time window that obviously as a shipper or supplier to that retailer, you get a charge-back as a percent of the value of the goods. So given the tremendous improvement in service product, we actually now offered that service for our customers where we can again make sure that we're taking -- we're tracking the freight all the way through destination and it needs to be stored at destination for a period of time before it gets delivered in a certain time window, we can make all of that happen for the customer. Similarly, on trade shows, when you look, we opened up here over the last few quarters a new service center in Las Vegas that is massive, one of the largest in the city. And you can imagine when people want to ship things into a trade show, they get it to our location. We offer five days of free storage. We offer again a service desk to coordinate the product getting delivered to the trade show floor and pickup from the trade show floor. So we handle all of these things for our customers. And finally, on Mexico, we expanded our Mexico offering. We've been doing Mexico for more than 30 years. We're one of the oldest carriers in doing that service, but we've added more border crossing locations and expanded our reach within Mexico and that's resonating with customers as well. So all of these are extra services that we are offering to the customer. They come at a cost on our side, but usually a smaller cost, but more importantly, they are very important for our customers in terms of getting the freight picked up and delivered with these extra requirements along with it. In terms of moving forward, we are looking to launch a number of incremental services as well. A security divider is one of them. Today, we do, for example, exclusive use of trailers, so where we ship -- where you can, as a customer, book an entire trailer. But in the future, you can also do partial trailers if you have high-value products you want to protect. We are looking at services like expedited services within the network -- intra-network and a number of others as well that we're working with our customers on too. In terms of the local investment in our -- investment in sales or our local sales team, so we had a plan to grow the local sales force by 25% and we reached that plan effectively where we are now. We are still adding incremental headcount to our sales force, but we still have to define going into next year whether we want to further grow our local sales force or whether we feel good about where we are. At this point, we're feeling good about the size of the sales force. We're still incrementally adding new roles, including business development roles on the team, but we'll see if we are going to expand the local sales force beyond that as we finalize here budgets for 2025. Yes. So if you look at the European sale, our strategy continues to be, we want to be a North American LTL carrier over time. Now we're patient on the sale of Europe, because we want to make sure we're getting the right value for it. It is a business that has high scarcity value. I mean, when you look at it, we're either number one, two or three in LTL in dedicated solutions and warehousing by trucking and brokerage in the Western European geographies, including U.K., France, Spain, Portugal and many other countries. And again, we're going to be patient to make sure we are getting the right value for it. Meanwhile, when you look at it, Bruce, we are performing really well in Europe. I mean, you look at the third quarter here, we grew revenue 7% on a year-on-year basis. It's the strongest quarterly volume and revenue growth since 2021 post-pandemic. It's the fifth consecutive quarter of accelerating year-on-year volume growth. And we're well-positioned to capitalize on the market over there. And again, long term, we're going to be a pure-play North American LTL carrier. Now when you look at what Kyle just mentioned, that's another avenue for value-creation for our shareholders, because when you think about it, overall, our earnings are compounding. As I mentioned earlier on, we expect to be either at or above the target range of margin improvement for us here in LTL in 2024. And there is only upside from here. At some point, whether it's the next couple of quarters, whether it's next year, we're going to see freight market cycle starting to inflect. And when that starts happening, we're going to compound our results, our growth, our earnings growth faster. And when you look at CapEx normalizing, what Kyle just mentioned, call it, a point or so a year till 2027, that's only going to expand our free cash flow conversion. You couple that with proceeds from Europe, at some point in time, we're going to start returning that larger cash flow conversion, that capital back to shareholders, which will be another avenue of value creation for shareholders as well. Thank you. So, Ravi, first looking at damage claims, our goal is to be best-in-class when it comes to no damages in our network. And over the last few years, again, we reduced damages by more than 80%. Here in-quarter, we reached a new company record every month of the quarter and we're going to keep on improving there. Our view is very simple. When we take care of the customer, they give us more freight and they're also willing to pay a higher price for the freight because that causes less disruption in their supply chain. So we're going to keep on working that until we become best-in-class when it comes to service. Now when it comes to the Mastio surveys, as you said, we were the most improved on a two-year stack in terms of NPS scores. It's just one data point we look at in terms of overall outperformance. But more importantly, Ravi, we measure satisfaction of our customers on a weekly basis. We effectively get to do a survey for customers who are actually shipping with us and we get to see that satisfaction and how it performs. Over the last few years, it's up by more than 40% over that period of time. And ultimately, customers vote with their wallet and we're seeing effectively growth in our numbers and yield, we're seeing growth in margin, and all of that's driven, rooted by the improvements in service that we are making. First, Jason, it's tough to estimate how much of the freight have moved to truckload in terms of consolidation because that portion of it, typically, we don't have as much visibility into it. But generally, TMS have been -- TMS systems have been around for a long time. And usually, what more shippers do, they automatically look at the service requirement per shipment that they have and they compare rates between truckload and LTL and they compare it also based on the service requirement to move that freight. So that's not something new that we're seeing here. I mean, customers who have TMS systems usually move fairly quickly on whether they want to consolidate or not based on what they're seeing in the environment. So we expect whenever truckload, the rates go back up again, you get to see effectively the TMS system will do the computation and figure out that it's better to actually move a shipment with LTL. But that percentage is tough to estimate. Now there is also what we call direct mode conversion between LTL to TL, which is where there is a -- it's more cost-efficient just for one shipment. And in that particular case, if you look at our network, last quarter, our average length of haul was about 855 miles. When you apply in the trough of the market a $2 truckload rate to that, it's probably -- a corresponding truckload shipment would be about $1,700 to move that. You compare that to an average revenue per shipment for us was $380. So there's a big dislocation between $380 and $1,700 revenue per shipment in truckload versus LTL. Now, sometimes I get the question, well, Mario, what about heavy shipment? So I had the team on the breakeven point, and that breakeven point for shipments over 15,000 pounds, and today less than 0.3% of our shipments are that heavy. So there is a small conversion there. We estimate it to be 0.5 point, maybe less than a point. But again, once truckload rates go up, we'll come back to LTL as well. You got it. Yes. Well, Stephanie, if you look at it from our perspective, all of these service improvements were done, were not driven by lower volumes. They were driven by action plans to specifically improve service between incentive compensation for our employees that incentivizes on improving service between adding effectively technology that enables us to track damages down to the person level and the shift level and the supervisor level by doing a big cultural change and training and holding people accountable and our employees holding each other accountable to provide great service for the customer. So all of these are foundational changes in what we've done to improve service. Now I'll give you a couple of proof points. When you look at last year, when Yellow went bankrupt, we saw an above-seasonality increase in shipment count from Q2 to Q3 of plus 7%. So think about the macro recovery. Think of a cycle recovery. A 7 point higher than seasonality increase in volume is massive. And during that period of time, in the summer of last year, we saw our service product, our damages and our on-time improve every month in Q3 of last year, Q4 of last year, and that trend continued through 2024 here. So effectively, we already have done it once in an upcycle through the bankruptcy of one of our peers. Now, when you look at moving forward, a lot of it goes also to having capacity. So far we are loving the position we are in because we have -- we are in -- we have invested a lot in real estate, a lot in rolling stock. By Q1 of next year, we're going to have more than 30% excess capacity in our network to be able to handle that incremental freight for the customer. And similarly, on the rolling stock side, we've added more than 15,000 trailers and more than 4,000 trucks. So all of that capacity is going to put us in a prime position to provide great service for the customers and be able to capitalize on the upswing of demand when it comes. Thank you. Thanks Ari. Ari, I don't see a risk in that for a simple reason, which is usually real estate as a cost footprint in an LTL network is a low to mid-single digit as a percent of revenue. So in other terms, as an LTL carrier, you're not going to use that cost to justify onboarding freight that doesn't operate at or better profile than the rest of your network, because otherwise, you're going to take down your margins, you're going to take down your earnings and you're going to work harder to move that freight for a cost category that is very low on the P&L. So if you think about it as a capacity, though, from the industry as a whole, as I mentioned earlier on, when you look at all the publicly traded LTL carriers, shipment counts. When you look at pre-COVID 2018-'19 or 2021, which was post-COVID, it was still slightly lower than '18-'19. Compared to where we are in 2024, shipment demand in our industry on the low end is down in the low teens, and on the high end is down in the high teens. Now when Yellow went bankrupt last year, it was at a time where demand was depressed. So you took out 10% of the industry capacity through them ceasing operation. Since then they've sold about, call it, roughly half of their service centers. About 90% of these service centers went back into the hands of LTL carrier. So even in a year from now, you're going to have 94%, 95% of the industry capacity that existed a year ago. So that's what gives us a lot of confidence in the next up-cycle. And I'll give you just some anecdotal examples. Here, last week, I was actually visiting some of our customers in the Minneapolis area and based on those meetings I was with them, their main concern was what's going to happen in the next up-cycle. And they wanted to make sure that we have enough capacity to be able to grow with them during that period of time. So currently, on our customers' mind they see the fact that capacity have gone out, they see that some of it came back, but they also do understand that demand is very depressed. And when you start seeing that demand come back into LTL, it's going to be the cycle of all cycles for LTL companies. Thank you. Thank you, operator, and thanks everyone for joining us today. As you saw from our results, we are able to deliver strong margin improvement in a soft market for freight transportation. Now our strategy is working and we have the right team behind it executing on it. Our service has never been better and keeps on improving. Our yield is above-market in terms of growth and our customers are seeing those service improvements where we're launching. Our premium services are gaining momentum. Our local accounts are growing. We've added more than 8,000 local accounts so far year to date. And on the cost side, our technology is enabling us to run the business very efficiently and insourcing linehaul at a pace of three years ahead of plan. And importantly, all the investments we're making in capacity are positioning us to be able to do really well in the eventual freight market recovery and getting fantastic incremental margins as we grow the business. We look forward to updating you over the next quarter. And operator, you can now end the call. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Kyle. I'll start with LTL, where we executed well in a soft freight market to deliver another quarter of margin improvement and earnings growth. On a year-over-year basis, our third quarter shipments per day were down by 3.2% overall, but they were up in our local channel by double digits, accelerating from the second quarter. Local accounts are a key part of our strategy and an opportunity to earn market share at a favorable margin. Our weight per shipment continued to moderate this quarter and was down 0.7%. Collectively, these dynamics resulted in a 3.9% decline in tonnage per day, which largely tracks the seasonality and outperformed the industry as a whole. On a monthly basis, our July tonnage per day was down 0.8%, August was down 4.7% and September was down 6.1%. Looking just at shipments per day, July was up 0.1%, August was down 4.6% and September was down 4.9%. For October, we estimate that tonnage will be down 8% from the prior year, tracking roughly in line with seasonality, excluding the impact of a cyberattack at a peer last year. Our pricing trends remain strong as customers continue to recognize the value of our service quality and premium offerings. This enabled us to deliver another quarter of above-market pricing growth. On a year-over-year basis, we grew yield ex fuel by 6.7% and revenue per shipment by 6.6%. Importantly, both yields and revenue per shipment increased sequentially from the second quarter this year and also on a two-year stack basis. We expect these trends to continue for the fourth quarter, reflecting ongoing momentum with our pricing initiatives. Turning to margin, we improved our third quarter adjusted operating ratio by 200 basis points year-over-year to 84.2%. Sequentially, our adjusted OR increased by 100 basis points, coming in at the top of our guided range. Our robust margin performance was primarily driven by yield growth and bolstered by our cost initiatives and productivity gains. We've now delivered significant year-over-year OR improvement for four consecutive quarters, all in a historically soft freight environment. And it's notable that we were the only public LTL carrier to expand margin in the third quarter. Our full year outlook is for an adjusted OR improvement of 150 to 250 basis points, and we expect to be at or above the high end of that range. Moving to the European business, we executed well in the quarter to outperform the industry in a challenging market for freight transportation. Our pricing outpaced inflation and we managed cost to mitigate the impact on earnings. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA for the segment was flat compared with last year, and we generated double-digit growth in the U.K., which is a key market for us. The improvements we've made in the business will accelerate results in Europe when the macro recovers. I'll close with a summary of the major drivers behind the record margins we're reporting in the trough of the freight cycle. We're making significant progress with service quality and we expect this to propel margin expansion for years to come. Our pricing is outpacing the market and continues to gain traction. We believe we're just beginning to capture the massive yield opportunity ahead of us. And we're operating far more productively by reducing third-party linehaul miles to historic lows and effectively managing our variable costs. These initiatives are all in the early innings with strong momentum and their impact will accelerate when demand begins to recover. Now, we'll take your questions. Operator, please open the line for Q&A. And Scott, just on the OR side, we do expect a strong quarter here in the fourth quarter, driven by continued strength in yield and cost management. Typically, Q4 is a more volatile quarter, which does give a wider range of outcomes and volume trends can be impacted by the holidays and weather. However, if you take a step back and you look at the five-year average for the sequential OR change from Q3 to Q4, it's been in that 250 basis points range and we would expect to do better than that normal seasonal trend as we roll into the -- as we roll into the fourth quarter. And I think more importantly, when you roll that into the full year for 2024, we expect to now be at or above the high end of our 150 to 250 basis points OR improvement range, which is very strong performance at the trough of the cycle. Sure, Tom. This is Ali. So you've seen us deliver very strong yield growth over the last several quarters. And as Kyle noted, many of our yield initiatives are still in the very early innings. You think about our ongoing service improvements, that's going to continue to earn us a higher price with our customers. We're also growing the mix of our local business and premium services, which are both accretive to both yield and margin. In the case of premium services, these are services that our customers are asking for. And we also expect the favorable industry pricing trends to continue as well. You've seen a significant amount of capacity that's exited the market over the last 12 to 18 months. And the overall industry backdrop -- pricing backdrop remains very constructive. And our expectation is, Tom, we're going to continue outperforming the industry from a pricing standpoint, as you've seen us do over the last -- over the last year. We have a lot of pricing initiatives that we're executing on and we would expect that momentum to continue here into the fourth quarter and into 2025 as well. Jordan, I'll start here. So if you look at our pricing strategy, what we're doing is we're aligning our price with the increased value we're providing our customers. And our customers understand that for us to provide better service, we need to invest in our business. And there's a premium associated with that. And a better service product means a total lower cost for them as well to move goods through their supply chain. And as Mario noted, we've seen significant improvements in our service over the last few years. You think about our damage claims ratio improving from 1.2% a few years ago to 0.2%. Our on-time performance has improved for 10 consecutive quarters on a year-over-year basis. And those service improvements are earning us a higher price with our customers. And that's translating to above-market contract renewals and pricing growth. I'd also point out that there's other ways for us to improve our yield just beyond price. You think about growing the revenue mix of premium services in the local channel, both of which are both yield and margin accretive for us and go beyond just raising prices to the end customer. And so, we're going to continue to take a disciplined approach to grow our market share. As Mario noted, in the local channel, for example, we're growing shipments by more than 10% and that accelerated from the second quarter. So, overall, our top priority is to continue to drive OR improvement. For us, yield is going to be the main lever for that margin expansion. You look here in the third quarter and likely for the full year as well, we're going to be the only public LTL carrier to expand margin. And we're going to continue to optimize revenue quality to continue to drive that margin expansion going forward. And as you think about the outlook from a tonnage perspective, as Mario noted, if you roll forward seasonality from October, that would imply tonnage for the full quarter being down somewhere in that mid-single-digit-plus range year-over-year for the fourth quarter overall. Now macro will be the biggest swing factor, but if you just roll forward that normal seasonality into November and December, you'll get to somewhere in that mid-single-digit decline range."

I will now turn the call over to XPO's Chief Executive Officer, Mario Harik. Mr. Harik, you may begin.\nMario Harik: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call. I'm here in Greenwich with Kyle Wismans, our Chief Financial Officer; and Ali Faghri, our Chief Strategy Officer. This morning, we reported a strong second quarter for both revenue and earnings in a soft market for freight transportation. Company-wide, we grew revenue year-over-year by 9% to $2.1 billion. And we increased our adjusted EBITDA by 41% to $343 million. Adjusted diluted EPS was 58% higher year-over-year at $1.12. I'll start with the strategy that's driving our above market earnings growth and margin expansion. There are four pillars to LTL 2.0. First is to provide world class service. This revolves around the service metrics that are most important to our customers. In the second quarter, we improved one of the most important metrics damage claims ratio to a company record of 0.2%. This compares with 0.3% in the first quarter and 0.7% last year. Since late 2021, when we started LTL 2.0, we've driven more than a 75% reduction in damage frequency. We also improved our on-time performance on a year-over-year basis for the 9th consecutive quarter. We already have one of the industry's fastest networks of one and two-day lanes, and when coupled with our strong on-time performance, this is a key differentiator for our customers. We achieved these improvements while handling higher volume across our network by prioritizing both operational excellence and network investments. Specifically, we have two major levers with long runway to improve our service. One is the opening of 28 new service centers and the other is our in-sourcing of purchased transportation. In addition, we're constantly implementing a number of shorter-term initiatives. For example, we now have freight airbag systems installed in over 95% of our service centers. We're seeing a strong return on this investment through a reduction in damage claims. The second pillar is to invest in network capacity. Over the past three years, we've added nearly 14,000 trailers and more than 4,000 tractors to our fleet. This is a high return use of capital that allows us in-source linehaul transportation, drive operational efficiencies, and improve customer service levels. So far this year, we've added over 1,900 new tractors bringing down the average age to four years from five years at the end of 2023. These new tractors are more efficient to operate, resulting in a double-digit decline in our fleet maintenance costs in the second quarter. We've also manufactured over 2,600 trailers year-to-date at our in-house production facility in Arkansas. As the only U.S. freight transportation company to produce its own trailers, we can create capacity when our customers need it and at a lower cost. In addition, we're continuing to rollout the 28 service centers we acquired in December. We've opened 14 so far and expect to open another 10 in the back half of the year. The last four will be operational by early 2025, on track with our plan. These sites are in fast growing freight markets. Each new center will help us operate more efficiency in the near-term while giving us more capacity when the cycle recovers. Our larger footprint also reduces freight rehandling and brings us closer to our customers. And as our network continues to expand, the benefits of service will grow. Our third area of focus is yield, which is our single biggest opportunity for margin improvement. We've been reporting strong yield growth and we're still in the early innings. In the second quarter, we grew yield excluding fuel by 9% year-over-year, which helped us deliver 440 basis points of adjusted operating ratio improvement. We had three distinct levers for yield improvement. We're aligning our price with the value we deliver; we're growing our accessorials business; and we're expanding our local customer base. In the second quarter, our contract renewal pricing increased year-over-year by high single-digit for the fourth consecutive quarter, driven by the service improvements we're making. And accessorials generated double-digit revenue growth in the quarter. We're rolling out premium services that our customers are asking for, like our expanded trade show service recently opened a new service center in Las Vegas and we're already seeing strong customer demand for this offering. For our industrial base, we launched an expanded cross border service called Mexico+ that adds more capacity and border crossing points. This supports our customers who are shifting production to North America from overseas. We're also continuing to earn more market share from our local customer base, which is a higher margin business. In the second quarter, we increased shipments from local customers by over 9% compared with a year ago. The final pillar of our strategy is cost efficiency. The opportunities here are in purchased transportation, variable costs, and overhead. In the second quarter, we reduced our purchased transportation cost by 22% year-over-year through a combination of in-sourcing linehaul and paying lower contract rates to third-party carriers. We ended the quarter with 15.9% of linehaul miles outsourced to third-parties, which was a reduction of 490 basis points year-over-year. This is the lowest level outsourced in our company's history, and we expect to accelerate the pace as we move forward. When we transport the freight ourselves, we have more quality control and more flexibility. Our drivers and service centers can move freight faster with less rehandling, which reduces damages. We also get better utilization of our trailers by redeploying them at their destination. We expect to have a few hundred driver teams in sleeper cab trucks on the road by year-end to support more in-sourcing. Lastly, we're continuing to manage labor costs effectively in our operations. This is a direct result of the team's execution, as well as our proprietary technology for labor planning. The second quarter was our sixth straight quarterly improvement in labor productivity. Turning to Europe. Our business continued to outperform the industry in a soft macro. On a year-over-year basis, we increased segment revenue by 4%. We also delivered the highest quarterly EBITDA since 2019, with year-over-year growth of 7%, driven by a combination of top-line growth and disciplined cost control. Our strongest EBITDA growth was in the UK and France. In the UK, the increase was in the high teens and in France, it was in the high-single-digits. In summary, our strong results in the first half of the year demonstrate the disciplined progress we're making with the many initiatives we put in place. Importantly, we're delivering record service levels with a direct connection between service and profitability. This dynamic is at the core of our strategy. It enables us to outpace the market with yield growth and profitable market share gains, while operating more cost efficiently at scale. We're also continuing to invest capital where it can sustain high returns over time. These are all inherent strengths of our company that we'll use to improve the business in any environment. Together with our operating momentum, they create a powerful foundation for future growth. Now, I'm going to hand the call over to Kyle to discuss the financial results. Kyle, over to you.\nKyle Wismans: Thank you, Mario, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through our key financial results, balance sheet, and liquidity. We reported a strong second quarter across the company with revenue up 9% year-over-year to $2.1 billion. This includes top-line growth of 12% in our LTL segment and 4% growth in Europe. Excluding fuel, our LTL revenue was up 13% year-over-year. As we took on more business in LTL, we also improved our labor productivity. From the first to second quarter, we reduced our headcount sequentially, while our shipments per day increased by 4%. This helped to mitigate the cost of salaries, wages, and benefits, which in total were 11.5% higher in the quarter than a year ago. This primarily reflects wage and benefit inflation as well as incentive compensation aligned with the segment's strong second quarter performance. We were also more cost efficient with purchased transportation, primarily due to our in-sourcing initiative. Our expense for third-party carriers was down year-over-year by 22%, which equates to a $19 million savings in the quarter. Additionally, we continue to improve our maintenance costs, with our cost per mile down 12% year-over-year. Depreciation expense increased by 24% year-over-year or $15 million, reflecting the investments we're making in the business. This continues to be our top priority for capital allocation in LTL. Our second quarter CapEx was primarily allocated to purchase tractors from the OEMs and manufacture more trailers in-house. Next, I'll add some detail to adjusted EBITDA starting with the company as a whole. We generated adjusted EBITDA of $343 million in the quarter, up 41% from a year ago. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 16.5%, which was a year-over-year improvement of 380 basis points. This was supported by margin improvement in both segments and the continued rationalization of our corporate cost structure. In the second quarter, our corporate net expense was $3 million for a year-over-year savings of 70%. Looking at just the LTL segment, we grew adjusted operating income by 51% year-over-year to $214 million, and we grew adjusted EBITDA by 43% to $297 million. This reflects the combined impacts of our pricing gains, cost efficiencies, and the increase in volume. In our European Transportation segment, adjusted operating income was $19 million, which was a 6% increase from the prior year, and we grew adjusted EBITDA by 7% to $49 million. Returning to the company as a whole, we reported operating income of $197 million for the quarter, up 84% year-over-year, and we grew net income from continuing operations by 384% to $150 million, representing diluted earnings per share of $1.25. The increase in net income from continuing operations includes a one-time tax benefit of $41 million related to the reorganization of our legal entities in Europe. We expect to receive a net cash refund of approximately $45 million in 2025. Note that we excluded the tax benefit from adjusted net income in our second quarter reporting. On an adjusted basis, EPS increased by 58% year-over-year to $1.12. Lastly, we generated $210 million of cash flow from operating activities in the quarter and deployed $184 million of net CapEx. Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $250 million of cash on hand. Combined with available capacity under our committed borrowing facility, this gave us $836 million of liquidity. We had no borrowings outstanding under our ABL facility at quarter end. Our net debt leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.7x trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. This was an improvement from 2.9x at the end of the first quarter and we expect to further reduce our leverage in the second half of the year. The ongoing investments we're making are enhancing our earnings growth trajectory and will support our long-term goal of achieving an investment grade profile. Now, I'll turn it over to Ali who will cover our operating results.\nAli Faghri: Thank you, Kyle. I'll start with our LTL segment, which reported another quarter of profitable growth, reflecting strong execution by our operational teams. On a year-over-year basis, we increased our shipments per day by 4.5% in the quarter, led by more than 9% growth in our local sales channel. Notably, we grew tonnage per day by 3.4%, which is an acceleration from 2.6% in the first quarter. Our weight per shipment was down 1.1% with the year-over-year decline moderating from the prior quarter. This was our fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in weight per shipment. On a monthly basis, year-over-year, our April tonnage per day was up 3.1%, May was up 2.4%, and June was up 4.6%. Looking just at shipments per day, April was up 4.7%, May was up 3.8%, and June was up 4.9%. For July, we estimate tonnage and shipments per day to be about flat year-over-year with both trends outperforming seasonality. On a two-year stack basis, July shipments per day and tonnage per day meaningfully accelerated versus June. Our pricing trends remain strong as we continue to align our pricing with our service quality and premium offerings. For the second quarter, our contract renewal pricing was up year-over-year by 8%. We also delivered another quarter of above market yield growth. We grew yield excluding fuel by 9% compared with the prior year. While our improving weight per shipment was a modest mix headwind to yield, our revenue per shipment ex-fuel increased sequentially for the 6th consecutive quarter and was up 7.4% year-over-year. We expect to continue increasing both yield and revenue per shipment quarter-over-quarter in the back half of this year, reflecting ongoing momentum with our pricing initiatives. Turning to margin. We improved our second quarter adjusted operating ratio by 440 basis points to 83.2%. We've now delivered year-over-year margin expansion of around 400 basis points for three consecutive quarters. Sequentially, our adjusted OR improved by 250 basis points coming in at the high end of our guided range. Our robust margin performance was primarily driven by yield and volume growth bolstered by our cost initiatives and productivity gains. Moving to the European business. We improved volumes throughout the quarter with strong pricing that outpaced inflation. Our organic revenue growth in June was the highest year-to-date for the segment overall, and in the UK, an important market for us, organic revenue in June increased year-over-year by double-digits. Our sales pipeline has grown to a record $1.3 billion and the team continues to earn new business from blue chip customers, strengthening our position in key European geographies. Before we go to Q&A, I want to summarize the considerable progress we're making toward becoming the LTL service leader in North America. Our service metrics are at record levels and there is ample runway for further improvement. This is earning us profitable market share and above market yield growth. We're also optimizing our network with meaningful cost efficiencies, primarily through linehaul in-sourcing and labor productivity. And we just reported another strong quarter of revenue and earnings growth in a soft macro. We're confident that our strategy will drive significant margin expansion over the years to come. Now, we'll take your questions. Operator, please open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. The first question is from Ken Hoexter from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKen Hoexter: Hey, great. Good morning, and congrats on the strong results. Maybe Ali, just to kind of wrap on that, the tonnage ann shipments accelerated in June. Maybe your thoughts on the market here, is it share gains, benefits in new facilities, and relaying that you've always given some thoughts on the sequential move in the operating ratio. Obviously, you've got a lot of seasonality that typically increases it. Maybe your thoughts as we go into third and fourth quarter. Thanks.\nMario Harik: You got it Ken. This is Mario. First, I'll start with the market. So we're continuing to see a soft freight market, but it's stable. If you look at the month of June, the ISM was in the high-40s at 48, 49. And the industrial demand was relatively stable. It did pick up a bit from the month of May and then underlying demand on the industrial side. But again, not major growth there. On the retail side, retail sales came in better and we did see the retail sector also hold up and increase a bit as well. But sequentially, we did see a pickup in the month of June compared to where we were in May. Now, if you take a step back on the quarter and July starting there on tonnage for us, July tonnage is about flattish, which outperforms seasonality by one to two points. And we expect a similar outperformance for the third quarter as a whole. Now, when we look at seasonality, we do exclude the impact of COVID since if you recall, Q2 to Q3 back then was a big upswing with the decline in Q2. And similarly, when you look at Yellow last year, it was outside of seasonal norms. So if you apply seasonality, it would imply tonnage in the third quarter to be down low-single-digits. And we expect to do better than that, where we expect to be flattish on tonnage for the third quarter as a whole. Now, the other moving part for OR going to your question on margin is on the yield front. And we expect a strong quarter for yield ex-fuel. As our initiatives continue to gain traction, we expect to be in the mid to high-single-digit range on a year-on-year improvement for yield. Even as we lap the tougher comps, weight per shipment could be a swing factor. We've seen that improve here through the course of the year for us. And it does imply an acceleration on a two-year stack for yield Q3 versus the first half. And it does imply a sequential increase on absolute dollar basis from Q2 going to Q3 as well. Ultimately, from an OR perspective, we also expect a strong quarter for margin improvement. We expect OR to increase sequentially by 100 basis points to 150 basis points, which is in line with seasonality. But similar to my comments on volume, if you do exclude the outlier quarters with COVID and the Yellow bankruptcy, typical seasonality is 200 to 250 deterioration and we expect to do much better than that, driven by volume, yield growth, and all the cost efficiencies we're implementing.\nKen Hoexter: Very helpful. Thank you, Mario.\nMario Harik: You bet.\nOperator: The next question is from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Just want to follow-up on operating ratio. So thanks for the color on Q3. How are you now thinking about the full year guide in terms of full year OR. And then I don't know, I know it's early, but clearly some continued good momentum on price and claims. How do you think this sets up from an OR perspective heading into 2025?\nKyle Wismans: Hey Scott, it's Kyle. So when you think about 2024, we think it's going to be a strong year of margin improvement. Initially, we thought the year would be in the 150 basis point to 250 basis point range for the year of improvement, and we expect to land towards the high end of that range. And that's given the momentum we've seen so far in the first half, and assuming a stable macro in the back half of the year. A \u2013 Mario Harik And so for 2025, we expect a strong year in 2025 for OR improvement and earnings growth as well. Now, obviously, we're not immune to the macro. Macro would be the biggest swing factor there, but we expect a very strong year. And if you take a step back, we are driving above-market yield growth, and that's driven by the continuous service improvements that we are doing across the network, and that's translating into us gaining profitable market share. And customers want to give us more business, and we're driving higher yields. And they know that for us to provide this great service, we got to invest in our business. We're also making contributions from premium services and the growth of the local channel or the local account. When you look at premium services, we already launched a good number of them here through the course of the year, between retail store rollouts or retail solutions to tradeshows, to cross border in Mexico, expanding the service. And we're continuing to make great progress on in-sourcing. You saw here our results in the quarter. We got to a record level of in-sourcing of 15.9%, and we're ahead of our plan to get to the low-double-digit low-teens, and we expect to continue to accelerate that. And ultimately, we're opening up the new service centers, and these are contributing to cost efficiencies in the near-term. But as the cycle starts inflecting, at some point, they're going to give us more capacity as well. And they will be both OR accretive and EPS accretive in 2025. So overall, we expect a strong year, and we'll talk more about 2025 expectations as we report the fourth quarter results this year.\nScott Group: And I thought, did you give the pricing renewals number in the quarter?\nKyle Wismans: Hey, Scott, it's Kyle. So the renewals in the quarter were up 8%.\nScott Group: Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.\nKyle Wismans: You bet. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Daniel Imbro from Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Imbro: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking our questions. Maybe if we could follow-up, Mario, on the pricing on the accessorial side, I think there was a 5% gap when we came into this year between you and your best-in-class peer. I'm curious how much of that you think you've captured so far. And you mentioned a few of the services you've rolled out. I'm curious, have you introduced enough to close that gap fully? I guess, how long do you think it would take to close that accessorial pricing gap as well? Thanks.\nMario Harik: Yes, you got it. So when you look at it, the difference on accessorial revenue as a percent of total from where we are today and where we want to be, where best in class is, there's roughly a 5 points difference. So we have grown this last quarter accessorial revenue double-digit on a year-on-year basis, and we are making inroads towards getting to that 15%. Currently, we're still in the, call it low-double-digit, low-teens territory. And we believe that overall, over the years to come, if we gain an incremental point of yield from accessorials over the next, call it three, four, five years, that would be a good cadence for us in terms of how we realize that. In terms of the services themselves, as you know, then whenever you launch a new service, a new product, you build the pipeline; you have to always train your sellers and you start building that pipeline over time. And we're seeing a lot of great traction. There's still roughly call it about three or four services we want to be launching over the course of the next year that we're currently working on. But we already have made really great progress on launching some of these services, like I mentioned trade shows or retail store rollouts or retail solutions, and many of these other services.\nDaniel Imbro: Got it. And just to clarify, that was one point per year for the next few years, Mario, was your expectation?\nMario Harik: This is how we think about it.\nDaniel Imbro: Great. Thanks so much. Best of luck.\nMario Harik: You bet.\nOperator: The next question is from Fadi Chamoun from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nFadi Chamoun: Yes. Good morning. Thank you. Mario, so big -- big kind of piece of the OR improvement strategy over the medium-term, it's going to that's revenue per shipment to outgrow the market consistently. And accessorial is part of that and all of these things. I'm wondering if you can give us kind of behind the scene description, maybe example of how the service improvement in the last, maybe six, eight quarters that you've been going at it, have changed, the revenue mix have changed how your shipment profile with your customers changing or your customer profile is changing.\nMario Harik: Thank you. Thanks, Fadi. If you take a step back in our industry, customers want great service. And the reason why they want that is because that avoids disruptions in their supply chain and how they move a product from their locations to their customers\u2019 locations. And as you said, we've made tremendous progress on that over the last two years, we've reduced our damage claims ratio from 1.2% to a new company record here of 0.2%. And our customers see that even we -- in our new service centers, we put a slogan that says, we love our customers with three hearts next to it. And when you -- this is the relationship with building with the customers, they want to give you more freight; they want to give you more profitable freight. So in terms of the impact on the mix, we are being disciplined in terms of what we're taking on. So if we see a skid or a pallet that is non-conforming in size, doesn't fit well in an LTL network, if we see a freight that is not operating at a desirable margin for whatever reason, whether it's a customer who's not willing to pay a premium price, then we are turning away that freight or we are pricing it accordingly. And if we see a customer who wants to grow with us, whose freight fits our network that operates at a good margin, we're onboarding that freight. So we are being selective in terms of the freight we are taking on while supporting our customers. And we're also growing, now in terms of mix, it's largely unchanged between the industrial side and the retail side. We're still same proportions. But where we are seeing faster growth is in the local channel. These are mom-and-pop shops. We have now 25% more sellers in our ranks, and we're being able to gain more profitable market share in that channel. So far year-to-date, we've added more than 5,000 new customers in that channel. And we believe that that's going to grow with us here over the years to come.\nFadi Chamoun: Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nMario Harik: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Chris Wetherbee from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nChris Wetherbee: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. You guys have been opening new facilities. Not all of them are net new facilities, and I think you have still some in the back half of the year. But I guess, is there a way to think about sort of the relative profitability of the new facilities this year relative to maybe what the facilities have been out that have been open for a longer period of time or operating at? I guess, we're just trying to get sense of maybe how things could look as we get into potentially a better tonnage environment in 2025 as those facilities ramp up.\nAli Faghri: Good morning, Chris. This is Ali. So when you think about the sites we're launching here, as we noted before, we would expect these service centers to be OR-neutral this year. As you move through the year, we're going to continue to ramp sites. We're going to have another 10 online by the end of the year, and then we'll open the remaining handful in early 2025. As these sites continue to mature, we would expect them to turn OR-accretive into 2025 and also EPS accretive as well. And everything we've seen so far from the 14 sites we've opened already confirm our view that as we get into 2025, these service centers are going to be contributing meaningfully from a bottom line perspective.\nChris Wetherbee: Got it. Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Next question is from Jonathan Chappell from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Chappell: Thank you. Good morning. Ali, you mentioned revenue per underweight ex-fuel continue to increase sequentially throughout the rest of the year. Is mix starting to stabilize a little bit? And is this just pure core pricing and accessorials? Because you're coming up against some very difficult year-over-year comps and sequential increases would insinuate kind of low to mid-single-digit year-over-year increases as well. So can you help us think about maybe the continued headwinds of mix versus the core pricing momentum?\nAli Faghri: Sure, Jon. So when you think about mix, the biggest factor for us has been weight per shipment. Now, weight per shipment was down about 1% on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter. If you just roll forward seasonality from what we saw in July, from a weight per shipments standpoint, through the rest of the quarter, we would expect weight per shipments in Q3 to be down in that 1% range year-over-year, similar to what we saw in the second quarter, and a similar decline also in Q4, as well as our baseline forecast. So overall, we would expect mix from a weight per shipment standpoint to be relatively stable in the second half of the year relative to what we saw in the second quarter. When you think about our revenue per shipment outlook, we do expect a strong year from a revenue per shipment standpoint. As I noted earlier, we would expect revenue per shipment to increase sequentially both in Q3, and in Q4, and also accelerate on a two-year stack basis as well in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year. And our ability to drive that sequential improvement in two-year stack acceleration really goes back to all of the company specific pricing initiatives that we're executing on that are allowing us to drive that above market growth.\nJonathan Chappell: Got it. Thanks, Ali.\nOperator: The next question is from Stephanie Moore from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nJoe Hafling: Hey, good morning, everyone. This is Joe Hafling on for Stephanie. Congrats on the good results. I guess, I wanted to ask on the terminal openings, and you mentioned the OR neutral impact. So I kind of wanted to ask on how are you able to mitigate these cost headwinds from new terminal openings? Is it just better revenue quality flowing through the new terminals? You mentioned, from a near-term perspective, it almost sounded like it was a cost of productivity advantage compared to some of your peers seeing some growing pains on the new terminal headwinds. I wanted to know how you're able to kind of keep that OR neutral outlook on the new terminal opening. Thanks.\nMario Harik: Hey Joe, this is Mario. So when you think of the openings that we are doing so far, we opened up 14 service centers out of the 28 that we acquired. And out of the mix of these service centers, six of them are net adds. So these are markets where we are adding an incremental terminal and eight are relocations where we went from a smaller service center to a larger service center. Now, keep in mind that we already have a network that covers all zip codes in North America. So for us, the openings are about adding capacity, but in the near-term, it's about gaining efficiency and improving service as well. So when you think of the first tier of service centers that we've opened up, we've only added 50 net headcount to support these openings. And compare that to, we have 23,000 people. So it has almost no impact on cost. And the team has been executing very well on these openings. To give you an example, if you look at a market like Brooklyn, New York, we used to have 30, 40 doors in that market, small yards. We were tapped out on capacity. Now we moved into one of the largest service centers in Brooklyn, north of 80 doors, beautiful yard, gives us much more capacity. If you look at a market like Nashville, for example, we used to have a site in Southeast of Nashville, and every day we used to dispatch 30, 35 drivers North of Nashville for an hour each way to get to the customer pickup and delivery locations. Well, as soon as we opened up our Goodlettsville location north of Nashville, we relocated 35 of our drivers to that new location. And now we can cover that market with 10 to 15 minutes' drive times to get to the customer locations. So all of these service centers we opened up so far been on track, on time, either meeting or exceeding our expectation on cost efficiencies. And where we've opened them up, we've seen just in linehaul alone, 2 to 3 points of productivity pickup associated with the more space that we have with these service centers. So the execution has been very well -- going very well, and that we expect that to continue here through the course of the year going into early next year.\nJoe Hafling: Great. Really impressive stuff. Thanks for the time and congrats on the quarter.\nMario Harik: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Tom Wadewitz from UBS. Please go ahead.\nTom Wadewitz: Hi, yes. Good morning, and yes, really strong results. Wanted to see, Mario, if you could give us any thoughts on what might cause deviation versus normal seasonality in 3Q. I think you tend to give us a somewhat conservative framework and consistently give good results. What do you think might help you to do better than that 100 to 150 in deterioration sequentially in OR. And then just a broader question as well. I think there have been concerns about pricing environment, given the soft backdrop, and that there might be some kind of wrinkles and a little bit of increase in competition. And just wanted to get your thoughts on whether you're seeing that at all or whether you're just kind of seeing continued very stable, very favorable pricing backdrop. Thank you.\nMario Harik: Thanks, Tom. First off, to clarify, in the third quarter, it would be in line with seasonality, but when you exclude the outlier quarters of COVID or the Yellow bankruptcy, we are meaningfully doing better than seasonality on OR sequential changes from Q2 into Q3. But this said, when you look at what could allow us to outperform the high end of the range of the 150 to 250 full year guide, a lot of it would be based on, one, what happens in the -- from a macro perspective, we're not assuming any improvement. We're assuming a stable macro, but no pickup in demand in the back half of the year. So obviously, if you see stronger demand, that could lead to better results. There are also a lot of idiosyncratic things that we are executing on, when it comes to, for example, in-sourcing third-party linehaul, if we execute faster than we expect, the cost flow through there would be beneficial. Similarly, when it comes to some of the new services we're launching, with the premium services we're launching, we currently have a great pipeline, we're converting that pipeline. If that goes ahead of plan, we can see upside as well. So there are many of these initiatives that we're doing, if we see upside in them, we expect to do better than where we are currently landing for the full year. Now, when you take a step back and you think about the pricing environment, we're still seeing a very favorable pricing environment in our industry. You look at our yield numbers. As Ali mentioned earlier, we expect acceleration on the two-year stack, a sequential acceleration as well on year -- on yield. Our contract renewals were call it 8% in the second quarter. We expect to be in the same and the same ballpark in the third quarter as well. We continue to see a good environment out there, especially if you're providing the great service product that we are, that is the biggest driver for being able to drive those meaningful yield improvements. And we're seeing that materialize in our business.\nTom Wadewitz: So, okay. So you're really not seeing a change in the competitive dynamic?\nMario Harik: No, we're not seeing it in terms of overall industry.\nTom Wadewitz: Okay, great. Thanks for the time.\nMario Harik: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Brian Ossenbeck from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\nBrian Ossenbeck: All right. Thanks. Good morning. So Mario, you said you're still in the early innings of the yield story at XPO, renewing at high-single-digits. Now I wanted to see what your confidence, what you think is driving that in the future as you look into next year. And then maybe Kyle or Ali, you can give us a little bit more clarity details behind the different cost buckets that are getting you to that OR progression, whether its labor productivity, additional linehaul, insurance, was a decent improvement here in the quarter. So anything more specific on those separate buckets behind the OR would be helpful.\nMario Harik: Yes. I'll start first with the contract renewal and what gives us confidence in pricing. So we expect to outperform the market from a yield growth perspective, but we're obviously not immune to the macro. If things change from an underlying demand perspective that could change the environment. And if things pick up, you would see massive yields improvement in our business. But there are three reasons for that. Number one starts with service. The service improvements we're doing for our -- we're making for our customers are drastic. I mean, if you think about where we were two years ago to where we are now, and we hear it from our customers all the time, when they see the level of support we're giving them, the focus on picking up on time, delivering on time, delivering damage free every single time, that this customer again want to give you profitable market share and they understand that we're going to charge a price for that. The second area is around the premium services. That's a big opportunity for us. As I mentioned earlier on, we want to go call it from the low-double-digit, low-teens accessorial as a percent of revenue to the mid-teens. And that's another opportunity. As we continue to rollout these premium services and build a pipeline, and that pipeline converts, we're going to see more profitable freight in that segment. And then finally, on the local channels we've onboarded all the local, the incremental local sellers we've wanted to add since last year. And now, as these local sellers ramp and their contributions become -- continues to build, we're going to see higher growth in that channel, which comes at a higher yield and a higher margin as well. So these are the three levers that we look at in terms of that yield improvement.\nKyle Wismans: And then from a cost standpoint, Brian, if you think about salary, wage and benefits, labor being our largest cost element. In terms of headcount for Q3, we think we're going to be up less than our shipment growth sequentially. We would expect shipments per day in the third quarter to be up modestly, but we're going to do what we did in Q2, when we were up sequentially 4% on shipments and headcount was actually down. So I think when you think about that cost area, which is our largest, you think you're probably up mid-single-digit quarter-on-quarter. And then probably the second area I'd point to is linehaul in-sourcing. We're going to continue to in-source more linehaul. You saw purchased transportation down 22% in the second quarter. I'd expect that improvement to continue and accelerate in the third quarter.\nBrian Ossenbeck: And anything in particular on insurance, is that just lumpy from quarter-to-quarter?\nKyle Wismans: From a Q2 perspective, we think insurance is going to be fairly consistent when you think sequentially.\nOperator: The next question is from Bruce Chan from Stifel. Please go ahead.\nBruce Chan: Yes. Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Maybe just to follow-up, Ali, on those comments around the PT reductions accelerating in the back half. Really nice to see that. I think especially in a world with cheap spot and soft demand here, can you maybe just remind us of what your target is for that outsourced linehaul percentage this year and long-term, and then maybe help us think through any market factors that would influence the pace of reductions, whether up or down?\nAli Faghri: Sure, Bruce. So when you think about our progress that we made in the second quarter, we were able to bring our third-party linehaul miles as a percentage of total down to sub-16%. They came in at 15.9%, which was a company record for us, and improved by nearly 500 basis points on a year-over-year basis. Now, our goal is to get that number down to the low-teens by 2027. However, given the progress that we've made so far over the last several quarters, we would expect it to get there much quicker and our goal would be to continue in-sourcing even beyond that into the single-digit. More recently, we have been rolling out initiatives to accelerate that pace of in-sourcing, specifically team drivers and sleeper cab trucks. We'd expect to have a few hundred of these teams in our fleet by the end of the year, and that's going to allow us to accelerate that pace of in-sourcing even beyond what you've seen us deliver over the last several quarters. In terms of the market factors influencing the pace of in-sourcing, we have a lot of confidence that we can deliver the continued insourcing in any macro environment. Our expectation is that as we move into the second half of the year, and into 2025, you're going to continue to see both linehaul miles as a percentage of total, as well as our purchased transportation expense on the P&L continue to move lower.\nBruce Chan: Great. That's very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks, everyone. Mario, you said earlier that you're seeing outsized growth in small local channel, mom-and-pop business versus national account. Can you unpack that a little bit more? Because I thought that maybe 12, 15 months ago, kind of you had onboarded a couple of large national accounts as well. How is that mix shifting? What is the actual kind of mix difference between the local channel and the enterprise channel? And also usually in up cycles, which part of the business kind of accelerates faster, the national networks or the local networks?\nMario Harik: Thanks, Ravi. When you look at our local channel, so the shipment growth in that channel here over the last quarter was above 9%. Compare that to the overall network, has grown it's almost double the rate of growth for the rest of the network. So we're seeing meaningful progress in terms of getting more of those stickier relationships with local accounts. And the reason why that's really good business, again, it's a higher yielding business, but you also have a great local relationship with that customer that can grow with you over time as they grow their business. Now, in terms of how they react to a macro environment, they are about the same, I mean, what you typically see with the local accounts is that any software macro, the weight per shipment in that channel goes down higher than any strong macro compared to the national or the larger accounts, because usually larger accounts that use TMS systems to optimize how they're moving the freight. From a local perspective, you can imagine if you had a local manufacturer as an example, they might be shipping typically 2,000 pounds in a pallet in a strong economy, and in a soft economy that might be shipping less product; it could be 1,000 pounds a pallet. So it depends on the economy impacts weight per shipment more on the local channel. But we do expect in a cycle recovery both to grow meaningfully and be tailwinds, especially on the local side for tonnage and ultimately margins as well.\nRavi Shanker: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Jason Seidl from TD Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.\nJason Seidl: Thank you, operator. Mario, you still talked a little bit about a sluggish backdrop, but some others have noted some green shoots along the way. I was wondering if you can give us a little bit more color about the demand function and what your customers are telling you what to expect in the back half of the year. And then just looking also for a clarification, the 8% renewal rate, what percent of the overall business did that cover?\nMario Harik: Yes. I'll start first and I'll turn it over to Kyle for the renewal side. But in terms of the backdrop, Jason, we're seeing again stable macro but soft demand, a continuous soft demand. So what we're hearing from customers, we usually survey our large customers every quarter and this time for the back half of the year, about half of them said they expect things to be flattish in the back half and the other half was split equally between folks who expected some pickup versus folks who were expecting a bit of decline as well. So on a net-net basis; we are expecting a flattish type demand environment in the back half of the year. Now in terms of green shoots, there are certain scenarios. So if you look at the retail side, the fact that retailers are largely done with destocking and their inventories are in a good place. You could see with easier comps compared to last year, peakseason be slightly stronger on the retail side. And same thing on the industrial side, we are seeing some subsectors where potentially could see strength heading into the back half of the year as well. But I think currently we're not seeing a lot of green shoots that are showing a meaningful inflection point of demand, but we'll see where things go from here. I do think that the Fed lowering rates could stimulate both consumer confidence increasing retail and stimulate spending on the industrial side as well. But we'll see what that materializes like in the fourth quarter.\nKyle Wismans: And then Jason from the renewal standpoint -- sorry, Jason, from the 8% that covers about a quarter of our contractual book, and just a little more color on renewals, renewals have been strong now for four consecutive quarters in that high-single-digit range. Our expectation for Q3, we should come in at a similar range we've seen so far in the first half.\nJason Seidl: Perfect. Appreciate the time, guys.\nMario Harik: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Jordan Alliger from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJordan Alliger: Yes. Hi, morning. Just obviously done a real good job with LTL 2.0. I'm just curious, longer-term over the next several years; you're several quarters into this, if not more, at this point, new terminal openings. How do you think about the benefits you've derived? And when we get back to better demand footing, manufacturing and otherwise, can you maybe talk to what you're thinking in terms of incremental margin potential over the next several years? Thanks.\nMario Harik: If you take a step back, in terms of where we are now, first in the overall demand environment, if you look in our industry at all the publicly traded LTL carriers, shipment count is down from 2021 to 2023 by roughly about 12%. Now, a lot of times I hear the feedback that this was the post-COVID run up in 2021. But in LTL specifically, 2021 was softer than pre-COVID. So when you compare 2018, 2019 to 2023 as a full year, shipment count in our industry was down in the mid-teens. And this is an industry that has historically grown in the low to mid-single-digit range commensurate with the IP, a bit higher than the IP. So when you think of the cycle inflection, that's going to be a massive tailwind both in terms of tonnage and volumes and in terms of pricing as well, because you won't have enough capacity in our industry. Now, you see a lot of those capacity additions, but Yellow was about 10% of the industry capacity and only half of that capacity is coming back into the market by next year. So the next cycle is shaping up to be a very strong cycle for LTLs across the board. Now, when you think about our execution, we've been able to execute very well on the plan and we're going to continue to execute very well on the plan. And you look over the last three quarters, we've delivered nearly 400 basis points of OR improvement quarter-after-quarter. And you look at the next cycle; we expect also very strong performance over the years to come. Now, in terms of incremental margins, we do expect them to change depending on what quarter it is and how much of the revenue growth is coming from yield versus volume and how well we do on the cost side. But just to give you an example, given the third quarter, we are expecting incremental margin more than 60% in what is a very soft freight environment. So again, we see massive upside here, and we're going to get to the low-80s from an OR perspective. Then we're going to get to the 70s and go from there. So that's how we think about the trajectory we're going to be on over the years to come.\nJordan Alliger: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question is from Eric Morgan from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nEric Morgan: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask on CapEx, your average fleet age is down to four years. I think in the past you mentioned a target of four to five years. Maybe you could just clarify that. And then just given the fleet age, just wondering, next year you would expect to come back into that 8% to 12% range and maybe what some of the priorities might be. I know it's kind of early, but just given that the fleet's in better shape at this point.\nKyle Wismans: Yes, Eric. So long-term target on fleet age is still 4.5 years. And when you think about CapEx this year as a percent of revenue, from an LTL standpoint, we're looking around 13%. I think next year you're going to normalize and come down. So certainly as we bring the Yellow service centers online, that'll help us reduce that number a bit. And then when you think about some of the in-sourcing efforts as those slow a bit as we get through our goals there, that'll help reduce the number as well. So I think you're probably down a point or two when you think on a percent of revenue basis. From a prioritization standpoint, when you think about our CapEx, obviously the majority across the company goes to LTL. And then within LTL, we'll prioritize continued fleet investments and then continued investments in real estate.\nEric Morgan: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Kevin Gainey from Thompson Davis & Company. Please go ahead.\nKevin Gainey: Hey gentlemen, good morning. Congrats on the great quarter. Maybe to take a different approach here. I was wondering if we could maybe talk through some of the kind of internal initiatives that you guys have done from a wage perspective in employee management. And I know Mario; previously you talked about like employee satisfaction and stuff like that. How is that affecting like retention, labor, outlooks and as the other point, maybe if you could breakout kind of the bonus compensation or at least percentage wise, maybe of what salaries and wages was for the quarter.\nMario Harik: So starting with wages, our goal is to always make sure that our employees are very well compensated. And we have given above-market wage increases here this year that were effective at the beginning of the second quarter, which were in the mid-single-digit territory for our employees, for dockworker, drivers, et cetera. And in terms of employee satisfaction, if I think about the foundation of our plan, of our strategy, a lot of it goes back to two foundational elements. One is around customers and making sure we are providing the best customer satisfaction possible. And the second one is around making sure that we have the most satisfied employees in the industry, that they know we support them. We listen to them, whether it's myself or Dave or our operators in the field or Tim and Tony or Kyle, the whole company, we spend a lot of time in the field where we are in service centers, sitting in break rooms, talking to drivers, talking to dockworkers, because they are the folks who keep the freight moving for our customers. And we take that very seriously. Now, over the last two years, our employee satisfaction has gone up in a similar trajectory as we've seen our customer satisfaction in our service improvement. And it's been hitting company records quarter-after-quarter. And we're very proud of the progress we're making in overall employee engagement across the board. In terms of incentive compensation, the way we look at it, it's based on a combination of things, depending on where you are in the business, but it's a combination of OR improvement, a combination of revenue growth, and a combination of service improvements and hitting thresholds. And we also have localized incentive plans. We call it the Gladiator program, that whenever a service center hits a stretch goal of improving quality of reducing damages, we give monthly incentive and we do a whole cookout for all the employees at the location to celebrate the fact that we're taking care very well of customers freight. So that's another foundational element of our strategy that we usually don't talk about it. We're very proud of the progress we're making there as well.\nKevin Gainey: Appreciate the color.\nMario Harik: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mario Harik for closing comments.\nMario Harik: Thank you, operator, and thanks all for joining us today. We're continuing to move forward from a position of strength following a strong first half of the year, and we'll be sharing more progress with you each quarter. Operator, you can now end the call. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Kyle Wismans",
            "content": "Thank you, Mario, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through our key financial results, balance sheet, and liquidity. We reported a strong second quarter across the company with revenue up 9% year-over-year to $2.1 billion. This includes top-line growth of 12% in our LTL segment and 4% growth in Europe. Excluding fuel, our LTL revenue was up 13% year-over-year. As we took on more business in LTL, we also improved our labor productivity. From the first to second quarter, we reduced our headcount sequentially, while our shipments per day increased by 4%. This helped to mitigate the cost of salaries, wages, and benefits, which in total were 11.5% higher in the quarter than a year ago. This primarily reflects wage and benefit inflation as well as incentive compensation aligned with the segment's strong second quarter performance. We were also more cost efficient with purchased transportation, primarily due to our in-sourcing initiative. Our expense for third-party carriers was down year-over-year by 22%, which equates to a $19 million savings in the quarter. Additionally, we continue to improve our maintenance costs, with our cost per mile down 12% year-over-year. Depreciation expense increased by 24% year-over-year or $15 million, reflecting the investments we're making in the business. This continues to be our top priority for capital allocation in LTL. Our second quarter CapEx was primarily allocated to purchase tractors from the OEMs and manufacture more trailers in-house. Next, I'll add some detail to adjusted EBITDA starting with the company as a whole. We generated adjusted EBITDA of $343 million in the quarter, up 41% from a year ago. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 16.5%, which was a year-over-year improvement of 380 basis points. This was supported by margin improvement in both segments and the continued rationalization of our corporate cost structure. In the second quarter, our corporate net expense was $3 million for a year-over-year savings of 70%. Looking at just the LTL segment, we grew adjusted operating income by 51% year-over-year to $214 million, and we grew adjusted EBITDA by 43% to $297 million. This reflects the combined impacts of our pricing gains, cost efficiencies, and the increase in volume. In our European Transportation segment, adjusted operating income was $19 million, which was a 6% increase from the prior year, and we grew adjusted EBITDA by 7% to $49 million. Returning to the company as a whole, we reported operating income of $197 million for the quarter, up 84% year-over-year, and we grew net income from continuing operations by 384% to $150 million, representing diluted earnings per share of $1.25. The increase in net income from continuing operations includes a one-time tax benefit of $41 million related to the reorganization of our legal entities in Europe. We expect to receive a net cash refund of approximately $45 million in 2025. Note that we excluded the tax benefit from adjusted net income in our second quarter reporting. On an adjusted basis, EPS increased by 58% year-over-year to $1.12. Lastly, we generated $210 million of cash flow from operating activities in the quarter and deployed $184 million of net CapEx. Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $250 million of cash on hand. Combined with available capacity under our committed borrowing facility, this gave us $836 million of liquidity. We had no borrowings outstanding under our ABL facility at quarter end. Our net debt leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.7x trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. This was an improvement from 2.9x at the end of the first quarter and we expect to further reduce our leverage in the second half of the year. The ongoing investments we're making are enhancing our earnings growth trajectory and will support our long-term goal of achieving an investment grade profile. Now, I'll turn it over to Ali who will cover our operating results. Hey Scott, it's Kyle. So when you think about 2024, we think it's going to be a strong year of margin improvement. Initially, we thought the year would be in the 150 basis point to 250 basis point range for the year of improvement, and we expect to land towards the high end of that range. And that's given the momentum we've seen so far in the first half, and assuming a stable macro in the back half of the year. A \u2013 Mario Harik And so for 2025, we expect a strong year in 2025 for OR improvement and earnings growth as well. Now, obviously, we're not immune to the macro. Macro would be the biggest swing factor there, but we expect a very strong year. And if you take a step back, we are driving above-market yield growth, and that's driven by the continuous service improvements that we are doing across the network, and that's translating into us gaining profitable market share. And customers want to give us more business, and we're driving higher yields. And they know that for us to provide this great service, we got to invest in our business. We're also making contributions from premium services and the growth of the local channel or the local account. When you look at premium services, we already launched a good number of them here through the course of the year, between retail store rollouts or retail solutions to tradeshows, to cross border in Mexico, expanding the service. And we're continuing to make great progress on in-sourcing. You saw here our results in the quarter. We got to a record level of in-sourcing of 15.9%, and we're ahead of our plan to get to the low-double-digit low-teens, and we expect to continue to accelerate that. And ultimately, we're opening up the new service centers, and these are contributing to cost efficiencies in the near-term. But as the cycle starts inflecting, at some point, they're going to give us more capacity as well. And they will be both OR accretive and EPS accretive in 2025. So overall, we expect a strong year, and we'll talk more about 2025 expectations as we report the fourth quarter results this year. Hey, Scott, it's Kyle. So the renewals in the quarter were up 8%. You bet. Thank you. And then from a cost standpoint, Brian, if you think about salary, wage and benefits, labor being our largest cost element. In terms of headcount for Q3, we think we're going to be up less than our shipment growth sequentially. We would expect shipments per day in the third quarter to be up modestly, but we're going to do what we did in Q2, when we were up sequentially 4% on shipments and headcount was actually down. So I think when you think about that cost area, which is our largest, you think you're probably up mid-single-digit quarter-on-quarter. And then probably the second area I'd point to is linehaul in-sourcing. We're going to continue to in-source more linehaul. You saw purchased transportation down 22% in the second quarter. I'd expect that improvement to continue and accelerate in the third quarter. From a Q2 perspective, we think insurance is going to be fairly consistent when you think sequentially. And then Jason from the renewal standpoint -- sorry, Jason, from the 8% that covers about a quarter of our contractual book, and just a little more color on renewals, renewals have been strong now for four consecutive quarters in that high-single-digit range. Our expectation for Q3, we should come in at a similar range we've seen so far in the first half. Yes, Eric. So long-term target on fleet age is still 4.5 years. And when you think about CapEx this year as a percent of revenue, from an LTL standpoint, we're looking around 13%. I think next year you're going to normalize and come down. So certainly as we bring the Yellow service centers online, that'll help us reduce that number a bit. And then when you think about some of the in-sourcing efforts as those slow a bit as we get through our goals there, that'll help reduce the number as well. So I think you're probably down a point or two when you think on a percent of revenue basis. From a prioritization standpoint, when you think about our CapEx, obviously the majority across the company goes to LTL. And then within LTL, we'll prioritize continued fleet investments and then continued investments in real estate."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Mario Harik",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call. I'm here in Greenwich with Kyle Wismans, our Chief Financial Officer; and Ali Faghri, our Chief Strategy Officer. This morning, we reported a strong second quarter for both revenue and earnings in a soft market for freight transportation. Company-wide, we grew revenue year-over-year by 9% to $2.1 billion. And we increased our adjusted EBITDA by 41% to $343 million. Adjusted diluted EPS was 58% higher year-over-year at $1.12. I'll start with the strategy that's driving our above market earnings growth and margin expansion. There are four pillars to LTL 2.0. First is to provide world class service. This revolves around the service metrics that are most important to our customers. In the second quarter, we improved one of the most important metrics damage claims ratio to a company record of 0.2%. This compares with 0.3% in the first quarter and 0.7% last year. Since late 2021, when we started LTL 2.0, we've driven more than a 75% reduction in damage frequency. We also improved our on-time performance on a year-over-year basis for the 9th consecutive quarter. We already have one of the industry's fastest networks of one and two-day lanes, and when coupled with our strong on-time performance, this is a key differentiator for our customers. We achieved these improvements while handling higher volume across our network by prioritizing both operational excellence and network investments. Specifically, we have two major levers with long runway to improve our service. One is the opening of 28 new service centers and the other is our in-sourcing of purchased transportation. In addition, we're constantly implementing a number of shorter-term initiatives. For example, we now have freight airbag systems installed in over 95% of our service centers. We're seeing a strong return on this investment through a reduction in damage claims. The second pillar is to invest in network capacity. Over the past three years, we've added nearly 14,000 trailers and more than 4,000 tractors to our fleet. This is a high return use of capital that allows us in-source linehaul transportation, drive operational efficiencies, and improve customer service levels. So far this year, we've added over 1,900 new tractors bringing down the average age to four years from five years at the end of 2023. These new tractors are more efficient to operate, resulting in a double-digit decline in our fleet maintenance costs in the second quarter. We've also manufactured over 2,600 trailers year-to-date at our in-house production facility in Arkansas. As the only U.S. freight transportation company to produce its own trailers, we can create capacity when our customers need it and at a lower cost. In addition, we're continuing to rollout the 28 service centers we acquired in December. We've opened 14 so far and expect to open another 10 in the back half of the year. The last four will be operational by early 2025, on track with our plan. These sites are in fast growing freight markets. Each new center will help us operate more efficiency in the near-term while giving us more capacity when the cycle recovers. Our larger footprint also reduces freight rehandling and brings us closer to our customers. And as our network continues to expand, the benefits of service will grow. Our third area of focus is yield, which is our single biggest opportunity for margin improvement. We've been reporting strong yield growth and we're still in the early innings. In the second quarter, we grew yield excluding fuel by 9% year-over-year, which helped us deliver 440 basis points of adjusted operating ratio improvement. We had three distinct levers for yield improvement. We're aligning our price with the value we deliver; we're growing our accessorials business; and we're expanding our local customer base. In the second quarter, our contract renewal pricing increased year-over-year by high single-digit for the fourth consecutive quarter, driven by the service improvements we're making. And accessorials generated double-digit revenue growth in the quarter. We're rolling out premium services that our customers are asking for, like our expanded trade show service recently opened a new service center in Las Vegas and we're already seeing strong customer demand for this offering. For our industrial base, we launched an expanded cross border service called Mexico+ that adds more capacity and border crossing points. This supports our customers who are shifting production to North America from overseas. We're also continuing to earn more market share from our local customer base, which is a higher margin business. In the second quarter, we increased shipments from local customers by over 9% compared with a year ago. The final pillar of our strategy is cost efficiency. The opportunities here are in purchased transportation, variable costs, and overhead. In the second quarter, we reduced our purchased transportation cost by 22% year-over-year through a combination of in-sourcing linehaul and paying lower contract rates to third-party carriers. We ended the quarter with 15.9% of linehaul miles outsourced to third-parties, which was a reduction of 490 basis points year-over-year. This is the lowest level outsourced in our company's history, and we expect to accelerate the pace as we move forward. When we transport the freight ourselves, we have more quality control and more flexibility. Our drivers and service centers can move freight faster with less rehandling, which reduces damages. We also get better utilization of our trailers by redeploying them at their destination. We expect to have a few hundred driver teams in sleeper cab trucks on the road by year-end to support more in-sourcing. Lastly, we're continuing to manage labor costs effectively in our operations. This is a direct result of the team's execution, as well as our proprietary technology for labor planning. The second quarter was our sixth straight quarterly improvement in labor productivity. Turning to Europe. Our business continued to outperform the industry in a soft macro. On a year-over-year basis, we increased segment revenue by 4%. We also delivered the highest quarterly EBITDA since 2019, with year-over-year growth of 7%, driven by a combination of top-line growth and disciplined cost control. Our strongest EBITDA growth was in the UK and France. In the UK, the increase was in the high teens and in France, it was in the high-single-digits. In summary, our strong results in the first half of the year demonstrate the disciplined progress we're making with the many initiatives we put in place. Importantly, we're delivering record service levels with a direct connection between service and profitability. This dynamic is at the core of our strategy. It enables us to outpace the market with yield growth and profitable market share gains, while operating more cost efficiently at scale. We're also continuing to invest capital where it can sustain high returns over time. These are all inherent strengths of our company that we'll use to improve the business in any environment. Together with our operating momentum, they create a powerful foundation for future growth. Now, I'm going to hand the call over to Kyle to discuss the financial results. Kyle, over to you. You got it Ken. This is Mario. First, I'll start with the market. So we're continuing to see a soft freight market, but it's stable. If you look at the month of June, the ISM was in the high-40s at 48, 49. And the industrial demand was relatively stable. It did pick up a bit from the month of May and then underlying demand on the industrial side. But again, not major growth there. On the retail side, retail sales came in better and we did see the retail sector also hold up and increase a bit as well. But sequentially, we did see a pickup in the month of June compared to where we were in May. Now, if you take a step back on the quarter and July starting there on tonnage for us, July tonnage is about flattish, which outperforms seasonality by one to two points. And we expect a similar outperformance for the third quarter as a whole. Now, when we look at seasonality, we do exclude the impact of COVID since if you recall, Q2 to Q3 back then was a big upswing with the decline in Q2. And similarly, when you look at Yellow last year, it was outside of seasonal norms. So if you apply seasonality, it would imply tonnage in the third quarter to be down low-single-digits. And we expect to do better than that, where we expect to be flattish on tonnage for the third quarter as a whole. Now, the other moving part for OR going to your question on margin is on the yield front. And we expect a strong quarter for yield ex-fuel. As our initiatives continue to gain traction, we expect to be in the mid to high-single-digit range on a year-on-year improvement for yield. Even as we lap the tougher comps, weight per shipment could be a swing factor. We've seen that improve here through the course of the year for us. And it does imply an acceleration on a two-year stack for yield Q3 versus the first half. And it does imply a sequential increase on absolute dollar basis from Q2 going to Q3 as well. Ultimately, from an OR perspective, we also expect a strong quarter for margin improvement. We expect OR to increase sequentially by 100 basis points to 150 basis points, which is in line with seasonality. But similar to my comments on volume, if you do exclude the outlier quarters with COVID and the Yellow bankruptcy, typical seasonality is 200 to 250 deterioration and we expect to do much better than that, driven by volume, yield growth, and all the cost efficiencies we're implementing. You bet. Yes, you got it. So when you look at it, the difference on accessorial revenue as a percent of total from where we are today and where we want to be, where best in class is, there's roughly a 5 points difference. So we have grown this last quarter accessorial revenue double-digit on a year-on-year basis, and we are making inroads towards getting to that 15%. Currently, we're still in the, call it low-double-digit, low-teens territory. And we believe that overall, over the years to come, if we gain an incremental point of yield from accessorials over the next, call it three, four, five years, that would be a good cadence for us in terms of how we realize that. In terms of the services themselves, as you know, then whenever you launch a new service, a new product, you build the pipeline; you have to always train your sellers and you start building that pipeline over time. And we're seeing a lot of great traction. There's still roughly call it about three or four services we want to be launching over the course of the next year that we're currently working on. But we already have made really great progress on launching some of these services, like I mentioned trade shows or retail store rollouts or retail solutions, and many of these other services. This is how we think about it. You bet. Thank you. Thanks, Fadi. If you take a step back in our industry, customers want great service. And the reason why they want that is because that avoids disruptions in their supply chain and how they move a product from their locations to their customers' locations. And as you said, we've made tremendous progress on that over the last two years, we've reduced our damage claims ratio from 1.2% to a new company record here of 0.2%. And our customers see that even we -- in our new service centers, we put a slogan that says, we love our customers with three hearts next to it. And when you -- this is the relationship with building with the customers, they want to give you more freight; they want to give you more profitable freight. So in terms of the impact on the mix, we are being disciplined in terms of what we're taking on. So if we see a skid or a pallet that is non-conforming in size, doesn't fit well in an LTL network, if we see a freight that is not operating at a desirable margin for whatever reason, whether it's a customer who's not willing to pay a premium price, then we are turning away that freight or we are pricing it accordingly. And if we see a customer who wants to grow with us, whose freight fits our network that operates at a good margin, we're onboarding that freight. So we are being selective in terms of the freight we are taking on while supporting our customers. And we're also growing, now in terms of mix, it's largely unchanged between the industrial side and the retail side. We're still same proportions. But where we are seeing faster growth is in the local channel. These are mom-and-pop shops. We have now 25% more sellers in our ranks, and we're being able to gain more profitable market share in that channel. So far year-to-date, we've added more than 5,000 new customers in that channel. And we believe that that's going to grow with us here over the years to come. Thank you. Hey Joe, this is Mario. So when you think of the openings that we are doing so far, we opened up 14 service centers out of the 28 that we acquired. And out of the mix of these service centers, six of them are net adds. So these are markets where we are adding an incremental terminal and eight are relocations where we went from a smaller service center to a larger service center. Now, keep in mind that we already have a network that covers all zip codes in North America. So for us, the openings are about adding capacity, but in the near-term, it's about gaining efficiency and improving service as well. So when you think of the first tier of service centers that we've opened up, we've only added 50 net headcount to support these openings. And compare that to, we have 23,000 people. So it has almost no impact on cost. And the team has been executing very well on these openings. To give you an example, if you look at a market like Brooklyn, New York, we used to have 30, 40 doors in that market, small yards. We were tapped out on capacity. Now we moved into one of the largest service centers in Brooklyn, north of 80 doors, beautiful yard, gives us much more capacity. If you look at a market like Nashville, for example, we used to have a site in Southeast of Nashville, and every day we used to dispatch 30, 35 drivers North of Nashville for an hour each way to get to the customer pickup and delivery locations. Well, as soon as we opened up our Goodlettsville location north of Nashville, we relocated 35 of our drivers to that new location. And now we can cover that market with 10 to 15 minutes' drive times to get to the customer locations. So all of these service centers we opened up so far been on track, on time, either meeting or exceeding our expectation on cost efficiencies. And where we've opened them up, we've seen just in linehaul alone, 2 to 3 points of productivity pickup associated with the more space that we have with these service centers. So the execution has been very well -- going very well, and that we expect that to continue here through the course of the year going into early next year. Thank you. Thanks, Tom. First off, to clarify, in the third quarter, it would be in line with seasonality, but when you exclude the outlier quarters of COVID or the Yellow bankruptcy, we are meaningfully doing better than seasonality on OR sequential changes from Q2 into Q3. But this said, when you look at what could allow us to outperform the high end of the range of the 150 to 250 full year guide, a lot of it would be based on, one, what happens in the -- from a macro perspective, we're not assuming any improvement. We're assuming a stable macro, but no pickup in demand in the back half of the year. So obviously, if you see stronger demand, that could lead to better results. There are also a lot of idiosyncratic things that we are executing on, when it comes to, for example, in-sourcing third-party linehaul, if we execute faster than we expect, the cost flow through there would be beneficial. Similarly, when it comes to some of the new services we're launching, with the premium services we're launching, we currently have a great pipeline, we're converting that pipeline. If that goes ahead of plan, we can see upside as well. So there are many of these initiatives that we're doing, if we see upside in them, we expect to do better than where we are currently landing for the full year. Now, when you take a step back and you think about the pricing environment, we're still seeing a very favorable pricing environment in our industry. You look at our yield numbers. As Ali mentioned earlier, we expect acceleration on the two-year stack, a sequential acceleration as well on year -- on yield. Our contract renewals were call it 8% in the second quarter. We expect to be in the same and the same ballpark in the third quarter as well. We continue to see a good environment out there, especially if you're providing the great service product that we are, that is the biggest driver for being able to drive those meaningful yield improvements. And we're seeing that materialize in our business. No, we're not seeing it in terms of overall industry. Thank you. Yes. I'll start first with the contract renewal and what gives us confidence in pricing. So we expect to outperform the market from a yield growth perspective, but we're obviously not immune to the macro. If things change from an underlying demand perspective that could change the environment. And if things pick up, you would see massive yields improvement in our business. But there are three reasons for that. Number one starts with service. The service improvements we're doing for our -- we're making for our customers are drastic. I mean, if you think about where we were two years ago to where we are now, and we hear it from our customers all the time, when they see the level of support we're giving them, the focus on picking up on time, delivering on time, delivering damage free every single time, that this customer again want to give you profitable market share and they understand that we're going to charge a price for that. The second area is around the premium services. That's a big opportunity for us. As I mentioned earlier on, we want to go call it from the low-double-digit, low-teens accessorial as a percent of revenue to the mid-teens. And that's another opportunity. As we continue to rollout these premium services and build a pipeline, and that pipeline converts, we're going to see more profitable freight in that segment. And then finally, on the local channels we've onboarded all the local, the incremental local sellers we've wanted to add since last year. And now, as these local sellers ramp and their contributions become -- continues to build, we're going to see higher growth in that channel, which comes at a higher yield and a higher margin as well. So these are the three levers that we look at in terms of that yield improvement. Thanks, Ravi. When you look at our local channel, so the shipment growth in that channel here over the last quarter was above 9%. Compare that to the overall network, has grown it's almost double the rate of growth for the rest of the network. So we're seeing meaningful progress in terms of getting more of those stickier relationships with local accounts. And the reason why that's really good business, again, it's a higher yielding business, but you also have a great local relationship with that customer that can grow with you over time as they grow their business. Now, in terms of how they react to a macro environment, they are about the same, I mean, what you typically see with the local accounts is that any software macro, the weight per shipment in that channel goes down higher than any strong macro compared to the national or the larger accounts, because usually larger accounts that use TMS systems to optimize how they're moving the freight. From a local perspective, you can imagine if you had a local manufacturer as an example, they might be shipping typically 2,000 pounds in a pallet in a strong economy, and in a soft economy that might be shipping less product; it could be 1,000 pounds a pallet. So it depends on the economy impacts weight per shipment more on the local channel. But we do expect in a cycle recovery both to grow meaningfully and be tailwinds, especially on the local side for tonnage and ultimately margins as well. Yes. I'll start first and I'll turn it over to Kyle for the renewal side. But in terms of the backdrop, Jason, we're seeing again stable macro but soft demand, a continuous soft demand. So what we're hearing from customers, we usually survey our large customers every quarter and this time for the back half of the year, about half of them said they expect things to be flattish in the back half and the other half was split equally between folks who expected some pickup versus folks who were expecting a bit of decline as well. So on a net-net basis; we are expecting a flattish type demand environment in the back half of the year. Now in terms of green shoots, there are certain scenarios. So if you look at the retail side, the fact that retailers are largely done with destocking and their inventories are in a good place. You could see with easier comps compared to last year, peakseason be slightly stronger on the retail side. And same thing on the industrial side, we are seeing some subsectors where potentially could see strength heading into the back half of the year as well. But I think currently we're not seeing a lot of green shoots that are showing a meaningful inflection point of demand, but we'll see where things go from here. I do think that the Fed lowering rates could stimulate both consumer confidence increasing retail and stimulate spending on the industrial side as well. But we'll see what that materializes like in the fourth quarter. Thank you. If you take a step back, in terms of where we are now, first in the overall demand environment, if you look in our industry at all the publicly traded LTL carriers, shipment count is down from 2021 to 2023 by roughly about 12%. Now, a lot of times I hear the feedback that this was the post-COVID run up in 2021. But in LTL specifically, 2021 was softer than pre-COVID. So when you compare 2018, 2019 to 2023 as a full year, shipment count in our industry was down in the mid-teens. And this is an industry that has historically grown in the low to mid-single-digit range commensurate with the IP, a bit higher than the IP. So when you think of the cycle inflection, that's going to be a massive tailwind both in terms of tonnage and volumes and in terms of pricing as well, because you won't have enough capacity in our industry. Now, you see a lot of those capacity additions, but Yellow was about 10% of the industry capacity and only half of that capacity is coming back into the market by next year. So the next cycle is shaping up to be a very strong cycle for LTLs across the board. Now, when you think about our execution, we've been able to execute very well on the plan and we're going to continue to execute very well on the plan. And you look over the last three quarters, we've delivered nearly 400 basis points of OR improvement quarter-after-quarter. And you look at the next cycle; we expect also very strong performance over the years to come. Now, in terms of incremental margins, we do expect them to change depending on what quarter it is and how much of the revenue growth is coming from yield versus volume and how well we do on the cost side. But just to give you an example, given the third quarter, we are expecting incremental margin more than 60% in what is a very soft freight environment. So again, we see massive upside here, and we're going to get to the low-80s from an OR perspective. Then we're going to get to the 70s and go from there. So that's how we think about the trajectory we're going to be on over the years to come. So starting with wages, our goal is to always make sure that our employees are very well compensated. And we have given above-market wage increases here this year that were effective at the beginning of the second quarter, which were in the mid-single-digit territory for our employees, for dockworker, drivers, et cetera. And in terms of employee satisfaction, if I think about the foundation of our plan, of our strategy, a lot of it goes back to two foundational elements. One is around customers and making sure we are providing the best customer satisfaction possible. And the second one is around making sure that we have the most satisfied employees in the industry, that they know we support them. We listen to them, whether it's myself or Dave or our operators in the field or Tim and Tony or Kyle, the whole company, we spend a lot of time in the field where we are in service centers, sitting in break rooms, talking to drivers, talking to dockworkers, because they are the folks who keep the freight moving for our customers. And we take that very seriously. Now, over the last two years, our employee satisfaction has gone up in a similar trajectory as we've seen our customer satisfaction in our service improvement. And it's been hitting company records quarter-after-quarter. And we're very proud of the progress we're making in overall employee engagement across the board. In terms of incentive compensation, the way we look at it, it's based on a combination of things, depending on where you are in the business, but it's a combination of OR improvement, a combination of revenue growth, and a combination of service improvements and hitting thresholds. And we also have localized incentive plans. We call it the Gladiator program, that whenever a service center hits a stretch goal of improving quality of reducing damages, we give monthly incentive and we do a whole cookout for all the employees at the location to celebrate the fact that we're taking care very well of customers freight. So that's another foundational element of our strategy that we usually don't talk about it. We're very proud of the progress we're making there as well. Thank you. Thank you, operator, and thanks all for joining us today. We're continuing to move forward from a position of strength following a strong first half of the year, and we'll be sharing more progress with you each quarter. Operator, you can now end the call. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Kyle. I'll start with our LTL segment, which reported another quarter of profitable growth, reflecting strong execution by our operational teams. On a year-over-year basis, we increased our shipments per day by 4.5% in the quarter, led by more than 9% growth in our local sales channel. Notably, we grew tonnage per day by 3.4%, which is an acceleration from 2.6% in the first quarter. Our weight per shipment was down 1.1% with the year-over-year decline moderating from the prior quarter. This was our fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in weight per shipment. On a monthly basis, year-over-year, our April tonnage per day was up 3.1%, May was up 2.4%, and June was up 4.6%. Looking just at shipments per day, April was up 4.7%, May was up 3.8%, and June was up 4.9%. For July, we estimate tonnage and shipments per day to be about flat year-over-year with both trends outperforming seasonality. On a two-year stack basis, July shipments per day and tonnage per day meaningfully accelerated versus June. Our pricing trends remain strong as we continue to align our pricing with our service quality and premium offerings. For the second quarter, our contract renewal pricing was up year-over-year by 8%. We also delivered another quarter of above market yield growth. We grew yield excluding fuel by 9% compared with the prior year. While our improving weight per shipment was a modest mix headwind to yield, our revenue per shipment ex-fuel increased sequentially for the 6th consecutive quarter and was up 7.4% year-over-year. We expect to continue increasing both yield and revenue per shipment quarter-over-quarter in the back half of this year, reflecting ongoing momentum with our pricing initiatives. Turning to margin. We improved our second quarter adjusted operating ratio by 440 basis points to 83.2%. We've now delivered year-over-year margin expansion of around 400 basis points for three consecutive quarters. Sequentially, our adjusted OR improved by 250 basis points coming in at the high end of our guided range. Our robust margin performance was primarily driven by yield and volume growth bolstered by our cost initiatives and productivity gains. Moving to the European business. We improved volumes throughout the quarter with strong pricing that outpaced inflation. Our organic revenue growth in June was the highest year-to-date for the segment overall, and in the UK, an important market for us, organic revenue in June increased year-over-year by double-digits. Our sales pipeline has grown to a record $1.3 billion and the team continues to earn new business from blue chip customers, strengthening our position in key European geographies. Before we go to Q&A, I want to summarize the considerable progress we're making toward becoming the LTL service leader in North America. Our service metrics are at record levels and there is ample runway for further improvement. This is earning us profitable market share and above market yield growth. We're also optimizing our network with meaningful cost efficiencies, primarily through linehaul in-sourcing and labor productivity. And we just reported another strong quarter of revenue and earnings growth in a soft macro. We're confident that our strategy will drive significant margin expansion over the years to come. Now, we'll take your questions. Operator, please open the line for Q&A. Good morning, Chris. This is Ali. So when you think about the sites we're launching here, as we noted before, we would expect these service centers to be OR-neutral this year. As you move through the year, we're going to continue to ramp sites. We're going to have another 10 online by the end of the year, and then we'll open the remaining handful in early 2025. As these sites continue to mature, we would expect them to turn OR-accretive into 2025 and also EPS accretive as well. And everything we've seen so far from the 14 sites we've opened already confirm our view that as we get into 2025, these service centers are going to be contributing meaningfully from a bottom line perspective. Sure, Jon. So when you think about mix, the biggest factor for us has been weight per shipment. Now, weight per shipment was down about 1% on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter. If you just roll forward seasonality from what we saw in July, from a weight per shipments standpoint, through the rest of the quarter, we would expect weight per shipments in Q3 to be down in that 1% range year-over-year, similar to what we saw in the second quarter, and a similar decline also in Q4, as well as our baseline forecast. So overall, we would expect mix from a weight per shipment standpoint to be relatively stable in the second half of the year relative to what we saw in the second quarter. When you think about our revenue per shipment outlook, we do expect a strong year from a revenue per shipment standpoint. As I noted earlier, we would expect revenue per shipment to increase sequentially both in Q3, and in Q4, and also accelerate on a two-year stack basis as well in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year. And our ability to drive that sequential improvement in two-year stack acceleration really goes back to all of the company specific pricing initiatives that we're executing on that are allowing us to drive that above market growth. Sure, Bruce. So when you think about our progress that we made in the second quarter, we were able to bring our third-party linehaul miles as a percentage of total down to sub-16%. They came in at 15.9%, which was a company record for us, and improved by nearly 500 basis points on a year-over-year basis. Now, our goal is to get that number down to the low-teens by 2027. However, given the progress that we've made so far over the last several quarters, we would expect it to get there much quicker and our goal would be to continue in-sourcing even beyond that into the single-digit. More recently, we have been rolling out initiatives to accelerate that pace of in-sourcing, specifically team drivers and sleeper cab trucks. We'd expect to have a few hundred of these teams in our fleet by the end of the year, and that's going to allow us to accelerate that pace of in-sourcing even beyond what you've seen us deliver over the last several quarters. In terms of the market factors influencing the pace of in-sourcing, we have a lot of confidence that we can deliver the continued insourcing in any macro environment. Our expectation is that as we move into the second half of the year, and into 2025, you're going to continue to see both linehaul miles as a percentage of total, as well as our purchased transportation expense on the P&L continue to move lower."

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. \n Before the call begins, let me read a brief statement on behalf of the company regarding forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. During this call, the company will be making certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws, which, by their nature, involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. A discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in the company's SEC filings as well as in its earnings release. The forward-looking statements in the company's earnings release or made on this call are made only as of today, and the company has no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements, except to the extent required by law. \n During this call, the company also may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined under applicable SEC rules. Reconciliations of such non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are contained in the company's earnings release and the related financial tables or on its website. You can find a copy of the company's earnings release, which contains additional important information regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures in the Investors section of the company's website. \n I will now turn the call over to XPO's Chief Executive Officer, Mario Harik. Mr. Harik, you may begin. \nMario Harik: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call. I'm here in Greenwich with Kyle Wismans, our Chief Financial Officer; and Ali Faghri, our Chief Strategy Officer. \n This morning, we reported financial results that were well above expectations for revenue and earnings in a soft market for freight transportation. It was a strong first quarter for us company-wide, reflecting the momentum we carried into 2024. We grew revenue year-over-year by 6% to $2 billion, and we improved our adjusted EBITDA by 37% to $288 million. Adjusted diluted EPS was 45% higher year-over-year at $0.81. \n As you saw in our results, our LTL 2.0 plan is firing on all cylinders. I want to frame my comments this morning around the 4 pillars of our plan and the tremendous progress we're making. I'll start with the pillar that is most important to our growth and profitability, which is to provide world-class service to our customers. \n Our first quarter damage claims ratio continued to be among the best in the industry at a company record of 0.3%. This was an improvement from 0.7% last year and from 1.2% when we launched LTL 2.0 just over 2 years ago. The underlying driver of this improvement has been a reduction of more than 70% in damage frequency. \n Another key service metric is on-time performance, which has now improved on a year-over-year basis for 8 consecutive quarters. In short, we're delivering meaningful service improvements while moving more volume through our network, with a multiyear plan that balances operational excellence and investments in the network. This includes the freight airbag systems we introduced in the second half of last year. That equipment is now installed in 75% of our service centers, and we expect to complete the rollout by midyear. The sites that have the airbags are seeing an improvement in damage frequency of greater than 20%. \n We've also recently updated our trailer loading procedures, which will continue to enhance our service quality over time. And as we insource more miles from third-party carriers, we expect this to further reduce damages and improve on-time performance. We've made it clear to our customers and employees that service quality is our North Star, and we're well on our way to becoming the best-in-class LTL service provider. \n The second pillar of LTL 2.0 is to invest in our network. Our business has historically generated a high return on invested capital. Since the launch of LTL 2.0, we've added over 12,000 trailers and 4,000 tractors to our fleet. This has allowed us to operate more efficiently and maintain strong network fluidity while insourcing more linehaul transportation. \n Over 2/3 of our 2024 CapEx is allocated for fleet. We added nearly 1,600 tractors in the first quarter, which brought down our average tractor age to 4.2 years from 5 years at the end of 2023. The new tractors are more efficient to operate, resulting in an improvement in our fleet maintenance costs. \n We also manufactured nearly 1,300 trailers in the quarter, and we recently celebrated the 30th anniversary of our production facility in Arkansas. We are the only U.S. freight transportation company to manufacture its own trailers, which puts us in a unique position to create capacity when our customers need it, and we can do it with less capital. \n In terms of the 28 new service centers we acquired in December, we've now opened the first 6 on schedule in April, with another 6 planned for the second quarter. This is expanding our presence in growing freight markets like Nashville, Las Vegas and Houston. We plan to bring another dozen sites online by the end of this year and expect all 28 to be operational by early 2025. \n The third pillar of our plan is to drive above-market yield growth. Yield is our single biggest opportunity for margin improvement, and it's a highlight of our results this morning. We grew yield, excluding fuel, by 9.8% year-over-year, which helped us deliver nearly 400 basis points of adjusted operating ratio improvement. Even with the gains we've made, we still have a significant pricing opportunity that we can capture over time through 3 distinct levers: by improving our service, growing our accessorial business and expanding our local customer base. \n As we continue to improve our service, we're able to align our price with the value we deliver. This was reflected in our contract renewal pricing, where we achieved year-over-year growth in the high single digits for the third consecutive quarter. We also captured a double-digit increase in assessorial revenue as customers took advantage of our premium services. The fourth quarter rollout of our retail store offering went well, and we're developing a pipeline of customers, specifically for this premium service. In the first quarter, we introduced another new service called Must Arrive by Date, which is already gaining strong customer traction. And we're expanding our trade show and cross-border services with the support of our new service centers in Las Vegas and Nogales, Arizona. \n Lastly, we're continuing to have success in growing our local customer base. From a strategic perspective, local accounts are a higher-margin business for us, and we've expanded our local sales force to double down on this opportunity. In the first quarter, we earned 10% more shipment from local customers compared to the year ago. \n The final pillar of LTL 2.0 is cost efficiency, specifically, with purchase transportation, variable costs and overhead. In the first quarter, we reduced our purchased transportation cost by 21% year-over-year by covering more linehaul miles in-house while also paying lower contract rates for the miles we outsource. We ended the quarter with 18% of linehaul miles outsourced to third parties, which was a reduction of 370 basis points year-over-year. That puts us at the higher end of our target range for the 200 to 400 basis points improvement this year. \n We expect to accelerate the number of miles we bring in-house in 2024, which will give us greater efficiency, flexibility and quality control. This will be supported by our initiatives to add driver teams and sleeper cab trucks for long-distance hauls. We've onboarded over 100 of these teams, and we're targeting a few hundred sleeper trucks to be in operation by the end of this year. \n Lastly, as our volume growth continues to outpace our headcount growth, our variable labor cost creates an ongoing margin opportunity. We managed this effectively in the first quarter through the strong execution of our operational teams and our proprietary technology. \n Turning to Europe. Our business continued to perform well in a soft macro environment. We increased both revenue and adjusted EBITDA versus the prior year, supported by a strong pricing environment and a robust sales pipeline. Our strongest year-over-year growth rates and adjusted EBITDA were in France and the U.K., which are 2 key geographies for us. In France, the increase was in the mid-teens, and in the U.K., it was in the high single digits. Across the European business as a whole, our first quarter EBITDA was the highest it's been since the pandemic. \n In summary, we made significant progress in executing our strategy in the first quarter while continuing to make investments in long-term growth. Our service quality is at record levels. We're growing yield faster than the market, and we're driving cost efficiencies in areas that have the greatest impact on earnings. \n The initiatives we put in place are contributing to our strong operating momentum and cementing our foundation for future growth. We've come a long way on the LTL 2.0, and we're still in the early stages of unlocking our full potential. \n Now I'm going to hand the call over to Kyle to discuss the first quarter results. Kyle, over to you. \nKyle Wismans: Thank you, Mario, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through our key financial results, balance sheet and liquidity. \n It was a strong first quarter across the board. Revenue for the total company was $2 billion, up 6% year-over-year. This includes top line growth of 9% in our LTL segment and 1% in Europe. Our LTL revenue, excluding fuel, was up a robust 12% year-over-year. \n On the cost side in LTL, salary, wages and benefits were 10.5% higher in the quarter than a year ago. The increase primarily reflects weight and benefit inflation as well as incentive compensation aligned with the segment's strong first quarter performance. We mitigated these impacts by delivering our fifth straight quarterly increase in labor productivity on a year-over-year basis. Our labor hours per day increased by 3.5% in the quarter while our shipments per day increased by 4.7%. \n We were also more cost efficient with purchased transportation through a combination of insourcing and rate negotiation. Our expense for third-party carriers was down year-over-year by 21%, which equates to a $21 million savings in the quarter. \n Depreciation expense increased by 22% year-over-year or $13 million, reflecting the investments we're making in the business. This continues to be our top priority for capital allocation in LTL. Our first quarter CapEx was primarily allocated to purchasing new tractors from the OEMs and manufacturing more trailers in-house. \n Next, I'll add some detail to adjusted EBITDA, starting with the company as a whole. We generated adjusted EBITDA of $288 million in the quarter, which was up 37% from a year ago. Both our North American and European segments contributed to the increase. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 14.2%, representing a year-over-year improvement of 320 basis points company-wide. We also continued to rationalize our corporate cost structure. Our first quarter corporate net expense was $5 million for a year-over-year savings of 44%. \n Looking at just the LTL segment, we grew our adjusted operating income by 50% year-over-year to $175 million, and we grew adjusted EBITDA by 40% to $255 million. This reflects the combined impact of pricing gains, cost efficiencies and an increase in volume. \n In our European Transportation segment, adjusted EBITDA was $38 million for the quarter, up 3% over the prior year.  \n Company-wide, we reported operating income of $138 million for the quarter, up 138% year-over-year. And we grew net income from continuing operations by 294% to $67 million, representing diluted earnings per share of $0.56. On an adjusted basis, EPS increased by 45% year-over-year to $0.81. \n And lastly, we generated $145 million of cash flow from operating activities in the quarter and deployed $299 million of net CapEx. \n Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $229 million of cash on hand. Combined with available capacity under our committed borrowing facility, this gave us $793 million of liquidity. We had no borrowings outstanding under our ABL facility at quarter end. \n Our net debt leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.9x trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. This was an improvement from 3x at year-end 2023, and we expect to further reduce our leverage this year. \n The ongoing investments we're making are enhancing our earnings growth trajectory and will support our long-term goal of achieving an investment-grade profile. \n Now I'll turn it over to Ali, who will cover our operating results. \nAli-Ahmad Faghri: Thank you, Kyle. I'll start with our LTL segment, which reported another quarter of profitable growth with strong underlying trends. On a year-over-year basis, we increased our shipments per day by 4.7% in the quarter, led by 10% growth in our local sales channel. This resulted in growth in tonnage per day of 2.6%, and our weight per shipment was down 1.9%, which was less of a decline than the prior quarter. On a year-over-year basis, this was our third consecutive quarter of improvement in weight per shipment. \n On a monthly basis, the trends across our operating metrics were broadly positive. Our January tonnage per day was down 1.1% year-over-year, February was up 3.5%, and March was up 5.9%. Looking just at shipments per day, January was up 1.4% year-over-year, February was up 5.8%, and March was up 7.2%. In April, our preliminary tonnage per day was up 3.1% year-over-year while our shipment count was up 4.8%. On a 2-year stack basis, April shipments per day and tonnage per day accelerated versus the month of March. \n We also delivered another strong quarter of yield growth. We grew yield, excluding fuel, by a robust 9.8% compared with the prior year. While our improving weight per shipment was a modest mix headwind to yield, our revenue per shipment, ex fuel, accelerated for the third consecutive quarter to a year-over-year increase of 7.9%. Importantly, our underlying pricing trends are strong as we continue to align our pricing with the better service and value-added offerings we provide. Our contract renewal pricing was up 8% in the quarter compared with a year ago. \n Turning to margin. Our first quarter adjusted operating ratio was 85.7%, which was an improvement of 390 basis points year-over-year. We've now reported nearly 400 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion in each of 2 consecutive quarters, and the current quarter is tracking for an improvement at the same level or better. Our strong margin performance was primarily driven by yield growth and bolstered by our cost initiatives and productivity gains. Sequentially, our adjusted OR improved by 80 basis points, which outperformed our expectations. \n Moving to our European business. We delivered year-over-year revenue growth despite ongoing softness in the macro environment. As with the prior quarter, our strong pricing outpaced inflation. Volume improved month by month and turned positive on a year-over-year basis in March. We also grew adjusted EBITDA versus the prior year even with fewer working days, reflecting disciplined cost control. The team continues to execute well and earn new business from high-caliber customers. This momentum is reflected in our sales pipeline, which has expanded to nearly $1.2 billion. This should continue to strengthen our position in key European geographies. \n I'll close with a summary of our strong start to the year, which lays the foundation for the significant margin improvement we expect in 2024. As you heard from us this morning, we're continuing to deliver record service levels, providing more value to our customers and earning higher returns. Our service improvements, combined with the momentum of our accessorials offering, drove another quarter of strong yield growth. And we realized meaningful cost efficiencies through our linehaul insourcing initiatives and labor productivity gains. \n In summary, our strategy is working. We're delivering strong revenue and earnings growth, and we're still in the early stages of realizing our margin expansion opportunity. \n Now we'll take your questions. Operator, please open the line for Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. \nRavi Shanker: So Mario, you said that you are seeing some pretty good pricing momentum, and there's a lot more to come. How much of your order book is repriced already? And kind of what's the potential opportunity there as you kind of go through the year? \nMario Harik: Yes. Ravi, Mario. When we look at the overall contract renewals, so we were up in the high single digits in the first quarter. And usually, on average, we renew roughly around 1/4 of our contracts. And that performance for us was driven by all the service improvements that we are delivering for our customers that obviously, we were in a higher price because they don't want to see disruptions in their supply chain. And they also understand we're investing in our network to be able to provide that great service. \n Again, for us, it's been the third quarter of high single digits. And we have -- since the bankruptcy of Yellow, that would be -- we have another quarter of the book effectively to renegotiate here in the upcoming quarter as well. \nRavi Shanker: Got it. That's helpful. And maybe as a follow-up, I think you said 2Q OR, I think year-over-year improvement is similar. Can you just unpack that a little bit more? Kind of how do we think about the evolution through the months of 2Q? And kind of how much OR would improve versus seasonality? \nMario Harik: Yes, you got it, Ravi. And I'll actually give the color on the tonnage, yield and OR -- ultimately, OR outlook like we usually do. But on the tonnage side, for us, April was up 3% on a year-on-year basis, and shipment counts, we're up in the same ballpark as the first quarter as well. We do expect the second quarter to be up in a similar level. For us, April was actually better than seasonality compared to March. And we'll give another update here on the May tonnage early June mid-quarter. \n And on the yield side, as I said earlier, we do expect yields to be up on a year-on-year basis in a similar range as we had in the first quarter. April for us was also in a similar range. From a revenue per shipment perspective, we saw that accelerate from Q4 to Q1, and we expect, on a quarter-over-quarter on an absolute dollar basis, for that to further accelerate in the second quarter. \n And ultimately, from an OR perspective, we expect a strong quarter for margin improvement. Sequentially, we expect to be an improvement from Q1 to Q2 of 200 to 250 basis points going into the third quarter. That would put us, call it, in the low to mid-83% range for Q2, which implies more than 400 basis points of margin improvement on a year-on-year basis, which, we believe, will be a very, very good performance in this freight market. \nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. \nKen Hoexter: Great. That's great detail, and Mario, congrats and way to go. Just the talk about the growth of local sales and what that's meant. It seems like that had outsized growth compared to your national sales in the quarter, and it seems to be accelerating. Maybe talk about the pace that you expect that to continue because that's been an important driver for the pricing that you're talking about. \nMario Harik: Thanks, Ken. It is a big part of our strategy to grow local account business because, Ken, these are more sticky relationships we have with those customers. And they are supported with a local relationship with one of our sellers in a local market. So over the last 12 months, we increased the headcount in our local sales force by roughly around 25% over that period of time. And we're seeing great performance. Here, in the first quarter, shipment count was up 10% on a year-on-year basis. \n Just to give you a stat there, we've added more than 3,000 new buying accounts in that channel so far year-to-date. So it is a segment of growth for us. We're investing more in it. And when customers see our focus on service and taking care of them and taking care of their freight, we're seeing very good growth associated with that. \nKen Hoexter: Great. On the future growth, we've seen some volatility in some customers kind of taking on freight and losing it. Maybe talk about the demand environment in the backdrop here. We've had mixed signals. Our indicator seems to be improving in the backdrop. Any signs that you're seeing demand improve in the backdrop? \nMario Harik: We are seeing the freight markets continuing to be soft, Ken. The underlying demand from customer is soft. However, it's stable. It seems to be bouncing along the bottom from that perspective. Obviously, again, for us, April was better than seasonality, but a lot of that was based on our sales efforts, on our quality improvement. Our service improvements are enabling us to drive those gains. \n Now if you break it down between industrial and retail, you saw the ISM peak over 50 for the first time in March, but then it dropped back down to 49 here in April. So we're seeing the industrials be a bit more muted. And now when we talk about industrial customers, and we usually survey them on a quarterly basis, they do expect growth in the back half, but it seems to be muted growth. \n On the retail side, inventories are largely normalized at this point, and what our customers are telling us, they do expect, again, growth in the back end given -- in the back half given the easier comps, but it's still softer consumer demand as well. So again, the market seems to be on the softer side in terms of the underlying demand. But again, for us, it's about gaining more momentum in that local account segment, and as we deliver great service numbers, our customers are rewarding us with more freight. \nOperator: Our next question is coming from Daniel Imbro with Stephens. \nDaniel Imbro: I wanted to dig in to the cost side in a little bit more detail. Obviously, better performance on the OR here in the first quarter. And you mentioned bringing linehaul in in-house, 200 to 400 basis points this year. Where could that go in '25 and beyond? And then, Mario, on the variable cost side, what are the other levers that you and the team are targeting? So as we kind of execute on this initiative, what's the next leg of the cost takeout you see in the model? \nAli-Ahmad Faghri: Sure. Sure, Daniel. So when you think about linehaul insourcing, obviously, an important strategic initiative for us here in the first quarter, we were at about 18.1% miles that were outsourced to third parties. We improved that by 370 basis points on a year-over-year basis, also improved 150 basis points quarter-over-quarter. And that was at the higher end of our full year target range of improving by 200 to 400 basis points annually.\n In terms of our target, we've talked about cutting third-party linehaul miles in half by 2027 relative to where we were at year-end 2021. So that would get us to somewhere in that low-teens percent range as a percentage of total miles. That's not only going to be a cost benefit for us, but it's also going to help us with service as well. \n As we've talked about more recently, we've been rolling out initiatives to accelerate the pace of insourcing, specifically team drivers and sleeper cab trucks. We already have 100 of those teams onboarded. And we expect to have a few hundred of those teams in the fleet by the end of 2024, and that's going to allow us to drive efficiencies in our linehaul network but also accelerate that pace of insourcing. \nMario Harik: And in terms of -- Dan, Mario. In terms of variable cost levers, so Ali mentioned the insourcing of third-party linehaul, which that comes -- obviously, you saw it here in the first quarter, our PT costs were down over 20%. Now when you look at the other levers around variable labor costs, and the team has done a great job operationally managing labor, here in the first quarter, we had the fifth consecutive quarter of productivity improvement. If you look at the quarter, we -- our shipment count went up more than our headcount effectively in the first quarter. And that led to benefits, obviously, to the bottom line.\n Now a lot of that is driven again by operational execution in the field, and it's also driven by our proprietary technology that enables us to manage labor very effectively. So if you think through the quarters and years to come, these are 2 big levers for us. One is the continued reduction of PT costs. And then the second one is labor productivity. \nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Fadi Chamoun with BMO Capital Markets. \nFadi Chamoun: Congrats on strong results. Were there any costs associated with the new terminals that you opened in Q1? Are there any dragging costs that you expect kind of as we go into the second quarter and the second half of the year as you reopen these terminals? \n And just a follow-up kind of on the pricing side of things. This -- I mean you mentioned renewals are tracking in the 8% range. Is that kind of complete kind of the book of business that we have seen started to get renewed as service level improved last year? I'm just trying to figure like from a comp perspective, do we start to get into easier -- I mean, harder comps in the second half of this year? Or is that momentum potentially sustainable? \nMario Harik: Thanks, Fadi. I'll start with the Yellow site openings or the acquired site opening. I'll turn it over to Kyle to discuss contract renewals. \n But when you look at the new service centers we're bringing online, we don't see them as having a meaningful cost headwind for us. We do expect them to be only neutral in this year, and they will become accretive in 2025 and beyond. Now here in the near term in the second quarter, I mean, it's a small impact of cost, probably in the 10- to 20-basis-point range on OR associated with those sites as we first turn them on and then we start getting the efficiency benefits.\n The reason why, for us, that's the case, because if you look at the service centers, we already cover 99% of all zip codes, and they fall in 3 categories. In some markets, we are moving from a smaller location to a larger location. And as soon as we do that, we gain all the benefits of having more space on the dock that enables us to run more productively and more efficiently for a better service. But your variable cost is the same because we just relocated the team and the rolling stock from site A to site B. \n The second scenario is where we are adding a site to an existing market where we already have a service center. A good example of that is Nashville was in our new Goodlettsville site, which is north of Nashville, a few weeks ago. But that's the case where you look at that site, we split the existing team in that market between 2 sites or more than 2 sites. So in the case of Nashville, we already have 30, 35 city drivers in Goodlettsville, but these were relocated from our Nashville terminal into Goodlettsville. \n So there as well, you see a small impact from the cost per door, the more space that we have, but you don't see a meaningful impact on cost. And we have 2 smaller markets in Eau Clair, Wisconsin; and Nogales, Arizona that are net new markets, but they are smaller terminals, and they already -- in Nogales, right across the border from Mexico, and it's already running ahead of expectations in terms of the demand we're seeing on the site. So on a net-net basis, Fadi, we -- again, we look at these as being neutral and then accretive for 2025 and beyond. \nKyle Wismans: Fadi, when you think about renewals, so we renegotiated about 25% of the contractual book each quarter. So from the disruption last year, we've gone about -- through about 75% of the book. And then if you think about the outlook for contract renewals, we expect to be somewhere probably in the high single-digit range for the remainder of the year. \nOperator: The next question is coming from Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. \nJonathan Chappell: Kyle, kind of a simple one for you maybe. So in February, you gave some annual guide, low single-digit tonnage; yield, ex fuel, mid-single digit; OR, 150 to 200 basis points improvement. And it feels like with the 1Q upside and the commentary that Ali and Mario have given about April so far and how 2Q is tracking that. You're off to a much better start. Is there any way to frame what the full year guide may look like based off the first 4 months of the year vis-\u00e0-vis the February guide? \nKyle Wismans: Sure. So I think what's important to think about is if you take the Q2 guide we walked through today, so if you're in the low to mid-83s. If you think about that and you roll through typical seasonality for both Q3 and Q4, that would imply our full year OR to be at the high end of the outlook range. Now there's still a path, Jon, we can do better than that given the momentum we have now and potential for a macro recovery, but it's still early in the year. We'll give you an update as the year progresses. \nJonathan Chappell: Okay. And no change to the others, tonnage or yield as well? \nKyle Wismans: No change right now to the assumptions. \nOperator: Our next question is coming from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. \nStephanie Benjamin Moore: I wanted to actually follow up on the prior question or 2 questions ago on just the ramp of terminals. Any change in the time line of the ramp of service -- the ramp of these service centers, just given what is a weaker macro? \nMario Harik: Stephanie, we won't expect to change the time line because we think of this opening as being an investment for the next 10-plus years. And we are prioritizing markets that are capacity constrained for us today. I mean you hear us talk about the markets like Las Vegas, for example, or Brooklyn, New York or Houston, Texas. These are markets where we don't have enough doors as things stand. So they get a lot accretive very, very quickly. \n And the second area is around cost efficiency. I mentioned earlier on the Goodlettsville site, as an example. It's not that we are ramping variable costs associated with that. Just to give you an example, for the first phase of a dozen terminals we're opening up here in the second quarter, we're adding a total of 30 or so headcount to be able to support those service centers because we already have the labor in those markets and we're just splitting the teams between the new service centers or relocating from one service center to another. \n So we don't see the macro as impacting our cadence of opening these. We expect to open 12 in the -- up to 12 by the first -- by the second quarter, another 11 to 12 in the back half of the year and the remaining 5 or so sites in early 2025. \nOperator: Our next question is coming from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. \nThomas Wadewitz: Congratulations on the really strong results. I -- let's see. I want to ask you a question kind of related to that momentum you have. How much sensitivity do you think that your volume and pricing trend has to just what the overall freight market does? Obviously, your service improvement is a big factor, but it's hard to think there's no impact from the actual freight market trends. So maybe just a thought on that kind of volume and price, how sensitive are you to freight if it gets weak or whatever? \n And then I guess the second part would be how sensitive is your OR improvement to the volume side? I know it'd be sensitive to price, but volume comes in 2 points weaker than you think. Are you still going to be able to do similar margin improvement to what we're talking about? \nMario Harik: Yes. Thanks, Tom. I'll start with the first one in terms of market sensitivity. I mean, obviously, we're not immune to the market. If things slow down a lot in the back half of the year, then that's -- we're going to be impacted. But this said, we do expect to outperform. And the reason why is that our strategy is working. Our service product is improving, and customers are rewarding us with higher pricing. We're launching new premium services, and these are resonating in the market. And we're growing our local sales force, and that comes at a higher margin. \n So we're doing a lot of things because that our company is driven to counter whatever comes from a macro perspective. I mean if you look at the first quarter, it was a very muted freight market. We are still in a freight recession. Yet we are delivering great numbers given that our strategy is working and the team is executing on that strategy. But again, we will -- if the volume environment goes down, also we're going to be under pressure from a volume perspective, but we expect to gain market share as we go along. And from a pricing perspective, a lot of the initiatives we have that are driving pricing are based on all the things I just mentioned, which enabled us to also deliver a good, good pricing number as a whole. \nThomas Wadewitz: And what about the second part being like if you get 2 points less, whatever, pick a number of volume growth, is the OR improvement sensitive to that or not particularly so? \nAli-Ahmad Faghri: So Tom, this is Ali. As Mario mentioned, we're not immune to the macro, but within our baseline outlook, we're assuming very modest assumptions around tonnage growth. You saw here in 1Q and also in 4Q as well with relatively modest tonnage growth on a year-over-year basis in that low single-digits range. We were able to deliver 400 basis points or nearly 400 basis points of year-over-year OR improvement. As you roll forward into the second quarter, we're assuming tonnage up in that low to mid-single-digit range. We expect 400-plus basis points of OR improvement. \n So for us, specifically, while there is some sensitivity to the tonnage outlook, where we're focused on is driving yield growth, driving cost efficiency, and we have a lot of control over our own destiny and a lot of company-specific levers we can pull to drive both yield growth and cost efficiencies to drive stronger OR improvement even in a softer macro environment. \nOperator: Our next question is coming from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. \nBrian Ossenbeck: Just wanted to maybe get your thoughts on competition, both with other LTLs, some of which are expanding their footprint as well. But also some of the last question from Tom, in terms of the freight market, we have seen probably a bit more weight from a weaker truckload market, but you're also seeing better weight per shipment in your trend. So doesn't seem like you're as exposed as maybe some others. So maybe you can walk through the details on that. \nMario Harik: Yes. I'll first start actually with the back half on weight per shipment or back half of your question. Look, for us, weight per shipment has sequentially improved. A lot of that goes back to the -- we are being very disciplined on the type of freight we are taking into our network to make sure it fits the profile of an LTL network, and it's so accretive and from an overall margin perspective. Now when you look at the move of freight potentially from LTL to truckload, we -- I had the team run an analysis here recently for us, and it's roughly around 0.5 point of shipments that are those heavy LTL shipments that we have seen effectively go down more than the corresponding other parts.\n And that's driven predominantly by the truckload rates being lower. But it's not a meaningful number, but we're seeing some of that in terms of the LTL-to-TL shift. The good news there is as soon as the truckload market tightens, that becomes a tailwind for LTL, and we see it coming back. \n In terms of the overall industry dynamics, when you look at the capacity in our industry, you go back a year ago, all of the Yellow service centers were up and running. And now about half of them have been sold. So look, about 80%, 90% of these are coming back to LTL carriers. In a year from now, would be at 94%, 95% of the industry capacity that was running just a short year ago. \n And when you look at the overall, we are in a freight recession. So when you look in how -- in the TL industry and you look at all the publicly traded LTL carriers, you can see that from a baseline of 2021, shipment count in our industry is down in the teens since the post-COVID environment. And it's not that 2021 was a particularly strong year. It was even less shipments in LTL than 2019 or '18 or '17. \n So the best way to think about it is that, that capacity went out at a time when freight markets were down in the teens. About half of it is coming back. But yet, we haven't seen yet any meaningful shipment recovery. So from an industry capacity perspective, as soon as we see any meaningful form of recovery, you would see that we don't have enough capacity in the LTL space as a whole. \nBrian Ossenbeck: Just to quickly follow up on that then, looking into later half of this year and probably more like next year, what are some of the incremental margins you would expect, I guess, the new facilities in particular, especially in some of the bigger areas with more density? Should that be similar to what we saw this quarter, which was around 40% or so, or maybe a little bit less, and of course, it would depend on the pace of the macro? But I just wanted to get your sense in terms of how those assets would fit when the recovery does come back. \nAli-Ahmad Faghri: Sure, Brian. This is Ali. We do expect very strong incremental margins on these new service centers. As you saw here in 1Q, we delivered very strong incremental margins. In 2Q, if you look at what we're implying for OR, that implies incremental margins north of 50%. And as we cycle into the second half of the year and into 2025, as these new service centers come online, we would expect to maintain that very strong performance in incremental margins comfortably above 40%. \nOperator: Our next question is coming from Jason Seidl with TD Cowen. \nJason Seidl: For the Mario team, congrats on the strong quarter. One question, one follow up here. How should we think about this push to the more local accounts as an impact on the overall yield? And I understand how the margin impact works. I was just curious if there's any impact on yields. \n And then, Kyle, I wanted to follow up. You mentioned being at the \"higher end\" of the OR target range. And I'm assuming you meant the better end, but the lower OR. I just want to clarify that. \nKyle Wismans: Yes. Jason, so I'll take the first part of the question, too. So when you think about the local account strategy and a move from 20% to 30% of the book, when we talk about our overall opportunity from a yield perspective, we said we had probably a mid-teens gap at times. When you think about growing the local accounts, we think that's 2 to 3 points of what that gap could be just from growing that local business. \n And then with respect to the OR target, yes, so if -- as we're performing now and what we expect, just rolling seasonality would put you at the higher end of that target in the 250-basis-point range. \nOperator: Our next question is coming from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. \nJordan Alliger: Longer-term question. I think you'd mentioned that LTL 2.0 is still in the earlier days or earlier innings. And obviously, now since you first put that plan out, you have the former Yellow terminals that you're rolling out. Any thoughts on assessment sort of the longer-term, margin improvement potential that you could get to in less-than-truckload vis-\u00e0-vis the original expectations or updated expectations? \nMario Harik: Thanks, Jordan. Well, initially [indiscernible] at least 600 basis points of our improvement from a baseline of 2021 through 2027. But we -- but that's what we always said at least because we're not stopping at 600 basis points, and we're not stopping in 2027. But with the momentum we have and all the initiatives and the plan working as expected, we do expect to get there faster. But obviously, we're not stopping at 600 or 2027. Our goal is to get to the 70s from an OR perspective and eventually into the mid-70s and eventually the low 70s. \nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. \nBrandon Oglenski: Mario, I was wondering if you could talk to service outcomes during the quarter. I know you guys were calling out a really low claims ratio. And then how does that factor in -- with these new terminals opening, does XPO actually become more of a growth story as you look out the next 2 to 3 years, I mean, obviously, cycle contingent? \nMario Harik: Yes. So the way we think about the new service centers, they will help us deliver better service as well because usually, when you have more space on the dock, you have to -- you turn less often your doors, your dock doors, which gives you more time to load trailers effectively and also being able to build what we call pure trailers that can go through the network without any rehandling along the way. So we believe that more space is going to enable us to even have a better service product over time as well. \n Similarly, we have initiatives around insourcing third-party linehaul as we mentioned earlier on. And these also come with an improvement in service. And we have obviously the airbags systems and the loading technology and all the things that we are doing as a company to further improve service. \n Now in terms of being growth, our goal is to keep on improving service and drive yield more than tonnage. But at some point, whenever there is a market inflection, we'd be able to take on more freight, but we're focused on making sure it's an accretive freight, and it's operating at the right yield as well. \n So again, we're not chasing tonnage. We're chasing yield and keep on improving that service product as well. \nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. \nScott Schneeberger: Could we touch on Europe? I think Mario, you mentioned it was the best quarter since COVID and seeing some strength in the U.K. and France. What end market specifically? And I guess I'll throw in the question too of, is now an improved time to be considering that disposition? \nMario Harik: First, I'll start with the back half of the question. Our long-term plan remains to be a pure-play North American LTL carrier, and selling that business is a strategic priority of ours. But we're going to be patient. We want to make sure that we are maximizing the returns on that business. It is a business that has a lot of scarcity value. In Western Europe, we're either #1, #2 or #3 in LTL, truckload and brokerage. And it's in key Western European geographies, think about U.K., France, Spain, Portugal. So it's not a matter of if, but when. \n Meanwhile, the business is performing really well. And as you mentioned, we -- our EBITDA for the first quarter was the highest it's been since the pandemic. And some of these key geographies in France, for example, our EBITDA was up in the mid-teens. In the U.K., our EBITDA was up in the high single digit. And a lot of it is driven by really good strong sales pipeline driven by good pricing. And the team is just executing in every level in our European business. And keep in mind that in the backdrop of a soft freight economy, and we have seen our volumes inflect positive in the month of March. \n So we are seeing more strength in the less-than-truckload business in Europe but also in the brokerage side, and the truckload side, we are also seeing an improvement in overall trend. \nOperator: Our next question is coming from Kevin Gainey with Thompson, Davis & Company. \nKevin Gainey: Congrats on the quarter. I actually wanted to go into operating cash flow. It was a pretty strong quarter for that. And I was wondering what levers kind of drove that from your standpoint. Or was there any kind of efficiency changes that you guys have done there? And then maybe the outlook that you guys have for the remainder of the year on cash flow. \nKyle Wismans: Yes. From the cash flow quarter, I think it's another strong quarter from a working capital perspective. Obviously, Q1 tends to be negative from a cash flow standpoint. But I think even given that and the higher CapEx, we had a really good end result. I think what's important when you think about cash flow is for the rest of the year, we expect to generate over $100 million of cash flow in 2024. That's even contemplating the elevated level of spending from a CapEx perspective. So we said $700 million, $800 million in planning assumptions. We think we'll be in that range. And I think even with that, we should still be comfortably over $100 million in cash flow. \n Again, timing, you got to think about, so Q1, we said it's negative. But we had a lot of tractor deliveries here in the first quarter, 1,600 deliveries in Q1, most of the whole year. So that CapEx number for Q1 at $299 million in net CapEx will come down over the course of the year. We feel very strong -- we feel very good about our cash generation ability this year. \nOperator: We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to XPO's Chief Executive Officer, Mario Harik, for concluding comments. \nMario Harik: Thank you, operator, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm proud of our strong first quarter and the tremendous progress we're making. As you can see from our results, our LTL 2.0 plan is working and is gaining momentum in a soft macro for freight transportation. We look forward to updating you on our continued progress next quarter. \n Operator, you can now end the call. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. We thank you for your participation, and you may disconnect your lines at this time.",

            "content": "Thank you, Kyle. I'll start with our LTL segment, which reported another quarter of profitable growth with strong underlying trends. On a year-over-year basis, we increased our shipments per day by 4.7% in the quarter, led by 10% growth in our local sales channel. This resulted in growth in tonnage per day of 2.6%, and our weight per shipment was down 1.9%, which was less of a decline than the prior quarter. On a year-over-year basis, this was our third consecutive quarter of improvement in weight per shipment. \n On a monthly basis, the trends across our operating metrics were broadly positive. Our January tonnage per day was down 1.1% year-over-year, February was up 3.5%, and March was up 5.9%. Looking just at shipments per day, January was up 1.4% year-over-year, February was up 5.8%, and March was up 7.2%. In April, our preliminary tonnage per day was up 3.1% year-over-year while our shipment count was up 4.8%. On a 2-year stack basis, April shipments per day and tonnage per day accelerated versus the month of March. \n We also delivered another strong quarter of yield growth. We grew yield, excluding fuel, by a robust 9.8% compared with the prior year. While our improving weight per shipment was a modest mix headwind to yield, our revenue per shipment, ex fuel, accelerated for the third consecutive quarter to a year-over-year increase of 7.9%. Importantly, our underlying pricing trends are strong as we continue to align our pricing with the better service and value-added offerings we provide. Our contract renewal pricing was up 8% in the quarter compared with a year ago. \n Turning to margin. Our first quarter adjusted operating ratio was 85.7%, which was an improvement of 390 basis points year-over-year. We've now reported nearly 400 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion in each of 2 consecutive quarters, and the current quarter is tracking for an improvement at the same level or better. Our strong margin performance was primarily driven by yield growth and bolstered by our cost initiatives and productivity gains. Sequentially, our adjusted OR improved by 80 basis points, which outperformed our expectations. \n Moving to our European business. We delivered year-over-year revenue growth despite ongoing softness in the macro environment. As with the prior quarter, our strong pricing outpaced inflation. Volume improved month by month and turned positive on a year-over-year basis in March. We also grew adjusted EBITDA versus the prior year even with fewer working days, reflecting disciplined cost control. The team continues to execute well and earn new business from high-caliber customers. This momentum is reflected in our sales pipeline, which has expanded to nearly $1.2 billion. This should continue to strengthen our position in key European geographies. \n I'll close with a summary of our strong start to the year, which lays the foundation for the significant margin improvement we expect in 2024. As you heard from us this morning, we're continuing to deliver record service levels, providing more value to our customers and earning higher returns. Our service improvements, combined with the momentum of our accessorials offering, drove another quarter of strong yield growth. And we realized meaningful cost efficiencies through our linehaul insourcing initiatives and labor productivity gains. \n In summary, our strategy is working. We're delivering strong revenue and earnings growth, and we're still in the early stages of realizing our margin expansion opportunity. \n Now we'll take your questions. Operator, please open the line for Q&A. Sure. Sure, Daniel. So when you think about linehaul insourcing, obviously, an important strategic initiative for us here in the first quarter, we were at about 18.1% miles that were outsourced to third parties. We improved that by 370 basis points on a year-over-year basis, also improved 150 basis points quarter-over-quarter. And that was at the higher end of our full year target range of improving by 200 to 400 basis points annually.\n In terms of our target, we've talked about cutting third-party linehaul miles in half by 2027 relative to where we were at year-end 2021. So that would get us to somewhere in that low-teens percent range as a percentage of total miles. That's not only going to be a cost benefit for us, but it's also going to help us with service as well. \n As we've talked about more recently, we've been rolling out initiatives to accelerate the pace of insourcing, specifically team drivers and sleeper cab trucks. We already have 100 of those teams onboarded. And we expect to have a few hundred of those teams in the fleet by the end of 2024, and that's going to allow us to drive efficiencies in our linehaul network but also accelerate that pace of insourcing. So Tom, this is Ali. As Mario mentioned, we're not immune to the macro, but within our baseline outlook, we're assuming very modest assumptions around tonnage growth. You saw here in 1Q and also in 4Q as well with relatively modest tonnage growth on a year-over-year basis in that low single-digits range. We were able to deliver 400 basis points or nearly 400 basis points of year-over-year OR improvement. As you roll forward into the second quarter, we're assuming tonnage up in that low to mid-single-digit range. We expect 400-plus basis points of OR improvement. \n So for us, specifically, while there is some sensitivity to the tonnage outlook, where we're focused on is driving yield growth, driving cost efficiency, and we have a lot of control over our own destiny and a lot of company-specific levers we can pull to drive both yield growth and cost efficiencies to drive stronger OR improvement even in a softer macro environment. Sure, Brian. This is Ali. We do expect very strong incremental margins on these new service centers. As you saw here in 1Q, we delivered very strong incremental margins. In 2Q, if you look at what we're implying for OR, that implies incremental margins north of 50%. And as we cycle into the second half of the year and into 2025, as these new service centers come online, we would expect to maintain that very strong performance in incremental margins comfortably above 40%."

            "name": "Kyle Wismans",
            "content": "Thank you, Mario, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through our key financial results, balance sheet and liquidity. \n It was a strong first quarter across the board. Revenue for the total company was $2 billion, up 6% year-over-year. This includes top line growth of 9% in our LTL segment and 1% in Europe. Our LTL revenue, excluding fuel, was up a robust 12% year-over-year. \n On the cost side in LTL, salary, wages and benefits were 10.5% higher in the quarter than a year ago. The increase primarily reflects weight and benefit inflation as well as incentive compensation aligned with the segment's strong first quarter performance. We mitigated these impacts by delivering our fifth straight quarterly increase in labor productivity on a year-over-year basis. Our labor hours per day increased by 3.5% in the quarter while our shipments per day increased by 4.7%. \n We were also more cost efficient with purchased transportation through a combination of insourcing and rate negotiation. Our expense for third-party carriers was down year-over-year by 21%, which equates to a $21 million savings in the quarter. \n Depreciation expense increased by 22% year-over-year or $13 million, reflecting the investments we're making in the business. This continues to be our top priority for capital allocation in LTL. Our first quarter CapEx was primarily allocated to purchasing new tractors from the OEMs and manufacturing more trailers in-house. \n Next, I'll add some detail to adjusted EBITDA, starting with the company as a whole. We generated adjusted EBITDA of $288 million in the quarter, which was up 37% from a year ago. Both our North American and European segments contributed to the increase. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 14.2%, representing a year-over-year improvement of 320 basis points company-wide. We also continued to rationalize our corporate cost structure. Our first quarter corporate net expense was $5 million for a year-over-year savings of 44%. \n Looking at just the LTL segment, we grew our adjusted operating income by 50% year-over-year to $175 million, and we grew adjusted EBITDA by 40% to $255 million. This reflects the combined impact of pricing gains, cost efficiencies and an increase in volume. \n In our European Transportation segment, adjusted EBITDA was $38 million for the quarter, up 3% over the prior year.  \n Company-wide, we reported operating income of $138 million for the quarter, up 138% year-over-year. And we grew net income from continuing operations by 294% to $67 million, representing diluted earnings per share of $0.56. On an adjusted basis, EPS increased by 45% year-over-year to $0.81. \n And lastly, we generated $145 million of cash flow from operating activities in the quarter and deployed $299 million of net CapEx. \n Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $229 million of cash on hand. Combined with available capacity under our committed borrowing facility, this gave us $793 million of liquidity. We had no borrowings outstanding under our ABL facility at quarter end. \n Our net debt leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.9x trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. This was an improvement from 3x at year-end 2023, and we expect to further reduce our leverage this year. \n The ongoing investments we're making are enhancing our earnings growth trajectory and will support our long-term goal of achieving an investment-grade profile. \n Now I'll turn it over to Ali, who will cover our operating results. Fadi, when you think about renewals, so we renegotiated about 25% of the contractual book each quarter. So from the disruption last year, we've gone about -- through about 75% of the book. And then if you think about the outlook for contract renewals, we expect to be somewhere probably in the high single-digit range for the remainder of the year. Sure. So I think what's important to think about is if you take the Q2 guide we walked through today, so if you're in the low to mid-83s. If you think about that and you roll through typical seasonality for both Q3 and Q4, that would imply our full year OR to be at the high end of the outlook range. Now there's still a path, Jon, we can do better than that given the momentum we have now and potential for a macro recovery, but it's still early in the year. We'll give you an update as the year progresses. No change right now to the assumptions. Yes. Jason, so I'll take the first part of the question, too. So when you think about the local account strategy and a move from 20% to 30% of the book, when we talk about our overall opportunity from a yield perspective, we said we had probably a mid-teens gap at times. When you think about growing the local accounts, we think that's 2 to 3 points of what that gap could be just from growing that local business. \n And then with respect to the OR target, yes, so if -- as we're performing now and what we expect, just rolling seasonality would put you at the higher end of that target in the 250-basis-point range. Yes. From the cash flow quarter, I think it's another strong quarter from a working capital perspective. Obviously, Q1 tends to be negative from a cash flow standpoint. But I think even given that and the higher CapEx, we had a really good end result. I think what's important when you think about cash flow is for the rest of the year, we expect to generate over $100 million of cash flow in 2024. That's even contemplating the elevated level of spending from a CapEx perspective. So we said $700 million, $800 million in planning assumptions. We think we'll be in that range. And I think even with that, we should still be comfortably over $100 million in cash flow. \n Again, timing, you got to think about, so Q1, we said it's negative. But we had a lot of tractor deliveries here in the first quarter, 1,600 deliveries in Q1, most of the whole year. So that CapEx number for Q1 at $299 million in net CapEx will come down over the course of the year. We feel very strong -- we feel very good about our cash generation ability this year."

            "name": "Mario Harik",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call. I'm here in Greenwich with Kyle Wismans, our Chief Financial Officer; and Ali Faghri, our Chief Strategy Officer. \n This morning, we reported financial results that were well above expectations for revenue and earnings in a soft market for freight transportation. It was a strong first quarter for us company-wide, reflecting the momentum we carried into 2024. We grew revenue year-over-year by 6% to $2 billion, and we improved our adjusted EBITDA by 37% to $288 million. Adjusted diluted EPS was 45% higher year-over-year at $0.81. \n As you saw in our results, our LTL 2.0 plan is firing on all cylinders. I want to frame my comments this morning around the 4 pillars of our plan and the tremendous progress we're making. I'll start with the pillar that is most important to our growth and profitability, which is to provide world-class service to our customers. \n Our first quarter damage claims ratio continued to be among the best in the industry at a company record of 0.3%. This was an improvement from 0.7% last year and from 1.2% when we launched LTL 2.0 just over 2 years ago. The underlying driver of this improvement has been a reduction of more than 70% in damage frequency. \n Another key service metric is on-time performance, which has now improved on a year-over-year basis for 8 consecutive quarters. In short, we're delivering meaningful service improvements while moving more volume through our network, with a multiyear plan that balances operational excellence and investments in the network. This includes the freight airbag systems we introduced in the second half of last year. That equipment is now installed in 75% of our service centers, and we expect to complete the rollout by midyear. The sites that have the airbags are seeing an improvement in damage frequency of greater than 20%. \n We've also recently updated our trailer loading procedures, which will continue to enhance our service quality over time. And as we insource more miles from third-party carriers, we expect this to further reduce damages and improve on-time performance. We've made it clear to our customers and employees that service quality is our North Star, and we're well on our way to becoming the best-in-class LTL service provider. \n The second pillar of LTL 2.0 is to invest in our network. Our business has historically generated a high return on invested capital. Since the launch of LTL 2.0, we've added over 12,000 trailers and 4,000 tractors to our fleet. This has allowed us to operate more efficiently and maintain strong network fluidity while insourcing more linehaul transportation. \n Over 2/3 of our 2024 CapEx is allocated for fleet. We added nearly 1,600 tractors in the first quarter, which brought down our average tractor age to 4.2 years from 5 years at the end of 2023. The new tractors are more efficient to operate, resulting in an improvement in our fleet maintenance costs. \n We also manufactured nearly 1,300 trailers in the quarter, and we recently celebrated the 30th anniversary of our production facility in Arkansas. We are the only U.S. freight transportation company to manufacture its own trailers, which puts us in a unique position to create capacity when our customers need it, and we can do it with less capital. \n In terms of the 28 new service centers we acquired in December, we've now opened the first 6 on schedule in April, with another 6 planned for the second quarter. This is expanding our presence in growing freight markets like Nashville, Las Vegas and Houston. We plan to bring another dozen sites online by the end of this year and expect all 28 to be operational by early 2025. \n The third pillar of our plan is to drive above-market yield growth. Yield is our single biggest opportunity for margin improvement, and it's a highlight of our results this morning. We grew yield, excluding fuel, by 9.8% year-over-year, which helped us deliver nearly 400 basis points of adjusted operating ratio improvement. Even with the gains we've made, we still have a significant pricing opportunity that we can capture over time through 3 distinct levers: by improving our service, growing our accessorial business and expanding our local customer base. \n As we continue to improve our service, we're able to align our price with the value we deliver. This was reflected in our contract renewal pricing, where we achieved year-over-year growth in the high single digits for the third consecutive quarter. We also captured a double-digit increase in assessorial revenue as customers took advantage of our premium services. The fourth quarter rollout of our retail store offering went well, and we're developing a pipeline of customers, specifically for this premium service. In the first quarter, we introduced another new service called Must Arrive by Date, which is already gaining strong customer traction. And we're expanding our trade show and cross-border services with the support of our new service centers in Las Vegas and Nogales, Arizona. \n Lastly, we're continuing to have success in growing our local customer base. From a strategic perspective, local accounts are a higher-margin business for us, and we've expanded our local sales force to double down on this opportunity. In the first quarter, we earned 10% more shipment from local customers compared to the year ago. \n The final pillar of LTL 2.0 is cost efficiency, specifically, with purchase transportation, variable costs and overhead. In the first quarter, we reduced our purchased transportation cost by 21% year-over-year by covering more linehaul miles in-house while also paying lower contract rates for the miles we outsource. We ended the quarter with 18% of linehaul miles outsourced to third parties, which was a reduction of 370 basis points year-over-year. That puts us at the higher end of our target range for the 200 to 400 basis points improvement this year. \n We expect to accelerate the number of miles we bring in-house in 2024, which will give us greater efficiency, flexibility and quality control. This will be supported by our initiatives to add driver teams and sleeper cab trucks for long-distance hauls. We've onboarded over 100 of these teams, and we're targeting a few hundred sleeper trucks to be in operation by the end of this year. \n Lastly, as our volume growth continues to outpace our headcount growth, our variable labor cost creates an ongoing margin opportunity. We managed this effectively in the first quarter through the strong execution of our operational teams and our proprietary technology. \n Turning to Europe. Our business continued to perform well in a soft macro environment. We increased both revenue and adjusted EBITDA versus the prior year, supported by a strong pricing environment and a robust sales pipeline. Our strongest year-over-year growth rates and adjusted EBITDA were in France and the U.K., which are 2 key geographies for us. In France, the increase was in the mid-teens, and in the U.K., it was in the high single digits. Across the European business as a whole, our first quarter EBITDA was the highest it's been since the pandemic. \n In summary, we made significant progress in executing our strategy in the first quarter while continuing to make investments in long-term growth. Our service quality is at record levels. We're growing yield faster than the market, and we're driving cost efficiencies in areas that have the greatest impact on earnings. \n The initiatives we put in place are contributing to our strong operating momentum and cementing our foundation for future growth. We've come a long way on the LTL 2.0, and we're still in the early stages of unlocking our full potential. \n Now I'm going to hand the call over to Kyle to discuss the first quarter results. Kyle, over to you. Yes. Ravi, Mario. When we look at the overall contract renewals, so we were up in the high single digits in the first quarter. And usually, on average, we renew roughly around 1/4 of our contracts. And that performance for us was driven by all the service improvements that we are delivering for our customers that obviously, we were in a higher price because they don't want to see disruptions in their supply chain. And they also understand we're investing in our network to be able to provide that great service. \n Again, for us, it's been the third quarter of high single digits. And we have -- since the bankruptcy of Yellow, that would be -- we have another quarter of the book effectively to renegotiate here in the upcoming quarter as well. Yes, you got it, Ravi. And I'll actually give the color on the tonnage, yield and OR -- ultimately, OR outlook like we usually do. But on the tonnage side, for us, April was up 3% on a year-on-year basis, and shipment counts, we're up in the same ballpark as the first quarter as well. We do expect the second quarter to be up in a similar level. For us, April was actually better than seasonality compared to March. And we'll give another update here on the May tonnage early June mid-quarter. \n And on the yield side, as I said earlier, we do expect yields to be up on a year-on-year basis in a similar range as we had in the first quarter. April for us was also in a similar range. From a revenue per shipment perspective, we saw that accelerate from Q4 to Q1, and we expect, on a quarter-over-quarter on an absolute dollar basis, for that to further accelerate in the second quarter. \n And ultimately, from an OR perspective, we expect a strong quarter for margin improvement. Sequentially, we expect to be an improvement from Q1 to Q2 of 200 to 250 basis points going into the third quarter. That would put us, call it, in the low to mid-83% range for Q2, which implies more than 400 basis points of margin improvement on a year-on-year basis, which, we believe, will be a very, very good performance in this freight market. Thanks, Ken. It is a big part of our strategy to grow local account business because, Ken, these are more sticky relationships we have with those customers. And they are supported with a local relationship with one of our sellers in a local market. So over the last 12 months, we increased the headcount in our local sales force by roughly around 25% over that period of time. And we're seeing great performance. Here, in the first quarter, shipment count was up 10% on a year-on-year basis. \n Just to give you a stat there, we've added more than 3,000 new buying accounts in that channel so far year-to-date. So it is a segment of growth for us. We're investing more in it. And when customers see our focus on service and taking care of them and taking care of their freight, we're seeing very good growth associated with that. We are seeing the freight markets continuing to be soft, Ken. The underlying demand from customer is soft. However, it's stable. It seems to be bouncing along the bottom from that perspective. Obviously, again, for us, April was better than seasonality, but a lot of that was based on our sales efforts, on our quality improvement. Our service improvements are enabling us to drive those gains. \n Now if you break it down between industrial and retail, you saw the ISM peak over 50 for the first time in March, but then it dropped back down to 49 here in April. So we're seeing the industrials be a bit more muted. And now when we talk about industrial customers, and we usually survey them on a quarterly basis, they do expect growth in the back half, but it seems to be muted growth. \n On the retail side, inventories are largely normalized at this point, and what our customers are telling us, they do expect, again, growth in the back end given -- in the back half given the easier comps, but it's still softer consumer demand as well. So again, the market seems to be on the softer side in terms of the underlying demand. But again, for us, it's about gaining more momentum in that local account segment, and as we deliver great service numbers, our customers are rewarding us with more freight. And in terms of -- Dan, Mario. In terms of variable cost levers, so Ali mentioned the insourcing of third-party linehaul, which that comes -- obviously, you saw it here in the first quarter, our PT costs were down over 20%. Now when you look at the other levers around variable labor costs, and the team has done a great job operationally managing labor, here in the first quarter, we had the fifth consecutive quarter of productivity improvement. If you look at the quarter, we -- our shipment count went up more than our headcount effectively in the first quarter. And that led to benefits, obviously, to the bottom line.\n Now a lot of that is driven again by operational execution in the field, and it's also driven by our proprietary technology that enables us to manage labor very effectively. So if you think through the quarters and years to come, these are 2 big levers for us. One is the continued reduction of PT costs. And then the second one is labor productivity. Thanks, Fadi. I'll start with the Yellow site openings or the acquired site opening. I'll turn it over to Kyle to discuss contract renewals. \n But when you look at the new service centers we're bringing online, we don't see them as having a meaningful cost headwind for us. We do expect them to be only neutral in this year, and they will become accretive in 2025 and beyond. Now here in the near term in the second quarter, I mean, it's a small impact of cost, probably in the 10- to 20-basis-point range on OR associated with those sites as we first turn them on and then we start getting the efficiency benefits.\n The reason why, for us, that's the case, because if you look at the service centers, we already cover 99% of all zip codes, and they fall in 3 categories. In some markets, we are moving from a smaller location to a larger location. And as soon as we do that, we gain all the benefits of having more space on the dock that enables us to run more productively and more efficiently for a better service. But your variable cost is the same because we just relocated the team and the rolling stock from site A to site B. \n The second scenario is where we are adding a site to an existing market where we already have a service center. A good example of that is Nashville was in our new Goodlettsville site, which is north of Nashville, a few weeks ago. But that's the case where you look at that site, we split the existing team in that market between 2 sites or more than 2 sites. So in the case of Nashville, we already have 30, 35 city drivers in Goodlettsville, but these were relocated from our Nashville terminal into Goodlettsville. \n So there as well, you see a small impact from the cost per door, the more space that we have, but you don't see a meaningful impact on cost. And we have 2 smaller markets in Eau Clair, Wisconsin; and Nogales, Arizona that are net new markets, but they are smaller terminals, and they already -- in Nogales, right across the border from Mexico, and it's already running ahead of expectations in terms of the demand we're seeing on the site. So on a net-net basis, Fadi, we -- again, we look at these as being neutral and then accretive for 2025 and beyond. Stephanie, we won't expect to change the time line because we think of this opening as being an investment for the next 10-plus years. And we are prioritizing markets that are capacity constrained for us today. I mean you hear us talk about the markets like Las Vegas, for example, or Brooklyn, New York or Houston, Texas. These are markets where we don't have enough doors as things stand. So they get a lot accretive very, very quickly. \n And the second area is around cost efficiency. I mentioned earlier on the Goodlettsville site, as an example. It's not that we are ramping variable costs associated with that. Just to give you an example, for the first phase of a dozen terminals we're opening up here in the second quarter, we're adding a total of 30 or so headcount to be able to support those service centers because we already have the labor in those markets and we're just splitting the teams between the new service centers or relocating from one service center to another. \n So we don't see the macro as impacting our cadence of opening these. We expect to open 12 in the -- up to 12 by the first -- by the second quarter, another 11 to 12 in the back half of the year and the remaining 5 or so sites in early 2025. Yes. Thanks, Tom. I'll start with the first one in terms of market sensitivity. I mean, obviously, we're not immune to the market. If things slow down a lot in the back half of the year, then that's -- we're going to be impacted. But this said, we do expect to outperform. And the reason why is that our strategy is working. Our service product is improving, and customers are rewarding us with higher pricing. We're launching new premium services, and these are resonating in the market. And we're growing our local sales force, and that comes at a higher margin. \n So we're doing a lot of things because that our company is driven to counter whatever comes from a macro perspective. I mean if you look at the first quarter, it was a very muted freight market. We are still in a freight recession. Yet we are delivering great numbers given that our strategy is working and the team is executing on that strategy. But again, we will -- if the volume environment goes down, also we're going to be under pressure from a volume perspective, but we expect to gain market share as we go along. And from a pricing perspective, a lot of the initiatives we have that are driving pricing are based on all the things I just mentioned, which enabled us to also deliver a good, good pricing number as a whole. Yes. I'll first start actually with the back half on weight per shipment or back half of your question. Look, for us, weight per shipment has sequentially improved. A lot of that goes back to the -- we are being very disciplined on the type of freight we are taking into our network to make sure it fits the profile of an LTL network, and it's so accretive and from an overall margin perspective. Now when you look at the move of freight potentially from LTL to truckload, we -- I had the team run an analysis here recently for us, and it's roughly around 0.5 point of shipments that are those heavy LTL shipments that we have seen effectively go down more than the corresponding other parts.\n And that's driven predominantly by the truckload rates being lower. But it's not a meaningful number, but we're seeing some of that in terms of the LTL-to-TL shift. The good news there is as soon as the truckload market tightens, that becomes a tailwind for LTL, and we see it coming back. \n In terms of the overall industry dynamics, when you look at the capacity in our industry, you go back a year ago, all of the Yellow service centers were up and running. And now about half of them have been sold. So look, about 80%, 90% of these are coming back to LTL carriers. In a year from now, would be at 94%, 95% of the industry capacity that was running just a short year ago. \n And when you look at the overall, we are in a freight recession. So when you look in how -- in the TL industry and you look at all the publicly traded LTL carriers, you can see that from a baseline of 2021, shipment count in our industry is down in the teens since the post-COVID environment. And it's not that 2021 was a particularly strong year. It was even less shipments in LTL than 2019 or '18 or '17. \n So the best way to think about it is that, that capacity went out at a time when freight markets were down in the teens. About half of it is coming back. But yet, we haven't seen yet any meaningful shipment recovery. So from an industry capacity perspective, as soon as we see any meaningful form of recovery, you would see that we don't have enough capacity in the LTL space as a whole. Thanks, Jordan. Well, initially [indiscernible] at least 600 basis points of our improvement from a baseline of 2021 through 2027. But we -- but that's what we always said at least because we're not stopping at 600 basis points, and we're not stopping in 2027. But with the momentum we have and all the initiatives and the plan working as expected, we do expect to get there faster. But obviously, we're not stopping at 600 or 2027. Our goal is to get to the 70s from an OR perspective and eventually into the mid-70s and eventually the low 70s. Yes. So the way we think about the new service centers, they will help us deliver better service as well because usually, when you have more space on the dock, you have to -- you turn less often your doors, your dock doors, which gives you more time to load trailers effectively and also being able to build what we call pure trailers that can go through the network without any rehandling along the way. So we believe that more space is going to enable us to even have a better service product over time as well. \n Similarly, we have initiatives around insourcing third-party linehaul as we mentioned earlier on. And these also come with an improvement in service. And we have obviously the airbags systems and the loading technology and all the things that we are doing as a company to further improve service. \n Now in terms of being growth, our goal is to keep on improving service and drive yield more than tonnage. But at some point, whenever there is a market inflection, we'd be able to take on more freight, but we're focused on making sure it's an accretive freight, and it's operating at the right yield as well. \n So again, we're not chasing tonnage. We're chasing yield and keep on improving that service product as well. First, I'll start with the back half of the question. Our long-term plan remains to be a pure-play North American LTL carrier, and selling that business is a strategic priority of ours. But we're going to be patient. We want to make sure that we are maximizing the returns on that business. It is a business that has a lot of scarcity value. In Western Europe, we're either #1, #2 or #3 in LTL, truckload and brokerage. And it's in key Western European geographies, think about U.K., France, Spain, Portugal. So it's not a matter of if, but when. \n Meanwhile, the business is performing really well. And as you mentioned, we -- our EBITDA for the first quarter was the highest it's been since the pandemic. And some of these key geographies in France, for example, our EBITDA was up in the mid-teens. In the U.K., our EBITDA was up in the high single digit. And a lot of it is driven by really good strong sales pipeline driven by good pricing. And the team is just executing in every level in our European business. And keep in mind that in the backdrop of a soft freight economy, and we have seen our volumes inflect positive in the month of March. \n So we are seeing more strength in the less-than-truckload business in Europe but also in the brokerage side, and the truckload side, we are also seeing an improvement in overall trend. Thank you, operator, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm proud of our strong first quarter and the tremendous progress we're making. As you can see from our results, our LTL 2.0 plan is working and is gaining momentum in a soft macro for freight transportation. We look forward to updating you on our continued progress next quarter. \n Operator, you can now end the call. Thank you."
