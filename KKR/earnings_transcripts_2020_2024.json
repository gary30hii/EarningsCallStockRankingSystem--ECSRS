During today\u2019s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following management\u2019s prepared remarks, the conference will be opened for questions. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.\nCraig Larson: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. I\u2019m joined this morning by Scott Nuttall, our Co-President and Co-COO; and by Rob Lewin, our CFO. We\u2019d like to remind everyone that we\u2019ll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, which is available on the Investor Center section at KKR.com. This call will contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to our SEC filings for cautionary factors related to these statements. And like previous quarters, we\u2019ve also posted a supplementary deck on our website that we\u2019ll be referring to over the course of the call. Thank you, everyone, for joining us. We hope you and your families are safe and healthy. Our call this morning is organized into three parts. The first relates to where we\u2019ve been with a focus on our fourth quarter results. We had a strong finish to a solid year and I\u2019m going to walk you through these. The second part of the call relates to where we\u2019re going. Rob is going to lead you through this part of a call. This includes an update on the Global Atlantic acquisition, which closed on February 1st. And additionally, Rob is going to review some important changes in our reporting and compensation framework and also introduce new fee-related earnings per share guidance as part of this. And finally, Scott will offer some thoughts both on our year, as well as on our outlook. Turning first to the results. In Page 2 of our supplement, you can see that we have success -- we had a successful year. In the upper left-hand corner of the page, assets under management grew 15% to $252 billion, driven both by investment performance in addition to new capital raised, 2020 was a record fundraising year for us. In turn, management fees grew by 16% year-over-year to $1.4 billion. Looking at the bottom left-hand corner, book value per share continued to compound. At year-end, our book value per share was $23.09, representing a 20% increase from a year ago. And finally, on the bottom right-hand side, after-tax distributable earnings increased 8% to $1.5 billion for the year. When you look at this pace more broadly from 2016 to 2020, we\u2019ve seen our AUM and management fees grow at compound annual growth rates of 18% and 15%, respectively. Book value per share has compounded 17% annually. And remember, in addition to this compounding, dividends are being paid out alongside. And with the growth and the earnings power of the firm and unrealized carry and embedded gains in our balance sheet both at record levels as of 12/31, we\u2019re well-positioned to see an acceleration in earnings growth from here. Now let\u2019s dive a little deeper into our results for the quarter. Please turn to Page 3 of the supplement. Focusing on our revenues, management fees of $393 million are up 24% compared to the fourth quarter of last year and increased 9% just from last quarter, driven by fee-paying AUM growth, as well as $22 million of catch-up management fees related to capital raised and strategies that had already begun investment period. Net transaction and monitoring fees were up nicely. Capital Markets fees of $193 million is the strongest quarterly figure we\u2019ve reported in two years. Fees here continued to be diversified across geographies, with a little over 40% of revenues for the quarter and the year, coming from each of the U.S. and Europe, with about 15% coming from Asia. And realized performance income and realized investment income totaled $392 million. That number is right on top of the $390 million update we issued in December. Notable contributors this quarter include monetizations at Pfizer and Epicor, as well as just over $100 million in incentive fees at Marshall Wace. On a blended basis, our key exits this quarter were done at over 2 times costs. Turning to our expenses. Compensation, including equity base comp, was $376 million apply -- implying a 35% compensation margin for the quarter and bringing our comp margin for the year to 38.7%, well inside of the low 40%s total comp ratio we discussed on these calls now for some time. You did see a modestly greater skew towards equity-based comp in the quarter as we issued some stock to employees as part of our year-end comp process. And remember, as always, our intent is to repurchase shares and offset dilution from shares issued to employees over time. Non-compensation operating expenses came in at $124 million, essentially flat year-over-year. So for the quarter, we\u2019re reporting after-tax distributable earnings of $431 million, or $0.49 per share, up 11% on a per share basis relative to Q4 of 2019. And looking at the results for the full-year on the right-hand side, we\u2019re really proud of the results you see on the page. Despite all of the market volatility and challenges over 2020, management fees increased 16%, capital markets fees increased 17%, aggregate revenues increased 8%. And with 150 basis points of margin improvement, operating earnings were up 11%. And while after-tax DE per share for the year compares favorably to 2019, it\u2019s worth noting that we completed the majority of our financings related to Global Atlantic in Q3, which has burdened our after-tax DE per share in advance of the revenues and earnings associated with the acquisition. And in addition to these P&L metrics, you\u2019ve seen continued acceleration in our fundraising, new capital raised in 2020 totaled $44 billion, a 72% increase compared to 2019. More on this in a couple of minutes. Moving to Page 4, you see our investment performance. This has continued to be a real strength for the firm. In 2020, our flagship private equity funds returned 32%, well ahead of the 17% and 18% total return figures of the MSCI World and S&P 500 indices. Performance here was strongest in the Americans, driven by number of digital and tech-oriented investments, as well as strong performance in some of our carve outs, Americas XII appreciated 48% over the year. In real estate, our flagship opportunistic funds appreciated 8%, which compares quite favorably to its benchmark, which appreciated 1% and negative performance across major REIT indices. And our Infrastructure III funds had a gross return of 3% well above its benchmark, which declined 7% in 2020. And our more mature Infrastructure II fund had an excellent year, appreciating 34% driven by a number of sizable monetizations. Our alternative credit flagship funds had a strong Q4, up 9% for the quarter to finish flat for the year. And as an update, our dislocation fund, which we launched in the midst of the pandemic, has continued its strong start up 16% in the fourth quarter and for the year is up over 50% on an unannualized basis. In leveraged credit, which is the largest of our credit businesses by AUM, the composite was up 7% for the year, compared to 3.8% for the LSTA. Looking at page five of the deck, investment performance has helped us continue to raise capital. We raised $12 billion in Q4 and a record $44 billion for the year, up over 70% from 2019. Notably, we brought in $17 billion of AUM for Asia strategies in 2020, representing almost 40% of new capital raised. Asia Real Estate and Asian Infrastructure both held their final closes in Q4, wrapping up two very successful first time fundraisers for us. And on top of our success in Asia, we\u2019ve grown up our core platform this quarter, with capital raised in core PE, as well as the first dollars raised in our new core infrastructure strategy. And it\u2019s worth highlighting the continued scaling of the real estate platform, driven by new capital raised at our Asia and Americas opportunistic strategies, as well as core plus real estate, AUM across the platform has increased from $9 billion a year ago to over $25 billion pro forma for GA. And we continue to have a lot of growth opportunities ahead of us. We\u2019re highlighting this on the right-hand side of the page. Looking at strategies in the market or expected to come to market over the next two years. We have four flagship strategies, 20 plus additional strategies, with GA on top of that. And I have two final items to touch on before turning the call over to Rob. First, consistent with historical practice, we\u2019re pleased to announce an increase in our annual dividend per share from $0.54 to $0.58. This change will go into effect beginning with any dividends to be announced for the first quarter of 2021. And second, we\u2019re excited to announce that we\u2019ll be hosting a virtual Investor Day, the morning of April 14th. To discuss our business in more detail and also focus on the growth we see over the coming years. We hope that you\u2019ll be able to join us then. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over Rob.\nRob Lewin: Thanks a lot, Craig. Turning our attention to Global Atlantic, as announced last week, we closed on our acquisition of GA on February the 1st. I wanted to provide some key updates. Between signing and closing, assets of GA have increased significantly. We had an oversubscribed equity co-investment process that allowed us to bring down our ownership to approximately 60% our desired level, while raising primary capital for GA at the same time. The long-term impact that we expect GA to have on our financials has increased considerably compared to the figures discussed when the transaction was announced in July 2020. And most importantly, we continue to work exceptionally well with a broad GA team. Let me spend a few minutes on some of the details. First, in terms of GA\u2019s footprint, AUM has increased from $72 billion at announcement to $90 billion at 12/31, an increase of roughly 25%. This growth in AUM between signing and closing was well ahead of our expectations. The strength of GA\u2019s platform was clearly evident in both its individual channel. GA has strong embedded relationships here with over 200 banks and broker dealers in addition to its institutional channel, where it\u2019s a leader in block, pension risk transfer and flow reinsurance. Of particular note, GA reinsured over $16 billion in three separate block acquisitions in the third and fourth quarters of 2020. So the fundamentals of the business required remained compelling. Slide six of the supplement updates you on what this asset growth does for some of our important operating metrics. Taking a look at the top half of the slide, you could see the impact on KKR as AUM, which increases 36% to $342 billion. As all of these assets will immediately hit our fee paying AUM, this acquisition results in a 48% increase in that figure from $186 billion to just over $275 billion. We now manage approximately $120 billion on behalf of insurance companies and believe we are well positioned to further partner with insurance balance sheets over time. I think the bottom half of this page is particularly worth calling out. As you\u2019ll see the transaction increases our perpetual capital by 5 times from $22 billion to $112 billion. And we now have 43% of our capital base that is either perpetual or with multi-decade recycling provisions. And 86% of our capital overall will now have a contractual life of over eight years from inception. GA provides more scale and it does so in a permanent way, meaningfully advancing several important strategic initiatives for us all at once. As GA\u2019 investment manager we are focused on bringing our asset management and origination expertise to there on behalf of Global Atlantic and its policyholders. GA already had a strong investment track record and an accomplished team of investment professionals. Working together, we believe we can further improve GA\u2019s risk adjusted return profile. Now, as it relates to the transaction itself, GA was acquired for $4.7 billion or one-time its book value at close. Following the successful co-investment process that was led by our capital markets team, we now have an approximate 60% interest in GA and we were also able to raise $250 million of primary capital, which really does set the business up nicely for future organic and inorganic growth. Of the $4.7 billion purchase price, plus $250 million primary raise, we funded our share, which is approximately $3 billion through the $1.9 billion of proceeds raised in our August mandatory convertible and senior note issuances, with the remainder coming from cash on our balance sheet. In terms of our financial results, you\u2019ll remember that there are really two ways that GA impacts our distributable earnings. The first are the management fees we generate as GA\u2019s investment manager. When we announced the transaction in July, we mentioned that we expect net management fees to increase by at least $200 million over the next couple of years as we ramp up our work with GA. This reflects management fees we earn as GA\u2019s investment manager, as well as fees generated on assets that we manage directly. This figure is net of operating expenses, which in part relate to strategies that we aren\u2019t investing directly. Given the increase in GA\u2019s assets since the announcement of the deal, our confidence around exceeding the $200 million target has certainly increased. The second way that GA impacts our P&L is through our share of their operating earnings. As noted earlier, GA\u2019s book value is approximately $5 billion. For illustrative purposes, which can help your modeling, if you assume the 12% to 13% ROE and took our 60% share, that would suggest annual earnings in the range of $360 million to 390 million running through our financials. These earnings will show up in our P&L through our insurance segment operating earnings. In terms of our financial reporting, GA is now majority on subsidiary. So we will consolidate their financials into our GAAP earnings starting in Q1. As it relates to our segment results, we will be introducing a new insurance segment that would disclose certain financial information, including our share with their adjusted operating earnings that I just referenced. We will then use this profitability measure in our walk to KKR total distributable earnings. I\u2019ll review a prototype of our segment earnings in just a few minutes. Now, this all leads nicely into the second topic related to some important changes we\u2019re making in our reporting and compensation framework more broadly in 2021. Looking at page seven of the supplement, we feel that we have never had better line of sight, better visibility into our management fees as we do right now. With GA, we\u2019ve added a significant stream of perpetual management fees. Additionally, as you heard earlier from Craig, management fees across KKR continued to scale and we\u2019re in the early stages of an active fundraising cycle that includes raises across a number of our larger benchmark strategies. Putting these two dynamics together, we have increased visibility in our fee revenue, as well as meaningful confidence in our ability to scale from here. As a result, we now have an opportunity to change our compensation framework in a way that we think should really benefit our shareholders. Currently, we talk about comp and comp margins as a percentage of our total distributable revenues. Our historical guidance here has targeted a low 40s overall comp margin. But that compensation figure has been a single number based on all forms of revenue. Starting in 2021, we are going to decouple our compensation into its component pieces. Let me walk through the changes to our framework before pulling it all together, please take a look at page eight. The first piece relates to fee-related compensation. We expect our fee-related revenue to have an annual cash comp load in the range of 20% to 25%. To be clear, given our line of sight and outlook around our fee revenues, we believe this range allows for a base level of comp to be paid across the firm in all operating environments, including years where monetization are more challenged. In terms of our other forms of compensation, for our realized performance revenue, which is primarily driven by carried interest, our range of annual cash comp is expected to be 60% to 70%. Our realized investment income from our balance sheet will have an expected cash comp load of 10% to 20%. We believe this change will benefit KKR shareholders in a number of ways. First, it will enhance the transparency of how our compensation pool gets formed and the profits we derived from our three forms of revenue. It will also create better alignment, as compensation at KKR will become even more success based and aligned with the realized investment performance of our funds. We think this change is advantageous for both our public shareholders, as well as our fund limited partners. And from a P&L perspective, this change delivers a much higher flow through of our fee-related earnings to our shareholders. We believe this will also provide greater line of sight to the drivers of the growth and margin expansion of our FRE going forward. And finally, we believe this change will make the economics from our balance sheet clear. Our balance sheet is positioned to generate excellent returns. We have averaged 21.5% over the last two years. And it does so without any fixed expenses, which are all borne by our fee revenues, and our modest and variable comp load. When you take a step back and compare these characteristics to other balance sheets, we think this is fairly unique, and with continued performance, we believe these attributes will lead to a higher multiple being applied to our balance sheet over time. Now even though we are breaking out of compensation into its component parts, we will continue to track our aggregate compensation margin, including equity-based comp. In a normalized operating environment, you should expect our comp ratio to be roughly in line with our current levels. In an environment where we have elevated levels of successful monetization, our comp margin is likely to tick up a bit. But in a more challenging environment where our monetization is are lower, you should also expect to see our comp margins go down, which will provide some level of added protection to our operating earnings. Let me repeat this part, as it\u2019s a really important piece to be clear on, these changes are not about increasing compensation on the enterprise. As an example, if we applied the midpoint of our new compensation ranges to our actual 2020 revenues, our compensation margin would have been 38.6%. This compares to our reported comp margin of 38.7% for the year. So this change is really about how our comp pool is calculated and creating more visibility and flow through of our fee revenues to our shareholders, while adding a bit more variability in our comp margin based on our performance. And we are confident we can achieve that while not increasing the overall compensation paid by the firm. In connection with these changes, you\u2019ll see that we expect to make a couple of adjustments to our financial reporting to bring it more in line with our peer set and allow for easier comparability for our investors and analysts. The first change is to build to a new simplified fully burdened fee related earnings figure with individual compensation components as described a minute ago. On this page, you can see KKR\u2019s distributable operating earnings as you think of them today, but now titled Asset Management Operating Earnings. This will then be added to our share of GA\u2019s earnings to arrive at a total distributable operating earnings line as you work your way towards after-tax distributable earnings. Please note that we\u2019ve included a more detailed prototype of our segments financial profile and definitions in the appendix on pages 10 and 11. In addition, consistent with our peers, when calculating after-tax distributable earnings going forward, we will no longer include equity-based compensation as an expense. At this point, we believe we are one of the few alternative asset management firms that reflect equity based compensation as an expense in our reported total distributable earnings. This has been a source of confusion at times, in particular, as investors look at relative valuation multiples. So we\u2019re going to conform to our peers and make it easier for our shareholders to compare results. Equity-based compensation will of course still be disclosed in our earnings release, and as we think about aggregate compensation and comp margins, it will be a key input. But it will not be included within our reported after-tax PE or after-tax PE per share metrics. And finally, let me spend a minute on our fee-related earnings. Given all of our growth avenues and the visibility that I spoke of earlier, we see a clear path for FRE to comfortably exceed $2 per share for 2022. This anticipated growth will be in spite of some large investments we intend to make across technology and distribution and marketing over the next couple of years, which we believe will benefit our FRE and DE well beyond 2022. We know FRE is an important financial metric to our investors and we intend to provide periodic updates on our progress. And with that, let me hand it off to Scott.\nScott Nuttall: Thank you, Rob. And thank you everybody for joining our call today. Given everything already covered, I\u2019m going to be brief. First, a quick comment on Global Atlantic. The GA transaction is highly strategic for KKR. It meaningfully expands our base of permanent capital, further diversifies and scales our business, and significantly grows our position within the insurance industry. The acquisition also improves the quality and visibility of our earnings. And GE\u2019s strong and experienced management team is a critical element of this transaction. We see a number of growth opportunities working with our new partners. In short, this is a meaningful development for us and we look forward to keeping you posted on our collective progress. Second, a couple thoughts on KKR more broadly. As a senior team, we just spent the better part of a week in our annual strategic planning meetings. Listening to the discussions and presentations in those sessions was incredibly energizing. In our nearly 45 years in business, we have never had a stronger management team, more line of sight to our near-term results, more ways to grow and more confidence in our future. This confidence is driving our announcements today and sharing our belief that we can comfortably exceed $2 per share in FRE next year. And even more exciting, we see significant growth beyond that. We know we have discussed a lot of information on this call. That is one of the reasons we\u2019re looking forward to our April Investor Day. We think it will be helpful for example for everyone to hear Global Atlantic CEO, Allan Levine talk about GA and its growth prospects. We\u2019ll also spend a significant amount of time detailing the building blocks of the firm\u2019s growth plans, which we think will help you understand why we are so optimistic about the path ahead for us. We thank you for your partnership, trust and time, and are happy to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we\u2019ll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bill Katz with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\nBill Katz: Okay. Thank you very much for taking the questions and thanks for the enhanced disclosure. It is super helpful. Maybe tying together two of the points you guys are highlighting. Could you unpack for us maybe the walk up to the $2 number plus for 2022, between maybe the legacy KKR platform versus GA, just given where the assets are your ownership -- perform ownership versus at the time of the deal? And then, Rob, just a point of clarification, when you mentioned your scenarios with the comp ratios and up down realization backdrop, I was a little confused by the ratio being down, would that become ratio being down or the FRE margin being down if monetization is down? Thank you.\nRob Lewin: Great. Thanks a lot, Bill, for the questions. To be clear that was the -- if we have lower monetizations, lower successful monetizations, our anticipation is that our comp ratio would be going down as we\u2019re making compensation at KKR more success-based. In terms of your question around 2022 FRE, that was really a combination of a bunch of different things that\u2019s given us confidence and being able to achieve that target out into the future. I\u2019d say, the first is management fees coming across our existing platform through our different products and geographies and the scaling that Craig referenced earlier in the call. Second piece of it is clearly the increased confidence that we have in Global Atlantic and their scaling of assets and our ability to work constructively with them. We also continue to see a lot of opportunities to scale the breadth of our products and what we cover in our Capital Markets business, as well as different clients. And so when you add all that together, inclusive of ensuring that that we monitor expense management, we feel really good that we should be able to comfortably exceed $2 per share of FRE in 2022.\nBill Katz: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi. Thank you. Curious your thoughts on the current or -- let\u2019s just call it 2021 realization backdrop. M&A is super active, stacks are even more active, markets are at their highs. I\u2019m just curious on how you balance those thoughts with the investment opportunities that are out there because you have some of your flagship funds that are only say, half invested. I know we\u2019re trying to get to the other side for more capital. So curious on how you see that landscape?\nRob Lewin: Yes. Hi, Glenn. It\u2019s Rob. Thanks for the question. And Scott will probably jump in here at some point as well. Listen, we\u2019re very constructive from a monetization perspective. And if you look at our Q1 line of sight in terms of realized carry and balance sheet revenue, as we sit here today, we feel really good that we\u2019ve got deals that are signed and are closed that would represent greater than $375 million of revenue in Q1. And so we agree that the market backdrop is one that that\u2019s quite an interesting one as it relates to being able to monetize investments.\nScott Nuttall: Yes. And Glenn, so I\u2019d say, look, we agree with your comment. We\u2019re very constructive on the backdrop for monetizations broadly and it is across the Board. There\u2019s M&A. There\u2019s strategic sales. There are sales to sponsors. There\u2019s leverage recaps, dividends, so a lot of different opportunities for us to monetize. I would also say, though, despite the overall valuation environment, we continue to be very active in terms of deployment. As we talked about in the last call, we\u2019ve been really leaning into a number of investment themes that we think will be accelerated by this period of time and so our pipelines are actually quite full as we head through the first quarter here.\nGlenn Schorr: Thanks very much. Appreciate it.\nScott Nuttall: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nAlex Blostein: Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping we cannot pack the trajectory for management fee growth a little bit more. It sounds like fundraising momentum is really strong. If we look at the deployment activity in the quarter, I think, it\u2019s been -- it was one of the best we\u2019ve seen in a long time from you guys. So, all of that feels like we could see a little bit of fast -- a little faster kind of turning on to the fees in some of the larger fund. So maybe kind of help us bridge kind of standalone KKR management fees for 2021, 2022 relative to your sort of prior targets of 50% plus growth. And then, Rob, I was hoping we could get a jumping-off point for management fees for GA specifically that will, I guess, start to come in, in the first quarter and how they expect to sort of ramp to that $200 million-plus number that you alluded to? Thanks.\nRob Lewin: Yes. Thanks a lot, Alex. And maybe I\u2019ll take the second part of your question first and then head back to the first part of it. So I think it\u2019d be probably helpful for us to break down the net management fees from Global Atlantic that we expect to receive in a few different pieces. The first is that we will have an IMA across GA\u2019s asset base. We have agreed with the regulators that our fee there will not be in excess of 30 basis points. We also intend to manage assets directly for GA where we\u2019ll charge the relevant fee rates for other similarly large investors in those strategies, offsetting both of those two fee revenue lines are some expenses, which include paying other investment managers who perform services that KKR does not perform today. The net of those three items together is really what generates the $200 million of net management fee revenue that we expect to be able to achieve a couple of years out that we talked about earlier, as well as our belief that we\u2019ve got a path to a higher number over a similar period of time. I\u2019d say, we don\u2019t have an exact time table as when those numbers will effectively be generated in large part because of the need to ramp up our own direct origination as GA\u2019s investment manager, but we feel really good and being able to achieve these numbers a couple of years from now. And so as you think about year one, which I know you asked about explicitly, I\u2019d say, that we feel good about achieving somewhere around half to two-thirds of our $200-plus million target in year one of our investment here and partnership with Global Atlantic. In terms of the second part of your question. So, obviously, we feel good about the trajectory of GA and a good start that I think we\u2019re going to have in year one and being able to ramp. I\u2019d say, we feel incrementally better about our ability to achieve 50%-plus management fee growth over, I think, we said between 2019 and 2022. And so our expectation, as you think about our 2022 FRE is that we should be north of that number, but we don\u2019t have any further guidance on the specifics.\nAlex Blostein: Great. Thank you for that.\nCraig Larson: Yes. Just one clarifying thing, Alex, on that, just to be clear. The 50-plus percent growth that Rob mentioned was organic before GA. So I think of the punch lines, we feel better about being able to meet or exceed that. And then you\u2019ve got Global Atlantic on top of that, so it gets you to the higher number obviously.\nAlex Blostein: Yes. That makes perfect sense. Great. Thanks for all the details guys.\nRob Lewin: Thanks, Alex.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gerry O\u2019Hara with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nGerry O\u2019Hara: Great. Thanks and good morning. Maybe just touching on geographic opportunities, Asia has been clearly a source of strength throughout 2020 both in terms of fundraising, but I think also other capital metrics. Perhaps you could give us a little color on what 2021 might have in store for outlook just in terms of some of the channel capital formation trends? Thank you.\nCraig Larson: Hi, Jerry. It\u2019s Craig. Why don\u2019t I start there, and I think, Scott may add on. So look, I think, in many ways when we think of deployment, the interesting aspect here really relates to the increasing balance of the firm. So historically private markets deployment was clearly driven by private equity and we\u2019ve seen in the last handful of years. You\u2019re correct, Asia, be very strong for us and I think we do expect deployment in the region again to be active as Scott had alluded to earlier. But I think in many ways, one of the other interesting points here really relates to the growth in real assets footprint for us, so infrastructure, real estate energy. And I think, there is a real opportunity for more balanced deployment for us given that scaling. So infra at this point, the business is global. The team is busy everywhere. In real estate, we mentioned in the prepared remarks, the growth of the platform. We\u2019ve seen a significant ramp. So I think, overall, we look at the opportunity for us as being meaningful given the various pools of capital that we have really across geographies.\nScott Nuttall: Yes. The only thing I\u2019d add Gerry is that, it -- we continue to see these opportunities across a number of these investment themes that we\u2019ve discussed. And Asia, of course, is at the most part come out of the COVID period more quickly than other parts of the world. And so we are kind of seeing more regular activity levels on the ground in a number of those markets.\nGerry O\u2019Hara: Helpful. Thanks.\nScott Nuttall: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Please proceed with your question.\nPatrick Davitt: Hi. Good morning, guys. My question is on the kind of compensation shift. Does this come with kind of explicit discussions with employees that going to be paid difference in years with few realizations? I guess in another words, do we have your assurance that in a bad realization you\u2019re not suddenly going to have a 30% or 35% FRE compensation ratio? And through that lens do you worry this could create retention issues and bad realization years that people are getting paid meaningfully less than other firms.\nRob Lewin: Yes. Hi, Patrick. It\u2019s Rob. Let me start off. So I think a really important component of this change is the fact that we feel like we\u2019re able to make this change today given the scaling of our management fee growth based on what we\u2019ve had historically and what we see prospectively over the next couple of years, inclusive of the GA acquisition. And so we feel today that we\u2019re at that inflection point where we will be able to compensate our firm based on the fee revenues that we have today in downside scenarios. In terms of employee communication, of course, this is something that we\u2019ve been closely linked up with our senior employees on, and I would say, this type of change impacts our senior employees by far the most. And a couple of comments there, one, our senior employees are all big shareholders of KKR and we think that this is certainly a benefit to our shareholders. That\u2019s why we did it. We think our senior employees are also more used to more variability and their annual compensation based on performance. Frankly, it\u2019s something I think they like as part of their overall compensation framework. And as we think about being competitive in the market for talent, we certainly see that dynamic where for senior talent there is more variability and compensation for performance.\nScott Nuttall: Hey, Patrick. It\u2019s Scott. Just to jump on, I think, the basic question is, do we plan to stick to it. The answer is yes. We\u2019ve been talking about this potential change internally for the last few years and working to Rob\u2019s point to get to the scale and diversity and visibility where we thought, we could tell you this and stick to it. And you know us well, right, we are deliberate people, we are very careful about what we commit to and we do not intend to let you or our shareholders down. So we would not announce this unless we\u2019re confident we can deliver in these comp ranges in all operating environments. And to Rob\u2019s point, yes, we talked about this with the partners of the firm. Everybody gets the alignment. We own over 30% or 35% of the stock, give or take. So we think it\u2019s the right change and we\u2019ve kind of been building toward it for the last several years.\nPatrick Davitt: Great. Thank you.\nScott Nuttall: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nScott Nuttall: Good morning.\nCraig Siegenthaler: I wanted to come back to your comments on our Global Atlantic. So we will launch GA expand in the disability with the year end transaction last year. So I wanted to see if you could talk about some of the other insurance verticals that GA could expand into really outside of annuities and could we see additional disability transactions in 2021?\nScott Nuttall: Thanks for the question, Craig. It\u2019s Scott. First off, I think, you\u2019re right, we did the transaction with the book was the disability book. It was -- suffice it to say it was structured in such a way that it was much closer to an annuity book and a disability book in terms of what it means for us. So it really is not us taking different kinds of risks at Global Atlantic. It\u2019s more just the transaction was structured to make it the risk that we want to take. And as we talked about the prior calls, we really like that the GA team is very focused on taking particular kinds of risks. So you shouldn\u2019t take that as any change in strategy. In terms of the other insurance verticals, I think, for the time being you should expect that we\u2019re going to stay focused on annuities, life and the other existing businesses of Global Atlantic. We don\u2019t have any plans to meaningfully change that and we\u2019ll continue to execute that through the individual channel and the institutional channel as we\u2019ve discussed in its various forms. But we\u2019ll keep you posted. Never say never in terms of the evolution of the strategy, but we\u2019re focused on what got us here.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you, Scott.\nScott Nuttall: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nDevin Ryan: Okay. Great. Good morning, everyone.\nScott Nuttall: Good morning.\nDevin Ryan: I want to ask a question here on the capital markets business and really just trying to get a little bit more context around how the platform is scaled over the past couple of years or any stats you can provide around the size, number of people, any incremental capabilities. Really what I\u2019m just looking to kind of think about is parsing through what\u2019s been a very good backdrop for the business and obviously you guys have evolved here versus how the broader platform has grown? And then just kind of as a follow on to that, any additional color for what you\u2019re expecting on the business for 2021?\nRob Lewin: Hey, Devin. Let me take that one. So I think it\u2019s a really good question. As we think about the scaling of our capital markets platform, I\u2019d say, it\u2019s really in three components. The first was really around geographic breadth. And as you know this business started really as predominantly a U.S. centric business, but we\u2019ve got a highly skilled team of capital markets professionals that today are all over the world supporting KKRs businesses all over the world, we talked about it earlier. But KKRs capital deployment for the year was pretty well spread out between the Americas, Europe and Asia, and that was all covered by our capital markets team. Second thing is really about building out the product capability to be able to follow KKRs evolution from a product standpoint. So as we\u2019ve expanded into asset classes like infrastructure and real estate and aspects of structured and principal credit. Our capital markets team has fallen alongside and we\u2019ve gone out and recruited what we think is best-in-class talent to cover those areas. And then the last piece of it is really our approach, what we think -- a really unique approach to non-KKR clients and being able to cover those clients, being able to speak for capital structures. We think in a really unique way in a way that\u2019s highly coordinated with our credit pools of capital as well. And that\u2019s our expanding part of our business in the U.S., but also in Europe and in aspects of Asia as well. We\u2019re starting to get some real traction. And so I think when you add that altogether, that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing scaling of that business over time and that duration of that business. As we look out a few years, we certainly see continued meaningful growth over and above the levels that we\u2019ve been operating in over the last couple of years. So we\u2019re excited about the outlook for that business and what we think it could become over time.\nDevin Ryan: Okay. Very helpful. Thank you, guys.\nScott Nuttall: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeremy Campbell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nJeremy Campbell: Hey. Thanks, guys, and thanks for all the great color today with the new info. It\u2019s very helpful. Just wanted to check in here with maybe a little bit more of a simplistic question, for newer investors coming to KKR taking a look that $2 plus FRE target in 2022 is very helpful. I might also be hoping to get some color on the growth algorithm for FRE going forward? Scott, you had noted earlier that the prior fee revenue guide was 50%, which kind of translates to mid-teens topline CAGR, but that didn\u2019t include insurance. And then Rob, I think you had mentioned also some potential for FRE margin expansion. So, kind of just putting these pieces together over time would it be fair to think about a medium to long run FRE growth cadence of somewhere in the mid-teens, mid-teens plus?\nRob Lewin: Yes. Hey, Jeremy. So, we\u2019re not going to on this call provide guidance beyond 2022 and I think as we get to our Investor Day in April, we could provide a little bit more substance about what we see from a longer term growth trajectory perspective. Suffice it to say that we\u2019ve got a lot of things that have quite a bit of momentum across the firm right now still a number of young strategies. So it\u2019s not just about the next two years growth, in terms of how we see our platform developing. And we think, asset management, capital markets and insurance will all be growers in a fairly robust way over the next several years and not just over the next couple.\nScott Nuttall: Hey, Jeremy. It\u2019s Scott. Look it\u2019s an astute question. We\u2019ll try to shed some light directionally for you in April.\nJeremy Campbell: Got it. Thanks guys.\nScott Nuttall: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Carrier: Great. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Just given the growth you\u2019ve seen in book value, you now have GA business and then the strategic outlook. Just curious, any change or shift in how you\u2019re thinking about the balance sheet, including level of monetization and capital management moving forward?\nRob Lewin: Yes. Hey Mike. No change. We\u2019re going to go through the same process we go through every year as we think about our balance sheet and how we manage our capital allocation. The first point is always is how we think about return of capital to shareholders. As you know, this quarter, we announced an increase in our dividend from $0.54 to $0.58. Craig also noted in his prepared remarks that we\u2019re going to continue to opportunistically over time repurchase shares to keep our share count flat for employee dilution. And then, most importantly is to be able to strategically reinvest our capital base back into our business for growth. There is no better example of that type of transaction than what we were able to accomplish this past year with Global Atlantic.\nScott Nuttall: Hey, Mike. It\u2019s Scott. Just one other thing, as you know, we remain very focused on compounding, just compounding our AUM, compounding our balance sheet. We think the additional Global Atlantic will allow us to do both of those things at a faster rate over time. So no change is expected.\nMike Carrier: Got it. Thanks a lot.\nScott Nuttall: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Robert Lee with KBW. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Lee: Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Since -- maybe I\u2019ll try to squeeze in a two-part. The first one is, first part of it is, can you maybe update us just giving the robust fundraising you\u2019ve had and your robust outlook? Maybe update us on kind of your cross-sell within your LP base and any kind of metrics you can share like how many of your LPs are invested in two to three or more products and kind of where your penetration of Global LP stands? And then second part is really going back to an earlier question, you guys have always been known for having I believe kind of one comp pool and plus the firm as opposed having people have specific points on specific funds per se. I\u2019m assuming with the changes that that your traditional approach to your comp pool hasn\u2019t changed?\nCraig Larson: Hey, Rob. It\u2019s Craig. Why don\u2019t I take the first part of that and thanks for the question on cross-selling. Look, I think, we continue to make very good progress at year end. We were at about 1,200 investors at this point, approaching that level and that continues to be a real focus for us, first in terms of increasing the overall breadth of our LP base. We held as we mentioned the final close in the fourth quarter of our Asia Infrastructure fund. And 25% of the LPs in that fund are new fund investors to KKR. We love seeing statistics like that. And then as it relates to the cross-sell, at this point, we\u2019re about two products per client. We\u2019ve seen that number continue to migrate up, but it migrates up slowly honestly, because as you\u2019re adding clients. You\u2019re typically adding the one product at a time. Our largest category of client averages almost five products per client. So I think as we look overall, we still see significant opportunities for us both in terms of increasing the overall number of LPs, as well as those cross-sell statistics. And I think in addition to that, when we think of areas like us and retail again see continued long-term opportunities for us.\nRob Lewin: Yes. And on the second part of your question, Rob, no change. What we\u2019re really talking about is how the compensation pool is calculated. We\u2019re not changing in terms -- the approach we\u2019ve taken, which we think is really important culturally for us that everybody participates in everything. So it\u2019s more about the -- how the aggregate is calculated, how it\u2019s shared.\nRobert Lee: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.\nScott Nuttall: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Harris: Yes. Hey, Rob. How should we be thinking about the tax rate on a pro forma basis. And then the insurance segment operating earnings that you highlighted of $360 million to $390 million, is that pretax or an after-tax number?\nRob Lewin: Yes. So as we build up our P&L we\u2019re going to show our insurance segment on an after-tax basis to answer your question specifically there and as it relates to KKRs overall tax expense, no change to prior guidance. Overtime, we would expect to see our tax rate migrate up to statutory rate in the low 20s, but that will take some time as we start off quite a bit deferred tax asset from the C-Corp conversion a couple years back.\nScott Nuttall: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Cyprus with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Cyprus: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to circle back on the comp changes, maybe just on the equity comp, that\u2019s now excluded from the earnings framework going forward, just curious what the outlook is for equity comp to grow from there. I think it was $246 million level or so here in 2020. And then could you also just talk about the underpinning for the 60% to 70% carried interest comp ratio, just how you thought about setting that I think it\u2019s a bit different from maybe where it was five years or six years ago and a little bit different from some of the peers. So just curious how you\u2019re thinking about that?\nRob Lewin: Sure. Thanks a lot for the question, Mike. So on equity-based comp, one, it\u2019s very important to understand, as we look at aggregate compensation margin, we\u2019re going to continue to do that and we\u2019re going to continue to look at that inclusive of equity-based comp and it\u2019s a core component. As you think about 2021, the expectation should be that we should have modest growth in that line item commensurate with the growth of the firm. So, as you noted, we were in the mid-$240s in 2020. I could see that number being in the $250 million to $300 million range in 2021. And as we thought about the 60% to 70% comp margin on performance revenues, a lot of different variables went into that inclusive of how we thought about comp ranges on our other forms of revenue. We also looked at the competitive framework, not just some of the big alternatives firms that went public at the same time of us, but some firms that went public after us with different comp ratios and we thought about the competitive dynamic with our own people and the number of firms that we compete against for talent that have compensation pools on carried interest that are effectively 100%. And so it was a really looking at all of those different factors and coming up with the range of 60% to 70% that we thought was appropriate.\nMichael Cyprus: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Arnaud Giblat with Exane. Please proceed with your question.\nArnaud Giblat: Yes. So it\u2019s Arnaud Giblat from Exane BNP. A quick question please. Can you talk about the opportunities you see to grow Global Atlantic through bolt-on deals? And more generally, do you see opportunities to accelerate growth targeted in new strategies through bolt-ons? Thank you.\nRob Lewin: Thank you for the question. The short answer is, we see a significant number of ways we and Global Atlantic can grow together. I think the first and the primary focus is going to be doing that on an organic basis. And so the business itself really goes to market in two channels. The first is the individual channel where we have distribution relationships with 200 plus bank and broker dealers. So you should expect us to continue to scale organically through that channel. Secondly is the institutional channel where it\u2019s really executed in three different ways, blocks which Rob mentioned, we did $16 billion in Q3 and Q4 last year. But there is also flow reinsurance relationships, there is pension risk transfer opportunities until we see at least those three different ways to grow institutionally as well. So the primary focus right now is growing organically through those different channels and relationships. There are opportunities to your point also consider acquisitions over time. The Global Atlantic management team has done a number of acquisitions through their history and then it could also be another opportunity for us as we go forward. Nothing on the drawing board right now, but that is an opportunity to your point is something that we\u2019re keeping an eye on. And then I would also say the last thing that we\u2019re focused on. Although, it\u2019s going to take a good amount of time and energy in the near-term here in particular is ways that we could jointly developed products and then also potentially leverage Global Atlantic\u2019s distribution for things that KKR is doing. And so that could be another area of growth for us as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Kotowski: Yes. Good morning and thank you. I wanted to go back to how we should expect to see the Global Atlantic revenues flowing through the P&L since for all ramping up our models and starting over anyway? But presumably the 30 basis points or let\u2019s call it 25 basis points that goes against or under the IMA, presumably that hits upfront and so, say, if you figure 25 basis points on $90 billion that\u2019s somehow kind of like $225 million gross that you would have? And so presumably there is $100 million of expense or thereabouts of expense and comp that goes against that. And then presumably over time as you move those assets into your fund strategies, then we should see the revenues build up? Is that kind of the way we should think about it as we model out the next four or six, eight quarters?\nRob Lewin: Yes. Thanks Chris. Look, I think, you\u2019re directionally in the right ballpark. And that\u2019s right as we built up to the net $200 million plus over the next couple of years. We got there through the IMA fee. We got there through on an assumption around how we\u2019re going to ramp up investing assets directly on behalf of GA, offsetting that with the amount of investment expenses and other expenses that we\u2019ll need to bear inclusive of other asset managers for the GA balance sheet. Today we are doing things KKR doesn\u2019t do. And so when you add all those things together, you\u2019re getting to that $200 plus number. And as you think about year one, our ability to achieve 50% to 75% -- 50%, excuse me, to two-thirds of that seems reasonably in line with the math that you went through.\nChris Kotowski: Okay. And just if I could squeeze in one more. When I did back of the envelope kind of reverse engineering your comp ratio for 2020 I got to something around 36% using your methodology, it will be slightly lower than what we actually saw, could that be right?\nRob Lewin: No. As we looked at it and if we looked at the midpoint of the ranges that we outlined, it\u2019s a 38.6% number.\nChris Kotowski: Okay.\nRob Lewin: And just to be clear because I think it could impact some of your numbers, as we think about the incentive fees against Marshall Wace we\u2019re assuming that that gets comped in the balance sheet revenue, a number of 10% to 20% comp range as opposed to our realized performance revenue number and that\u2019s what could be creating a little bit of delta with some of your numbers.\nChris Kotowski: Okay. All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. And then thanks for all the color and clarification really helpful. Most of my questions have been answered, but maybe just one back on the FRE confidence of over $2? Maybe if you just comment on a little bit on the fundraising side of that, it looks to me like you\u2019d be able to exceed the 2020 annual level of fundraising each of the next two years based on the fund profile? So I just wanted to sanity check if that seems right given and maybe I guess the flagship component of that obviously would be large and just sort of the cadence of timing of that. And then what you\u2019re assuming for capital markets business fees in that $2, is that the level of 2020 at least or do we expect growth on that?\nScott Nuttall: Hey, Brian. It\u2019s Scott. We\u2019re not going to be able to share with you kind of fundraising guidance or capital markets revenue guidance. I think if you look at page five of the supplemental materials, you can see on the right-hand side, all of the strategies we have coming to market, including the number of flagship strategies. And so, I think as long as the fundraising environment stays with us and it\u2019s probably frankly improved a bit since the last time we talked. We do feel good about our ability to meaningfully scale our AUM from here and have good fundraising outcomes in the next couple of years. We\u2019re not going to put a precise number on it, but we feel good on a kind of a team in place basis and then we\u2019re also making new investments in distribution as well that we\u2019ll talk about more in April. Capital markets had a very nice year last year after a quiet spring given the pandemic. And we do see real opportunities to scale there as well. We\u2019ve incorporated all of that go into kind of the FRE guidance we gave you, where we said, we could comfortably exceed $2 per share. That is incorporated into that statement and that guidance and the outcomes we think can be a bit fungible, but both fundraising KCM, Global Atlantic and all the other ways we have to win re incorporated in that message.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Okay. Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.\nScott Nuttall: Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we\u2019ve reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Craig Larson for closing comments.\nCraig Larson: So thank you everybody for your time and attention. We know that we had a number of items to impact this quarter. We\u2019re always available of course for any follow-ups. In saying that, we look forward to seeing everybody, starting with everybody next quarter and again at the April Investor Day event. So thanks again.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and we thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rob Lewin",
            "content": "Thanks a lot, Craig. Turning our attention to Global Atlantic, as announced last week, we closed on our acquisition of GA on February the 1st. I wanted to provide some key updates. Between signing and closing, assets of GA have increased significantly. We had an oversubscribed equity co-investment process that allowed us to bring down our ownership to approximately 60% our desired level, while raising primary capital for GA at the same time. The long-term impact that we expect GA to have on our financials has increased considerably compared to the figures discussed when the transaction was announced in July 2020. And most importantly, we continue to work exceptionally well with a broad GA team. Let me spend a few minutes on some of the details. First, in terms of GA's footprint, AUM has increased from $72 billion at announcement to $90 billion at 12/31, an increase of roughly 25%. This growth in AUM between signing and closing was well ahead of our expectations. The strength of GA's platform was clearly evident in both its individual channel. GA has strong embedded relationships here with over 200 banks and broker dealers in addition to its institutional channel, where it's a leader in block, pension risk transfer and flow reinsurance. Of particular note, GA reinsured over $16 billion in three separate block acquisitions in the third and fourth quarters of 2020. So the fundamentals of the business required remained compelling. Slide six of the supplement updates you on what this asset growth does for some of our important operating metrics. Taking a look at the top half of the slide, you could see the impact on KKR as AUM, which increases 36% to $342 billion. As all of these assets will immediately hit our fee paying AUM, this acquisition results in a 48% increase in that figure from $186 billion to just over $275 billion. We now manage approximately $120 billion on behalf of insurance companies and believe we are well positioned to further partner with insurance balance sheets over time. I think the bottom half of this page is particularly worth calling out. As you'll see the transaction increases our perpetual capital by 5 times from $22 billion to $112 billion. And we now have 43% of our capital base that is either perpetual or with multi-decade recycling provisions. And 86% of our capital overall will now have a contractual life of over eight years from inception. GA provides more scale and it does so in a permanent way, meaningfully advancing several important strategic initiatives for us all at once. As GA' investment manager we are focused on bringing our asset management and origination expertise to there on behalf of Global Atlantic and its policyholders. GA already had a strong investment track record and an accomplished team of investment professionals. Working together, we believe we can further improve GA's risk adjusted return profile. Now, as it relates to the transaction itself, GA was acquired for $4.7 billion or one-time its book value at close. Following the successful co-investment process that was led by our capital markets team, we now have an approximate 60% interest in GA and we were also able to raise $250 million of primary capital, which really does set the business up nicely for future organic and inorganic growth. Of the $4.7 billion purchase price, plus $250 million primary raise, we funded our share, which is approximately $3 billion through the $1.9 billion of proceeds raised in our August mandatory convertible and senior note issuances, with the remainder coming from cash on our balance sheet. In terms of our financial results, you'll remember that there are really two ways that GA impacts our distributable earnings. The first are the management fees we generate as GA's investment manager. When we announced the transaction in July, we mentioned that we expect net management fees to increase by at least $200 million over the next couple of years as we ramp up our work with GA. This reflects management fees we earn as GA's investment manager, as well as fees generated on assets that we manage directly. This figure is net of operating expenses, which in part relate to strategies that we aren't investing directly. Given the increase in GA's assets since the announcement of the deal, our confidence around exceeding the $200 million target has certainly increased. The second way that GA impacts our P&L is through our share of their operating earnings. As noted earlier, GA's book value is approximately $5 billion. For illustrative purposes, which can help your modeling, if you assume the 12% to 13% ROE and took our 60% share, that would suggest annual earnings in the range of $360 million to 390 million running through our financials. These earnings will show up in our P&L through our insurance segment operating earnings. In terms of our financial reporting, GA is now majority on subsidiary. So we will consolidate their financials into our GAAP earnings starting in Q1. As it relates to our segment results, we will be introducing a new insurance segment that would disclose certain financial information, including our share with their adjusted operating earnings that I just referenced. We will then use this profitability measure in our walk to KKR total distributable earnings. I'll review a prototype of our segment earnings in just a few minutes. Now, this all leads nicely into the second topic related to some important changes we're making in our reporting and compensation framework more broadly in 2021. Looking at page seven of the supplement, we feel that we have never had better line of sight, better visibility into our management fees as we do right now. With GA, we've added a significant stream of perpetual management fees. Additionally, as you heard earlier from Craig, management fees across KKR continued to scale and we're in the early stages of an active fundraising cycle that includes raises across a number of our larger benchmark strategies. Putting these two dynamics together, we have increased visibility in our fee revenue, as well as meaningful confidence in our ability to scale from here. As a result, we now have an opportunity to change our compensation framework in a way that we think should really benefit our shareholders. Currently, we talk about comp and comp margins as a percentage of our total distributable revenues. Our historical guidance here has targeted a low 40s overall comp margin. But that compensation figure has been a single number based on all forms of revenue. Starting in 2021, we are going to decouple our compensation into its component pieces. Let me walk through the changes to our framework before pulling it all together, please take a look at page eight. The first piece relates to fee-related compensation. We expect our fee-related revenue to have an annual cash comp load in the range of 20% to 25%. To be clear, given our line of sight and outlook around our fee revenues, we believe this range allows for a base level of comp to be paid across the firm in all operating environments, including years where monetization are more challenged. In terms of our other forms of compensation, for our realized performance revenue, which is primarily driven by carried interest, our range of annual cash comp is expected to be 60% to 70%. Our realized investment income from our balance sheet will have an expected cash comp load of 10% to 20%. We believe this change will benefit KKR shareholders in a number of ways. First, it will enhance the transparency of how our compensation pool gets formed and the profits we derived from our three forms of revenue. It will also create better alignment, as compensation at KKR will become even more success based and aligned with the realized investment performance of our funds. We think this change is advantageous for both our public shareholders, as well as our fund limited partners. And from a P&L perspective, this change delivers a much higher flow through of our fee-related earnings to our shareholders. We believe this will also provide greater line of sight to the drivers of the growth and margin expansion of our FRE going forward. And finally, we believe this change will make the economics from our balance sheet clear. Our balance sheet is positioned to generate excellent returns. We have averaged 21.5% over the last two years. And it does so without any fixed expenses, which are all borne by our fee revenues, and our modest and variable comp load. When you take a step back and compare these characteristics to other balance sheets, we think this is fairly unique, and with continued performance, we believe these attributes will lead to a higher multiple being applied to our balance sheet over time. Now even though we are breaking out of compensation into its component parts, we will continue to track our aggregate compensation margin, including equity-based comp. In a normalized operating environment, you should expect our comp ratio to be roughly in line with our current levels. In an environment where we have elevated levels of successful monetization, our comp margin is likely to tick up a bit. But in a more challenging environment where our monetization is are lower, you should also expect to see our comp margins go down, which will provide some level of added protection to our operating earnings. Let me repeat this part, as it's a really important piece to be clear on, these changes are not about increasing compensation on the enterprise. As an example, if we applied the midpoint of our new compensation ranges to our actual 2020 revenues, our compensation margin would have been 38.6%. This compares to our reported comp margin of 38.7% for the year. So this change is really about how our comp pool is calculated and creating more visibility and flow through of our fee revenues to our shareholders, while adding a bit more variability in our comp margin based on our performance. And we are confident we can achieve that while not increasing the overall compensation paid by the firm. In connection with these changes, you'll see that we expect to make a couple of adjustments to our financial reporting to bring it more in line with our peer set and allow for easier comparability for our investors and analysts. The first change is to build to a new simplified fully burdened fee related earnings figure with individual compensation components as described a minute ago. On this page, you can see KKR's distributable operating earnings as you think of them today, but now titled Asset Management Operating Earnings. This will then be added to our share of GA's earnings to arrive at a total distributable operating earnings line as you work your way towards after-tax distributable earnings. Please note that we've included a more detailed prototype of our segments financial profile and definitions in the appendix on pages 10 and 11. In addition, consistent with our peers, when calculating after-tax distributable earnings going forward, we will no longer include equity-based compensation as an expense. At this point, we believe we are one of the few alternative asset management firms that reflect equity based compensation as an expense in our reported total distributable earnings. This has been a source of confusion at times, in particular, as investors look at relative valuation multiples. So we're going to conform to our peers and make it easier for our shareholders to compare results. Equity-based compensation will of course still be disclosed in our earnings release, and as we think about aggregate compensation and comp margins, it will be a key input. But it will not be included within our reported after-tax PE or after-tax PE per share metrics. And finally, let me spend a minute on our fee-related earnings. Given all of our growth avenues and the visibility that I spoke of earlier, we see a clear path for FRE to comfortably exceed $2 per share for 2022. This anticipated growth will be in spite of some large investments we intend to make across technology and distribution and marketing over the next couple of years, which we believe will benefit our FRE and DE well beyond 2022. We know FRE is an important financial metric to our investors and we intend to provide periodic updates on our progress. And with that, let me hand it off to Scott. Great. Thanks a lot, Bill, for the questions. To be clear that was the -- if we have lower monetizations, lower successful monetizations, our anticipation is that our comp ratio would be going down as we're making compensation at KKR more success-based. In terms of your question around 2022 FRE, that was really a combination of a bunch of different things that's given us confidence and being able to achieve that target out into the future. I'd say, the first is management fees coming across our existing platform through our different products and geographies and the scaling that Craig referenced earlier in the call. Second piece of it is clearly the increased confidence that we have in Global Atlantic and their scaling of assets and our ability to work constructively with them. We also continue to see a lot of opportunities to scale the breadth of our products and what we cover in our Capital Markets business, as well as different clients. And so when you add all that together, inclusive of ensuring that that we monitor expense management, we feel really good that we should be able to comfortably exceed $2 per share of FRE in 2022. Yes. Hi, Glenn. It's Rob. Thanks for the question. And Scott will probably jump in here at some point as well. Listen, we're very constructive from a monetization perspective. And if you look at our Q1 line of sight in terms of realized carry and balance sheet revenue, as we sit here today, we feel really good that we've got deals that are signed and are closed that would represent greater than $375 million of revenue in Q1. And so we agree that the market backdrop is one that that's quite an interesting one as it relates to being able to monetize investments. Yes. Thanks a lot, Alex. And maybe I'll take the second part of your question first and then head back to the first part of it. So I think it'd be probably helpful for us to break down the net management fees from Global Atlantic that we expect to receive in a few different pieces. The first is that we will have an IMA across GA's asset base. We have agreed with the regulators that our fee there will not be in excess of 30 basis points. We also intend to manage assets directly for GA where we'll charge the relevant fee rates for other similarly large investors in those strategies, offsetting both of those two fee revenue lines are some expenses, which include paying other investment managers who perform services that KKR does not perform today. The net of those three items together is really what generates the $200 million of net management fee revenue that we expect to be able to achieve a couple of years out that we talked about earlier, as well as our belief that we've got a path to a higher number over a similar period of time. I'd say, we don't have an exact time table as when those numbers will effectively be generated in large part because of the need to ramp up our own direct origination as GA's investment manager, but we feel really good and being able to achieve these numbers a couple of years from now. And so as you think about year one, which I know you asked about explicitly, I'd say, that we feel good about achieving somewhere around half to two-thirds of our $200-plus million target in year one of our investment here and partnership with Global Atlantic. In terms of the second part of your question. So, obviously, we feel good about the trajectory of GA and a good start that I think we're going to have in year one and being able to ramp. I'd say, we feel incrementally better about our ability to achieve 50%-plus management fee growth over, I think, we said between 2019 and 2022. And so our expectation, as you think about our 2022 FRE is that we should be north of that number, but we don't have any further guidance on the specifics. Thanks, Alex. Yes. Hi, Patrick. It's Rob. Let me start off. So I think a really important component of this change is the fact that we feel like we're able to make this change today given the scaling of our management fee growth based on what we've had historically and what we see prospectively over the next couple of years, inclusive of the GA acquisition. And so we feel today that we're at that inflection point where we will be able to compensate our firm based on the fee revenues that we have today in downside scenarios. In terms of employee communication, of course, this is something that we've been closely linked up with our senior employees on, and I would say, this type of change impacts our senior employees by far the most. And a couple of comments there, one, our senior employees are all big shareholders of KKR and we think that this is certainly a benefit to our shareholders. That's why we did it. We think our senior employees are also more used to more variability and their annual compensation based on performance. Frankly, it's something I think they like as part of their overall compensation framework. And as we think about being competitive in the market for talent, we certainly see that dynamic where for senior talent there is more variability and compensation for performance. Hey, Devin. Let me take that one. So I think it's a really good question. As we think about the scaling of our capital markets platform, I'd say, it's really in three components. The first was really around geographic breadth. And as you know this business started really as predominantly a U.S. centric business, but we've got a highly skilled team of capital markets professionals that today are all over the world supporting KKRs businesses all over the world, we talked about it earlier. But KKRs capital deployment for the year was pretty well spread out between the Americas, Europe and Asia, and that was all covered by our capital markets team. Second thing is really about building out the product capability to be able to follow KKRs evolution from a product standpoint. So as we've expanded into asset classes like infrastructure and real estate and aspects of structured and principal credit. Our capital markets team has fallen alongside and we've gone out and recruited what we think is best-in-class talent to cover those areas. And then the last piece of it is really our approach, what we think -- a really unique approach to non-KKR clients and being able to cover those clients, being able to speak for capital structures. We think in a really unique way in a way that's highly coordinated with our credit pools of capital as well. And that's our expanding part of our business in the U.S., but also in Europe and in aspects of Asia as well. We're starting to get some real traction. And so I think when you add that altogether, that's why you're seeing scaling of that business over time and that duration of that business. As we look out a few years, we certainly see continued meaningful growth over and above the levels that we've been operating in over the last couple of years. So we're excited about the outlook for that business and what we think it could become over time. Yes. Hey, Jeremy. So, we're not going to on this call provide guidance beyond 2022 and I think as we get to our Investor Day in April, we could provide a little bit more substance about what we see from a longer term growth trajectory perspective. Suffice it to say that we've got a lot of things that have quite a bit of momentum across the firm right now still a number of young strategies. So it's not just about the next two years growth, in terms of how we see our platform developing. And we think, asset management, capital markets and insurance will all be growers in a fairly robust way over the next several years and not just over the next couple. Yes. Hey Mike. No change. We're going to go through the same process we go through every year as we think about our balance sheet and how we manage our capital allocation. The first point is always is how we think about return of capital to shareholders. As you know, this quarter, we announced an increase in our dividend from $0.54 to $0.58. Craig also noted in his prepared remarks that we're going to continue to opportunistically over time repurchase shares to keep our share count flat for employee dilution. And then, most importantly is to be able to strategically reinvest our capital base back into our business for growth. There is no better example of that type of transaction than what we were able to accomplish this past year with Global Atlantic. Yes. And on the second part of your question, Rob, no change. What we're really talking about is how the compensation pool is calculated. We're not changing in terms -- the approach we've taken, which we think is really important culturally for us that everybody participates in everything. So it's more about the -- how the aggregate is calculated, how it's shared. Yes. So as we build up our P&L we're going to show our insurance segment on an after-tax basis to answer your question specifically there and as it relates to KKRs overall tax expense, no change to prior guidance. Overtime, we would expect to see our tax rate migrate up to statutory rate in the low 20s, but that will take some time as we start off quite a bit deferred tax asset from the C-Corp conversion a couple years back. Sure. Thanks a lot for the question, Mike. So on equity-based comp, one, it's very important to understand, as we look at aggregate compensation margin, we're going to continue to do that and we're going to continue to look at that inclusive of equity-based comp and it's a core component. As you think about 2021, the expectation should be that we should have modest growth in that line item commensurate with the growth of the firm. So, as you noted, we were in the mid-$240s in 2020. I could see that number being in the $250 million to $300 million range in 2021. And as we thought about the 60% to 70% comp margin on performance revenues, a lot of different variables went into that inclusive of how we thought about comp ranges on our other forms of revenue. We also looked at the competitive framework, not just some of the big alternatives firms that went public at the same time of us, but some firms that went public after us with different comp ratios and we thought about the competitive dynamic with our own people and the number of firms that we compete against for talent that have compensation pools on carried interest that are effectively 100%. And so it was a really looking at all of those different factors and coming up with the range of 60% to 70% that we thought was appropriate. Thank you for the question. The short answer is, we see a significant number of ways we and Global Atlantic can grow together. I think the first and the primary focus is going to be doing that on an organic basis. And so the business itself really goes to market in two channels. The first is the individual channel where we have distribution relationships with 200 plus bank and broker dealers. So you should expect us to continue to scale organically through that channel. Secondly is the institutional channel where it's really executed in three different ways, blocks which Rob mentioned, we did $16 billion in Q3 and Q4 last year. But there is also flow reinsurance relationships, there is pension risk transfer opportunities until we see at least those three different ways to grow institutionally as well. So the primary focus right now is growing organically through those different channels and relationships. There are opportunities to your point also consider acquisitions over time. The Global Atlantic management team has done a number of acquisitions through their history and then it could also be another opportunity for us as we go forward. Nothing on the drawing board right now, but that is an opportunity to your point is something that we're keeping an eye on. And then I would also say the last thing that we're focused on. Although, it's going to take a good amount of time and energy in the near-term here in particular is ways that we could jointly developed products and then also potentially leverage Global Atlantic's distribution for things that KKR is doing. And so that could be another area of growth for us as well. Yes. Thanks Chris. Look, I think, you're directionally in the right ballpark. And that's right as we built up to the net $200 million plus over the next couple of years. We got there through the IMA fee. We got there through on an assumption around how we're going to ramp up investing assets directly on behalf of GA, offsetting that with the amount of investment expenses and other expenses that we'll need to bear inclusive of other asset managers for the GA balance sheet. Today we are doing things KKR doesn't do. And so when you add all those things together, you're getting to that $200 plus number. And as you think about year one, our ability to achieve 50% to 75% -- 50%, excuse me, to two-thirds of that seems reasonably in line with the math that you went through. No. As we looked at it and if we looked at the midpoint of the ranges that we outlined, it's a 38.6% number. And just to be clear because I think it could impact some of your numbers, as we think about the incentive fees against Marshall Wace we're assuming that that gets comped in the balance sheet revenue, a number of 10% to 20% comp range as opposed to our realized performance revenue number and that's what could be creating a little bit of delta with some of your numbers."

            "content": "Thank you, Rob. And thank you everybody for joining our call today. Given everything already covered, I'm going to be brief. First, a quick comment on Global Atlantic. The GA transaction is highly strategic for KKR. It meaningfully expands our base of permanent capital, further diversifies and scales our business, and significantly grows our position within the insurance industry. The acquisition also improves the quality and visibility of our earnings. And GE's strong and experienced management team is a critical element of this transaction. We see a number of growth opportunities working with our new partners. In short, this is a meaningful development for us and we look forward to keeping you posted on our collective progress. Second, a couple thoughts on KKR more broadly. As a senior team, we just spent the better part of a week in our annual strategic planning meetings. Listening to the discussions and presentations in those sessions was incredibly energizing. In our nearly 45 years in business, we have never had a stronger management team, more line of sight to our near-term results, more ways to grow and more confidence in our future. This confidence is driving our announcements today and sharing our belief that we can comfortably exceed $2 per share in FRE next year. And even more exciting, we see significant growth beyond that. We know we have discussed a lot of information on this call. That is one of the reasons we're looking forward to our April Investor Day. We think it will be helpful for example for everyone to hear Global Atlantic CEO, Allan Levine talk about GA and its growth prospects. We'll also spend a significant amount of time detailing the building blocks of the firm's growth plans, which we think will help you understand why we are so optimistic about the path ahead for us. We thank you for your partnership, trust and time, and are happy to take your questions. Yes. And Glenn, so I'd say, look, we agree with your comment. We're very constructive on the backdrop for monetizations broadly and it is across the Board. There's M&A. There's strategic sales. There are sales to sponsors. There's leverage recaps, dividends, so a lot of different opportunities for us to monetize. I would also say, though, despite the overall valuation environment, we continue to be very active in terms of deployment. As we talked about in the last call, we've been really leaning into a number of investment themes that we think will be accelerated by this period of time and so our pipelines are actually quite full as we head through the first quarter here. Thank you. Yes. The only thing I'd add Gerry is that, it -- we continue to see these opportunities across a number of these investment themes that we've discussed. And Asia, of course, is at the most part come out of the COVID period more quickly than other parts of the world. And so we are kind of seeing more regular activity levels on the ground in a number of those markets. Thank you. Hey, Patrick. It's Scott. Just to jump on, I think, the basic question is, do we plan to stick to it. The answer is yes. We've been talking about this potential change internally for the last few years and working to Rob's point to get to the scale and diversity and visibility where we thought, we could tell you this and stick to it. And you know us well, right, we are deliberate people, we are very careful about what we commit to and we do not intend to let you or our shareholders down. So we would not announce this unless we're confident we can deliver in these comp ranges in all operating environments. And to Rob's point, yes, we talked about this with the partners of the firm. Everybody gets the alignment. We own over 30% or 35% of the stock, give or take. So we think it's the right change and we've kind of been building toward it for the last several years. Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for the question, Craig. It's Scott. First off, I think, you're right, we did the transaction with the book was the disability book. It was -- suffice it to say it was structured in such a way that it was much closer to an annuity book and a disability book in terms of what it means for us. So it really is not us taking different kinds of risks at Global Atlantic. It's more just the transaction was structured to make it the risk that we want to take. And as we talked about the prior calls, we really like that the GA team is very focused on taking particular kinds of risks. So you shouldn't take that as any change in strategy. In terms of the other insurance verticals, I think, for the time being you should expect that we're going to stay focused on annuities, life and the other existing businesses of Global Atlantic. We don't have any plans to meaningfully change that and we'll continue to execute that through the individual channel and the institutional channel as we've discussed in its various forms. But we'll keep you posted. Never say never in terms of the evolution of the strategy, but we're focused on what got us here. Thank you. Good morning. Thank you. Hey, Jeremy. It's Scott. Look it's an astute question. We'll try to shed some light directionally for you in April. Thank you. Hey, Mike. It's Scott. Just one other thing, as you know, we remain very focused on compounding, just compounding our AUM, compounding our balance sheet. We think the additional Global Atlantic will allow us to do both of those things at a faster rate over time. So no change is expected. Thank you. Thank you. Great. Thank you. Hey, Brian. It's Scott. We're not going to be able to share with you kind of fundraising guidance or capital markets revenue guidance. I think if you look at page five of the supplemental materials, you can see on the right-hand side, all of the strategies we have coming to market, including the number of flagship strategies. And so, I think as long as the fundraising environment stays with us and it's probably frankly improved a bit since the last time we talked. We do feel good about our ability to meaningfully scale our AUM from here and have good fundraising outcomes in the next couple of years. We're not going to put a precise number on it, but we feel good on a kind of a team in place basis and then we're also making new investments in distribution as well that we'll talk about more in April. Capital markets had a very nice year last year after a quiet spring given the pandemic. And we do see real opportunities to scale there as well. We've incorporated all of that go into kind of the FRE guidance we gave you, where we said, we could comfortably exceed $2 per share. That is incorporated into that statement and that guidance and the outcomes we think can be a bit fungible, but both fundraising KCM, Global Atlantic and all the other ways we have to win re incorporated in that message. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to the KKR's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. During today\u2019s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the management's prepared remarks, the conference will be opened for questions. [Operator Instructions] I would now hand the call over to Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.\nCraig Larson: Thank you, good morning everybody and welcome to our third quarter 2020 earnings call. I'm joined by Scott Nuttall, our Co-President and Co-COO; and also by Rob Lewin our CFO. We'd like to remind everyone that we'll be refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, which is available on the Investor Center section at KKR.com. This call will contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance, so please refer to our SEC filings for cautionary factors related to these statements. And like previous quarters, we've also posted a supplementary deck on our website that we'll be referring to over the course of the call. We've all experienced volatility and disruption in many ways in 2020 across the globe. So we continue to hope that everyone is safe and healthy. But in terms of KKR, and our results this quarter, we've continued to see strong performance really across all of our metrics. Turning to Page 2 of our supplement to begin, you can see that our key metrics are performing nicely. Looking at the upper left hand part of the page, assets under management came in at $234 billion, representing a 12% increase from a year ago. And as fundraising and capital deployment momentum continued, our management fees of the past 12 months as you can see by the chart in the right hand top right hand corner grew by 13% to $1.3 billion. Looking at the bottom left, you can see our book value per share. So a meaningful increase this quarter. This is by strong investment performance. In the third quarter, book value per share grew from $17.73 as of 6/30, the $20.26, up 14%, and more broadly is up 11% from $18.22 per share a year ago. And finally on the bottom right hand side, you see our after-tax distributable earnings. First, in terms of this quarter, DE came in at $410 million or $0.48 on a per share basis. Both of these figures are up approximately 25% from our results last quarter. And looking over the last 12 months despite all of the volatility we've endured, we reported $1.5 billion of after tax DE, which is essentially flat compared to the figure from a year ago. Moving on to our summary financials for the third quarter, please turn to Page 3 of the supplement, and let's walk through the left hand part of that slide. Management fees increased to $360 million, up 14% to Q3 last year, driven most significantly by Asia IV, which entered its investment period in the quarter. Transaction fees totaled $301 million. We had a strong quarter within capital markets with transaction fees here coming in at $158 million given the breadth of deployment and monetization activities we saw over the course of the quarter. Realized performance income came in at $234 million, and with $260 million of realized investment income. Total revenues were $1.1 billion this quarter, up 11% from the same quarter a year ago. Notable monetization activity in the quarter included the IPO of Hut Group, a British e-commerce firm, the dividend recapitalization of Epicor, which is a software firm and North America Fund XI, which we subsequently sold, as well as the secondary Pfizer. In on a blended basis, our exits this quarter were done at over three times costs. Turning to our expenses for the quarter. Compensation expenses were $427 million, which brings our total compensation margin including equity based comp to 40%. Non-compensation operating expenses were $90 million. Our operating margin increased to 52% with after tax distributable earnings then of the $410 million or $0.48 per share. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Rob.\nRobert Lewin: Thanks a lot, Craig. And good morning, everyone. Similar to last quarter, I want to start off by focusing on our year-to-date performance. We've clearly experienced some market volatility in 2020. And we believe our results over the past nine months highlight both the resilience of our business model and the high level of execution by our global teams. I'm going to start with the right hand side of Page 3, focusing initially on three major drivers of our revenue. First, our management fees are up 13% this year. Our ability to realize carry through different market environments also remained strong, bringing our realized performance fees to just under $1 billion year-to-date. And finally, our balance sheet is continued to perform with realized investment income up 8% continuing to demonstrate the important contribution of this revenue stream towards our overall financial performance. In aggregate, our revenues are up 7% through the first nine months of the year. Moving through our expenses, compensation margin has remained at 40% through the year. In terms of non-compensation related expenses, we have been deliberately prudent with expense management in 2020, and have obviously benefited from the limited amount of travel and office related expenses this year. Year-to-date, our other operating expenses together with occupancy are down 4%, compared to this period last year, despite making some very meaningful investments across our platform. As a result, our distributable operating margins are up 100 basis points, while our total operating earnings are up 9%. In addition, our after tax DE per share of $1.28 for the nine months ended September 2020, compares favorably to $1.23 in the same period in 2019. It is important to note here, that we have completed our financing related to Global Atlantic in Q3, which has already started to burden our after tax DE per share in advance of generating the revenue associated with the acquisition. Switching to capital raising. On a year-to-date basis, we have raised 80% more capital than we raised in the same period in 2019, which really does set us up nicely for future growth. Moving to investment performance on Page four, which has largely been a real strength for us this year. Our flagship private equity funds returned 27% over the past 12 months, and our real estate and infrastructure strategies returned 10% and 7% respectively over that same period. In credit, we had a very positive quarter, leverage credit, which is the largest of our credit businesses by AUM, was up 5% in Q3, and is up 3% over the LTM period. Alternative credit was up 6% in the quarter, and down 7% LTM. Our alternative credit numbers are a combination of our private performing credit strategies, which had solid performance and our distressed portfolio, which has taken some marks LTM. Turning to Page 5, we thought it was worth spending a minute specifically discussing our benchmark PE performance. As you can see, really across all geographies, our flagship private equity funds are meaningfully outperforming their benchmark indices on a since inception basis. This performance is in part generated by our portfolio construction, especially in a bifurcated market like the one we have seen in 2020. We are underweight some of the harder hit sectors, while also importantly choosing to have a large exposure to technology, with a focus on investments in data, ecommerce, and digitalization. Our relative weighting to Asia has also benefited our performance. Page 6 provides some additional detail on our balance sheet. Consistent with the performance across the firm, our book value per share increased to $20.26, representing a 14% increase from June 30. Our balance sheet investment portfolio returned 11% in the quarter, and our net accrued carry balance increased 44% from Q2, providing additional visibility for future carry. Also as it relates to our balance sheet, it's worth highlighting our buyback activity this year. Since January, we've used $324 million under our buyback program. The majority of this activity occurred in the first four months of the year, as we leaned into the volatility and repurchased stock at a weighted average price of just over $24 per share. In total now, since we announced our first buyback program at the end of 2015, we've used $1.4 billion to retire shares at an average price of just under $19 per share. With our book value today in excess of $20 and the stock price where it is, we feel good about our activity levels here. Turning to fundraising. New capital raised totaled $8.7 billion in the quarter driven by fundraising across private markets in our U.S. real estate strategy, as well as across three strategies in Asia, real estate, infrastructure, and private equity. Additionally, we raised capital related to leverage and private credit. New capital raised from a fee paying AUM standpoint was a record $19 billion this quarter, with $12 billion of that attributed to Asia IV as it entered its investment period in July. We now have over $13 billion of capital in Asia IV, I will provide further updates on the fundraise as it continues to progress. The $32 billion of capital raised year-to-date importantly sets us up with $67 billion of dry powder, which is a high point for us. As we have discussed on prior calls, we really did lean in when the market was dislocated. So this dry powder is particularly noteworthy given the level of capital investment we have made year-to-date. Now focusing on this deployment more specifically, our private markets business had a record investment quarter with $6.2 billion deployed, which was largely in transactions that were entered into during the more heightened market dislocation in the spring and early summer. In Europe, two previously announced core PE investments closed. Our infrastructure team continued to find compelling opportunities across various sectors in Europe and Asia. And a number of Asia P investments closed, including our investment GI. And finally, an update on a couple of items related to Global Atlantic. We completed two financings in the quarter the proceeds of which will be used to fund the acquisition. In August, we issued $1.15 billion of mandatory convertible preferred stock. You will see in our earnings release on a distributable earning basis that this offering is reported on a as if converted basis. And subsequent to the mandatory convertible offering, we also issued $750 million of 30-year senior notes with a 3.5% coupon. Behind the scenes, the GA team has been hard at work at closing. Following KKR announcement of the acquisition in July, GA completed two block reinsurance transactions, adding an incremental $8 billion of assets. Notably, GA's pipeline for similar transactions is quite active, and we have confidence in the team's ability to execute. We continue to see really strong opportunities here for both organic and inorganic growth. And with that, let me hand it over to Scott.\nScott Nuttall: Thank you, Rob. And thank you everyone for joining our call today. All of us at KKR hope you and your families are happy, safe and healthy. Our numbers speak for themselves this quarter. So I'm going to be brief. From my seat, there are a handful of things I thought I would highlight. First, we have invested and committed $42 billion so far this year around the world and across strategies. We were prepared to lean into dislocation coming into the spring, and our preparedness has paid off. Second, investment performance has been strong. And we see more upside in the portfolio from here. Third, fundraising momentum has continued. In the first three quarters, we have raised $32 billion. And we have three more flagship funds and over 20 other strategies in or coming to market over the next 18 months. Fourth, our model is working with our combination of AUM capital markets and balance sheet we have multiple ways to win. We have always felt our model is resilient. One silver lining of this year has been an opportunity for that resilience to shine through. And fifth, the Global Atlantic acquisition is on track. And as you heard from Rob, GA is winning in the marketplace, and will be larger at closing than we had anticipated with multiple ways to grow from here. It has been a busy year, but we have a lot more ahead of us. And with that, we're happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from William Katz with Citi.\nWilliam Katz: Thank you very much for taking the question. I think you guys answer a little bit of it in some of your prepared commentary. But Scott just sort of wondering rather you guys want to maybe to sort of step back and update us around Vista management fee walk up as you see it another sort of quarter under your belt, just given sort of the outsized economics this quarter and your commentary on the Global Atlantic transaction?\nScott Nuttall: Sure, thanks a lot, Bill. So nothing has changed in our view on management fee growth from here. We communicated a little bit while back that our expectation is that we'll be able to generate 50 plus percent management fee growth. On top of that, we believe there is an additional 200 plus million of net management fee that we would expect to generate from Global Atlantic. And so, I'd say we continue to be convicted on being able to achieve that.\nWilliam Katz: Okay. And just a follow-up a big picture, maybe a little bit unanswerable today. But just to the extent that there will be any kind of shift in carried interest taxation. How might that impact the economics or the franchise either bottom line or from a sort of a comp perspective? And then the harder part is to the extent there is any kind of sort of administrative change next week. How might that influence institutional allocations and with the relative appeal of alternatives more broadly?\nRobert Lewin: Sure, so as it relates to any changes or around carried interest taxation that won't have an impact on distributable earnings for us all forms of our income, our tax the same and so at the statutory rate. And as you know we benefit from a little bit of a tax step up that we had achieved at our C-Corp conversion, but other than that, any kind of new revenue that comes into the firm is taxed at the statutory rate all the same.\nScott Nuttall: And Bill, just on the other parts of your question it\u2019s Scott. So no impact on the DE, no impact on compensation or how we think about it and with respect to fundraising we do not expect any change in the tax code to have an impact. Remember a lot of the people that invest with us our tax exempts and regardless of what happens from a tax code standpoint. We believe the interest in alternatives will continue to grow.\nOperator: Our next question is from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.\nGlenn Schorr: Thanks very much, wonder if you could talk a little bit more about alternative credit, you mentioned the performance and the stress is not the biggest piece. But I'm curious on what you see as temporary versus permanent impairments in that book and the outlook more importantly for distress. Because we keep thinking there is a good outlook but every time, every time it happens more stimulus comes and maybe you could tie in to dislocation fund what's going on in the distressed landscape? Thanks so much.\nRobert Lewin: Yes, thanks a lot for the question Glenn, this is Rob, I'll start and I'm sure Scott will have some views here as well. I think the punch line is we continue to view a number of assets in our distressed portfolio that have taken some marks on an LTM basis quite favorably. And as you also know and you hit on this, we've shifted a number of our distressed oriented resources to our dislocation opportunity strategy. And an 8-week period and in spring, we raised $2.8 billion fund we have north of $4 billion of capital committed to that strategy and already through the first several months of that fund strategy. We either deployed or committed a little bit north of 40% of that fund already. And so, it's a big opportunity, we think for us and that's why we've diverted some of the team to be focused on those activities.\nScott Nuttall: Yes, just - add on a couple of thoughts, Glenn. So first, we feel good about the underlying portfolio, we think a bunch of those marks are going to come back. Secondly, when you look at the page in the deck that shows kind of the LTM period, it's important to keep in mind that the convention in terms of how that page is put together means that what's dragging that number down is our Special Sits II fund, which is all of $2.1 billion of fair value and its $73 billion credit business. So our perspective is - a lot of that is going to come back over time and it's a very small part of the overall business and credit as a whole continues to perform. I think perhaps to your market opportunity question. We do think that there is going to continue to be an interesting opportunity, but what it's going to require is to be really nimble and kind of flexible as to how you deploy capital and that's why to your point we raised a dislocation vehicle, incentive vehicles. They have the ability to invest across asset classes. So we're investing not only in traditional distressed, but traded markets, real estate credit, corporate credit you got to be able to move quickly and actually some of the early investments we made there. We've already monetized. So I think you should expect us to continue to scale that dislocation platform over time. But that's how we're thinking about it. Its first control for just - control distress, then it is just being able to move quickly.\nOperator: Our next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.\nAlex Blostein: Great thanks, good morning, everybody. Thanks for the question. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about deployment dynamics and the implications that might have on both the fundraising and the capital markets business. So from what we could see, you guys have been quite active and the pipeline of deployment, just I guess and some of the public data looks really strong coming up? So I guess what does it mean for sort of timing of North America up 13, the next infra fund or the next European fund in terms of both kind of fundraising and when those fees could ultimately come online. And then I guess secondly, the outlook for the transaction revenues albeit I guess kind of lumpy and hard to predict, but just from a trajectory perspective, given the strong deployment pipeline, how should we think about that over the next 12 months? Thanks.\nCraig Larson: Alex, it's Craig, why don't I give a beginning part answer there as it relates to deployment, and then as well as fundraising and then Scott and Rob may want to add on. I think you're right as it relates to deployment it's been a really busy period for us as you heard from Rob, private markets in particular in the third quarter was a really healthy figure for us. I think that reflects a number of things. One, the overall growing platforms for us certainly also reflects the decisions that we had to lean into dislocation earlier in the year. As Rob had mentioned, the activity that closed in Q3, largely reflects transactions that were announced in the spring. And I think the third thing you see, reflects the geographic breadth that we have in our presence in Asia. Asia within private equity was a business busiest geography for us deployment wise in PE in the quarter as well as year-to-date. And as you'll remember, we do run a very localized model in Asia. So I think as it - that approach is very helpful for us, as it relates to sourcing and executing opportunities. I do think as it relates to fundraising the main dynamic is that things are on track. So as, it relates to the three additional flagship funds for us in addition to the fundraising continued for our Asia private equity strategy. And then when you layer on the 20 plus additional strategies. As we look forward, I think everything is on pace for us. And important in that is only 25% of those strategies that we see coming to market our first time for us. So I think, we have predecessors that are performing and real benefits as it relates to maturation. I do think as it relates to that overall deployment dynamic. One of the things that is correct that as it relates to accelerated deployment finding attractive risk reward, if anything that can move the overall timing as we try and think things more forward. But the overall message is one that we're on pace.\nRobert Lewin: Alex, it's Rob maybe a couple of points to add on. In terms of the geographic breadth of our deployment, as we've looked at where we're likely to wind up in the year from a private equity perspective, it's actually close to a third, a third, a third, Americas, Europe and Asia in terms of deployment. And so that's really that geographic breadth and diversification has really helped us be able to lean into different opportunities on a global basis. Then, as it relates to the second part of your question, in terms of the impact this can have on transaction fees. Our pipeline remains healthy for investment, the remainder of the year of course, we got a couple months left in 2020. And some of the deals in our pipeline might slip to Q1. So it's a little bit hard to predict our transaction fees for the quarter, but certainly our deployment levels have helped those figures on a year-to-date basis. And if our deployment continues to be robust over the coming quarters, then you should see a similar level of transaction fees play out.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jeremy Campbell with Barclays.\nJeremy Campbell: Just quick point of clarification before I ask the question, relative to the $200 million plus fee revenue opportunity from Global Atlantic you guys highlighted back in the summertime. Just curious if these recent block deals were baked into that or incremental to that?\nRobert Lewin: The short answer Jeremy is they're incremental to that.\nJeremy Campbell: And then, I guess bigger picture on Global Atlantic. Can you remind us what the typical organic growth looks like? I think the summer slide deck is something like $9 billion, and then maybe how you envision the growth algorithm going forward between organic flow and inorganic blocks?\nScott Nuttall: Yes sure Jeremy, it\u2019s Scott, I'll take that. So, I think the way to think about it is Global Atlantic, in our view, is just multiple ways to grow. So there is the retail business where they have relationships with over 200 banks and broker dealers. There is the institutional business and it's really although it could be thought of as organic or in organic I suppose. There is a lot of aspects of that that are fairly recurring and somewhat predictable. For example, they have flow reinsurance arrangements with a number of counterparties. There in the pension risk transfer business. And then on top of that, you've got these reinsurance blocks that you referenced, that although they are transaction like, there is actually been a very steady stream and that\u2019s a very consistent flow for the business over the last several years. So there is opportunities to grow from what they've done - group that together, and we call the institutional business. And then third, there is potential acquisitions of other companies, which is truly the inorganic. As you can see from the slide deck from July, the company has by virtue of really that retail and institutional approach grown quite significantly and a very steady pace over time. I think with the addition of, hopefully, our help in terms of access to capital and investment returns. Our expectation is that we can continue to see attractive growth. We're not going to put out a forecast per se, but we're happy to share with you what we're seeing over time. And as you've noted, we do expect to be larger at closing than we had expected, partially because the organic growth frankly has been better than we thought on the retail channel so far. And the blocks are on top of that, but we'll keep you updated along the way.\nOperator: Our next question is from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research.\nPatrick Davitt: You mentioned the Epicor sale which looks fairly punchy. So could you just give us an update on kind of the announced pipeline of carry and investment income as it sits right now?\nRobert Lewin: Yes sure, hi Patrick it's Rob. And just to clarify, that was - that Craig mentioned was a dividend for Epicor in Q3, the announced sale closing in Q4, which I could lead in to your question. So as it relates to Q4 revenue, as of now we have more than $250 million of performance and balance sheet revenue that we've got line of sight on. And so this is from deals that are already closed or have been signed up and we expect to close as well as from booked incentive fee that have already been crystallized. And so, we're only one month into the quarter. And hopefully, we'll have some things break in our direction, November and December to elevate that number, but our line of sales by 250, a little bit north of 250 right now, which is similar to where we were at this point last quarter.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Carrier with Bank of America.\nMichael Carrier: Thanks for taking the question. Just given the strength given in private equity, on the performance side just wanted to get maybe some color on what you're seeing maybe across some of the different industries regions, because it was obviously pretty broad based. But when we look at obviously the economic activity, it's pretty kind of start difference. So just any color in terms of what the drivers and - is this broad based as it looks? Thanks.\nCraig Larson: Mike it\u2019s Craig. Why don't I start and Scott may add in. I think the answers are really situation specific so, businesses that are in troubled sectors or have seen real impacts from COVID. Obviously, you see that, I think on the flip side, we have seen real strength in companies focused in areas that have been given tailwinds from COVID. So that's ecommerce, gaming, mobile gaming, software, housing related themes, health and wellness and the like. And I think given the conviction that we've had around several of those themes, we were better positions as a result of that. And so that's really what you see across the performance statistics for the year. And I think it is worth, mentioning Asia again as part of that, as we've a large business in Asia in our geographic focus again it's helped. It helped us learn in the spring, as these economies recovered first. And currently, it should help as most Asian economies haven't seen the recent spike in COVID trends that we've seen across several states in the U.S. and European countries.\nScott Nuttall: Yes Mike, the only thing I'd add, just put some numbers around that. So just to give you a sense - it really is about portfolio construction. And the fact that we've been focused to Craig's point on a number of investment themes for the last several years that we think have long-term durability. And that actually the pandemic has probably accelerated the development of those themes. So big part of the answer to your question, why you're seeing the performance is we've been meaningfully underweight. The sector has most dramatically impacted. So if you aggregate, hotels and leisure, retail and energy, it's a sum total of about 8% of our total exposure, even within real estate. It's a very small piece in the hotel side. So we've had very little exposure to the most impacted sectors. And we all can tell from the markets, it's a really bifurcated story. Where we have been more exposed \u2013 has been tech media telecom to Craig's point that's been 25%. So where we've had our exposure, and then Asia has been, about a third of our total PE portfolio 30% or so. So the answer really is around portfolio construction, and leading into these themes that we think are just being accelerated.\nOperator: Our next question is from Gerry O'Hara with Jefferies.\nGerry O'Hara: My question is sort of runs balance sheet and the allocations there so clearly that the allocation is certainly kind of changed with the addition of global pandemic. I think in the past, you talked about kind of diversifying the exposure across asset classes. But perhaps you can give us an update on how you're thinking about that post insurance assets coming into the mix or if that's even really a focus right now?\nRobert Lewin: Gerry, it's Rob. Thanks for the question. And so Global [indiscernible] are the largest single investment in our balance sheet, it's not going to show up in our investment table, per se since it's really going to be a consolidated operating asset of KKR\u2019s like our other operating businesses. In terms of diversification of our balance sheet holdings you look at the chart in our earnings release. And while it does show about 70% exposure, private equity, inside of that, we've got meaningful exposure to core private equity it\u2019s about 20% of our portfolio a little bit north of that today \u2013 on a growing exposure, growth equity. And so, we do certainly want to have a greater exposure to these types of assets on our balance sheet, and I wouldn't expect, dramatic changes from here around how we've allocated our balance sheet to-date.\nOperator: Our next question is from Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.\nChristoph Kotowski: Yes, good morning thank you. I know these numbers bounce around quite a bit. But normally, your realized carry is like four or five times the level of realized balance sheet gains. And this quarter, they were almost equal. And I'm just wondering, is that \u2013 did that I was trying to figure out where that came from and why that is? And should we expect to see a kind of shift towards more realizations in the coming quarters?\nRobert Lewin: Hey, Chris, thanks for the question. No, I don't think that's a fundamental shift. I think that's just looking one quarter time, we had meaningful balance sheet realization through \u2013 our stake in the Hut Group, and while that was invested across our broader platform, it was certainly weighted towards our balance sheet. And so, I would not expect this to be necessarily a trend on a go forward basis. At least in the near term as our balance sheet continues the evolution into one that is going to be compounding in nature at some point in time in the future. As we've completed, I would say that evolution of moving from a balance sheet that is generating cash to one that is compounding over time, that compounded balance sheet will mature to the point where it's generating meaningfully more cash. But that's sort of in the next stage of our growth profile here for the foreseeable future. I think the expectation would continue to be carried \u2013 be it elevated gains to balance sheet income.\nChristoph Kotowski: Okay, great.\nScott Nuttall: That\u2019s a segment I would add it's always felt to me like we have multiple ways to win and this was a quarter where I think you're right investment income and balance sheet performance contributed to DE while we still saw significant book value compounding. And capital markets in addition had a very strong quarter so it's always \u2013 we've talked about how we think the business model is really wonderfully resilient. And I think \u2013 this quarter those items were both great examples.\nChristoph Kotowski: Yes and then I was also curious, if you can discuss it. Just why the odd kind of like two part exit from Epicor are with first the dividend recap and then a sale process, is that tax driven or if you are going to sell something, why would one to do a dividend recap immediately in front of that?\nRobert Lewin: Chris and it was not tax driven and without commenting too much any specific situation, we were able to get something done that drove liquidity back to the firm with a capital structure that was portable for a new buyer. And it just so happened that we were able to exit it a couple months later on so there is nothing that was specifically unusual, about that transaction.\nOperator: Our next question is from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.\nChristopher Harris: So with the news out there that Aries is bidding for A&P. I was hoping you could give us your updated thoughts on how you guys are thinking about M&A at this point. Are you open to deals, are you looking at deals or is the main focus right now primarily Global Atlantic?\nScott Nuttall: Chris it\u2019s Scott, thanks for the question. We do have a lot of work to do on the Global Atlantic front, but the answer to your question as we continue to look for new opportunities. You know the bar remains very high, but we were continued to focus on some of the areas we talked about in the past, growth areas for us, like real estate, some of the other kind of adjacent parts of the space around well as secondary's or co-invest. And then over time, you should continue to expect us to be thinking about through and with Global Atlantic whether this more things to do in insurance. So we're continuing to look, and we'll keep you posted, but we're definitely still out there.\nOperator: Our next question is from Robert Lee with KBW.\nRobert Lee: I'm just curious - actually I questioned Marshall Wace. I know there is a slide in your Investor Deck from September that shows pretty phenomenal growth. Can you maybe just update us on maybe what its contribution was this quarter, and is there still kind of how you're working with them. And then maybe there's still an opportunity for you to increase your stake in Marshall Wace?\nRobert Lewin: Rob, I'll take the first part of that, and I think Scott going to take how we're working together. So our punch line is, the business is performing very well north of $45 billion of AUM today. We have a 40% share in that. And you're seeing that flow through our financial results in a couple of ways. Through most of the year, you're seeing it flow through on our pro rata share of management fees. What you'll see and a little bit of incentive fees along the way, their performance year end is the end of September. And so what you'll see in our financials in Q4 is an elevated level of incentive fees, which is our pro rata share of Marshall Wace incentive fees. And that was in the 250 plus million number that I gave earlier on this call around our pipeline of visibility.\nScott Nuttall: The only thing I would add Rob, is and thanks for the comment. I think, the Marshall Wace management team has done a fantastic job growing the business navigating this environment and continuing to grow the firm. We have continued to work together on a number of different fronts. But it's just been a great partnership and it's been satisfying in terms of the discussions we have about markets and continue to explore ways to do more strategically together. But, it's also been a partnership through which, it's had a very nice economic return for the investment that we've made off the balance sheet. In terms of the question about raising the stake, the initial phase of the transaction was for us to invest 24.9% that as scheduled went up to where we are now, which is about 40%. There's no near term plan to change that, that may always change over time.\nRobert Lee: And then maybe just a follow-up question. I guess you can have a conference call that ESG coming up I guess. But, and thinking about you had the announcement today about in India, the [indiscernible] platform you had your impact on. But just more broadly, how do you think of, the firm's positioning to whether it's - or how are you incorporating some of the principles within kind of within your strategies? And on the private investment side, private equity side, you feel like - it\u2019s more important or similar to what you're seeing on the public investment side in terms of LPs really focusing on those capabilities and how you're incorporating into your process?\nCraig Larson: Bob, its Craig Larson, I think there are two things to understand first, we as a firm have been focused on ESG since 2008. So at this point, we have over a decade of experience in driving and protecting value through ESG management. And we believe we've established ourselves as a clear leader in these areas. And what it means at this point is within our firm like ESG considerations are integrated within the decision making that's taking place every day within our deal teams and our investment committees on a global basis. So these are one off items, one off projects is part of the mindset of our teams as we evaluate opportunities, and look to execute and create value. And I think the second point is really, as a result of all of this work. We were finding good investment opportunities through the work that everyone was doing but there were cases when we didn't have a home for these investments. So you're right, we've created a business around this. That's our impact business. That's a strategy that's focused on opportunities to generate private equity like returns while driving positive impact at the same time. That's the opportunity. Though, earlier this year, we held our final close, I think it was February on our impact funds. And we're off to a very good start. And I think as it relates to trends and dynamics from a public shareholder standpoint, from an LP standpoint, et cetera. All these considerations and dynamics are only increasing I think in importance and increasing in terms of focus from third party constituents, consistent with what I expect you're hearing from others.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprys: I wanted to follow-up on the strong investment returns that you guys posted today and touched on earlier. I was just hoping you could elaborate a bit more on your views on the investment return outlook on both the existing investments there that are in the ground, and also the new capital that you're putting to work today. In terms of what sort of returns are you expecting to generate across the different types of strategies that you're managing? And how is the attribution of those returns evolving?\nScott Nuttall: Mike, it\u2019s Scott. Thanks for question. Look, I think the short answer to the first part of the question is that we continue to see a lot of upside in the portfolio. And as you can tell from the amount of deployment we've had this year $42 billion in total terms of closed and announced transactions, we've been deploying more capital into those investment themes that we think have a lot of legs. So the opportunity to continue to generate attractive returns from here we think is very attractive. We believe that it's, you know, going to continue to be driven by having the exposures to the parts of the economy globally, where we see those long-term trends playing out. And we think our globality is going to help. The fact to Rob's point that the deployments and about a third, a third, a third, U.S., Europe, Asia we think also will help the returns to a go forward basis. And most investors, I think look at us and how we're performing relative to the public markets, when they look at our private markets returns. And that's, I think our expectation is, we can continue to outperform nicely, and hopefully meet and beat their hurdles. And in terms of the go forward opportunity, we continue to stay focused on a number of those themes, and continue to involve them all the time. And it kind of the meta level, there's the investment themes. But the other thing we probably should talk about more on these calls is our growing real assets businesses, where we are seeing real opportunities to invest in real assets with yield. And that's part of the reason you're seeing such growth in our infrastructure, and real estate businesses in particular.\nOperator: Our next question is a follow-up from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research.\nPatrick Davitt: Thanks for the follow-up. I have a quick follow-up on the tax question. I think, obviously, public shareholders the changes - towards the change in the corporate rate that impacts us, but as you think about a potential change in the capital gains tax rate, would that cause any kind of rethink of how the balance sheet growth strategy works for you kind of internally or not?\nScott Nuttall: No change in how we would - short answer no change and how we would evaluate opportunities in our balance sheet strategy.\nOperator: And we have a follow-up question for Mike Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.\nMike Cyprys: Thanks for taking the follow-up. I just wanted to ask about the balance sheet, if you guys gave are able to share with us the amount of capital that was deployed off the balance sheet in the quarter and also how much was monetized from the balance sheet? Thanks.\nRobert Lewin: Yes, sure. No problem. In the quarter, we deployed a little bit more than $800 million of capital to balance sheet and we realized about $360 million.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back to Craig Larson for closing remarks.\nCraig Larson: Just would like to thank everybody for joining us. If you have any follow-ups, we look forward to following up with you directly, please reach out directly. And thank you once again. Bye, bye.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Scott Nuttall",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob. And thank you everyone for joining our call today. All of us at KKR hope you and your families are happy, safe and healthy. Our numbers speak for themselves this quarter. So I'm going to be brief. From my seat, there are a handful of things I thought I would highlight. First, we have invested and committed $42 billion so far this year around the world and across strategies. We were prepared to lean into dislocation coming into the spring, and our preparedness has paid off. Second, investment performance has been strong. And we see more upside in the portfolio from here. Third, fundraising momentum has continued. In the first three quarters, we have raised $32 billion. And we have three more flagship funds and over 20 other strategies in or coming to market over the next 18 months. Fourth, our model is working with our combination of AUM capital markets and balance sheet we have multiple ways to win. We have always felt our model is resilient. One silver lining of this year has been an opportunity for that resilience to shine through. And fifth, the Global Atlantic acquisition is on track. And as you heard from Rob, GA is winning in the marketplace, and will be larger at closing than we had anticipated with multiple ways to grow from here. It has been a busy year, but we have a lot more ahead of us. And with that, we're happy to take your questions. Sure, thanks a lot, Bill. So nothing has changed in our view on management fee growth from here. We communicated a little bit while back that our expectation is that we'll be able to generate 50 plus percent management fee growth. On top of that, we believe there is an additional 200 plus million of net management fee that we would expect to generate from Global Atlantic. And so, I'd say we continue to be convicted on being able to achieve that. And Bill, just on the other parts of your question it's Scott. So no impact on the DE, no impact on compensation or how we think about it and with respect to fundraising we do not expect any change in the tax code to have an impact. Remember a lot of the people that invest with us our tax exempts and regardless of what happens from a tax code standpoint. We believe the interest in alternatives will continue to grow. Yes, just - add on a couple of thoughts, Glenn. So first, we feel good about the underlying portfolio, we think a bunch of those marks are going to come back. Secondly, when you look at the page in the deck that shows kind of the LTM period, it's important to keep in mind that the convention in terms of how that page is put together means that what's dragging that number down is our Special Sits II fund, which is all of $2.1 billion of fair value and its $73 billion credit business. So our perspective is - a lot of that is going to come back over time and it's a very small part of the overall business and credit as a whole continues to perform. I think perhaps to your market opportunity question. We do think that there is going to continue to be an interesting opportunity, but what it's going to require is to be really nimble and kind of flexible as to how you deploy capital and that's why to your point we raised a dislocation vehicle, incentive vehicles. They have the ability to invest across asset classes. So we're investing not only in traditional distressed, but traded markets, real estate credit, corporate credit you got to be able to move quickly and actually some of the early investments we made there. We've already monetized. So I think you should expect us to continue to scale that dislocation platform over time. But that's how we're thinking about it. Its first control for just - control distress, then it is just being able to move quickly. Yes sure Jeremy, it's Scott, I'll take that. So, I think the way to think about it is Global Atlantic, in our view, is just multiple ways to grow. So there is the retail business where they have relationships with over 200 banks and broker dealers. There is the institutional business and it's really although it could be thought of as organic or in organic I suppose. There is a lot of aspects of that that are fairly recurring and somewhat predictable. For example, they have flow reinsurance arrangements with a number of counterparties. There in the pension risk transfer business. And then on top of that, you've got these reinsurance blocks that you referenced, that although they are transaction like, there is actually been a very steady stream and that's a very consistent flow for the business over the last several years. So there is opportunities to grow from what they've done - group that together, and we call the institutional business. And then third, there is potential acquisitions of other companies, which is truly the inorganic. As you can see from the slide deck from July, the company has by virtue of really that retail and institutional approach grown quite significantly and a very steady pace over time. I think with the addition of, hopefully, our help in terms of access to capital and investment returns. Our expectation is that we can continue to see attractive growth. We're not going to put out a forecast per se, but we're happy to share with you what we're seeing over time. And as you've noted, we do expect to be larger at closing than we had expected, partially because the organic growth frankly has been better than we thought on the retail channel so far. And the blocks are on top of that, but we'll keep you updated along the way. Yes Mike, the only thing I'd add, just put some numbers around that. So just to give you a sense - it really is about portfolio construction. And the fact that we've been focused to Craig's point on a number of investment themes for the last several years that we think have long-term durability. And that actually the pandemic has probably accelerated the development of those themes. So big part of the answer to your question, why you're seeing the performance is we've been meaningfully underweight. The sector has most dramatically impacted. So if you aggregate, hotels and leisure, retail and energy, it's a sum total of about 8% of our total exposure, even within real estate. It's a very small piece in the hotel side. So we've had very little exposure to the most impacted sectors. And we all can tell from the markets, it's a really bifurcated story. Where we have been more exposed \u2013 has been tech media telecom to Craig's point that's been 25%. So where we've had our exposure, and then Asia has been, about a third of our total PE portfolio 30% or so. So the answer really is around portfolio construction, and leading into these themes that we think are just being accelerated. That's a segment I would add it's always felt to me like we have multiple ways to win and this was a quarter where I think you're right investment income and balance sheet performance contributed to DE while we still saw significant book value compounding. And capital markets in addition had a very strong quarter so it's always \u2013 we've talked about how we think the business model is really wonderfully resilient. And I think \u2013 this quarter those items were both great examples. Chris it's Scott, thanks for the question. We do have a lot of work to do on the Global Atlantic front, but the answer to your question as we continue to look for new opportunities. You know the bar remains very high, but we were continued to focus on some of the areas we talked about in the past, growth areas for us, like real estate, some of the other kind of adjacent parts of the space around well as secondary's or co-invest. And then over time, you should continue to expect us to be thinking about through and with Global Atlantic whether this more things to do in insurance. So we're continuing to look, and we'll keep you posted, but we're definitely still out there. The only thing I would add Rob, is and thanks for the comment. I think, the Marshall Wace management team has done a fantastic job growing the business navigating this environment and continuing to grow the firm. We have continued to work together on a number of different fronts. But it's just been a great partnership and it's been satisfying in terms of the discussions we have about markets and continue to explore ways to do more strategically together. But, it's also been a partnership through which, it's had a very nice economic return for the investment that we've made off the balance sheet. In terms of the question about raising the stake, the initial phase of the transaction was for us to invest 24.9% that as scheduled went up to where we are now, which is about 40%. There's no near term plan to change that, that may always change over time. Mike, it's Scott. Thanks for question. Look, I think the short answer to the first part of the question is that we continue to see a lot of upside in the portfolio. And as you can tell from the amount of deployment we've had this year $42 billion in total terms of closed and announced transactions, we've been deploying more capital into those investment themes that we think have a lot of legs. So the opportunity to continue to generate attractive returns from here we think is very attractive. We believe that it's, you know, going to continue to be driven by having the exposures to the parts of the economy globally, where we see those long-term trends playing out. And we think our globality is going to help. The fact to Rob's point that the deployments and about a third, a third, a third, U.S., Europe, Asia we think also will help the returns to a go forward basis. And most investors, I think look at us and how we're performing relative to the public markets, when they look at our private markets returns. And that's, I think our expectation is, we can continue to outperform nicely, and hopefully meet and beat their hurdles. And in terms of the go forward opportunity, we continue to stay focused on a number of those themes, and continue to involve them all the time. And it kind of the meta level, there's the investment themes. But the other thing we probably should talk about more on these calls is our growing real assets businesses, where we are seeing real opportunities to invest in real assets with yield. And that's part of the reason you're seeing such growth in our infrastructure, and real estate businesses in particular. No change in how we would - short answer no change and how we would evaluate opportunities in our balance sheet strategy."

            "name": "Robert Lewin",
            "content": "Thanks a lot, Craig. And good morning, everyone. Similar to last quarter, I want to start off by focusing on our year-to-date performance. We've clearly experienced some market volatility in 2020. And we believe our results over the past nine months highlight both the resilience of our business model and the high level of execution by our global teams. I'm going to start with the right hand side of Page 3, focusing initially on three major drivers of our revenue. First, our management fees are up 13% this year. Our ability to realize carry through different market environments also remained strong, bringing our realized performance fees to just under $1 billion year-to-date. And finally, our balance sheet is continued to perform with realized investment income up 8% continuing to demonstrate the important contribution of this revenue stream towards our overall financial performance. In aggregate, our revenues are up 7% through the first nine months of the year. Moving through our expenses, compensation margin has remained at 40% through the year. In terms of non-compensation related expenses, we have been deliberately prudent with expense management in 2020, and have obviously benefited from the limited amount of travel and office related expenses this year. Year-to-date, our other operating expenses together with occupancy are down 4%, compared to this period last year, despite making some very meaningful investments across our platform. As a result, our distributable operating margins are up 100 basis points, while our total operating earnings are up 9%. In addition, our after tax DE per share of $1.28 for the nine months ended September 2020, compares favorably to $1.23 in the same period in 2019. It is important to note here, that we have completed our financing related to Global Atlantic in Q3, which has already started to burden our after tax DE per share in advance of generating the revenue associated with the acquisition. Switching to capital raising. On a year-to-date basis, we have raised 80% more capital than we raised in the same period in 2019, which really does set us up nicely for future growth. Moving to investment performance on Page four, which has largely been a real strength for us this year. Our flagship private equity funds returned 27% over the past 12 months, and our real estate and infrastructure strategies returned 10% and 7% respectively over that same period. In credit, we had a very positive quarter, leverage credit, which is the largest of our credit businesses by AUM, was up 5% in Q3, and is up 3% over the LTM period. Alternative credit was up 6% in the quarter, and down 7% LTM. Our alternative credit numbers are a combination of our private performing credit strategies, which had solid performance and our distressed portfolio, which has taken some marks LTM. Turning to Page 5, we thought it was worth spending a minute specifically discussing our benchmark PE performance. As you can see, really across all geographies, our flagship private equity funds are meaningfully outperforming their benchmark indices on a since inception basis. This performance is in part generated by our portfolio construction, especially in a bifurcated market like the one we have seen in 2020. We are underweight some of the harder hit sectors, while also importantly choosing to have a large exposure to technology, with a focus on investments in data, ecommerce, and digitalization. Our relative weighting to Asia has also benefited our performance. Page 6 provides some additional detail on our balance sheet. Consistent with the performance across the firm, our book value per share increased to $20.26, representing a 14% increase from June 30. Our balance sheet investment portfolio returned 11% in the quarter, and our net accrued carry balance increased 44% from Q2, providing additional visibility for future carry. Also as it relates to our balance sheet, it's worth highlighting our buyback activity this year. Since January, we've used $324 million under our buyback program. The majority of this activity occurred in the first four months of the year, as we leaned into the volatility and repurchased stock at a weighted average price of just over $24 per share. In total now, since we announced our first buyback program at the end of 2015, we've used $1.4 billion to retire shares at an average price of just under $19 per share. With our book value today in excess of $20 and the stock price where it is, we feel good about our activity levels here. Turning to fundraising. New capital raised totaled $8.7 billion in the quarter driven by fundraising across private markets in our U.S. real estate strategy, as well as across three strategies in Asia, real estate, infrastructure, and private equity. Additionally, we raised capital related to leverage and private credit. New capital raised from a fee paying AUM standpoint was a record $19 billion this quarter, with $12 billion of that attributed to Asia IV as it entered its investment period in July. We now have over $13 billion of capital in Asia IV, I will provide further updates on the fundraise as it continues to progress. The $32 billion of capital raised year-to-date importantly sets us up with $67 billion of dry powder, which is a high point for us. As we have discussed on prior calls, we really did lean in when the market was dislocated. So this dry powder is particularly noteworthy given the level of capital investment we have made year-to-date. Now focusing on this deployment more specifically, our private markets business had a record investment quarter with $6.2 billion deployed, which was largely in transactions that were entered into during the more heightened market dislocation in the spring and early summer. In Europe, two previously announced core PE investments closed. Our infrastructure team continued to find compelling opportunities across various sectors in Europe and Asia. And a number of Asia P investments closed, including our investment GI. And finally, an update on a couple of items related to Global Atlantic. We completed two financings in the quarter the proceeds of which will be used to fund the acquisition. In August, we issued $1.15 billion of mandatory convertible preferred stock. You will see in our earnings release on a distributable earning basis that this offering is reported on a as if converted basis. And subsequent to the mandatory convertible offering, we also issued $750 million of 30-year senior notes with a 3.5% coupon. Behind the scenes, the GA team has been hard at work at closing. Following KKR announcement of the acquisition in July, GA completed two block reinsurance transactions, adding an incremental $8 billion of assets. Notably, GA's pipeline for similar transactions is quite active, and we have confidence in the team's ability to execute. We continue to see really strong opportunities here for both organic and inorganic growth. And with that, let me hand it over to Scott. Sure, so as it relates to any changes or around carried interest taxation that won't have an impact on distributable earnings for us all forms of our income, our tax the same and so at the statutory rate. And as you know we benefit from a little bit of a tax step up that we had achieved at our C-Corp conversion, but other than that, any kind of new revenue that comes into the firm is taxed at the statutory rate all the same. Yes, thanks a lot for the question Glenn, this is Rob, I'll start and I'm sure Scott will have some views here as well. I think the punch line is we continue to view a number of assets in our distressed portfolio that have taken some marks on an LTM basis quite favorably. And as you also know and you hit on this, we've shifted a number of our distressed oriented resources to our dislocation opportunity strategy. And an 8-week period and in spring, we raised $2.8 billion fund we have north of $4 billion of capital committed to that strategy and already through the first several months of that fund strategy. We either deployed or committed a little bit north of 40% of that fund already. And so, it's a big opportunity, we think for us and that's why we've diverted some of the team to be focused on those activities. Alex, it's Rob maybe a couple of points to add on. In terms of the geographic breadth of our deployment, as we've looked at where we're likely to wind up in the year from a private equity perspective, it's actually close to a third, a third, a third, Americas, Europe and Asia in terms of deployment. And so that's really that geographic breadth and diversification has really helped us be able to lean into different opportunities on a global basis. Then, as it relates to the second part of your question, in terms of the impact this can have on transaction fees. Our pipeline remains healthy for investment, the remainder of the year of course, we got a couple months left in 2020. And some of the deals in our pipeline might slip to Q1. So it's a little bit hard to predict our transaction fees for the quarter, but certainly our deployment levels have helped those figures on a year-to-date basis. And if our deployment continues to be robust over the coming quarters, then you should see a similar level of transaction fees play out. The short answer Jeremy is they're incremental to that. Yes sure, hi Patrick it's Rob. And just to clarify, that was - that Craig mentioned was a dividend for Epicor in Q3, the announced sale closing in Q4, which I could lead in to your question. So as it relates to Q4 revenue, as of now we have more than $250 million of performance and balance sheet revenue that we've got line of sight on. And so this is from deals that are already closed or have been signed up and we expect to close as well as from booked incentive fee that have already been crystallized. And so, we're only one month into the quarter. And hopefully, we'll have some things break in our direction, November and December to elevate that number, but our line of sales by 250, a little bit north of 250 right now, which is similar to where we were at this point last quarter. Gerry, it's Rob. Thanks for the question. And so Global [indiscernible] are the largest single investment in our balance sheet, it's not going to show up in our investment table, per se since it's really going to be a consolidated operating asset of KKR's like our other operating businesses. In terms of diversification of our balance sheet holdings you look at the chart in our earnings release. And while it does show about 70% exposure, private equity, inside of that, we've got meaningful exposure to core private equity it's about 20% of our portfolio a little bit north of that today \u2013 on a growing exposure, growth equity. And so, we do certainly want to have a greater exposure to these types of assets on our balance sheet, and I wouldn't expect, dramatic changes from here around how we've allocated our balance sheet to-date. Hey, Chris, thanks for the question. No, I don't think that's a fundamental shift. I think that's just looking one quarter time, we had meaningful balance sheet realization through \u2013 our stake in the Hut Group, and while that was invested across our broader platform, it was certainly weighted towards our balance sheet. And so, I would not expect this to be necessarily a trend on a go forward basis. At least in the near term as our balance sheet continues the evolution into one that is going to be compounding in nature at some point in time in the future. As we've completed, I would say that evolution of moving from a balance sheet that is generating cash to one that is compounding over time, that compounded balance sheet will mature to the point where it's generating meaningfully more cash. But that's sort of in the next stage of our growth profile here for the foreseeable future. I think the expectation would continue to be carried \u2013 be it elevated gains to balance sheet income. Chris and it was not tax driven and without commenting too much any specific situation, we were able to get something done that drove liquidity back to the firm with a capital structure that was portable for a new buyer. And it just so happened that we were able to exit it a couple months later on so there is nothing that was specifically unusual, about that transaction. Rob, I'll take the first part of that, and I think Scott going to take how we're working together. So our punch line is, the business is performing very well north of $45 billion of AUM today. We have a 40% share in that. And you're seeing that flow through our financial results in a couple of ways. Through most of the year, you're seeing it flow through on our pro rata share of management fees. What you'll see and a little bit of incentive fees along the way, their performance year end is the end of September. And so what you'll see in our financials in Q4 is an elevated level of incentive fees, which is our pro rata share of Marshall Wace incentive fees. And that was in the 250 plus million number that I gave earlier on this call around our pipeline of visibility. Yes, sure. No problem. In the quarter, we deployed a little bit more than $800 million of capital to balance sheet and we realized about $360 million."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to KKR's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I will now hand the call over to Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.\nCraig Larson: Thank you, Operator. Welcome to our Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. As usual, I'm joined this morning by Scott Nuttall, our Co-President and Co-COO; and by Rob Lewin, our CFO. We would like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, which is available on the Investors Center section at kkr.com.  This call will contain forward-looking statements which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to our SEC filings for cautionary factors related to these statements. Like previous quarters, we've also posted a supplementary deck on our website that we'll be referring to over the course of the call. And we hope that you and your families, of course, are safe and healthy.  To begin, as a reminder, in early July, KKR signed a definitive agreement to acquire Global Atlantic Financial Group, or GA. The acquisition is subject to regulatory approvals and closing conditions and isn't expected to close until early 2021. So while Scott is going to touch on GA in a few minutes, the quarterly results we're going to discuss on this call exclude the results of Global Atlantic. The presentation and transcript from our investor call that introduces GA and all of the opportunities that we see resulting from the acquisition are both available on the Investors Center section of our website. Also of note in the quarter before I turn to the supplement. On June 26, we were pleased to be added to the Russell Index family, including the benchmark Russell 1000 and 3000 indices. This is just the most recent step in the evolution of our structure and our shareholder base. Since we announced our conversion from a partnership to a traditional corporation in May 2018, we've seen a meaningful increase in our mutual fund and index ownership, and our stock is up over 70% on a total return basis over this time frame compared to negative 7% for the S&P 500 Financials Index. Alongside our fundamental performance, the changes we've made to our structure and reporting have played an important part in this, and we continue to meet with new potential investors who haven't evaluated our sector or KKR before.  Let's turn to Page 2 of the supplement to go over our key metrics. Looking at the top half of the page, you can see AUM this quarter grew to $222 billion. With global equity indices up modestly over the last 12 months and high-yield and leveraged loan indices down over this period, our AUM has increased 8% year-over-year. Alongside investment performance in Q2, we had a strong fundraising quarter with $16 billion of new capital raised. Driven by fundraising and capital deployed, management fees over the last 12 months were $1.3 billion, up 13%.  Looking at the bottom half of the page. Our book value per share this quarter came in at $17.73 per share. This is up 7% from the $16.52 we reported last quarter. And as you can see, even amid significant volatility over the last 12 months, our book values remain relatively steady compared to the $17.81 per share reported a year ago. And finally, our after-tax distributable earnings came in at $326 million for the quarter or $0.39 on an adjusted per share basis, flat from Q2 last year. That brings us to $0.80 per share for the first half of the year, up 5% compared to the first half of 2019 and over $1.4 billion of after-tax DE over the last 12 months.  And one additional point when you look at the bottom right-hand chart. The top part of the bars, the lighter shaded portion, reflects realized balance sheet gains which can be more episodic in nature as we're also going to look to compound value on the balance sheet. So where we've seen more consistent growth is reflected in the bottom, darker portion of the bars, our fees and carry, in addition to interest income and dividends.  Turning to our summary financial results, please look at Page 3 of the supplement. Focusing on our results for the second quarter 2020. Management fees were $333 million, up 10% compared to the second quarter of 2019. Our realized performance income totaled $355 million. Despite all of the volatility, it was a good realized carried interest quarter for us, with carry generated across the firm. Over 90% of the carry came from investments outside the U.S., with over half coming from non-private equity strategies. The largest exits in the quarter were accomplished at a blended multiple of approximately 3.5x our cost. With $90 million of realized investment income, our total revenues were $892 million this quarter.  Now looking at our expenses. Compensation, including equity based comp, totaled $357 million, with our comp ratio once again this quarter coming in at 40%. We noted last quarter that even with market volatility and an uncertain monetization backdrop, that we would maintain our expected comp ratio, low 40s as a percentage of total revenues, for the remainder of 2020. So this quarter is at the low end of that guidance. Non-compensation expense totaled $86 million in the quarter, which is down from the $99 million reported in the second quarter of 2019 due to prudent cost management.  All of these results lead us to an operating margin of 50% and after-tax distributable earnings of $326 million, which again translates to that $0.39 per share figure.  And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Rob.\nRobert Lewin: Thanks a lot, Craig, and hello, everyone. I'm going to begin with some thoughts on our financial performance over the first half of 2020. And then we'll spend some time on our investment performance, before reviewing our fundraising and deployment activities.  To start, please take a look at the right-hand side of Page 3 of the deck. We've all clearly experienced significant market volatility year-to-date. Recognizing that dynamic, I think the resiliency of our business model is best highlighted by our results in the first half of 2020 compared to 2019. One of the key financial metrics that we utilize as a management team and we know is a critical focus for our investors is after tax distributable earnings per share. We were flat in Q2, and for the first half of 2020, our after-tax DE per share is up 5% relative to the same period last year. To be up 5% in such an important profitability metric does represent, we believe, differentiated performance relative to a broad set of comparables and speaks to the resilience of our model.  I thought it would be helpful to spend a minute on this call walking through some of the drivers of our performance. Let's start with revenues, which totaled $1.8 billion for the first half of the year and are up 4% year-over-year. Our revenue contributions have really been broad-based. Our most stable form of revenue, management fees, are up 12% over the 6 -- first 6 months of the year. Our carried interest has also been a meaningful contributor this year, as we have benefited from both strong investment performance and monetizations in several funds. Importantly, this is across different geographies and products, which has resulted in over $700 million of realized performance revenue year-to-date. That is up 25% relative to last year. And finally, our balance sheet continue to be a meaningful source of realized revenue, contributing $235 million in the first half of 2020. As it relates to our expense base, as Craig mentioned, last quarter on this same call, we committed to run KKR at a low 40% variable comp margin even through the volatility. Given our performance year-to-date, we are accruing total compensation, which includes equity-based comp, at a 40% margin, roughly flat to the same period last year.  Moving to our non-compensation related expense. Like many corporates, we have benefited from the reduced operating spend of having most of our employees working remotely. In addition, our management team has been very focused on trying to reduce our cost footprint wherever we are able to do so responsibly and without jeopardizing future growth. While you can see this reduced operating costs on a year-to-date basis, it's most pronounced in Q2, where our operating expenses are down approximately 13%.  As a result of both our revenue and cost performance, our distributable operating margin has increased by approximately 100 basis points year-to-date and is tracking right around 50%. All of this results in after-tax DE per share of $0.80 for the first 6 months of 2020 compared to $0.77 for the same period in 2019.  So our revenues are up, our margins have improved, and most importantly, our distributable earnings per share are up 5%. In addition to some of the P&L metrics, fundraising has also meaningfully accelerated through the first half of the year. Our new capital raised is up almost 2x in 2020 relative to the same period in 2019. Looking at our results in full. Our model is proving that it can hold up quite well during periods of market uncertainty.  Turning to investment performance. Please take a look at Page 4 of the supplement. Generally, we tend to focus on the trailing 12 months. But on this page, you'll also see we have included performance figures for the quarter given how volatile markets have been. Our private equity flagship funds returned 14% over the trailing 12 months, that compares to the total return for the S&P 500 and MSCI World indices of 7% and 3%. Our flagship real estate and infrastructure strategies returned 13% and 30%, respectively, over the last 12 months. The sale of Deutsche Glasfaser closed in the quarter, which was a very meaningful monetization for our infra business and is a big driver of our LTM performance.  In credit, we had a very positive quarter. Leveraged credit, the largest of our credit businesses by AUM, was up 11% in Q2 and flat over the LTM period. Alternative credit was up 2% in the quarter and down 10% LTM. Alternative credit is a combination of our private performing credit strategies, which had good relative performance; and our distressed portfolio, which took some marks LTM. This all compares to the LSTA index over the 12 months, which declined by about 2%. In terms of our balance sheet, our investment portfolio appreciated 8% this quarter, driving the increase in our book value per share to $17.73. Of note, our net accrued carry balance increased 27% in the quarter.  Turning to fundraising. Please flip to Page 5 of the supplement. As mentioned earlier, we're finding this a good environment to raise capital. On this page, we show the quarterly capital raised over the past 5 years, where we have averaged around $7.3 billion per quarter. This compares to the $16-plus billion we raised in Q2, which is a record quarter for us as a public company in both private and public markets. In the bar on the far right, you could see how this $16 billion breaks down.  The largest component is the capital raised so far for our Asia private equity strategy, one of our flagship raises. Including capital from initial closings through July, our Asia IV Fund is currently at approximately $11 billion, which is already 20% larger than its previous vintage and the largest pan-Asian private equity fund in the world. We will provide further updates on the fundraise as it continues to progress.  The second component, $4.2 billion, encompasses first-time funds and adjacent strategies. As we have talked previously about increasing our management fees by at least 50% over the coming 3 years, flagship funds are definitely important, but scaling up these newer strategies are also critical to achieving that goal. We're now starting to see the impact as new capital is raised in areas like Asia infra, which now totals $2.5 billion, as well as Asia real estate, core plus real estate and our dislocation strategy.  And finally, in the quarter, we raised capital within leveraged credit, we issued 2 European CLOs and earned our pro rata portion of inflows at Marshall Wace, all of which show up in the additional component.  Turning to Page 6. I want to spend a few minutes on one aspect of our business that we believe is very differentiated. We've spoken frequently about the significant growth opportunities we have ahead had, maybe our biggest is in Asia. Over the past 15 years, we've created the leading private equity franchise in the region. In addition, for a number of years now, we've been hiring local talent and building integrated teams across many non-private equity strategies.  As a result, you're starting to see our asset management footprint across Asia really start to scale. We are the clear leader in private equity and we're benefiting from the direct expansion of some of our non-PE strategies, with capital raised in infrastructure and real estate, with more to come over time in areas like alternative credit and growth equity. As you can see on the page, over the past 12 months, AUM has increased from $19 billion to $30 billion, with a lot of running room still ahead of us.  Looking at the right-hand side of the page, you see the current run rate pro forma management fee impact of this new capital raise. With Asia IV now turning on in July, the net impact of this collective fundraising has added approximately $100 million of run rate management fees. Between the continued economic growth in Asia, secular tailwinds for the alternative space in the region, and our differentiated track record as well as best-in-class local team, we really believe our Asia business can be as big as our North America franchise in the coming years.  Finally, turning to deployment on Page 7. Last quarter, we talked about the global financial crisis and how it was formative for our firm and drove us to meaningfully expand our business in the post-crisis years. We wanted to better position ourselves to play offense during periods of dislocation. And we've done just that, having really been on our front foot from a deployment perspective.  As you can see on this page, we've invested or committed approximately $30 billion so far this year. This has been evenly split between public and private markets. Our public markets activity includes our traded credit as well as our alternative credit deployment. Mid-February through April was an exceptionally active period for this business when the market saw significant dislocation. Given our recent fundraising, we now have over $4 billion of AUM for our dislocation strategy. Approximately 30% of this capital has already been invested or committed.  Focusing on private markets, which includes closed as well as pending investment activity. Deployment has been across a wide range of strategies and geographies and is reasonably split between U.S., Europe and Asia. Our global infrastructure team has also been active, with approximately 10% of our investment activity coming from this asset class.  And with that, let me hand it over to Scott.\nScott Nuttall: Thank you, Rob. And thank you, everyone, for not only joining the call today, but also for joining our call on the Global Atlantic acquisition in July. Before I start, let me first say that I hope you and your families are all safe and healthy, and that you're all doing well during these continuing strange times.  To pick up where Rob left off, perhaps the best example of us playing offense year-to-date is our recently announced acquisition of GA. This transaction is highly strategic for KKR. As a reminder, concurrent with the closing of the acquisition and pending regulatory approvals, we expect to become GA's investment manager. If you look at Slide 8 of the deck, you can see what this will do for some of our important metrics pro forma.  Taking a look at the top of the slide you could see AUM impact. As a result of the deal, our AUM increases over $70 billion, or 33%. And all of these assets will immediately hit our fee-paying AUM, resulting in a 45% increase in asset from $160 billion to approximately $233 billion. And the assets we manage on behalf of insurance companies will increase by more than 3.5x to over $100 billion. On the bottom half of the page, you'll see the transaction increases our perpetual capital by 4.9x, from $19 billion to $91 billion. And pro forma for the transaction, we will have 40% of our AUM either perpetual or with a multi-decade recycling provisions. And 84% of our capital overall will have a contractual life of over 8 years at inception. So the transaction will provide more scale and do it in a permanent way, meaningfully advancing several important strategic initiatives for us simultaneously.  But it's not just about the numbers and the immediate impact. This transaction brings us a fantastic management team as a partner that we believe is well positioned to grow GA materially from here. And the transaction provides us access to important underlying trends we have been looking to gain more exposure to and provide us an ability to grow faster overall as a firm.  Please turn to Slide 9. One of the critical strategic areas of focus for us has been what's happening in retirement and wealth trends globally. The retirement end market continues to grow with an aging population creating demographic tailwinds. And importantly, more retirement wealth is being managed by the individuals themselves. We have been looking to gain more access to these trends. Hence, our discussions with you over the last few years about our focus on areas like insurance, high net worth and retail.  GA sells annuities and life insurance largely to individuals in their 50s and 60s managing their own retirement wealth or managing it with the help of a bank, wealth adviser or broker-dealer. So GA gets us in the way of trends we have been looking for across both insurance and retail. And GA is well positioned to grow from here, both organically and inorganically. And as GA grows, KKR grows. So the transaction will have a large immediate impact on us, but we think the growth from here over time will be even more powerful.  Page 10 shows the financial impact of GA. Notably, we expect annual net management fees to increase by at least $200 million over the next couple of years as we ramp up our work together. And our current expectation is that this transaction will add north of $500 million of run rate annual after-tax distributable earnings by the end of our first year of ownership. That reflects incremental management fees as well as our share of GA's operating earnings. And overall, the transaction will be accretive to all our key financial metrics and increases their quality, stability and visibility.  Taking a step back, I want to take a minute to reflect on the year thus far. We have felt for some time that our business model provides us with a lot of ways to win and is more resilient than people understand. We also felt that it would take some volatility to really prove this out. Well, volatility has been the theme for some time now, and through it all, our model has proven to be quite resilient.  If you step back and think about it, year-to-date, we've grown our revenues and TDE, increased our margins, scaled our businesses organically, raising record amounts of capital, invested or committed over $30 billion and announced an important strategic acquisition using our balance sheet as a strategic weapon, giving us yet another way to win. And the last 7 months give us even more confidence in our ability to further increase our margins in the near term.  Putting it all together, we have increased the scale and earnings power of our firm and the stability and visibility of those earnings during this period, and we see more growth and opportunity ahead.  And with that, we're happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.\nAlexander Blostein: So the first question is around fundraising. Now that we've been in this more challenging environment for a couple of months now, what are some of the key lessons learned that we could extrapolate from with respect to KKR's ability to raise capital in this backdrop? And I guess how does this inform your prospects of management fee growth over the next 12 months?\nScott Nuttall: Great. Thanks for the question, Alex. It's Scott. I'll take that. Look, I think we have learned a lot during this period of time. As I think we mentioned a bit last quarter, we've really picked up our dialogue with our investors and prospects during this period. So a lot of discussions, a lot of outreach. Easily 2x or 3x what would be typical in the pre-COVID environment. And a lot of that's been comparing notes on what we're seeing, talking about what we're doing in terms of playing offense, a little bit on what we're doing to play defense.  And so I think one of the big lessons for us is that communication and that transparency has really, we think, been beneficial to enhancing those relationships. And we're seeing it come through in the numbers. And Rob took you through some of the fundraising stats. But it's really coming through, it's institutions, it's high net worth, it's retail, it's insurance, it's really broad-based. And so I think, overall, a big lesson for us is keep going with communication and transparency.  And the other thing I think we're finding in this period of time is that brand is powerful and having a global presence is very meaningful. And so we've also found that having incumbency and brand, you can have an advantage during a period of time like this. So those are a couple of things we've taken away.  And I think in terms of what it means for the growth, Rob had mentioned that we had shared a couple of quarters ago that we felt good that we could grow our management fees 50-plus-percent organically over the next 3-plus years. That's before the Global Atlantic acquisition. And I'd say -- well, it's hard to be precise. I'd say this period of time gives us even more confidence in that path.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.\nGlenn Schorr: So you've made some hires on the retail front lately, and you're clearly seeing some progress as displayed in a couple of the fund raises that you just mentioned. I'm just curious where you think you're at in the retail buildout and which products might be better suited there. Meaning, do you have everything you need? Or are you still on that innovation and rollout front?\nScott Nuttall: Glenn, it's Scott. Thanks for the question. You're right. We have been hiring into that team and continuing to build up that effort. We're by no means done. I think there's more to do on the hiring front. We have been continuing to gain traction in the retail space, in the high net worth. We've got a direct team. We have a platforms team. We have a number of partnerships that we've developed around the world. I think there's a lot more for us to do. So call it maybe second inning, bottom of the second, if you will. So we've got a long way to go and a lot of opportunity, we think, ahead.  In terms of the products, it's pretty broad-based. So we've seen it across -- the retail channel be very effective in terms of raising capital for us across credit, certainly. But also across private equity, growth equity, infrastructure, it's been very broad based in terms of the different products that we found that the retail channel is receptive to. Particular interest as of late in anything with yield. And one of the themes we're focused on is real assets with yields. So I think you'll see even more in areas like that. So that would be real estate, infrastructure in particular. So a lot of different ways to grow there, we think.\nCraig Larson: And I think, Glenn, it's Craig. The one stat I'd add on top of that as it relates to the quarter, retail, again, typically represents a teens percentage of new capital raised in any given quarter. And in terms of the $16 billion raise this quarter, again, it was a high-teens percentage. So it was again nice to see that follow through in terms of the results from this quarter as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Lee with KBW.\nRobert Lee: Great. I hope everyone's doing well. Scott, maybe just sticking with fundraising theme. Certainly, last quarter, understandably kind of a little more -- still positive, but more muted about maybe the timing and pace of fundraising, getting -- given everything, excuse me. You seem, in some ways, a little bit more enthusiastic about it now just in terms of maybe it's not going to be as delayed or as pushed out. Is that a fair assessment at this point?\nScott Nuttall: Rob, thanks for the question. I hope you're doing well, too. Yes. I think last quarter, I would say, we -- you're right, we did share that 3-year kind of perspective in terms of our ability to grow our management fee line again by 50%. We mentioned last quarter that, at best we could tell at that moment, we might push that out a few quarters. We were more in the teeth of COVID at the time.  But I do think we do feel a bit more optimistic today. To be candid, it's hard to be entirely precise, given the dynamism of the environment. But I do feel like we're a bit more optimistic today with a quarter like the one we just had behind us and the deployment that we've seen across a number of our different strategies globally. So some of the fundraises that we expected might be kind of 24 to 36 months from now, some of those are looking like they could be more like 12 to 24 months from now. And so we're seeing some of those pulled in a bit.  So we're not going to get precise in terms of which quarter precisely. But you're right. I think we're a bit more optimistic today. And I'd say, overall, our confidence in being able to grow 50-plus-percent is higher, and to be -- than it was last quarter within that time frame just by virtue of what we're seeing.  I'd also say that, as a reminder, all of that is before the Global Atlantic acquisition. So if you think about what we've said today, we're expecting $200 million-plus of run rate management fees a year, a couple of years out, that's on top of that 50% growth, which would obviously bring us to something more like 60% or 70% growth if you combine the two.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bill Katz with Citi.\nWilliam Katz: So just coming back to margins for a moment. Just want to just understand how much is just sort of tactical versus structural. You mentioned on one hand that you feel like you have opportunity to move the margins higher, so it sounds like that both in the scaling of the business as well as the transaction. But you've also alluded to sort of running at the low 40s for the comp ratio, and yet you're accruing at a 40% rate. So is the 40% rate the right baseline to be thinking about the legacy company? And will that improve subsequent to the GA transaction?\nRobert Lewin: Great. Bill, it's Rob. Thanks a lot for the question. So let's start with GA. I think that's the easiest piece, and then we can build up. We expect the revenue that's associated with the transaction to flow through at a very high level. So let's take that in 2 buckets. The first is GA's distributable earnings. They're going to flow into KKR's distributable earnings. And just for clarity, we're not expecting any additional comp growth on those earnings.  And then while our expectation as GA's asset manager is that we'll need to add some additional resources, we do have most of our teams well built out, and so the incremental management fees and carry over time, we think, should flow through to our P&L at a very high level.  And then Scott mentioned earlier some of our more organic scaling that we think we have across the firm, and we think we should be able to drive real margin expansion there as well.  And so while we don't have any specific guidance on this call, I think there's a lot of things that point to a positive direction in terms of our margins over the next couple of years.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America.\nMichael Carrier: Rob, I didn't hear if you gave like an update on just kind of realization activity, or the pipeline. Sometimes, you guys do. And it's fair if you didn't, just given the environment. But any update on that front? And even from just the portfolio, like how are you guys feeling on sort of the realization of the performance, particularly on the private side of some of the companies? And not necessarily for the quarter, but just over the next 12, 18 months?\nRobert Lewin: Great. Thanks a lot, Mike, for the question. And that's a good one. As it relates to our Q3 revenue, we do have some forward-looking guidance there. We expect $250 million of carrying balance sheet gains that are from deals that are already closed or have been signed up and that we expect to close. And so we're only a month into the quarter and we've got a couple of months to go, so hopefully, we can take that $250 million number up a bit. But that's what we have locked in today from those 2 buckets for the remainder of Q3.\nScott Nuttall: And then, Mike, I'll pick up on the second part of the question. In terms of the portfolio, I think the first thing to understand is portfolio construction really matters especially at a time like this. And so our portfolio has been performing pretty well. And I think it's due to a few different things. One is we have just been underweight the hardest hit parts of the global economy. So direct energy is about 2% of our AUM; hotels and leisure, 2%; retail, about 3%. So if you aggregate all 3 of those, you get to about 7% of our AUM. So we've just been underweight those sectors.  On the flip side, we have our largest exposure in technology. And so 25% of our portfolio overall, give or take, is in TMT. And so our investments in data and e-commerce are doing particularly well, as an example. And then on top of that, we have a heavier weighting toward Asia, about 30% of our private equity portfolio, and Asia is kind of further along in the recovery.  So when you put all that together, we've actually been quite encouraged by the data we're seeing. We've seen a snapback in numbers since the last time we talked. Asia is coming back. Europe is coming back. And a number of different sectors in the U.S., we've seen the numbers bounce as well. But I think, overall, a lot of that's driven by how we've constructed the portfolios.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research.\nPatrick Davitt: It looks like you have some chunkier new investments in the pipeline in terms of putting money into work. So through that lens, do you have a view that, that could translate into a more constructive Capital Markets outlook than you've had in previous calls?\nRobert Lewin: Yes. Patrick, it's Rob. It's a good question. The short answer is we do. And when we look at the first half of 2020, we've actually been quite pleased with the performance of our Capital Markets business, generating $130 million of revenue in what was a pretty challenging overall market, especially the leveraged finance markets, where we spend a lot of our time. But as we look at the second half of the year, our pipeline is a lot healthier. And our expectation is that we'll certainly improve on that first half number in the second half.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.\nDevin Ryan: I just want to follow-up on some of the retail opportunity commentary. And maybe just talk a little bit more about the connection with Global Atlantic footprint and their retail brokerage network. And I'm really just trying to get a little bit better sense on framing the opportunity in terms of how important it will be in accelerating the overall effort. Are there new products that will make sense to launch once that closes? And just whether leveraging this network is really an initial focus once the deal closes or more of a long-term kind of just ancillary benefit? Really just trying to get a framing of the opportunity and sizing.\nScott Nuttall: Thanks for the question, Devin. Look, I think you've hit on a couple of important things. You're right. As a reminder for everybody, Global Atlantic has particular strength in their distribution through banks and broker-dealers, over 200 relationships of that type. And today, they're kind of distributing annuities and life insurance through those types of relationships. We do think there is a potential opportunity for us to work together with the GA team to distribute KKR products through that channel.  To be clear, that's an upside lever. It's not embedded in any of the numbers that we've shared with you today or in last month's call. But it is something that we've talked about from time to time as an opportunity for us to pursue together, either in just outright KKR product form, or to your point, creating new products together with Global Atlantic that kind of marries their capabilities in terms of risk-taking and investment management, frankly, because they have a very talented team on the investment side in their own right, with our capabilities around investment management as well.  So we have talked about creating new products together for those channels and using their distribution to distribute them. So again, neither of those opportunities, whether it's KKR product or new products we can create together, are in any of these numbers. But it is something that we thought about as an upside lever over time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gerry O'Hara with Jefferies.\nGerald O'Hara: Great. As it looks -- you noted in the deck that the GA deal takes perpetual capital up to, I think, roughly 40% of total AUM. Scott, perhaps you can give us some thoughts on sort of how you see that long-dated and perpetual capital as a percent of total ramping as you kind of grow the business moving forward, either through -- I guess, as you note, organic, inorganic insurance deals; or perhaps just other types of longer-dated capital that you might be looking to raise.\nScott Nuttall: Great. Thanks for the question, Gerry. So you're right. And just to clarify, so the bottom-right of Page 8 of the supplemental deck, what we're saying there is, kind of the perpetual capital technically is 31% of our AUM pro forma. And then the way you get from the 31% to the 40% that you referenced is we're also including our strategic investor partnerships. And those are the relationships that we have with big institutions around the world, where we are recycling capital plus a percentage of profits for an extended period of time. And so most of those have a total life of somewhere between 20 and 30 years. So that -- it's the sum of the 2 that gets you to the 40%, and it's 31% and 9%.  And so to your question, to be clear, we think there's opportunities to continue to grow both. Just as a reminder, GA in its own right, without KKR as a partner, had about $17 billion of total assets in May of 2013; and is now, in terms of total GAAP assets, over $90 billion. So they've been able to grow organically themselves and inorganically without a partner like KKR. So we think that's going to be Part 1 of how we continue to grow our perpetual capital. It's just working with a great team at GA and figuring out how to continue and hopefully enhance that growth trajectory organically.  There are also going to be inorganic opportunities, we think, working with Global Atlantic, whether it be blocks, things we could do together in terms of just the flow they're seeing, which is significant right now; or additional acquisitions that we can make together that would expand the $72 billion or so of invested assets we would pick up upon closing. So there's the organic and the inorganic through GA, would be kind of the first part of the answer to your question.  And then the second part would be the strategic investor partnerships that we haven't talked about in a while, but we continue to find that we're getting good traction. And think of these as really, as I mentioned, multi-decade, but they're quite customized. They tend to be large scale, in the multiple billions of dollars each, and they compound by virtue of their terms. So we think there's opportunities to grow all of what I just talked about, on top of maybe thinking about other things that we can do organically for KKR in this space and inorganically. We have our BDC platform, we have our REIT platform, we have a number of different vehicles that we've been building away from GA and strategic partnerships that we can continue to scale. And we're looking to create new ones.  And so all a long way of saying that we expect that $91 billion of perpetual capital to continue to grow, and that 40% figure, we think, can continue to grow over time as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.\nBrian Bedell: Just maybe, Scott, if we could just dive into Asia a little bit more, looking at Slide 5 and then to your points on scaling that business up, at that $30 billion level right now. Maybe if you could just give us a little bit more color on the geographic distribution within Asia, which areas you're focused on and which areas you see geographically longer-term growth opportunities. And then you mentioned this could eventually become as big as the North American franchise. When you're saying that, say, over the next 2 or 3 years, what kind of AUM are you envisioning, I guess, for both?\nScott Nuttall: Thanks for the question, Brian. I'll take a stab and maybe Rob can jump in with anything I missed. But in the first instance, you're right. We do have -- just to be clear, we have a pan-Asian approach. So just as a reminder, 8 of our offices at KKR are actually in Asia. So we have a presence throughout the region, and we have a very local model. So we have country teams, we do local sourcing. And we have those teams working initially across PE, but now as Rob mentioned, we've been expanding and bringing really the rest of KKR to Asia.  So when you look at that Slide 6 in the deck, what you see is you've got the growth of Asia private equity, but also these other bars starting to show up: Infrastructure, real estate, we're also working on private credit in Asia and growth tech in Asia as well. So we're bringing, if you will, the rest of the KKR product suite to that part of the world and leveraging this footprint that we've already built, and we're adding specific talent in each market as well to be able to execute on all this.  And I think what Rob's getting at is that we're just starting to see the benefits of that growth trajectory. And you can see how powerful it is on Slide 6, just with respect to what we've seen over the course of the last 12 months or so. And this is -- a lot of this is Asian infrastructure getting raised, Asia real estate starting to get raised. And you can see how powerful that is, just that, plus the next Asia Fund adds $100 million in management fees.  And so our focus is quite broad. It's North Asia, South Asia, developed Asia and emerging Asia. And we've been active in all markets and increasingly across real assets, private equity, growth equity, and now in credit as well. And so if retail, we're in the second inning, I'd say the expansion of Asia is probably a bit -- even earlier than that, and we see a lot of opportunity ahead.  We're not going to give you a forecast in terms of what that means for management fees. But suffice it to say, we've just added, we think, $100 million run rate with just what we've started to do, and this is just the beginning. So we do see a significant amount of growth opportunity ahead from here. And the investing that we're doing in Asia is consistent with a bunch of the investment themes that we've been focused on around the world. And so when you think about a lot of what we've done has been in some of the themes around digitization, telecom, cloud, there's a lot of what we're doing across the region in that whole tech space, in addition to a number of other areas around health care, wellness and a variety of other investment themes that we're excited about.\nRobert Lewin: I think that's a really good summary, Scott. The only thing that I'd add on is we have a lot of tailwinds at our back in that part of the world. Clearly, if you're going to look out over the next decade-plus in terms of global growth, you bet on that part of the world continuing to grow at a higher level than when -- more western markets. We think alternatives as a percentage of the pie are going to continue to clearly grow in Asia really through all markets in Asia Pacific.  And then most importantly, we've got a best-in-class brand in the region and I think really unique access to bring on great local talent. And that's what we've been able to do, especially as we've built up private equity over the years and started to really scale our efforts in some non-private equity strategies, we've been able to bring in what we think is the best talent in the region to be able to do that.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.\nChristopher Harris: So we're seeing sales of annuity products across the industry drop pretty materially, and the culprit seems to be ultra low interest rates. Can you guys talk a bit about why you don't necessarily think this is going to be a meaningful headwind to the organic growth at Global Atlantic?\nScott Nuttall: Thanks for the question, Chris. Look, I'd say we've seen the same as well. I think it's a little bit hard to separate, especially over the course of the last handful of months, how much of what we see in terms of decline in sales is low rates versus just a little bit of a dynamic of the pandemic. And perhaps it's been harder for some advisers to get to their clients or perhaps it hasn't been top of mind for some of the clients to focus on how they're managing their wealth as they get through this period. But time will tell.  But our view is that, if anything, this low rate environment is going to drive demand for savings products that have tax deferral. And really, that's what an annuity product is. And we believe by working with the Global Atlantic team and leveraging their distribution and our ability to invest well together, we can create a very competitive product in terms of what they've already done, but also then hopefully create some new products, as we talked about, that can really satisfy the appetite that people are going to have for yield and tax deferral in this environment.  So we don't -- we're not of the view that the last few months is a long-term trend. Our view is that it's a bit of a moment in time. And we believe that we'll continue to see organic growth by virtue of that need for yield. And I'd say on top of that, the inorganic opportunity is probably even more exciting by virtue of the fact that we're seeing a number of life companies and annuity companies that are looking to sell blocks of business and use proceeds to do things like share buybacks. And so we are particularly active with the GA team looking at their pipeline of new opportunities. But GA hasn't put out its numbers yet, so that's probably as much as we should say on the topic. But that's a little bit of background for you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprys: I was just hoping you could talk a little bit about your approach to product and strategy-level profitability. How do you approach that and think about that? And given the number of strategies that you're likely to raise in the next couple of years, which strategies do you think will make the most progress in terms of improving their profitability? And which ones would you think would probably have to wait out a little bit further to maybe another fundraise down 3-plus, 5 years down the road?\nScott Nuttall: Michael, it's Scott. Thanks for the question. It's a really good one. We do have, as you know, a number of businesses that we've been kind of scaling over the course of the last decade. I think it's something like 18 of our 24 investing strategies are less than 10 years old. And I would say, if you'd asked that question 5 to 7 years ago, my answer would have been quite different than it is today. Because 5 to 7 years ago, we had a number of businesses that -- frankly, a majority of our businesses, that were kind of in that Fund I, Fund II, just starting to earn their way to run rate margins kind of level. But now as we sit here today, we have a majority of our activity actually getting into that inflection part of the curve, where we're starting to see real scale.  We talked a little bit about on Page 6 what that means is for an Asia IV PE Fund as an example. But if you think about what's going on across infrastructure with us, we're getting into -- closer to our third round of funds for some of our real estate strategies. So that -- those 2 areas, kind of that whole real assets area of the firm, I think we're going to really begin to see significant upside and opportunity in terms of scaling. And we'll share slides like Slide 6 with you over time as we continue to see that. But those would be a couple of areas that I would point to.  I do think we also have a variety of other areas, like our growth strategies which we don't talk about a lot. But health care growth, tech growth, and now Asia tech growth, as I mentioned. We're continuing to expand in the growth area and we're starting to get into Fund II and Fund III.  So the weight of the overall activity is now getting to that kind of Fund III, IV, V; whereas before, it was I, II, III. And so it's really -- that's a lot of what's behind our statement, both Rob's and mine, that we see opportunities for more margin expansion. And that's away from GA. It's because we're seeing the scaling of all these different types of strategies that we've started.  And we are creating new ones, like Impact. But relative to the quantum of capital that is getting to that scale/level, it's a relatively small percentage, whereas 5 years ago plus, it would have been a much bigger percentage. And it's really that shifting of the weight of the activity that gives us even more confidence in our ability to increase our margins.\nRobert Lewin: Yes. Michael, it's Rob. Just to briefly add on. As we do our analysis, we go business by business. Even at that very micro level, there really isn't a lot in our business today where we're looking at things that need to scale in order to turn to profitability. And even some of our newer products that we are launching, that are on Fund Is, they are really leveraging a lot of the existing team and infrastructure that we have at KKR today. And so they're adding, effectively, additional scale and revenue to a cost base that's largely built out. So there's -- as Scott said, there's really not a lot there where we need to wait for that scaling to achieve profitability.\nScott Nuttall: Yes. The best example, Michael, is probably core, which is a strategy where we manage $10-plus billion now. And it's really just leveraging deal flow and work that was already inside the firm. We literally did not hire a single person to raise that $10 billion. It was just monetizing what's already here.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.\nChristoph Kotowski: A couple of questions around Asia III and IV. One is just to confirm. You said that Asia IV turned on for fees in July. And the reason why I'm wondering is, I mean, you still have roughly like $4.2 billion or 47% of the committed capital left in Asia III. So I was wondering, like, has a lot of that been spoken for already? Or are you going to just have a lot of -- or are the two funds going to be investing concurrently?  And then, I guess given that you've raised Asia IV with almost half of Asia III still uncommitted, Americas XII is roughly at the same kind of level. So should we expect also kind of as quick a follow-on for the next Americas flagship fund?\nRobert Lewin: Chris, it's Rob. I'll take that. And so it's a really good question. And the chart you're looking at in our press release, our capital deployed or our investment vehicle summary -- on Page 13, I'm sorry. That's based on deployed capital and not on committed capital. And so what you don't see flowing through there is deals where that capital is already spoken for and committed. And so we'll have a normal type reserve for our Asia III fund. But over the coming quarters, you'll see that deployed number for Asia III naturally kick out based on the transactions that have already been committed to. And you're right, Asia IV turned on in July. And so you'll see that flip from AUM into fee-paying AUM in our Q3 numbers.  And then as it relates to our Americas XII fund, you're right. The capital deployed in that fund has been strong. And I'm sure we'll have more news around potential raises for that strategy over the coming quarters.\nOperator: Thank you. It appears we have no further questions at this time, so I'd like to pass the floor back over to Mr. Larson for any additional concluding comments.\nCraig Larson: Jesse, thanks for your help. And everybody on the call, thank you, of course, for your continued support. Please follow-up with us directly if you have any questions further on the quarter. Otherwise, we'll speak to you in 90 days.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. We thank you for your participation, and you may disconnect your lines at this time.",

            "name": "Scott Nuttall",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob. And thank you, everyone, for not only joining the call today, but also for joining our call on the Global Atlantic acquisition in July. Before I start, let me first say that I hope you and your families are all safe and healthy, and that you're all doing well during these continuing strange times.  To pick up where Rob left off, perhaps the best example of us playing offense year-to-date is our recently announced acquisition of GA. This transaction is highly strategic for KKR. As a reminder, concurrent with the closing of the acquisition and pending regulatory approvals, we expect to become GA's investment manager. If you look at Slide 8 of the deck, you can see what this will do for some of our important metrics pro forma.  Taking a look at the top of the slide you could see AUM impact. As a result of the deal, our AUM increases over $70 billion, or 33%. And all of these assets will immediately hit our fee-paying AUM, resulting in a 45% increase in asset from $160 billion to approximately $233 billion. And the assets we manage on behalf of insurance companies will increase by more than 3.5x to over $100 billion. On the bottom half of the page, you'll see the transaction increases our perpetual capital by 4.9x, from $19 billion to $91 billion. And pro forma for the transaction, we will have 40% of our AUM either perpetual or with a multi-decade recycling provisions. And 84% of our capital overall will have a contractual life of over 8 years at inception. So the transaction will provide more scale and do it in a permanent way, meaningfully advancing several important strategic initiatives for us simultaneously.  But it's not just about the numbers and the immediate impact. This transaction brings us a fantastic management team as a partner that we believe is well positioned to grow GA materially from here. And the transaction provides us access to important underlying trends we have been looking to gain more exposure to and provide us an ability to grow faster overall as a firm.  Please turn to Slide 9. One of the critical strategic areas of focus for us has been what's happening in retirement and wealth trends globally. The retirement end market continues to grow with an aging population creating demographic tailwinds. And importantly, more retirement wealth is being managed by the individuals themselves. We have been looking to gain more access to these trends. Hence, our discussions with you over the last few years about our focus on areas like insurance, high net worth and retail.  GA sells annuities and life insurance largely to individuals in their 50s and 60s managing their own retirement wealth or managing it with the help of a bank, wealth adviser or broker-dealer. So GA gets us in the way of trends we have been looking for across both insurance and retail. And GA is well positioned to grow from here, both organically and inorganically. And as GA grows, KKR grows. So the transaction will have a large immediate impact on us, but we think the growth from here over time will be even more powerful.  Page 10 shows the financial impact of GA. Notably, we expect annual net management fees to increase by at least $200 million over the next couple of years as we ramp up our work together. And our current expectation is that this transaction will add north of $500 million of run rate annual after-tax distributable earnings by the end of our first year of ownership. That reflects incremental management fees as well as our share of GA's operating earnings. And overall, the transaction will be accretive to all our key financial metrics and increases their quality, stability and visibility.  Taking a step back, I want to take a minute to reflect on the year thus far. We have felt for some time that our business model provides us with a lot of ways to win and is more resilient than people understand. We also felt that it would take some volatility to really prove this out. Well, volatility has been the theme for some time now, and through it all, our model has proven to be quite resilient.  If you step back and think about it, year-to-date, we've grown our revenues and TDE, increased our margins, scaled our businesses organically, raising record amounts of capital, invested or committed over $30 billion and announced an important strategic acquisition using our balance sheet as a strategic weapon, giving us yet another way to win. And the last 7 months give us even more confidence in our ability to further increase our margins in the near term.  Putting it all together, we have increased the scale and earnings power of our firm and the stability and visibility of those earnings during this period, and we see more growth and opportunity ahead.  And with that, we're happy to take your questions. Great. Thanks for the question, Alex. It's Scott. I'll take that. Look, I think we have learned a lot during this period of time. As I think we mentioned a bit last quarter, we've really picked up our dialogue with our investors and prospects during this period. So a lot of discussions, a lot of outreach. Easily 2x or 3x what would be typical in the pre-COVID environment. And a lot of that's been comparing notes on what we're seeing, talking about what we're doing in terms of playing offense, a little bit on what we're doing to play defense.  And so I think one of the big lessons for us is that communication and that transparency has really, we think, been beneficial to enhancing those relationships. And we're seeing it come through in the numbers. And Rob took you through some of the fundraising stats. But it's really coming through, it's institutions, it's high net worth, it's retail, it's insurance, it's really broad-based. And so I think, overall, a big lesson for us is keep going with communication and transparency.  And the other thing I think we're finding in this period of time is that brand is powerful and having a global presence is very meaningful. And so we've also found that having incumbency and brand, you can have an advantage during a period of time like this. So those are a couple of things we've taken away.  And I think in terms of what it means for the growth, Rob had mentioned that we had shared a couple of quarters ago that we felt good that we could grow our management fees 50-plus-percent organically over the next 3-plus years. That's before the Global Atlantic acquisition. And I'd say -- well, it's hard to be precise. I'd say this period of time gives us even more confidence in that path. Glenn, it's Scott. Thanks for the question. You're right. We have been hiring into that team and continuing to build up that effort. We're by no means done. I think there's more to do on the hiring front. We have been continuing to gain traction in the retail space, in the high net worth. We've got a direct team. We have a platforms team. We have a number of partnerships that we've developed around the world. I think there's a lot more for us to do. So call it maybe second inning, bottom of the second, if you will. So we've got a long way to go and a lot of opportunity, we think, ahead.  In terms of the products, it's pretty broad-based. So we've seen it across -- the retail channel be very effective in terms of raising capital for us across credit, certainly. But also across private equity, growth equity, infrastructure, it's been very broad based in terms of the different products that we found that the retail channel is receptive to. Particular interest as of late in anything with yield. And one of the themes we're focused on is real assets with yields. So I think you'll see even more in areas like that. So that would be real estate, infrastructure in particular. So a lot of different ways to grow there, we think. Rob, thanks for the question. I hope you're doing well, too. Yes. I think last quarter, I would say, we -- you're right, we did share that 3-year kind of perspective in terms of our ability to grow our management fee line again by 50%. We mentioned last quarter that, at best we could tell at that moment, we might push that out a few quarters. We were more in the teeth of COVID at the time.  But I do think we do feel a bit more optimistic today. To be candid, it's hard to be entirely precise, given the dynamism of the environment. But I do feel like we're a bit more optimistic today with a quarter like the one we just had behind us and the deployment that we've seen across a number of our different strategies globally. So some of the fundraises that we expected might be kind of 24 to 36 months from now, some of those are looking like they could be more like 12 to 24 months from now. And so we're seeing some of those pulled in a bit.  So we're not going to get precise in terms of which quarter precisely. But you're right. I think we're a bit more optimistic today. And I'd say, overall, our confidence in being able to grow 50-plus-percent is higher, and to be -- than it was last quarter within that time frame just by virtue of what we're seeing.  I'd also say that, as a reminder, all of that is before the Global Atlantic acquisition. So if you think about what we've said today, we're expecting $200 million-plus of run rate management fees a year, a couple of years out, that's on top of that 50% growth, which would obviously bring us to something more like 60% or 70% growth if you combine the two. And then, Mike, I'll pick up on the second part of the question. In terms of the portfolio, I think the first thing to understand is portfolio construction really matters especially at a time like this. And so our portfolio has been performing pretty well. And I think it's due to a few different things. One is we have just been underweight the hardest hit parts of the global economy. So direct energy is about 2% of our AUM; hotels and leisure, 2%; retail, about 3%. So if you aggregate all 3 of those, you get to about 7% of our AUM. So we've just been underweight those sectors.  On the flip side, we have our largest exposure in technology. And so 25% of our portfolio overall, give or take, is in TMT. And so our investments in data and e-commerce are doing particularly well, as an example. And then on top of that, we have a heavier weighting toward Asia, about 30% of our private equity portfolio, and Asia is kind of further along in the recovery.  So when you put all that together, we've actually been quite encouraged by the data we're seeing. We've seen a snapback in numbers since the last time we talked. Asia is coming back. Europe is coming back. And a number of different sectors in the U.S., we've seen the numbers bounce as well. But I think, overall, a lot of that's driven by how we've constructed the portfolios. Thanks for the question, Devin. Look, I think you've hit on a couple of important things. You're right. As a reminder for everybody, Global Atlantic has particular strength in their distribution through banks and broker-dealers, over 200 relationships of that type. And today, they're kind of distributing annuities and life insurance through those types of relationships. We do think there is a potential opportunity for us to work together with the GA team to distribute KKR products through that channel.  To be clear, that's an upside lever. It's not embedded in any of the numbers that we've shared with you today or in last month's call. But it is something that we've talked about from time to time as an opportunity for us to pursue together, either in just outright KKR product form, or to your point, creating new products together with Global Atlantic that kind of marries their capabilities in terms of risk-taking and investment management, frankly, because they have a very talented team on the investment side in their own right, with our capabilities around investment management as well.  So we have talked about creating new products together for those channels and using their distribution to distribute them. So again, neither of those opportunities, whether it's KKR product or new products we can create together, are in any of these numbers. But it is something that we thought about as an upside lever over time. Great. Thanks for the question, Gerry. So you're right. And just to clarify, so the bottom-right of Page 8 of the supplemental deck, what we're saying there is, kind of the perpetual capital technically is 31% of our AUM pro forma. And then the way you get from the 31% to the 40% that you referenced is we're also including our strategic investor partnerships. And those are the relationships that we have with big institutions around the world, where we are recycling capital plus a percentage of profits for an extended period of time. And so most of those have a total life of somewhere between 20 and 30 years. So that -- it's the sum of the 2 that gets you to the 40%, and it's 31% and 9%.  And so to your question, to be clear, we think there's opportunities to continue to grow both. Just as a reminder, GA in its own right, without KKR as a partner, had about $17 billion of total assets in May of 2013; and is now, in terms of total GAAP assets, over $90 billion. So they've been able to grow organically themselves and inorganically without a partner like KKR. So we think that's going to be Part 1 of how we continue to grow our perpetual capital. It's just working with a great team at GA and figuring out how to continue and hopefully enhance that growth trajectory organically.  There are also going to be inorganic opportunities, we think, working with Global Atlantic, whether it be blocks, things we could do together in terms of just the flow they're seeing, which is significant right now; or additional acquisitions that we can make together that would expand the $72 billion or so of invested assets we would pick up upon closing. So there's the organic and the inorganic through GA, would be kind of the first part of the answer to your question.  And then the second part would be the strategic investor partnerships that we haven't talked about in a while, but we continue to find that we're getting good traction. And think of these as really, as I mentioned, multi-decade, but they're quite customized. They tend to be large scale, in the multiple billions of dollars each, and they compound by virtue of their terms. So we think there's opportunities to grow all of what I just talked about, on top of maybe thinking about other things that we can do organically for KKR in this space and inorganically. We have our BDC platform, we have our REIT platform, we have a number of different vehicles that we've been building away from GA and strategic partnerships that we can continue to scale. And we're looking to create new ones.  And so all a long way of saying that we expect that $91 billion of perpetual capital to continue to grow, and that 40% figure, we think, can continue to grow over time as well. Thanks for the question, Brian. I'll take a stab and maybe Rob can jump in with anything I missed. But in the first instance, you're right. We do have -- just to be clear, we have a pan-Asian approach. So just as a reminder, 8 of our offices at KKR are actually in Asia. So we have a presence throughout the region, and we have a very local model. So we have country teams, we do local sourcing. And we have those teams working initially across PE, but now as Rob mentioned, we've been expanding and bringing really the rest of KKR to Asia.  So when you look at that Slide 6 in the deck, what you see is you've got the growth of Asia private equity, but also these other bars starting to show up: Infrastructure, real estate, we're also working on private credit in Asia and growth tech in Asia as well. So we're bringing, if you will, the rest of the KKR product suite to that part of the world and leveraging this footprint that we've already built, and we're adding specific talent in each market as well to be able to execute on all this.  And I think what Rob's getting at is that we're just starting to see the benefits of that growth trajectory. And you can see how powerful it is on Slide 6, just with respect to what we've seen over the course of the last 12 months or so. And this is -- a lot of this is Asian infrastructure getting raised, Asia real estate starting to get raised. And you can see how powerful that is, just that, plus the next Asia Fund adds $100 million in management fees.  And so our focus is quite broad. It's North Asia, South Asia, developed Asia and emerging Asia. And we've been active in all markets and increasingly across real assets, private equity, growth equity, and now in credit as well. And so if retail, we're in the second inning, I'd say the expansion of Asia is probably a bit -- even earlier than that, and we see a lot of opportunity ahead.  We're not going to give you a forecast in terms of what that means for management fees. But suffice it to say, we've just added, we think, $100 million run rate with just what we've started to do, and this is just the beginning. So we do see a significant amount of growth opportunity ahead from here. And the investing that we're doing in Asia is consistent with a bunch of the investment themes that we've been focused on around the world. And so when you think about a lot of what we've done has been in some of the themes around digitization, telecom, cloud, there's a lot of what we're doing across the region in that whole tech space, in addition to a number of other areas around health care, wellness and a variety of other investment themes that we're excited about. Thanks for the question, Chris. Look, I'd say we've seen the same as well. I think it's a little bit hard to separate, especially over the course of the last handful of months, how much of what we see in terms of decline in sales is low rates versus just a little bit of a dynamic of the pandemic. And perhaps it's been harder for some advisers to get to their clients or perhaps it hasn't been top of mind for some of the clients to focus on how they're managing their wealth as they get through this period. But time will tell.  But our view is that, if anything, this low rate environment is going to drive demand for savings products that have tax deferral. And really, that's what an annuity product is. And we believe by working with the Global Atlantic team and leveraging their distribution and our ability to invest well together, we can create a very competitive product in terms of what they've already done, but also then hopefully create some new products, as we talked about, that can really satisfy the appetite that people are going to have for yield and tax deferral in this environment.  So we don't -- we're not of the view that the last few months is a long-term trend. Our view is that it's a bit of a moment in time. And we believe that we'll continue to see organic growth by virtue of that need for yield. And I'd say on top of that, the inorganic opportunity is probably even more exciting by virtue of the fact that we're seeing a number of life companies and annuity companies that are looking to sell blocks of business and use proceeds to do things like share buybacks. And so we are particularly active with the GA team looking at their pipeline of new opportunities. But GA hasn't put out its numbers yet, so that's probably as much as we should say on the topic. But that's a little bit of background for you. Michael, it's Scott. Thanks for the question. It's a really good one. We do have, as you know, a number of businesses that we've been kind of scaling over the course of the last decade. I think it's something like 18 of our 24 investing strategies are less than 10 years old. And I would say, if you'd asked that question 5 to 7 years ago, my answer would have been quite different than it is today. Because 5 to 7 years ago, we had a number of businesses that -- frankly, a majority of our businesses, that were kind of in that Fund I, Fund II, just starting to earn their way to run rate margins kind of level. But now as we sit here today, we have a majority of our activity actually getting into that inflection part of the curve, where we're starting to see real scale.  We talked a little bit about on Page 6 what that means is for an Asia IV PE Fund as an example. But if you think about what's going on across infrastructure with us, we're getting into -- closer to our third round of funds for some of our real estate strategies. So that -- those 2 areas, kind of that whole real assets area of the firm, I think we're going to really begin to see significant upside and opportunity in terms of scaling. And we'll share slides like Slide 6 with you over time as we continue to see that. But those would be a couple of areas that I would point to.  I do think we also have a variety of other areas, like our growth strategies which we don't talk about a lot. But health care growth, tech growth, and now Asia tech growth, as I mentioned. We're continuing to expand in the growth area and we're starting to get into Fund II and Fund III.  So the weight of the overall activity is now getting to that kind of Fund III, IV, V; whereas before, it was I, II, III. And so it's really -- that's a lot of what's behind our statement, both Rob's and mine, that we see opportunities for more margin expansion. And that's away from GA. It's because we're seeing the scaling of all these different types of strategies that we've started.  And we are creating new ones, like Impact. But relative to the quantum of capital that is getting to that scale/level, it's a relatively small percentage, whereas 5 years ago plus, it would have been a much bigger percentage. And it's really that shifting of the weight of the activity that gives us even more confidence in our ability to increase our margins. Yes. The best example, Michael, is probably core, which is a strategy where we manage $10-plus billion now. And it's really just leveraging deal flow and work that was already inside the firm. We literally did not hire a single person to raise that $10 billion. It was just monetizing what's already here."

            "name": "Robert Lewin",
            "content": "Thanks a lot, Craig, and hello, everyone. I'm going to begin with some thoughts on our financial performance over the first half of 2020. And then we'll spend some time on our investment performance, before reviewing our fundraising and deployment activities.  To start, please take a look at the right-hand side of Page 3 of the deck. We've all clearly experienced significant market volatility year-to-date. Recognizing that dynamic, I think the resiliency of our business model is best highlighted by our results in the first half of 2020 compared to 2019. One of the key financial metrics that we utilize as a management team and we know is a critical focus for our investors is after tax distributable earnings per share. We were flat in Q2, and for the first half of 2020, our after-tax DE per share is up 5% relative to the same period last year. To be up 5% in such an important profitability metric does represent, we believe, differentiated performance relative to a broad set of comparables and speaks to the resilience of our model.  I thought it would be helpful to spend a minute on this call walking through some of the drivers of our performance. Let's start with revenues, which totaled $1.8 billion for the first half of the year and are up 4% year-over-year. Our revenue contributions have really been broad-based. Our most stable form of revenue, management fees, are up 12% over the 6 -- first 6 months of the year. Our carried interest has also been a meaningful contributor this year, as we have benefited from both strong investment performance and monetizations in several funds. Importantly, this is across different geographies and products, which has resulted in over $700 million of realized performance revenue year-to-date. That is up 25% relative to last year. And finally, our balance sheet continue to be a meaningful source of realized revenue, contributing $235 million in the first half of 2020. As it relates to our expense base, as Craig mentioned, last quarter on this same call, we committed to run KKR at a low 40% variable comp margin even through the volatility. Given our performance year-to-date, we are accruing total compensation, which includes equity-based comp, at a 40% margin, roughly flat to the same period last year.  Moving to our non-compensation related expense. Like many corporates, we have benefited from the reduced operating spend of having most of our employees working remotely. In addition, our management team has been very focused on trying to reduce our cost footprint wherever we are able to do so responsibly and without jeopardizing future growth. While you can see this reduced operating costs on a year-to-date basis, it's most pronounced in Q2, where our operating expenses are down approximately 13%.  As a result of both our revenue and cost performance, our distributable operating margin has increased by approximately 100 basis points year-to-date and is tracking right around 50%. All of this results in after-tax DE per share of $0.80 for the first 6 months of 2020 compared to $0.77 for the same period in 2019.  So our revenues are up, our margins have improved, and most importantly, our distributable earnings per share are up 5%. In addition to some of the P&L metrics, fundraising has also meaningfully accelerated through the first half of the year. Our new capital raised is up almost 2x in 2020 relative to the same period in 2019. Looking at our results in full. Our model is proving that it can hold up quite well during periods of market uncertainty.  Turning to investment performance. Please take a look at Page 4 of the supplement. Generally, we tend to focus on the trailing 12 months. But on this page, you'll also see we have included performance figures for the quarter given how volatile markets have been. Our private equity flagship funds returned 14% over the trailing 12 months, that compares to the total return for the S&P 500 and MSCI World indices of 7% and 3%. Our flagship real estate and infrastructure strategies returned 13% and 30%, respectively, over the last 12 months. The sale of Deutsche Glasfaser closed in the quarter, which was a very meaningful monetization for our infra business and is a big driver of our LTM performance.  In credit, we had a very positive quarter. Leveraged credit, the largest of our credit businesses by AUM, was up 11% in Q2 and flat over the LTM period. Alternative credit was up 2% in the quarter and down 10% LTM. Alternative credit is a combination of our private performing credit strategies, which had good relative performance; and our distressed portfolio, which took some marks LTM. This all compares to the LSTA index over the 12 months, which declined by about 2%. In terms of our balance sheet, our investment portfolio appreciated 8% this quarter, driving the increase in our book value per share to $17.73. Of note, our net accrued carry balance increased 27% in the quarter.  Turning to fundraising. Please flip to Page 5 of the supplement. As mentioned earlier, we're finding this a good environment to raise capital. On this page, we show the quarterly capital raised over the past 5 years, where we have averaged around $7.3 billion per quarter. This compares to the $16-plus billion we raised in Q2, which is a record quarter for us as a public company in both private and public markets. In the bar on the far right, you could see how this $16 billion breaks down.  The largest component is the capital raised so far for our Asia private equity strategy, one of our flagship raises. Including capital from initial closings through July, our Asia IV Fund is currently at approximately $11 billion, which is already 20% larger than its previous vintage and the largest pan-Asian private equity fund in the world. We will provide further updates on the fundraise as it continues to progress.  The second component, $4.2 billion, encompasses first-time funds and adjacent strategies. As we have talked previously about increasing our management fees by at least 50% over the coming 3 years, flagship funds are definitely important, but scaling up these newer strategies are also critical to achieving that goal. We're now starting to see the impact as new capital is raised in areas like Asia infra, which now totals $2.5 billion, as well as Asia real estate, core plus real estate and our dislocation strategy.  And finally, in the quarter, we raised capital within leveraged credit, we issued 2 European CLOs and earned our pro rata portion of inflows at Marshall Wace, all of which show up in the additional component.  Turning to Page 6. I want to spend a few minutes on one aspect of our business that we believe is very differentiated. We've spoken frequently about the significant growth opportunities we have ahead had, maybe our biggest is in Asia. Over the past 15 years, we've created the leading private equity franchise in the region. In addition, for a number of years now, we've been hiring local talent and building integrated teams across many non-private equity strategies.  As a result, you're starting to see our asset management footprint across Asia really start to scale. We are the clear leader in private equity and we're benefiting from the direct expansion of some of our non-PE strategies, with capital raised in infrastructure and real estate, with more to come over time in areas like alternative credit and growth equity. As you can see on the page, over the past 12 months, AUM has increased from $19 billion to $30 billion, with a lot of running room still ahead of us.  Looking at the right-hand side of the page, you see the current run rate pro forma management fee impact of this new capital raise. With Asia IV now turning on in July, the net impact of this collective fundraising has added approximately $100 million of run rate management fees. Between the continued economic growth in Asia, secular tailwinds for the alternative space in the region, and our differentiated track record as well as best-in-class local team, we really believe our Asia business can be as big as our North America franchise in the coming years.  Finally, turning to deployment on Page 7. Last quarter, we talked about the global financial crisis and how it was formative for our firm and drove us to meaningfully expand our business in the post-crisis years. We wanted to better position ourselves to play offense during periods of dislocation. And we've done just that, having really been on our front foot from a deployment perspective.  As you can see on this page, we've invested or committed approximately $30 billion so far this year. This has been evenly split between public and private markets. Our public markets activity includes our traded credit as well as our alternative credit deployment. Mid-February through April was an exceptionally active period for this business when the market saw significant dislocation. Given our recent fundraising, we now have over $4 billion of AUM for our dislocation strategy. Approximately 30% of this capital has already been invested or committed.  Focusing on private markets, which includes closed as well as pending investment activity. Deployment has been across a wide range of strategies and geographies and is reasonably split between U.S., Europe and Asia. Our global infrastructure team has also been active, with approximately 10% of our investment activity coming from this asset class.  And with that, let me hand it over to Scott. Great. Bill, it's Rob. Thanks a lot for the question. So let's start with GA. I think that's the easiest piece, and then we can build up. We expect the revenue that's associated with the transaction to flow through at a very high level. So let's take that in 2 buckets. The first is GA's distributable earnings. They're going to flow into KKR's distributable earnings. And just for clarity, we're not expecting any additional comp growth on those earnings.  And then while our expectation as GA's asset manager is that we'll need to add some additional resources, we do have most of our teams well built out, and so the incremental management fees and carry over time, we think, should flow through to our P&L at a very high level.  And then Scott mentioned earlier some of our more organic scaling that we think we have across the firm, and we think we should be able to drive real margin expansion there as well.  And so while we don't have any specific guidance on this call, I think there's a lot of things that point to a positive direction in terms of our margins over the next couple of years. Great. Thanks a lot, Mike, for the question. And that's a good one. As it relates to our Q3 revenue, we do have some forward-looking guidance there. We expect $250 million of carrying balance sheet gains that are from deals that are already closed or have been signed up and that we expect to close. And so we're only a month into the quarter and we've got a couple of months to go, so hopefully, we can take that $250 million number up a bit. But that's what we have locked in today from those 2 buckets for the remainder of Q3. Yes. Patrick, it's Rob. It's a good question. The short answer is we do. And when we look at the first half of 2020, we've actually been quite pleased with the performance of our Capital Markets business, generating $130 million of revenue in what was a pretty challenging overall market, especially the leveraged finance markets, where we spend a lot of our time. But as we look at the second half of the year, our pipeline is a lot healthier. And our expectation is that we'll certainly improve on that first half number in the second half. I think that's a really good summary, Scott. The only thing that I'd add on is we have a lot of tailwinds at our back in that part of the world. Clearly, if you're going to look out over the next decade-plus in terms of global growth, you bet on that part of the world continuing to grow at a higher level than when -- more western markets. We think alternatives as a percentage of the pie are going to continue to clearly grow in Asia really through all markets in Asia Pacific.  And then most importantly, we've got a best-in-class brand in the region and I think really unique access to bring on great local talent. And that's what we've been able to do, especially as we've built up private equity over the years and started to really scale our efforts in some non-private equity strategies, we've been able to bring in what we think is the best talent in the region to be able to do that. Yes. Michael, it's Rob. Just to briefly add on. As we do our analysis, we go business by business. Even at that very micro level, there really isn't a lot in our business today where we're looking at things that need to scale in order to turn to profitability. And even some of our newer products that we are launching, that are on Fund Is, they are really leveraging a lot of the existing team and infrastructure that we have at KKR today. And so they're adding, effectively, additional scale and revenue to a cost base that's largely built out. So there's -- as Scott said, there's really not a lot there where we need to wait for that scaling to achieve profitability. Chris, it's Rob. I'll take that. And so it's a really good question. And the chart you're looking at in our press release, our capital deployed or our investment vehicle summary -- on Page 13, I'm sorry. That's based on deployed capital and not on committed capital. And so what you don't see flowing through there is deals where that capital is already spoken for and committed. And so we'll have a normal type reserve for our Asia III fund. But over the coming quarters, you'll see that deployed number for Asia III naturally kick out based on the transactions that have already been committed to. And you're right, Asia IV turned on in July. And so you'll see that flip from AUM into fee-paying AUM in our Q3 numbers.  And then as it relates to our Americas XII fund, you're right. The capital deployed in that fund has been strong. And I'm sure we'll have more news around potential raises for that strategy over the coming quarters."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the KKR Q1 2020 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today to Mr. Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.\nCraig Larson: Thank you, Operator. Welcome to our first quarter 2020 earnings call. As usual, I'm joined this morning by Scott Nuttall, our Co-President and Co-COO; and by Rob Lewin, our CFO.  We'd like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, which is available on the Investor Center section at kkr.com. The call will contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance, so please refer to our SEC filings for cautionary factors related to these statements. And like previous quarters, we've also posted a supplementary presentation on our website that we'll be referring to over the course of the call.  Before we get into the results, we want to start by recognizing the extremely challenging times that we're all experiencing, and we hope that everyone on the call are safe and healthy. And our thoughts, of course, are with those most affected by COVID-19, particularly those on the front line. As a firm, our priority during the pandemic has been the health and safety of our employees, while at the same time, continuing to provide best-in-class investment services.  Like many of you, we've largely been working remotely over the last several weeks. Thanks to the tremendous efforts of our technology and operations teams. It's felt like connectivity across the firm has actually increased. And similarly, the dialogue we've been having across our LP base has also increased as we've looked, if anything, to overcommunicate given volatility. And in terms of helping those in need during the pandemic, we established KKR's global relief fund, and we're also incredibly proud of all that our portfolio companies are doing in support of COVID-19.  Now turning to our results. We're going to begin on Page 2 of our supplement. AUM for the quarter came in at $207 billion compared to $218 billion as of 12/31 and $200 billion 1 year ago. New capital raised in Q1 totaled $7 billion, driven by fundraising in our real estate and Asia infrastructure strategies as well as within private equity. And driven by asset growth, management fees for the quarter as well as the trailing 12 months are up 14%.  We reported after tax distributable earnings of $355 million for the first quarter, or $0.42 on a per adjusted share basis. And looking on a trailing LTM basis, we generated after tax DE of approximately $1.4 billion. Book value per share, which is mark-to-market every quarter, came in at $16.52. As Rob will talk about in a few minutes, investment performance over the past 12 months has been nicely ahead of both equity and fixed income indices. So our book value is down only modestly over the trailing 12 months.  And finally, touching on a topic we introduced last quarter, inclusion in Russell's benchmark indices continues to be a priority for us. We've been meaningfully engaged with FTSE Russell over the last couple of months and any decision on something like index inclusion is obviously FTSE Russells' and not ours, we believe we meet Russell's requirements.  And with that, I'm pleased to turn things over to Rob.\nRobert Lewin: Thanks a lot, Craig, and hello, everyone. Really glad to be speaking with all of you today and hope that you and your families are safe and healthy. Beginning with the quarter's financial performance. We've reported solid results, especially when you consider how challenged the operating and monetization environment was from mid-February time. Looking at our distributable earnings P&L on Page 3 of the supplement and starting with our operating revenue. Total fees came in at $426 million for the quarter. Of those fees, approximately 75% are management fees, which are up 14% versus last year. Our management fees are largely driven by commitments to our funds, and the invested cost of our assets as opposed to the NAVs of our funds, which is a real financial benefit that our industry affords during periods of market dislocation.  Our realized performance income came in at just over $370 million for the quarter, driven by the sale of PURE Group and in South Korea, the sale of KCF Technologies. In total, carry generating exits in Q1 on a blended basis, were done at 3.5x our investment costs. And finally, realized investment income for the quarter totaled $145 million. In aggregate, our revenues grew by 11% this quarter compared to a year ago.  Moving to expenses. Compensation and benefits totaled $377 million, while noncompensation expenses totaled $94 million. One thing to note here. Our total compensation ratio, including equity based comp, came in at 40% for the quarter. As you think about your go-forward models, you should continue to expect our total compensation ratio to remain variable and in the low 40% range for the remainder of 2020. And finally, our operating margin came in at 50% for the quarter, with an increase in our after-tax distributable earnings per share of 11%.  Looking forward, we actually have reasonably good line of sight on future carried interest and total realized investment income from transactions that have closed since 3/31 and or have been signed and are expected to close. As of today, that number is in excess of $400 million. While a small number of those transactions still rely on various regulatory approvals to close, so there is some uncertainty around achieving 100% of that figure, it is definitely helpful to go into the next couple of quarters with a solid base of additional revenue. As a point of reference, a year ago on this call, that same number was a little over $200 million.  So in a quarter with tremendous volatility, all 3 forms of our revenue increased. Our margins were maintained. Our distributable earnings per share increased by 11% and our visibility into our near-term earnings has meaningfully improved relative to a year ago. However, this quarter clearly did bring its share of adverse impacts to our financial profile as well. You can see that most clearly in our book value per share, where all of our investments are mark-to-market every quarter as that came in at $16.52 at March 31.  Specific to our balance sheet, investment performance for the quarter was down 14% compared to down 20% for the S&P 500. And for the trailing 12 months, balance sheet investment performance was down 2% compared to down 7% for the S&P 500. While our book value per share decreased 14% since the end of December, it is still relatively close to flat from this time last year.  Turning more specifically to our broad investment performance for the quarter. Please go to Page 4 of the supplemental presentation. While you can see that many of the asset classes where we invest have been affected by the market downturn this quarter, our performance remains positive over the last 12 months. Our most recent flagship private equity funds were down 6% in the quarter, and our entire PE portfolio is down 12% compared to down 21% for the MSCI World index. Outperformance was driven both by our modest exposure to areas directly impacted by the pandemic. As an example, direct energy is less than 2% of the private equity portfolio. Alongside greater exposure to a number of technology and online oriented investments that performed quite well.  Turning to real assets. Our flagship real estate funds depreciated 1% over the quarter, while our infrastructure flagship fund appreciated by 18% in the quarter, which was driven by a significant exit that was at a valuation well in excess of its carrying value. While our energy returns are not shown in the supplement this quarter because we have an AUM threshold for what appears on this page, we know it's a front of mind topic right now. Our direct energy funds in aggregate were down 33% in the quarter. But as a reminder, this is only 1% of our total AUM.  On the public market side, alternative credit and leveraged credit depreciated by 16% and 13%, respectively. This compares to the LSTA and the high-yield bond indices that were both down around 13% in the quarter.  We do believe that the combination of our continued strong relative investment performance, especially in our flagship funds, as well as a 44-year history of operating through market cycles will hold us in good stead with our clients. While undoubtedly some investing clients have slowed down their pace of new commitments, we are also finding that there are others looking for ways to invest into the dislocation. As an example, in the 2-month window from March 1 through May 1, we have closed on or in legal documentation on over $10 billion of new commitments across our fund platform. In terms of what this all means for our fundraising outlook, it's a little too early to say. We've grown our management fees over the last 3 years by approximately 50%. And we've shared in the last couple of quarters that given the funds we have coming to the market that we felt we could do that again from 2019 through 2022. We are still confident in our trajectory, but our best judgment sitting here today is that the 3 year path can now take us a few additional quarters to achieve. So the destination is very much the same. It may just take us a little longer to get there. This is obviously a dynamic environment, so we'll keep you updated to the extent our views change.  Two final points before I hand it off to Scott. The first relates to liquidity. During the first quarter, we opportunistically raised $500 million of 30-year senior notes priced at 3.625%. We knew at the time what was valuable capital to raise, but it certainly feels quite differentiated in this environment. And in April, we thought it made sense to take advantage of an opening in the investment-grade markets for an additional $250 million of 3.75% senior notes that mature in 2029. Taken together, we have $2.5 billion of cash and short-term investments in addition to our undrawn revolver capacity, providing significant liquidity and financial flexibility. The weighted average maturity of our debt portfolio today is over 15 years.  The second point relates to our share buyback activity. Since the last earnings call, we have retired 11 million shares at an average price of just over $23 per share. Looking at our buyback program since inception, in total review is over $1.3 billion to retire shares at a weighted average cost of just under $19 per share. We are confident that the shares we repurchased in Q1 will be a very good use of capital as we look forward over the next several years. As you would have seen in our press release, we have increased our share repurchase authorization back up to $500 million.  And with that, I would like to turn it over to Scott.\nScott Nuttall: Thank you, Rob. Hello, everybody. Thanks for joining our call today. I hope you and your families are safe and healthy, and that you're doing as well as can be expected during this strange time. The first thing I want to do is acknowledge how much the world has changed since our last call with you. It's pretty remarkable. I'm sure you're all working to process it just like we are. So I thought today, I would spend some time telling you how we are approaching the crisis as a firm and what we think it means for us.  Before I do that, let me go back to the global financial crisis because it was formative for our firms. At the time of the GFC, KKR was a smaller, more narrowly focused firm. We had a private equity franchise alongside a young U.S.-centric credit business. Our capital markets business was nascent, and we did not have a balance sheet. As we went through that crisis, we focused first on defense in our portfolio companies. We repositioned companies where we had to, and we were laser-focused on capital structures and debt maturity profiles. We were not forced sellers. And on balance, our teams did a very good job during that period.  We also made some good new investments, largely in PE, and we raised our first third-party capital in credit. During this time, we also took advantage of market dislocation and merged our then private asset management business into one of our public permanent capital vehicles, creating KKR as you think of it today.  However, we found during and immediately after the GFC, that our businesses and footprint were not relevant to many of the very interesting investment opportunities we were seeing. We became frustrated by that, and that frustration helped set us on the course to make sure that the next time there was a crisis or a meaningful investment opportunity, we would have the ability to invest more flexibly in any risk reward we found interesting. In short, we wanted to feel as good about our offense as we did about our defense.  So we spent the last 10 years since that crisis, building KKR based on that formative experience. Over that time, we've gone from a few hundred million of balance sheet assets to $20 billion, and we've dramatically increased our capital markets capabilities. We've also meaningfully expanded and diversified our business. Since the last crisis, we've gone from 2 investing businesses to 24, 10 offices to 21 and $45 billion of AUM to $207 billion. Because of all this, we now have the ability to invest in opportunities we like anywhere in the world.  So looking back, the last crisis was critical developmentally for us. We made some great investments, we made large and important moves for the firm strategically, and it was an inflection point that drove us to meaningfully expand our business in the years post crisis. We are viewing this crisis as providing similar opportunities, but off a larger base of capital, AUM and capabilities to work with. So the possibilities from here are greater, too.  So we find ourselves in the fortunate position of being ready as a firm this time to not only play defense, but also play more offense. And we've been doing a lot of both over the last several weeks. I thought I would share a bit of color on what we're doing on both fronts. But before I do that, let me remind you why our business model positions us well for periods of volatility. Our model provides a significant amount of stability and visibility. About 80% of our capital is committed for an average of 8 years or more. And we have $58 billion in dry powder, waiting to be called for new investments. When you have contractually committed capital that cannot be taken away and our liquid balance sheet, it is good news when asset prices get cheaper.  Also, our management fees are largely calculated on committed or invested capital and not influenced by marks. So our management fees are very steady. As an example, our fees actually grew year-over-year in both 2008 and 2009. Plus, we have a lot of committed capital on which we're not yet earning fees. $19 billion committed with a weighted average management fee rate of about 100 basis points that turns on when the capital is invested or enters its investment period. So we have nice stability of management fees and visibility on how they will grow.  We're also global. As you heard from Rob, the visibility of our near-term exit pipeline remains high. That is due in some part to our Asia portfolio, where, of course, the virus hit first, and where we've seen some economies reopen ahead of Europe and the U.S. As we've discussed, we also have a large and liquid balance sheet. During times like this, we can use our balance sheet to be aggressive for new investments, for strategic acquisitions and for buying our own stock. We view our balance sheet as a critical strategic tool, never more so than now.  Having said all that, there is no doubt this crisis is impacting our business. We've been playing a good amount of defense over the last several weeks, largely focused on protecting what we have.  Most of our people around the world are working from home. We're finding that it's actually going quite well. Hats off to our technology team. We're very well connected as a firm, and our teams are functioning at a high level. We're also focused on our portfolio companies. We were fortunate from a portfolio construction standpoint as we've been quite underweight direct energy, retail and hospitality. Those account for only 2%, 4% and 1% of our global investments, respectively.  Now to be clear, we definitely have a number of tough situations to manage, but it's a relatively small percentage of the total right now, and much smaller than it could have been with a different approach to portfolio construction. So the firm is operating well through this. And while we have a lot to manage, it is manageable.  And while defense is taking some of our time, we're spending at least as much time on offense. We've been using our business model in dry powder to invest into these markets. As I explained, we've been preparing for an environment like this for over a decade. More recently, as we've mentioned on prior calls, starting a couple of years ago, we repositioned our distressed and private equity teams to be closer together and created target lists or shopping lists for debt and equity that we would want to buy if and when dislocation occurred. This preparation has helped us. Since the crisis began, which we mark is when the market started to be more volatile on February 21, we've invested or committed approximately $8 billion of capital as a firm. This amount includes dollars invested by our leveraged credit teams in the traded loan and high yield markets. Of the $8 billion, approximately $5 billion has been in credit of some type and $3 billion has been in equity. We are using the target list we've been building over the last few years. And investing into companies we know and like at risk reward levels we find attractive.  We're also finding opportunities for our portfolio companies to pursue M&A. And to invest behind former portfolio companies, like we recently did with U.S. Foods, and we are looking at noncore subsidiary sales from companies looking to delever or buy back stock. So there's plenty to do on new investments.  We're also spending even more time than usual with our clients. Part of this is making sure they know what's happening with their portfolios. But a lot of it is discussing how to invest into these markets and ways we can work together. We're encouraged by those conversations, which have helped lead to 40 first time clients committing capital to us since the beginning of the year.  Hopefully, that gives you some color. We've been busy on both defense and offense, and the firm is incredibly well connected through this. There's no doubt the near-term path ahead is uncertain, but there are several critical areas where we have clarity. We expect to continue to be successful raising and deploying capital. We expect to continue to be able to generate returns well above what's available in the public markets. And we expect to be able to use this crisis as we did the last one to evolve and grow our business aggressively through and coming out of this and to create the next inflection point for our firm.  Thank you for joining our call. We're happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. \nAlexander Blostein: So first, wanted to start with the outlook on fundraising. The path taking a little bit longer makes sense, given, obviously, lots of near term uncertainty. But I wonder if you guys can talk a little bit about how the composition of that fundraising pipeline may change relative to your original expectations. Which products could be smaller, which products could be larger, where you could continue to be pretty active versus the areas that could actually take a little bit longer?\nCraig Larson: Alex, it's Craig. Why don't I begin with that, and I'll let Scott add on at the end. Just to give you a sense of where we're fundraising currently because it -- the breadth is something that I think you'll see in this. So in Asia, we're fundraising for our private equity strategy, also outside of private equity and real assets. In Europe, that includes fundraising for opportunistic real estate and direct lending. Also fundraising across our dislocation, Americas opportunistic real estate, real estate credit and core plus real estate strategies, and at the same time, that's going to continue areas that you're going to see on a more continuous basis, including our CLO business. We had issued a new CLO actually a few weeks ago as well as areas like our BDCs and the hedge fund partnerships. So I think it's a -- it continues to be a very active list of areas where we're fundraising. Scott, anything you'd add on top of that?\nScott Nuttall: Yes. Thanks for the question, Alex. A couple of things. One, I'd just overall say we remain very optimistic on the go-forward when it comes to fundraising. So in terms of your question about composition, no material change to the composition in terms of where we see ourselves accessing capital. Maybe just a little bit of color for you. There's just been a lot of dialogue and engagement with our clients, easily 2 to 3x the usual. And it's everything from comparing notes on the environment, explaining what we're seeing through our portfolio, especially in Asia, given our large Asia portfolio, where we started to see recovery ahead of the rest of the world. A lot of questions on that. We're talking to them about their portfolios. But basically, every conversation then pivots to offense and where to lean in.  I think we have a lot of clients around the world that invested into the recovery post GFC and are looking for ways to play offense. And we hit a couple of these in the prepared remarks, about 40 new LPs since year-end, $10 billion raised in the last 2 months. And in particular, we're seeing high net worth and retail lean in, in addition to institutional capital. So there's no change in expectation for our outcomes. The commentary around it may just take additional few quarters is our best guess. But as the markets continue to recover, we may shorten that over time, but it's highly path dependent, but no change in composition.\nAlexander Blostein: Great. Of course. That makes sense. My follow-up question just around the $10 billion number that Rob and Scott, you both just mentioned. So $10 billion over the last 2 months. Can you give us what was in May? And then again, what kind of strategies drove that fundraising over the course of May? And give us maybe a sense on the sort of timing when that actually is going to come in into management fees?\nRobert Lewin: Great. Thanks, Alex. So what we were trying to do with the $10 billion, we'll not guide it quarter-to-quarter in terms of where our fundraising is, but instead to give a good sense to the investor community that we're still raising capital despite the volatility in the markets. And the best example we could give is the $10 billion of closed commitments or commitments that we have in legal documentation that we expect to close, as opposed to trying to parse it, whether that's going to be Q1 or Q2 or Q3 fee paying AUM or AUM.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bill Katz from Citigroup.\nWilliam Katz: Okay. I hope everyone is doing okay during this crisis, and thanks for the really well thought out prepared commentary. A couple of hot button topics that seem to be going through the alt space through this earning season is some of the composition of CLOs as well as potential clawback risk just given performance metrics in the quarter. I was wondering if you could address both maybe on the CLOs, how much of your revenues come from base management fees versus maybe subordinated or performance fees? And then how we should we thinking about any clawback risk, if at all, against the carry?\nRobert Lewin: Bill, it's Rob. I'll handle both questions. On our CLOs, I'll just put it into context, we do about $17 million a quarter of management fees across our CLO complex. A little more than $10 million of the $17 million are subordinated management fees are more at risk. Across that $17 million, we see de minimis impact in Q2, where compliance today or at the end of 3/31 with all of our OC tests. Based on what we see today, with downgrades coming through our portfolio as well as where we are in the market, we could see some impact in Q3 and Q4. Right now, we don't think that, that's a material impact. But as that -- as things change over the course of the quarter, we'll make sure to update everybody on our Q2 call.  And then on the second part of that question, Bill was around clawbacks. Today, we've got roughly $90 million of clawback exposure through KKR. And that's a few small clawbacks in a number of different funds globally. It's not something that's an irregular part of our business. And what we shoot for is to have our accrued carry, certainly be north of any clawback liabilities in a material way, and that's really how we present our numbers. So the $1.26 billion of accrued carry that we have on our balance sheet is net of the $90 million of claw backed liabilities that we have spread across the firm in a bunch of different and smaller ways. But again, that's pretty normal course for us to have some form of clawback liability in our business. And as of now, it's relatively contained.\nWilliam Katz: Great. And if I could get in my follow-up, even though the first one was a 2 parter. Just Scott, you had mentioned using your capital for both investments as well as potential M&A. I just sort of wonder, was that a generic comment? Or is there an opportunity here to potentially pick up some distressed assets at the strategic level? And if so, excuse me, where might you be thinking?\nScott Nuttall: Thanks for the question, Bill. As you know, we're always looking for opportunities, and we continue to look in this environment may provide some strategic opportunities that we find interesting. We're going to have a really high bar just like we always do. In terms of areas where we may be looking, I would point you to some of the younger areas for us, whether it's real assets, which is a place that we've been building businesses around the world as one potential opportunity. We're also thinking about opportunities on the distribution front. But nothing specific that I would point you to right now, just an observation that when you get in periods like this, sometimes opportunities come our way that we find especially interesting.\nCraig Larson: And operator, if we could just ask everyone to please limit themselves actually to 1 question, that would just be really helpful as we look to work our way through the queue. And if you have a follow-up, feel free, of course, to then get back in and we can circle back around. We appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Kotowski from Oppenheimer.\nChristoph Kotowski: Yes. Scott, I thought the color you gave on the investments that you're making, it was really interesting. Just a couple of things around that. One is when you said the $5 billion of credit investments, does that include investments made by your portfolio companies themselves to retire debt at a discount? And I'm curious, is there a lot of that kind of activity or was the window where they were distressed too short? And then secondly, you mentioned you did an investment in U.S. Foods. And I was curious, was that, since it's a publicly traded company, was that equity or debt? And I guess, why would you invest in a publicly traded company in a private equity portfolio?\nScott Nuttall: Thanks for the question, Chris. First, on the $5 billion, no that does not include activity by our portfolio companies themselves in terms of buying their own debt at a discount. There was some of that activity but not extensive activity. So that $5 billion I mentioned was just for the firm's account specifically. In terms of the U.S. Foods investment, that was a convert. So it was a convert in a company we know well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nCraig Siegenthaler: I wanted your updated thoughts on FRE stability in 2020 from current levels, just given your previous comments, to Bill's question on CLO subordinated fees and also some other sources of risk, including mark-to-market on NAV based funds, which I think is a small component for you guys, capital markets transaction fees, which are actually already quite low. And I'm forgetting if you include any FRE performance fees, including from like your BDC business Franklin Square, and FRA 2. So maybe just unpack other sources of risk that could maybe develop throughout the year. And of course, that would be offset by shadow AUM deployment and fundraising, too. But just I wanted to unpack those sources of risk there.\nRobert Lewin: Great. Thanks, Craig. It's Rob. And maybe the best way to do this is to take our FRE in component parts. The first and most important are our management fees, as you know, which are roughly 75% of our total fees this quarter. Even with the potential impact of the CLO subordinate fees, it's a fairly minor part of our overall business. And as you said, our NAV based funds is also pretty minor. And so as we look at our management fee component, we think it's both stable and has significant growth in front of it. The best example of that is being up 14% year-over-year this quarter.  On top of that, we've also guided that we expect to grow our management fees by greater than 50% over the next 3 and change years. The other 25% of our fees today are made up of a combination of transaction and monitoring fees that I think, over time, are probably biased to go up based on the overall size of KKR and how it grows as well as our capital markets business, which we think is a long-term growth engine for us. And a normalized environment really should be able to take some additional share with the business model we set up and the people that we have.  And maybe the last component is the margin piece of it. What we've indicated in the past is that if we're able to achieve the management fee growth trajectory that we think we can do over the next few years, that we would expect to see some margin expansion flow through our business. And so while we haven't guided to a specific FRE number, we do think that when you break out all of the component parts that would suggest 2 things: one, a meaningful amount of stability; and two, some real upside from here.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Devin Ryan from JMP Securities.\nDevin Ryan: I guess just would love to maybe dig in a little bit more about kind of the investing playbook from here. I heard the comments about kind of moving the distressed team closer to the PE team. And just trying to think about whether you guys are going to be looking at maybe opportunities in areas that you've shied away from because valuations weren't interesting, but now we're getting to some maybe pretty severe distress, and so that could be more attractive? Or is it more kind of focusing on the same, I guess, maybe areas that you have been focused on but just potentially getting a little bit more attractive valuation. Just trying to think about what the stress kind of defined might look like to you guys and just kind of the investment playbook in that.\nScott Nuttall: Devin, thanks for the question. It's Scott. I would say, we're kind of seeing this rolling out in a few different waves, and there's probably 4 big themes as we kind of see how this unfolds from an investment opportunity standpoint. I'd say the first wave was investing in dislocated traded credit and equities, and that we were particularly busy on that front over the last couple of months. And the commentary we gave around the target lists that we had created were very helpful in that regard. So there were a number of companies that we were tracking both credit and equity, where, frankly, the prices were too high, but we had a target price. We've done the work, and we were able to buy on the back of that work when the dislocation first showed up. And some of those opportunities were very short lived, so we were able to move quickly by virtue of that. That was kind of wave one. We continue to see opportunities there. Spreads are still wide, and we continue to deploy capital into that opportunity set.  So the second wave we've seen is providing liquidity to companies that are in need. And those tend to take the form of either structured equity or credit, and we've got the firm working very well together across both PE credit, real estate infrastructure where appropriate, basically making sure that all hands are on deck. And when we have companies that we know and like, they are looking for liquidity, we can move quickly. And U.S. Foods is one example of that, but we have several other opportunities like that, that we're working on to the firm right now.  The third big theme would be around portfolio companies making acquisitions. We're starting to see opportunities of that type of merge now and are working with several of our portfolio companies that are looking to grow and be consolidators through this time. And there, again, probably a lot of those conversations have been going on for months or years, but there was a meeting of the minds on valuation opportunity in times like this is perhaps everybody becomes a little more economic around what can get done and the synergies are even more powerful relative to the base of earnings. And so we're busy there.  And then the fourth theme I would mention is around companies, both public and private that are looking to sell non-core subs. And they're doing that to delever or to buy back stock or in some cases, a little bit of both. And that wave is starting to show up. So what we've seen generally is it started in the traded markets and now has moved into more of the private markets. And so we're busy on all of those fronts as we sit here today. And that's part of the reason we're so enthusiastic about the deployment opportunity ahead of us and the return opportunity on the deployed capital.  And yes, to your question, some of those are in areas that we may have shied away from in the past because valuations were too high, and they started to come back our way.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Patrick Davitt from Autonomous Research.\nPatrick Davitt: Thanks for the industry exposure breakout detail there. A lot of the other firms have also been giving us more color around what percentage of the portfolio they view as particularly stressed or exposed to this recession. So if I believe you have 1 high profile, 1 that's been in the press that doesn't fit into the 3 buckets you gave. Could you maybe frame your view of the portfolio from that standpoint, the percent of exposed companies that you maybe have bucketed into a meaningful stress category? And then conversely, perhaps the percent that has been categoried as more okay or maybe even benefiting from this environment?\nRobert Lewin: Sure. Thanks, Patrick. It's Rob, and I'll take that question. So we're not going to disclose how we break companies out into different buckets. But what we could tell you and it's what Scott mentioned on the call, and I'll expand on a little bit more, is we feel really good about our relative portfolio of construction, and it's going to be a combination of our limited exposure in energy, retail, travel, hospitality and leisure through our portfolio. On the upside, I think we've become overweight over the last number of years in online and e-commerce businesses, which have held up quite well over the last couple of months. And then the last point around portfolio construction for us is we obviously have a fair bit of weighting towards Asia as a firm. North of 30% of our private equity portfolio today is exposed to Asia or directly exposed to the Asian market, which has held up on a relative basis, better than the U.S. and Europe. And so overall, we feel good about our portfolio. Scott mentioned on the call, we certainly have our companies that are going to need some additional support through this period of time. But we think the overall construction of our portfolio and the health of our companies is part of the reason why you would have seen our investment performance hold up pretty good in our private equity businesses over the last quarter, and especially, if you look over the last 12 months.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr from Evercore.\nGlenn Schorr: That's a good lead-in to the question. I want to talk a little bit more about the Asia franchise. I would ask both the short-term and the long term, short term, meaning, besides holding up better, what can you use in terms of those markets being ahead of us and opening up? And what can you learn from that across the franchise, where the opportunities are? And then longer term, is a little tougher because right now, there's a little more China related friction and nationalism everywhere in the world. And I just -- I don't know if that has any implications on your thought process about the Asia franchise because it's such an important part of who you are.\nScott Nuttall: Thanks for the question, Glenn. It's Scott. So I'd say, first, on the short term, it's been hugely helpful having such a broad platform in Asia and such a big portfolio in Asia. Because obviously, we were able to see several of those countries and markets be impacted by the crisis ahead of Europe and the U.S., and we've started to see those -- a lot of those markets now bottom and start to see some improvement. And so just to give you a little bit of color, when the crisis started, we moved to kind of a daily call with the top people in the firm from all around the world, including in Asia. And the Asia team is sharing its insights from what they're seeing with our portfolio and on the ground, very early. And so we've been able to kind of learn from that as we adjust our approach in Europe and the U.S. and on the back of those learnings.  And we are seeing slow improvement across a number of our portfolio companies. We started to see it in Asia. Most manufacturing facilities are kind of now operating at 70% to 100% of capacity. We're starting to see that also occur in parts of Europe. And we're actually in some markets, even in the U.S., starting to see a bit of bottoming.  Now to be clear, it's not of the -- it's more like an elevator down escalator up type set of charts that we're seeing across the portfolio. But we started to see that happen in Asia over the last few weeks, and now it's showing up in the rest of the world. So it's been very helpful to us as we've navigated all this.  In terms of the longer term, we feel great about our Asia franchise and the opportunity we have in front of us. As a reminder, we have 8 of our 22 offices there, two of those are in China, 6 outside. We see a big opportunity to grow our business. As you know from prior discussions, we started in Asia in private equity and have now really been bringing the rest of KKR's businesses to Asia across real estate infrastructure credit, just to name some examples, growth technology, we're also bringing to Asia. And so we continue to see a big opportunity to expand our platform in that part of the world. And regardless of what happens with the China dialogue, we still feel quite good about the opportunity ahead for the firm.\nRobert Lewin: Glenn, one additional point, I'll just -- it's worth mentioning when we're talking about our Asia franchise, that's relevant. We've talked a lot about Japan carve-outs over the last number of quarters and how that's been a real strategy for us there. We actually had our first exit of 1 of our carve-outs that we announced in March, the sale of alpha beta, and that closed in April, around 3x multiple of money for us, and you'll see that flow through our Q2 financials. But that was a nice win for that strategy for us in Japan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Carrier from Bank of America.\nMichael Carrier: I just have a question on performance fees and investment income. So your level of carry eligible AUM seemed to dip less in some firms. Your ratio of paying carries above 60%, I mean, likely hire post April rally. I mean you mentioned the $400 million pipeline. So curious on the outlook of performance fees, maybe a bit further out and realize tough to predict. But on one hand, it still seems like a fairly challenging backdrop, depending on the type of coverage but some of these stats make it look a bit better than period. So any additional color you can provide, including the stability of interest income and dividends from the balance sheet?\nRobert Lewin: Sure. I'll cover both of those. Listen, there's a lot about the environment that's difficult to predict right now and carry -- realized carried interest, that would certainly be at the top of that list, I think, for all of us. But as you said, there's some encouraging statistics we have that 60% of our total carry eligible AUM. Today would be in carry paying mode on a liquidation value basis. And our accrued carry still stands at north of $1 billion. I think the most critical thing and what we try and do every quarter is to give you visibility in terms of what we actually do know on our carried interest and our realized balance sheet earnings, which is the $400 million plus million number that I mentioned in the prepared remarks.  As it relates to our interest and dividends, those have been elevated over much of the last three quarters for largely the same reason. We have a margin loan against our Pfizer shares and we've used that margin loan -- fairly low LTV margin loan to take a dividend in Q3, Q4 and Q1. And so that represented about 2/3 of our interest and dividends this quarter. And I think the other 1/3 of that is relatively stable, albeit with interest rates now near 0, we'll probably take a little bit of a hit on our cash balance on our interest line item. But the overall line should be reasonably stable going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Lee from KBW.\nRobert Lee: Great, and I hope everyone is doing well in this crazy environment. I have a question on the capital markets business. So I guess, thinking about it, it would make sense that at least in the near term, that business would slow, but by the same token to the extent maybe investment activity or opportunities kind of maybe pick up or remain healthy. There's actually some near-term opportunity for that business to be more resilient. So how should we think about kind of the capital markets business over the coming quarters?\nRobert Lewin: So, it's Rob, and I'll take that question. Q1 was an interesting quarter for us, $60 million of revenue, sort of in line with the $50 million to $70 million of baseline revenue that we had suggested in our last call. About half of our business in Q1 was from third-party business. It's pretty meaningful, especially in a quarter where KKR didn't have a lot of deployment across our organization. Listen, we continue to feel that in capital markets environments that are stable, that we should be able in ordinary course to generate $50 million to $70 million a quarter and then have the upside potential from some large transactions that have been a regular occurrence as part of that business, which is exactly why we've averaged in that business over the last few years.  As it relates to the near term, I'm not sure we're yet in normalized capital market type environment. And so for Q2, we might be on the lower end of that $50 million to $70 million range, it's certainly too early to say, and there's a lot of the quarter left to go. But we do think that business in market opportunities when capital is scarce is where that business can really shine around some of the larger transactions that continue to come through our pipeline.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank.\nBrian Bedell: Actually, a good follow-on right to Rob's question. In this environment, maybe you just got it Rob, if you can characterize the deployment capabilities in terms of anything getting delayed with the COVID-19 crisis and how that might sort of -- how you're thinking that might project out for the rest of the year, certainly if we get more contagion in the second wave? And then the -- how you see your -- both your capital markets business and your balance sheet, being used to help get deals done that a lot of other firms can't do to that extent?\nScott Nuttall: Thanks for the question, Brian. It's Scott. I'll take that. In terms of deployment opportunities being delayed, I'd say there's probably a bit of a pause that went on, especially during the first several weeks of the crisis as people were trying to process what was happening. But we've actually started to see our pipelines pick up around the world. Some of it was in the areas that I mentioned in terms of some of the providing capital to companies in need of liquidity, the rescue type opportunities. But we are also seeing some larger scale private markets opportunities begin to reemerge. As an example, our pipeline in Asia is very active right now. So I don't think it's going to have a big impact over the long-term. It's all path dependent, obviously, but we are starting to see pipelines pick up on the back of some improvement maybe in the visibility in terms of timing. So we'll keep you posted on that, but no big long-term change. Just a few things may get bumped into the back half that might have been in the first half.  In terms of KCM in the balance sheet, it's a great question. We really view our model is providing us with a real advantage in times like this. And some of the deals that we've been able to get done during periods of dislocation have been because we have been able to use the balance sheet and our capital markets business to access financing, both equity and debt when others couldn't. So we've had several situations over time, including recently, where we're not necessarily the highest bidder, but we were the only bidder that could actually access the capital and have financing certainty. And so we, as in prior periods like this are viewing KCM and the balance sheet is providing us with a real strategic tool to be able to do that again. And so good question and we are focused on making sure that we've got liquidity on the balance sheet and the capital markets team is really well connected with our deal teams to make sure that we can do that well in a time like this.\nCraig Larson: And Brian, it's Craig. Just one tangential point as it relates to capital markets in this value-add and certainly a strategic value is greater in periods like this. Sometimes people ask that question in the framework of our own portfolio companies. So one thing that I think it is helpful just to understand is how active the capital markets team has been to position us and allow us to be in a position of strength entering this volatility.  So when we look across the private equity portfolio in whole, we really have very few near-term maturities. So when we look at the maturities of our portfolio companies and what we see in 2020 and 2021, that represents only about 4% of the quantum of that long-term debt that we have. So I think we've -- given the strength of capital markets, it does help us allow us to be front footed when there is periods of volatility, I think it's also been very helpful in positioning us well as we entered this period.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Harris from Wells Fargo.\nChristopher Harris: Can you give us an update on where things stand with respect to the ownership of your stock by index and long-only investors? And related to that, what do you anticipate the potential Russell index might do to that number?\nCraig Larson: Chris, it's Craig. So I think we've seen a nice increase as it relates to not only index buying in that index ownership, but also as it relates to mutual funds who do look at those benchmark indices as they make their investment decisions. And it's really been our experience there that has really influenced our decision as it relates to Russell. So in terms of the -- when we look at ETFs in that passive amount, that's been in the mid-60s, between 60 million and 70 million shares that have been owned by those index providers. And as it relates to Russell, first, there are those ETFs and strategies that are directly linked to those indices like the Russell 1000 and 3000 and I think that math is pretty straightforward. A lot of you have done that math. Again, I think it would suggest to teens, million in the teens as it relates to those more formulaic strategies.  And really the second piece that has really most interested us are those mutual funds that are benchmarked against those industries -- indices and our ability to market ourselves through to those institutions and increase our mind share. And as we looked at it, we think that second piece should even be more powerful than the first. And so recognizing that we've spent a fair amount of time, as you'd expect, looking at Russell, they publish a pretty detailed construction and methodology document. And within that, they review a whole series of considerations for public equity, domicile, market cap, float structure, a whole series of items. So of course, we've reviewed that document pretty closely and alongside of that, as we mentioned earlier, have meaningfully engaged directly with FTSE Russell over the last couple of months. So as we stated earlier, while any decision on index inclusion is obviously their decision and not ours, we believe we meet Russell's requirement.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprys: Just wanted to ask around LP demand. I certainly heard you on the $10 billion of new commitments coming in the door. But I just hope you could talk a little bit more around how you see LP demand for the private markets evolving in this backdrop. On one hand, you have the denominator effect that drives the allocations higher and lower distributions from the asset class for all these so that means LP have to fund the commitments in the allocations from elsewhere in their portfolio, which could be a challenge, but then you have low rates. And so maybe there's more demand. I just curious how you see these sort of pieces and LPs navigating through these dynamics and the impact it could have on the asset class? Do we see more secondary activity? And is that a part of the marketplace that you'd like to have more presence in?\nScott Nuttall: Thanks, Michael. It's Scott. I'll take those. It's a great question. And it is a bit early, honestly, to be able to give you a definitive answer on it. I think you're right. There's going to be a little -- there's going to be some puts and takes, right? There's going to be questions for some of the institutional investors around the denominator effect and what happens with the rest of their portfolio and their allocations to alternatives. But frankly, we've started to see the public markets rebound. And so I think what were initial questions about that, now there's a little bit of uncertainty as to whether the denominator effect will be a big consideration or not. I think we're just going to have to give that a bit of time to see how that settles out. The last time that happened, what we saw was not a big reduction in allocation to alternatives, but actually an increase in the allocation alternatives so that institutional investors could actually keep investing in the asset class. So we'll see what happens here, but it's pretty path dependent.  I think on the flip side of that, you're entirely right. I think even the conversation in the last handful of weeks with CIOs around the world, there is a real recognition that a low rate environment went to a virtually no rate environment, and they need to keep looking for ways to generate returns. And so the dialogue around alternatives continues, which is why those conversations, I think, pivot pretty quickly from defense to offense. And so we take that as encouraging. We think investors around the world are going to continue to look to the private markets for returns as they're expecting less and less out of their traditional fixed income and public equities portfolios. We think that's great for us.  And we're also finding just as an incremental piece of color, that during this period of time, there continues to be a lot of interest from the insurance space, which tends to be quite liquid and conservative in its approach, so we've been quite active in our dialogue with insurance companies over this period of time. And from the high net worth and retail markets, we're seeing them lean into this from an offense standpoint as well. So there's lots of tos and fros in all of that. But overall, we think it bodes well for our business. There's going to be an even greater need for return. And if you think about the power of the illiquidity premium that the alternative space provides, the lower the overall normal market return is, the greater that illiquidity premium is as a percentage of the total return. And so there's even more interest in what we do, we think, coming out of this.  In terms of your question on the secondary market, it's a space that we continue to spend time on and have looked at from time to time, I think there will be opportunities for the secondary space to continue to grow and that's one of the areas that we look to periodically as we think about other opportunities for us strategically, but nothing to report today on that front.\nOperator: This concludes our Q&A session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Craig Larson for closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nCraig Larson: Thank you, operator, for your help. And thank you, everybody, for joining our call. We look forward to giving you an update next quarter. And for any follow-up items, of course, please feel free to reach out to [indiscernible] or me directly. Thank you once again.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Scott Nuttall",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob. Hello, everybody. Thanks for joining our call today. I hope you and your families are safe and healthy, and that you're doing as well as can be expected during this strange time. The first thing I want to do is acknowledge how much the world has changed since our last call with you. It's pretty remarkable. I'm sure you're all working to process it just like we are. So I thought today, I would spend some time telling you how we are approaching the crisis as a firm and what we think it means for us.  Before I do that, let me go back to the global financial crisis because it was formative for our firms. At the time of the GFC, KKR was a smaller, more narrowly focused firm. We had a private equity franchise alongside a young U.S.-centric credit business. Our capital markets business was nascent, and we did not have a balance sheet. As we went through that crisis, we focused first on defense in our portfolio companies. We repositioned companies where we had to, and we were laser-focused on capital structures and debt maturity profiles. We were not forced sellers. And on balance, our teams did a very good job during that period.  We also made some good new investments, largely in PE, and we raised our first third-party capital in credit. During this time, we also took advantage of market dislocation and merged our then private asset management business into one of our public permanent capital vehicles, creating KKR as you think of it today.  However, we found during and immediately after the GFC, that our businesses and footprint were not relevant to many of the very interesting investment opportunities we were seeing. We became frustrated by that, and that frustration helped set us on the course to make sure that the next time there was a crisis or a meaningful investment opportunity, we would have the ability to invest more flexibly in any risk reward we found interesting. In short, we wanted to feel as good about our offense as we did about our defense.  So we spent the last 10 years since that crisis, building KKR based on that formative experience. Over that time, we've gone from a few hundred million of balance sheet assets to $20 billion, and we've dramatically increased our capital markets capabilities. We've also meaningfully expanded and diversified our business. Since the last crisis, we've gone from 2 investing businesses to 24, 10 offices to 21 and $45 billion of AUM to $207 billion. Because of all this, we now have the ability to invest in opportunities we like anywhere in the world.  So looking back, the last crisis was critical developmentally for us. We made some great investments, we made large and important moves for the firm strategically, and it was an inflection point that drove us to meaningfully expand our business in the years post crisis. We are viewing this crisis as providing similar opportunities, but off a larger base of capital, AUM and capabilities to work with. So the possibilities from here are greater, too.  So we find ourselves in the fortunate position of being ready as a firm this time to not only play defense, but also play more offense. And we've been doing a lot of both over the last several weeks. I thought I would share a bit of color on what we're doing on both fronts. But before I do that, let me remind you why our business model positions us well for periods of volatility. Our model provides a significant amount of stability and visibility. About 80% of our capital is committed for an average of 8 years or more. And we have $58 billion in dry powder, waiting to be called for new investments. When you have contractually committed capital that cannot be taken away and our liquid balance sheet, it is good news when asset prices get cheaper.  Also, our management fees are largely calculated on committed or invested capital and not influenced by marks. So our management fees are very steady. As an example, our fees actually grew year-over-year in both 2008 and 2009. Plus, we have a lot of committed capital on which we're not yet earning fees. $19 billion committed with a weighted average management fee rate of about 100 basis points that turns on when the capital is invested or enters its investment period. So we have nice stability of management fees and visibility on how they will grow.  We're also global. As you heard from Rob, the visibility of our near-term exit pipeline remains high. That is due in some part to our Asia portfolio, where, of course, the virus hit first, and where we've seen some economies reopen ahead of Europe and the U.S. As we've discussed, we also have a large and liquid balance sheet. During times like this, we can use our balance sheet to be aggressive for new investments, for strategic acquisitions and for buying our own stock. We view our balance sheet as a critical strategic tool, never more so than now.  Having said all that, there is no doubt this crisis is impacting our business. We've been playing a good amount of defense over the last several weeks, largely focused on protecting what we have.  Most of our people around the world are working from home. We're finding that it's actually going quite well. Hats off to our technology team. We're very well connected as a firm, and our teams are functioning at a high level. We're also focused on our portfolio companies. We were fortunate from a portfolio construction standpoint as we've been quite underweight direct energy, retail and hospitality. Those account for only 2%, 4% and 1% of our global investments, respectively.  Now to be clear, we definitely have a number of tough situations to manage, but it's a relatively small percentage of the total right now, and much smaller than it could have been with a different approach to portfolio construction. So the firm is operating well through this. And while we have a lot to manage, it is manageable.  And while defense is taking some of our time, we're spending at least as much time on offense. We've been using our business model in dry powder to invest into these markets. As I explained, we've been preparing for an environment like this for over a decade. More recently, as we've mentioned on prior calls, starting a couple of years ago, we repositioned our distressed and private equity teams to be closer together and created target lists or shopping lists for debt and equity that we would want to buy if and when dislocation occurred. This preparation has helped us. Since the crisis began, which we mark is when the market started to be more volatile on February 21, we've invested or committed approximately $8 billion of capital as a firm. This amount includes dollars invested by our leveraged credit teams in the traded loan and high yield markets. Of the $8 billion, approximately $5 billion has been in credit of some type and $3 billion has been in equity. We are using the target list we've been building over the last few years. And investing into companies we know and like at risk reward levels we find attractive.  We're also finding opportunities for our portfolio companies to pursue M&A. And to invest behind former portfolio companies, like we recently did with U.S. Foods, and we are looking at noncore subsidiary sales from companies looking to delever or buy back stock. So there's plenty to do on new investments.  We're also spending even more time than usual with our clients. Part of this is making sure they know what's happening with their portfolios. But a lot of it is discussing how to invest into these markets and ways we can work together. We're encouraged by those conversations, which have helped lead to 40 first time clients committing capital to us since the beginning of the year.  Hopefully, that gives you some color. We've been busy on both defense and offense, and the firm is incredibly well connected through this. There's no doubt the near-term path ahead is uncertain, but there are several critical areas where we have clarity. We expect to continue to be successful raising and deploying capital. We expect to continue to be able to generate returns well above what's available in the public markets. And we expect to be able to use this crisis as we did the last one to evolve and grow our business aggressively through and coming out of this and to create the next inflection point for our firm.  Thank you for joining our call. We're happy to take your questions. Yes. Thanks for the question, Alex. A couple of things. One, I'd just overall say we remain very optimistic on the go-forward when it comes to fundraising. So in terms of your question about composition, no material change to the composition in terms of where we see ourselves accessing capital. Maybe just a little bit of color for you. There's just been a lot of dialogue and engagement with our clients, easily 2 to 3x the usual. And it's everything from comparing notes on the environment, explaining what we're seeing through our portfolio, especially in Asia, given our large Asia portfolio, where we started to see recovery ahead of the rest of the world. A lot of questions on that. We're talking to them about their portfolios. But basically, every conversation then pivots to offense and where to lean in.  I think we have a lot of clients around the world that invested into the recovery post GFC and are looking for ways to play offense. And we hit a couple of these in the prepared remarks, about 40 new LPs since year-end, $10 billion raised in the last 2 months. And in particular, we're seeing high net worth and retail lean in, in addition to institutional capital. So there's no change in expectation for our outcomes. The commentary around it may just take additional few quarters is our best guess. But as the markets continue to recover, we may shorten that over time, but it's highly path dependent, but no change in composition. Thanks for the question, Bill. As you know, we're always looking for opportunities, and we continue to look in this environment may provide some strategic opportunities that we find interesting. We're going to have a really high bar just like we always do. In terms of areas where we may be looking, I would point you to some of the younger areas for us, whether it's real assets, which is a place that we've been building businesses around the world as one potential opportunity. We're also thinking about opportunities on the distribution front. But nothing specific that I would point you to right now, just an observation that when you get in periods like this, sometimes opportunities come our way that we find especially interesting. Thanks for the question, Chris. First, on the $5 billion, no that does not include activity by our portfolio companies themselves in terms of buying their own debt at a discount. There was some of that activity but not extensive activity. So that $5 billion I mentioned was just for the firm's account specifically. In terms of the U.S. Foods investment, that was a convert. So it was a convert in a company we know well. Devin, thanks for the question. It's Scott. I would say, we're kind of seeing this rolling out in a few different waves, and there's probably 4 big themes as we kind of see how this unfolds from an investment opportunity standpoint. I'd say the first wave was investing in dislocated traded credit and equities, and that we were particularly busy on that front over the last couple of months. And the commentary we gave around the target lists that we had created were very helpful in that regard. So there were a number of companies that we were tracking both credit and equity, where, frankly, the prices were too high, but we had a target price. We've done the work, and we were able to buy on the back of that work when the dislocation first showed up. And some of those opportunities were very short lived, so we were able to move quickly by virtue of that. That was kind of wave one. We continue to see opportunities there. Spreads are still wide, and we continue to deploy capital into that opportunity set.  So the second wave we've seen is providing liquidity to companies that are in need. And those tend to take the form of either structured equity or credit, and we've got the firm working very well together across both PE credit, real estate infrastructure where appropriate, basically making sure that all hands are on deck. And when we have companies that we know and like, they are looking for liquidity, we can move quickly. And U.S. Foods is one example of that, but we have several other opportunities like that, that we're working on to the firm right now.  The third big theme would be around portfolio companies making acquisitions. We're starting to see opportunities of that type of merge now and are working with several of our portfolio companies that are looking to grow and be consolidators through this time. And there, again, probably a lot of those conversations have been going on for months or years, but there was a meeting of the minds on valuation opportunity in times like this is perhaps everybody becomes a little more economic around what can get done and the synergies are even more powerful relative to the base of earnings. And so we're busy there.  And then the fourth theme I would mention is around companies, both public and private that are looking to sell non-core subs. And they're doing that to delever or to buy back stock or in some cases, a little bit of both. And that wave is starting to show up. So what we've seen generally is it started in the traded markets and now has moved into more of the private markets. And so we're busy on all of those fronts as we sit here today. And that's part of the reason we're so enthusiastic about the deployment opportunity ahead of us and the return opportunity on the deployed capital.  And yes, to your question, some of those are in areas that we may have shied away from in the past because valuations were too high, and they started to come back our way. Thanks for the question, Glenn. It's Scott. So I'd say, first, on the short term, it's been hugely helpful having such a broad platform in Asia and such a big portfolio in Asia. Because obviously, we were able to see several of those countries and markets be impacted by the crisis ahead of Europe and the U.S., and we've started to see those -- a lot of those markets now bottom and start to see some improvement. And so just to give you a little bit of color, when the crisis started, we moved to kind of a daily call with the top people in the firm from all around the world, including in Asia. And the Asia team is sharing its insights from what they're seeing with our portfolio and on the ground, very early. And so we've been able to kind of learn from that as we adjust our approach in Europe and the U.S. and on the back of those learnings.  And we are seeing slow improvement across a number of our portfolio companies. We started to see it in Asia. Most manufacturing facilities are kind of now operating at 70% to 100% of capacity. We're starting to see that also occur in parts of Europe. And we're actually in some markets, even in the U.S., starting to see a bit of bottoming.  Now to be clear, it's not of the -- it's more like an elevator down escalator up type set of charts that we're seeing across the portfolio. But we started to see that happen in Asia over the last few weeks, and now it's showing up in the rest of the world. So it's been very helpful to us as we've navigated all this.  In terms of the longer term, we feel great about our Asia franchise and the opportunity we have in front of us. As a reminder, we have 8 of our 22 offices there, two of those are in China, 6 outside. We see a big opportunity to grow our business. As you know from prior discussions, we started in Asia in private equity and have now really been bringing the rest of KKR's businesses to Asia across real estate infrastructure credit, just to name some examples, growth technology, we're also bringing to Asia. And so we continue to see a big opportunity to expand our platform in that part of the world. And regardless of what happens with the China dialogue, we still feel quite good about the opportunity ahead for the firm. Thanks for the question, Brian. It's Scott. I'll take that. In terms of deployment opportunities being delayed, I'd say there's probably a bit of a pause that went on, especially during the first several weeks of the crisis as people were trying to process what was happening. But we've actually started to see our pipelines pick up around the world. Some of it was in the areas that I mentioned in terms of some of the providing capital to companies in need of liquidity, the rescue type opportunities. But we are also seeing some larger scale private markets opportunities begin to reemerge. As an example, our pipeline in Asia is very active right now. So I don't think it's going to have a big impact over the long-term. It's all path dependent, obviously, but we are starting to see pipelines pick up on the back of some improvement maybe in the visibility in terms of timing. So we'll keep you posted on that, but no big long-term change. Just a few things may get bumped into the back half that might have been in the first half.  In terms of KCM in the balance sheet, it's a great question. We really view our model is providing us with a real advantage in times like this. And some of the deals that we've been able to get done during periods of dislocation have been because we have been able to use the balance sheet and our capital markets business to access financing, both equity and debt when others couldn't. So we've had several situations over time, including recently, where we're not necessarily the highest bidder, but we were the only bidder that could actually access the capital and have financing certainty. And so we, as in prior periods like this are viewing KCM and the balance sheet is providing us with a real strategic tool to be able to do that again. And so good question and we are focused on making sure that we've got liquidity on the balance sheet and the capital markets team is really well connected with our deal teams to make sure that we can do that well in a time like this. Thanks, Michael. It's Scott. I'll take those. It's a great question. And it is a bit early, honestly, to be able to give you a definitive answer on it. I think you're right. There's going to be a little -- there's going to be some puts and takes, right? There's going to be questions for some of the institutional investors around the denominator effect and what happens with the rest of their portfolio and their allocations to alternatives. But frankly, we've started to see the public markets rebound. And so I think what were initial questions about that, now there's a little bit of uncertainty as to whether the denominator effect will be a big consideration or not. I think we're just going to have to give that a bit of time to see how that settles out. The last time that happened, what we saw was not a big reduction in allocation to alternatives, but actually an increase in the allocation alternatives so that institutional investors could actually keep investing in the asset class. So we'll see what happens here, but it's pretty path dependent.  I think on the flip side of that, you're entirely right. I think even the conversation in the last handful of weeks with CIOs around the world, there is a real recognition that a low rate environment went to a virtually no rate environment, and they need to keep looking for ways to generate returns. And so the dialogue around alternatives continues, which is why those conversations, I think, pivot pretty quickly from defense to offense. And so we take that as encouraging. We think investors around the world are going to continue to look to the private markets for returns as they're expecting less and less out of their traditional fixed income and public equities portfolios. We think that's great for us.  And we're also finding just as an incremental piece of color, that during this period of time, there continues to be a lot of interest from the insurance space, which tends to be quite liquid and conservative in its approach, so we've been quite active in our dialogue with insurance companies over this period of time. And from the high net worth and retail markets, we're seeing them lean into this from an offense standpoint as well. So there's lots of tos and fros in all of that. But overall, we think it bodes well for our business. There's going to be an even greater need for return. And if you think about the power of the illiquidity premium that the alternative space provides, the lower the overall normal market return is, the greater that illiquidity premium is as a percentage of the total return. And so there's even more interest in what we do, we think, coming out of this.  In terms of your question on the secondary market, it's a space that we continue to spend time on and have looked at from time to time, I think there will be opportunities for the secondary space to continue to grow and that's one of the areas that we look to periodically as we think about other opportunities for us strategically, but nothing to report today on that front."

            "name": "Robert Lewin",
            "content": "Thanks a lot, Craig, and hello, everyone. Really glad to be speaking with all of you today and hope that you and your families are safe and healthy. Beginning with the quarter's financial performance. We've reported solid results, especially when you consider how challenged the operating and monetization environment was from mid-February time. Looking at our distributable earnings P&L on Page 3 of the supplement and starting with our operating revenue. Total fees came in at $426 million for the quarter. Of those fees, approximately 75% are management fees, which are up 14% versus last year. Our management fees are largely driven by commitments to our funds, and the invested cost of our assets as opposed to the NAVs of our funds, which is a real financial benefit that our industry affords during periods of market dislocation.  Our realized performance income came in at just over $370 million for the quarter, driven by the sale of PURE Group and in South Korea, the sale of KCF Technologies. In total, carry generating exits in Q1 on a blended basis, were done at 3.5x our investment costs. And finally, realized investment income for the quarter totaled $145 million. In aggregate, our revenues grew by 11% this quarter compared to a year ago.  Moving to expenses. Compensation and benefits totaled $377 million, while noncompensation expenses totaled $94 million. One thing to note here. Our total compensation ratio, including equity based comp, came in at 40% for the quarter. As you think about your go-forward models, you should continue to expect our total compensation ratio to remain variable and in the low 40% range for the remainder of 2020. And finally, our operating margin came in at 50% for the quarter, with an increase in our after-tax distributable earnings per share of 11%.  Looking forward, we actually have reasonably good line of sight on future carried interest and total realized investment income from transactions that have closed since 3/31 and or have been signed and are expected to close. As of today, that number is in excess of $400 million. While a small number of those transactions still rely on various regulatory approvals to close, so there is some uncertainty around achieving 100% of that figure, it is definitely helpful to go into the next couple of quarters with a solid base of additional revenue. As a point of reference, a year ago on this call, that same number was a little over $200 million.  So in a quarter with tremendous volatility, all 3 forms of our revenue increased. Our margins were maintained. Our distributable earnings per share increased by 11% and our visibility into our near-term earnings has meaningfully improved relative to a year ago. However, this quarter clearly did bring its share of adverse impacts to our financial profile as well. You can see that most clearly in our book value per share, where all of our investments are mark-to-market every quarter as that came in at $16.52 at March 31.  Specific to our balance sheet, investment performance for the quarter was down 14% compared to down 20% for the S&P 500. And for the trailing 12 months, balance sheet investment performance was down 2% compared to down 7% for the S&P 500. While our book value per share decreased 14% since the end of December, it is still relatively close to flat from this time last year.  Turning more specifically to our broad investment performance for the quarter. Please go to Page 4 of the supplemental presentation. While you can see that many of the asset classes where we invest have been affected by the market downturn this quarter, our performance remains positive over the last 12 months. Our most recent flagship private equity funds were down 6% in the quarter, and our entire PE portfolio is down 12% compared to down 21% for the MSCI World index. Outperformance was driven both by our modest exposure to areas directly impacted by the pandemic. As an example, direct energy is less than 2% of the private equity portfolio. Alongside greater exposure to a number of technology and online oriented investments that performed quite well.  Turning to real assets. Our flagship real estate funds depreciated 1% over the quarter, while our infrastructure flagship fund appreciated by 18% in the quarter, which was driven by a significant exit that was at a valuation well in excess of its carrying value. While our energy returns are not shown in the supplement this quarter because we have an AUM threshold for what appears on this page, we know it's a front of mind topic right now. Our direct energy funds in aggregate were down 33% in the quarter. But as a reminder, this is only 1% of our total AUM.  On the public market side, alternative credit and leveraged credit depreciated by 16% and 13%, respectively. This compares to the LSTA and the high-yield bond indices that were both down around 13% in the quarter.  We do believe that the combination of our continued strong relative investment performance, especially in our flagship funds, as well as a 44-year history of operating through market cycles will hold us in good stead with our clients. While undoubtedly some investing clients have slowed down their pace of new commitments, we are also finding that there are others looking for ways to invest into the dislocation. As an example, in the 2-month window from March 1 through May 1, we have closed on or in legal documentation on over $10 billion of new commitments across our fund platform. In terms of what this all means for our fundraising outlook, it's a little too early to say. We've grown our management fees over the last 3 years by approximately 50%. And we've shared in the last couple of quarters that given the funds we have coming to the market that we felt we could do that again from 2019 through 2022. We are still confident in our trajectory, but our best judgment sitting here today is that the 3 year path can now take us a few additional quarters to achieve. So the destination is very much the same. It may just take us a little longer to get there. This is obviously a dynamic environment, so we'll keep you updated to the extent our views change.  Two final points before I hand it off to Scott. The first relates to liquidity. During the first quarter, we opportunistically raised $500 million of 30-year senior notes priced at 3.625%. We knew at the time what was valuable capital to raise, but it certainly feels quite differentiated in this environment. And in April, we thought it made sense to take advantage of an opening in the investment-grade markets for an additional $250 million of 3.75% senior notes that mature in 2029. Taken together, we have $2.5 billion of cash and short-term investments in addition to our undrawn revolver capacity, providing significant liquidity and financial flexibility. The weighted average maturity of our debt portfolio today is over 15 years.  The second point relates to our share buyback activity. Since the last earnings call, we have retired 11 million shares at an average price of just over $23 per share. Looking at our buyback program since inception, in total review is over $1.3 billion to retire shares at a weighted average cost of just under $19 per share. We are confident that the shares we repurchased in Q1 will be a very good use of capital as we look forward over the next several years. As you would have seen in our press release, we have increased our share repurchase authorization back up to $500 million.  And with that, I would like to turn it over to Scott. Great. Thanks, Alex. So what we were trying to do with the $10 billion, we'll not guide it quarter-to-quarter in terms of where our fundraising is, but instead to give a good sense to the investor community that we're still raising capital despite the volatility in the markets. And the best example we could give is the $10 billion of closed commitments or commitments that we have in legal documentation that we expect to close, as opposed to trying to parse it, whether that's going to be Q1 or Q2 or Q3 fee paying AUM or AUM. Bill, it's Rob. I'll handle both questions. On our CLOs, I'll just put it into context, we do about $17 million a quarter of management fees across our CLO complex. A little more than $10 million of the $17 million are subordinated management fees are more at risk. Across that $17 million, we see de minimis impact in Q2, where compliance today or at the end of 3/31 with all of our OC tests. Based on what we see today, with downgrades coming through our portfolio as well as where we are in the market, we could see some impact in Q3 and Q4. Right now, we don't think that, that's a material impact. But as that -- as things change over the course of the quarter, we'll make sure to update everybody on our Q2 call.  And then on the second part of that question, Bill was around clawbacks. Today, we've got roughly $90 million of clawback exposure through KKR. And that's a few small clawbacks in a number of different funds globally. It's not something that's an irregular part of our business. And what we shoot for is to have our accrued carry, certainly be north of any clawback liabilities in a material way, and that's really how we present our numbers. So the $1.26 billion of accrued carry that we have on our balance sheet is net of the $90 million of claw backed liabilities that we have spread across the firm in a bunch of different and smaller ways. But again, that's pretty normal course for us to have some form of clawback liability in our business. And as of now, it's relatively contained. Great. Thanks, Craig. It's Rob. And maybe the best way to do this is to take our FRE in component parts. The first and most important are our management fees, as you know, which are roughly 75% of our total fees this quarter. Even with the potential impact of the CLO subordinate fees, it's a fairly minor part of our overall business. And as you said, our NAV based funds is also pretty minor. And so as we look at our management fee component, we think it's both stable and has significant growth in front of it. The best example of that is being up 14% year-over-year this quarter.  On top of that, we've also guided that we expect to grow our management fees by greater than 50% over the next 3 and change years. The other 25% of our fees today are made up of a combination of transaction and monitoring fees that I think, over time, are probably biased to go up based on the overall size of KKR and how it grows as well as our capital markets business, which we think is a long-term growth engine for us. And a normalized environment really should be able to take some additional share with the business model we set up and the people that we have.  And maybe the last component is the margin piece of it. What we've indicated in the past is that if we're able to achieve the management fee growth trajectory that we think we can do over the next few years, that we would expect to see some margin expansion flow through our business. And so while we haven't guided to a specific FRE number, we do think that when you break out all of the component parts that would suggest 2 things: one, a meaningful amount of stability; and two, some real upside from here. Sure. Thanks, Patrick. It's Rob, and I'll take that question. So we're not going to disclose how we break companies out into different buckets. But what we could tell you and it's what Scott mentioned on the call, and I'll expand on a little bit more, is we feel really good about our relative portfolio of construction, and it's going to be a combination of our limited exposure in energy, retail, travel, hospitality and leisure through our portfolio. On the upside, I think we've become overweight over the last number of years in online and e-commerce businesses, which have held up quite well over the last couple of months. And then the last point around portfolio construction for us is we obviously have a fair bit of weighting towards Asia as a firm. North of 30% of our private equity portfolio today is exposed to Asia or directly exposed to the Asian market, which has held up on a relative basis, better than the U.S. and Europe. And so overall, we feel good about our portfolio. Scott mentioned on the call, we certainly have our companies that are going to need some additional support through this period of time. But we think the overall construction of our portfolio and the health of our companies is part of the reason why you would have seen our investment performance hold up pretty good in our private equity businesses over the last quarter, and especially, if you look over the last 12 months. Glenn, one additional point, I'll just -- it's worth mentioning when we're talking about our Asia franchise, that's relevant. We've talked a lot about Japan carve-outs over the last number of quarters and how that's been a real strategy for us there. We actually had our first exit of 1 of our carve-outs that we announced in March, the sale of alpha beta, and that closed in April, around 3x multiple of money for us, and you'll see that flow through our Q2 financials. But that was a nice win for that strategy for us in Japan. Sure. I'll cover both of those. Listen, there's a lot about the environment that's difficult to predict right now and carry -- realized carried interest, that would certainly be at the top of that list, I think, for all of us. But as you said, there's some encouraging statistics we have that 60% of our total carry eligible AUM. Today would be in carry paying mode on a liquidation value basis. And our accrued carry still stands at north of $1 billion. I think the most critical thing and what we try and do every quarter is to give you visibility in terms of what we actually do know on our carried interest and our realized balance sheet earnings, which is the $400 million plus million number that I mentioned in the prepared remarks.  As it relates to our interest and dividends, those have been elevated over much of the last three quarters for largely the same reason. We have a margin loan against our Pfizer shares and we've used that margin loan -- fairly low LTV margin loan to take a dividend in Q3, Q4 and Q1. And so that represented about 2/3 of our interest and dividends this quarter. And I think the other 1/3 of that is relatively stable, albeit with interest rates now near 0, we'll probably take a little bit of a hit on our cash balance on our interest line item. But the overall line should be reasonably stable going forward. So, it's Rob, and I'll take that question. Q1 was an interesting quarter for us, $60 million of revenue, sort of in line with the $50 million to $70 million of baseline revenue that we had suggested in our last call. About half of our business in Q1 was from third-party business. It's pretty meaningful, especially in a quarter where KKR didn't have a lot of deployment across our organization. Listen, we continue to feel that in capital markets environments that are stable, that we should be able in ordinary course to generate $50 million to $70 million a quarter and then have the upside potential from some large transactions that have been a regular occurrence as part of that business, which is exactly why we've averaged in that business over the last few years.  As it relates to the near term, I'm not sure we're yet in normalized capital market type environment. And so for Q2, we might be on the lower end of that $50 million to $70 million range, it's certainly too early to say, and there's a lot of the quarter left to go. But we do think that business in market opportunities when capital is scarce is where that business can really shine around some of the larger transactions that continue to come through our pipeline."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to KKR's Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I'll now hand the call over to Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Please go ahead.\nCraig Larson: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. As usual, I'm joined this morning by Rob Lewin, our CFO; and Scott Nuttall, our Co-Chief Executive Officer.  We'd like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, which is available on the Investor Center section at kkr.com. And as a reminder, we report our segment numbers on an adjusted-share basis.  Our call will contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to our earnings release and SEC filings for cautionary factors about these statements.  Now before we jump into our results for the quarter, we'd like to take a step back and talk about KKR in full.  As we look at our business, we see 4 things. First, we see scaling. Organically, over the last 12 months, AUM at KKR increased 48%. For an asset management business of our size, that alone is a pretty remarkable statistic. And including the Global Atlantic acquisition, AUM increased 87% year-over-year.  Second, you're seeing the impact of the scaling across many of the numbers that we're reporting today. You see it in our financials. Management fees for the year increased 44%. Fee-related earnings increased 54%, while distributable earnings more than doubled. All of these figures are at a record level for us.  And you also see it in our operating statistics Investment activity, for example, is at a new level. In 2020, we invested $30 billion across the firm. In 2021, that increased to over $70 billion. And new capital raised of $121 billion for the year reflects breadth and diversification. Approximately 1/3 of that capital was raised from the broad private equity franchise, so including our growth strategies and core PE. Another 1/3 came from our real assets businesses with the remaining 1/3 coming from public markets. So fundraising was truly diversified across the firm. And the other neat point about that $121 billion is that 45% of it came from strategies that didn't exist at KKR 5 years ago. We think that says a lot about our culture and our focus on innovation.  Third, looking forward, we remain very constructive on the opportunities we have ahead of us with multiple identifiable growth avenues on a global basis. Rob is going to touch on our fundraising pipeline and our areas of focus in a few minutes. And finally, remember, we feel advantaged during periods of dislocation. There are very few long-dated pools of capital as large as ours that can take advantage of dislocations, and we have a unique business model and a unique culture that we think can lead to differentiated outcomes during these periods, and that's all alongside of $112 billion of dry powder. Suffice to say, there's plenty to focus on and a lot of compelling opportunities in the uncertain world in which we all find ourselves.  Now turning to our results. The fourth quarter was another very strong quarter for us. Fee-related earnings per share of $0.69 and after-tax distributable earnings of $1.59 per share are record quarterly figures for us. And full year FRE of $2.23 per share, an after-tax DE of $4.44 per share are record annual figures for us.  Looking at the quarter's operating metrics. New capital raised totaled $19 billion driven by several strategies across private equity, infrastructure, real estate and credit. Notably, Healthcare Strategic Growth II held its final close, bringing the fund to almost $4 billion or approximately 3x larger than its predecessor. This brings new capital raise for 2021 to $121 billion, and this record fundraising and the addition of $98 billion from the Global Atlantic acquisition in February significantly increased our asset base. AUM now totals $471 billion, up 87% year-over-year.  The strength of this year's fundraising is importantly quite diverse, as I mentioned a minute ago, with about $70 billion from non-flagship strategies. Our younger strategies are scaling as they enter their second or third fund life, and we continue to innovate and expand into adjacencies across strategies and across geographies. And GA grew by $25 billion through block activity, alongside of organic inflows in the year.  We deployed $23 billion in the quarter. Capital invested in both traditional private equity and core private equity were strong. Our real estate platform continues to see robust deployment with real estate credit particularly operating a high run rate, and that's been amplified by Global Atlantic. Similarly, on the public market side, GA has added to the rate of private credit deployment in the quarter, most meaningfully in asset-based finance, with additional deployment in direct lending and opportunistic strategies.  Q4's activity brings capital invested for 2021 to $73 billion, up 2.5x year-over-year. We've seen a step function type change in the level of deployment driven by the size and diversity of our capital base while at the same time remaining judicious in choosing our spots.  Now just as we continue to see strength on the fundraising and deployment front, our funds and strategies continue to perform at a very high level. You can see this on Page 7 of the earnings release, where we detail investment performance for the quarter and the year across investment strategies.  And finally, I want to touch on capital return before Rob walks through our earnings profile. As you can see at the bottom of Page 2 of the release, consistent with historical practice, we're pleased to announce an increase in our annual dividend from $0.58 to $0.62 per share. This is the third consecutive year we've increased our dividend since we changed our corporate structure, and the change will go into effect beginning with any dividends to be announced for the first quarter of 2022.  And since our third quarter earnings call in November through last week, we repurchased $363 million of our stock in the open market with the majority of that coming in 2022 in the midst of all of this volatility.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob.\nRobert Lewin: Thanks a lot, Craig. Now to walk you through our quarterly P&L, our management fees increased by 49% this quarter versus Q4 of 2020. Management fee growth was driven by close across a number of active funds in the quarter. These closes, alongside our investment activity, bring fee-paying AUM to $357 billion million. The fundraising success experienced over the past few quarters is really starting to flow through this line with another $38 billion of committed capital not yet paying fees.  Our net transaction and monitoring fees were primarily driven by our capital markets franchise this quarter, which earned $320 million. This is a high point for us. This revenue figure also encompasses a record number of transactions in a single quarter, and we only had one fee event that was greater than $20 million.  For the year, Capital Markets totaled $847 million with revenues diversified by type, approximately 1/4 of our revenues related to each of private equity, infrastructure as well as third-party clients with the remaining quarter diversified across multiple different asset classes.  Moving to our expenses. Fee-related compensation came in right at that 22.5% mark, the midpoint of the range we've discussed previously, while our other operating expenses came in at $140 million. The increase here was driven by higher placement fees as well as professional fees given high activity levels across the firm. We are also all back in the office across most of our locations, leading to an uptick in operating costs versus this time last year. In total, this brings our fee-related earnings to $606 million for the quarter, which is up 45% versus Q4 of 2020. The quarterly and yearly FRE margin both came in at 63%. And on a per-share basis, FRE is $2.23 for the year.  Now moving on to realizations. Realized carried interest totaled $568 million in the quarter. Our realized incentive fees totaled $351 million in the quarter, largely due to Marshall Wace's strong investment performance. And realized investment income totaled $336 million. Together, these earnings streams resulted in $1.4 billion of asset management operating earnings. Our insurance segment also experienced an incredibly strong quarter with $347 million of operating earnings.  In Q4, Global Atlantic sold its interest in Origis Energy, a solar renewable energy developer, at 12x cost, resulting in a $200-plus million benefit to segment operating earnings. This was really an amazing result for Global Atlantic and all of its shareholders while still recognizing that 12x gains are not representative of our go-forward expectations here.  Excluding all variable investment income for the year at GA, ROE would have still been a bit above 14%. This return represents a strong core operating level and modestly above our 12% to 13% expected range.  Most importantly, a year into our partnership with GA, we couldn't feel any better about our collective progress, including the performance of management, the profitability of our stake, scaling of the AUM and the integration of our teams.  In total, our after-tax distributable earnings were $1.4 billion for the quarter or $1.59 per share. Comparing 2021 to 2020, DE per share is up over 2x. Alongside an increase in earnings, we are also seeing continued compounding in our book value per share, which now totals $28.77. As a component of this, our 61% economic interest in Global Atlantic's book value now totals $3.4 billion, up 15% since the first quarter of our ownership.  In summary, our business continues to perform at an exceptionally high level, and this is clearly evident in both our Q4 as well as our 2021 results.  Now there are 2 additional topics I would like to go through in a bit more detail. The first is our potential. In 2021, we generated almost $5 billion of distributable operating income, really a step function increase from the $2.3 billion that we generated in 2020. And to be clear, we don't believe these results yet reflect even our run rate profitability, let alone our potential.  There are a number of reasons why we have room to run. Let's start with management fees. At 12/31, we had $38 billion of committed capital that isn't yet running through our management fee line. A year ago, that number was $20 billion. And as that $38 billion, which has a weighted average management fee north of 100 basis points, is either invested or enters its investment period, it will drive management fees in a meaningful way. And I will come to our future fundraising potential from here in just a minute.  Next are our embedded gains. Gross unrealized carry at year-end totaled $8.6 billion compared to $4.7 billion a year ago. So even after a record realization year, gross unrealized carry increased over 80%, positioning us really well for future realized performance income. And embedded balance sheet gains at 12/31 were $6.7 billion, up from $4.4 billion a year ago. So similarly, while we saw a meaningful step-up in balance sheet realizations in 2021, our embedded gains increased over 50%.  And finally, as the overall footprint of the firm continues to grow, leading to increased deployment and more relationships, this, in turn, continues to expand the opportunities we expect to have in our Capital Markets business, so really strong performance in 2021 over the really meaningful potential still yet in front of us.  That leads into the second topic I'd like to touch on: fundraising and our pipeline. As we look forward, we expect to be fundraising across 30-plus strategies in 2022, so we have a lot of runway and opportunity in front of us.  In terms of areas of focus, I'd highlight 4. The first area is private wealth. We now manage a little over $50 billion in private wealth assets, and we've been investing meaningfully into this channel. Historically, private wealth has contributed about 10% to 20% of the money that we raise annually. With the investments we're making in people, technology and new product innovation, alongside the strength of our brand and our track record, we believe over time that it should be 30% to 50% of the money that we raise.  The second area would be Asia. More than half of global GDP growth is expected to come from Asia. And as a reminder, 8 of our 21 offices are in the region. We were early in Asia, and we've seen significant scaling as AUM across our Asia-dedicated strategies has gone from $20 billion to $42 billion over the last 2 years with private equity being the biggest driver of that growth. In 2022, we expect to be fundraising for 5 Asia-focused strategies outside of PE across our infrastructure, real estate, credit and growth businesses. We have a leading footprint in Asia today, and building on our presence is a priority and a big opportunity for us.  The third area would be our broader core franchises. These are all adjacent strategies to what we're doing in private equity, real estate, as well as infrastructure. So think longer-term capital, a lot of which can be raised on a continuous basis for strategies that are leveraging resources and deal flow that are already resident within the firm today. A year ago, we were at $17 billion of AUM across core. And today, that figure is north of $40 billion. In 2022, we look to continue the momentum and expect to be fundraising across 5 distinct strategies in private equity, real estate and infrastructure.  And the fourth area is what we're doing across our real estate franchise. A year ago, AUM across real estate was $15 billion. Today, that figure is $41 billion. In 2022, we expect to fundraise across 10 distinct real estate strategies, including the next generation of our opportunistic real estate strategies across all 3 geographies.  And with that, let me turn it over to Scott.\nScott Nuttall: Thank you, Rob, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. As Craig and Rob reviewed, 2021 was a very strong year with record AUM, FRE and earnings. The hard work of the last 10 to 15 years of business-building began to show up in bigger ways last year, and we're ahead of where we thought we would be at this point. And with a record $112 billion of dry powder, we are well capitalized to invest in opportunities presented by more volatile markets and an evolving macro picture. In summary, we feel incredibly well positioned.  While we're together today, I also want to give you a little color on our annual planning meetings. Last week, we gathered 35 of our partners for 2 full days to review where we are, where we're going and what we need to get right to capture the opportunity in front of us. It was an extremely energizing discussion.  As we discussed at our Investor Day last April, we had significant runway in all of our businesses and see the opportunity to meaningfully scale across multiple platforms and markets simultaneously, including Asia, real estate, infrastructure, our core suite of products, private wealth, growth, impact in ESG, insurance, credit and private equity, amongst others. What we discussed last week is that our progress makes us even more confident in the opportunity ahead and what these businesses can become. Said another way, we believe we can get to the destination faster than we thought a year ago, and the quantum of the growth opportunity is greater than we anticipated.  So while 2021 was a great year for the firm, what's particularly exciting is how the progress we made last year positions us for more growth in the years ahead. And critically, Joe and I have never had more confidence in our team. We have a focused and highly motivated group driving our businesses and functions and responsible for each of our growth initiatives. So we enter 2022 with significant conviction in our growth prospects, our model and our people and look forward to keeping you updated throughout the year.  And with that, we're happy to take your questions. Question-and-Answer Session\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.\nAlexander Blostein: Why don't we start with just the dynamics around fundraising and management fee growth? And I really kind of want to zone in on a couple of things. I guess, first, whether or not the current macro conditions are having any impact on LP appetite to allocate to private markets, broadly, even if just tactically, but curious what to hear what you guys are hearing on the ground. And then, secondly, Rob, you mentioned a number of fundraising initiatives for 2022. I was hoping you could size how much you expect to raise across those 30-plus strategies and ultimately what that means for 2022 management fee growth.\nCraig Larson: Alex, it's Craig. Why don't I begin? To the first part of your question, really, no change in terms of the interest level that our LPs are having from a fundraising side, and it continues to feel like we have a lot of momentum which is great, why don't I give a little bit more granularity in terms of all of those -- the areas where we're fundraising to give you a sense of the breadth of that activity for us? Rob obviously ran through the 4 areas of focus for us in 2022.  More narrowly, in private equity, we're still fundraising for Americas Private Equity. We're fundraising for our Europe private equity strategy. In growth, fundraising is launched for both the impact and next-gen tech strategies. In core, we're fundraising across the core businesses, so that's core private equity as well as core infra and core plus real estate strategies. Now the latter 2 are open ended. And in addition to core plus, in the U.S. that we've spoken about, we've also launched fundraising for core plus real estate in Europe and Asia. Both of those are also open ended, as well as in infra, where fundraising continues for the benchmark infra strategy. In real estate, in addition to the core plus strategies in all 3 geographies, we're fundraising for a stabilized real estate credit strategy and our opportunistic real estate credit strategy as well. In credit, we're active in U.S., Europe and Asia. We're fundraising for lending partners, European revolving credit, Asia credit, asset-based finance, credit opportunities and that's in addition to Global Atlantic sidecar strategy. Our CLO business has been active. And as we look to raise capital across the leveraged credit platforms and our hedge fund partnerships on a more continuous basis, and that's all in addition to the suite of democratized products that we have.  So again, really, it's -- I think the overall takeaway, lots of activity, and it just continues to feel like we have a lot of momentum.\nScott Nuttall: Yes. The only thing I would add, Alex, agree with Craig, no change in LP appetite. The only incremental color I'd give is, if anything, we're seeing more interest in real assets with yield. So anything with some inflation protection, so think infrastructure and real estate. As we see inflation expectations go up, we're finding even more interest in those asset classes. Rob, do you want to pick up on the second part?\nRobert Lewin: Yes, Alex. As it relates to the management fee piece of it, Alex, we've never felt as good as we do right now about our ability to sustainably grow management fees over time. Obviously, I referenced the $38 billion of capital that hasn't yet flown through our management fee line item, the 30-plus products Craig just went through, our relationship with Global Atlantic where assets are much higher than where we thought it would be and, frankly, just the new product innovation that's happening across the firm today that gives us visibility around our ability to grow management fees tomorrow. So I think the expectation should certainly be continued management fee growth from us and being able to do so on a sustainable basis over time.\nAlexander Blostein: Great. And then just my follow-up is around capital management. So you guys obviously picked up the pace of buyback so far in the first quarter. Given your comments around the robustness of the business going forward, obviously, lots of capacity on the balance sheet given realizations and embedded gains. How are you thinking about the buyback at this level for the share price? And should we be thinking about acceleration in share repurchases from here?\nRobert Lewin: Yes. Alex, the key for us on capital allocation is to have a consistent approach, and you've heard that for us over the last number of years, and we'd anticipate that continuing. And so as we think about our overall capital allocation strategy, we want to make sure that we're striking the right balance between capital return to shareholders and investing back into KKR for growth, so long as that can be done at high ROEs and above our cost of equity.  So let's take those in order. You would have seen, obviously, that we just increased our dividend 7%, third consecutive year since we became a C-corp where we've increased our dividend.  And then we want to continue to invest back into KKR stock, as you said. Certainly at these levels, we feel really good about our overall body of work on our share buyback. We've repurchased or retired north of 80 million shares now. That's almost 10% of KKR shares outstanding, almost 15% of our free float. And our goal is to keep our share count flat as it relates to employee dilution. So I think the expectation over time would certainly see us be in the market and acquiring and retiring KKR stock.  In terms of balancing that with overall opportunity to grow KKR, it is a big priority for us to reinvest back into KKR, whether that's in M&A or supporting new products or supporting new innovations so long as we're seeing returns that are commensurate with that capital commitment. And over the last number of years, we certainly have.  So we're going to continue to have a capital allocation framework that is very much ROE-based. We feel that's a real core competency of ours as we think about moving capital around to the highest ROE opportunity. And if you think about our overall capital allocation framework, I think it's also worth remembering that KKR is an employee base is the single-largest shareholder in KKR. So we come at that from a very aligned basis.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW.\nRobert Lee: Great. Maybe, first, looking at wealth management. Generating 30% to 50% of your fundraising from that channel in several years is a pretty big step-up, particularly in light of your overall fundraising. So could you maybe put a little bit more meat on the bone? Like I know you had just hired a new Head of Global Wealth Management. But whether specific products or specific things that kind of give you that confidence sitting here today that in the next couple of years, you can have that magnitude of an increase coming from that channel. I mean, what would drive that?\nCraig Larson: Yes. Rob, it's Craig. Why don't I begin? So private wealth is as big a priority as we have as a firm. And the addressable market here, as everyone knows, is massive. Total client assets are estimated to be around $280 trillion. That's pension funds, sovereign wealth, insurance, private wealth combined. And private wealth is almost 65% of that and is growing, so it's a massive end market. But at the same time, allocations, as we all know, for individual investors is a fraction of what you find at institutions. And so individual investors are less than 5%. And by our research, we actually think that number is in around 2% to 3%. . We have this enormous end market. It's underpenetrated with allocations that are increasing. And so it's a huge opportunity. And I think as we think of our investment skills, our track record, combined with our brand, we really think we're exceptionally well positioned to be a winner here.  And the focus, I'd say, is really threefold. So one, we're focused on our partnerships with private wealth platforms. So in the U.S., that's the wirehouses, the independent broker-dealers, the RIAs. And outside the U.S., it's the global private banks and the regional private banks. And so the business is organized by geography here. And you're correct. You've seen some hiring related to that.  Second, we're related -- we're focused on the family capital part, so think about that single-family offices, multifamily, ultra-high net worth. And some of those folks are very large and very sophisticated. And again, we're organized by geography here.  And then third, we're focused on product creation. So historically, we've offered private fund solutions through the private wealth space. But really, there are only a limited number of private wealth investors that are qualified who could look at private funds as appropriate. So we're focusing on creating these new investment solutions, these more democratized products, democratized solutions that are in a registered fund format and have much wider applicability within the private wealth channel. So I think suffice to say, when you combine with where we are in the development of the channel, the maturing of our product set, including, and Scott mentioned this a moment ago, all the products that we have with the yields, real assets, et cetera, and put that together with our brands, which is really encouraged with how we're situated and all of the opportunities that we have ahead of us.\nRobert Lee: Okay. Great. And maybe as a follow-up, I mean, lease equity mark has been a pretty rocky start to the year, so I guess investors are generally concerned about kind of the realization outlook from here. Could you maybe update us on where things are for you guys right now through the start of the year, the first half of the quarter in Q1?\nRobert Lewin: Yes. Rob, some good news here. As it relates to Q1, we already have a good amount of visibility into some pretty meaningful revenue from monetization activity. As of now, that figure is around $700 million, maybe a bit above that. As you know, that's collectively across both our performance as well as our investment income. And as a reminder, that is from deals that are already closed or have been signed up and that we expect to close in Q1. So we're off to a really good start there. This is one of the strongest figures we've ever had at this stage of the quarter. And then the other I know relevant thing for your models is the split. It's weighted around 75-25 carry investment income right now. So yes, we feel like a pretty good start to the year and gives us some support going into Q1 in 2022.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citi.\nWilliam Katz: Okay. So maybe come back to interest rates for a moment. I was wondering if you could let us know what is your rate assumption that you have that sort of supports your sort of 12% to 13% ROE for Global Atlantic? And then if rates were to go up, can you walk us through what the net impact would be between maybe a higher ROE there versus any impact on management fees?\nRobert Lewin: Bill, it's Rob. Thanks for the question. Maybe let's start with where we think interest rates are going, and so we do see rates certainly increasing like the rest of the market. I think we're likely to get 4 more fed funds increases this year. But at the same time, we do see that coming on the back of robust financial conditions. So our expectation is that we can be in an environment here where rates are still low or negative over the next couple of years, which I think is an overall positive place for us to be from a business model perspective.  Now of course, there are uncertainties around weights are going, but I think there's a number of areas where we're, I think, pretty well competitively positioned. As you referenced, Global Atlantic, they are largely biased to benefit from interest rates rising over time. So $120 billion of capital there as well as how we think about their individual channel and our ability to be able to generate sales from that channel we think are all positively biased in a rising rate environment.  And so I think there's a number of other areas around KKR as well where we think we're competitively well positioned. You look at our credit business, over $200 billion or close to $200 billion of AUM. Much of our third-party business there is floating rate exposure in nature. So as interest rates rise, all things equal, our returns go up. And the hurdle rates across many of those products tend to be fixed in nature, so the likelihood of earning additional incentive fees is that much higher. So hopefully, that helps answer your question.\nWilliam Katz: Okay. And just a follow-up, just coming back to maybe your prior guidance. I certainly appreciate the tone and tenor of what you're saying about the confidence. But can you sort of still triangulate back to sort of your guidance for this year in terms of $2 plus of FRE and sort of how you think about that, not only for this year, but maybe into 2023, just given the compounding nature of growth? And then maybe just sort of level set where you are in terms of the capital raising flagship of the $100 billion plus well into that as well.\nRobert Lewin: Yes. No updates to the numbers. Bill, obviously, we're well ahead of where we thought we would be even 6 or 12 months ago.  And as it relates to both fundraising as well as management fee growth, this isn't just a result of acceleration of fundraisers. In many cases, we have well exceeded the expectations that we have for ourselves, and so we continue to see a robust environment to be able to raise capital. And as I mentioned earlier, we continue to see an environment where we should be able to really drive substantial management fee growth as well as FRE growth off of a base of $2.23. So we should be well ahead of our target for 2022 that we laid out. I think it was about 12 months ago.\nScott Nuttall: Yes. The only thing I'd add, Bill, last quarter, we said we thought we could double fee-related earnings in TDE over the next 5 years. That's still very much the case. So no updated guidance for '22, but suffice it to say, we well exceeded what we told you a year ago.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.\nGlenn Schorr: So there's -- it's been a slower start to the year for just Capital Markets activity. It's early. But if you look at all the pipelines for M&A and IPOs, they're down. I think that's just a market jitters thing. But anyway, with the slower pipeline, just curious how insulated you think -- you just gave us the number on dollars for realization pipeline. But just broader picture, as you look at the year, how susceptible could a realization pipeline or Capital Markets pipeline may or may not be to that? In the past, you've given some -- what you think the core run rate of transactional monitoring fees or Capital Markets, that would be helpful.\nRobert Lewin: It's Rob. So let's -- I think it's worth spending a little bit of time on our Capital Markets business. It did have a really step-function increase in 2021. If you take a step back, our Capital Markets business over the last several quarters has averaged about $200 million of revenue per quarter. Now markets have definitely been open and compliant, but I think we've also continued to really take share here.  So I think that's -- as you think about our business in a market environment where capital is being deployed, it can be still a relatively volatile market environment. But in one where there's activity, we think that's a reasonable run rate for our business.  But much more important for us is how we take our business from the $850 million of revenue in 2021 and over the next several years continue to take a lot of share and grow that in a meaningful way. And we think we've got plans in place to be able to do that. We've gone through this a bunch of times. It includes following KKR in terms of its own product expansion, following KKR in terms of its own geographic expansion. We think by hiring the right capabilities internally, that could lead to a lot of revenue growth. And I think it's worth calling out our non-KKR issuer business, our third-party business, it generated almost $200 million of revenue in 2021. And I think that really speaks to our business model and the quality of our people, that we were able to take that business and scale to the point that is not too different from a revenue perspective from where our Capital Markets business was in aggregate not too long ago.\nCraig Larson: Glenn, it's Craig. We were looking at some of these statistics and are kind of interesting, just to give you another sense of the breadth in Capital Markets fees. When you look at deployment for us as a firm, deployments increased materially, obviously. We were $30 billion in 2020, $70 billion in 2021. And if you look at where that came from and the impact of that, it had a big impact on Capital Markets revenues. So that increase in deployment for us, it really didn't come from private equity. So we invested $10 billion in 2020. We invested $10.2 billion in 2021. And so KCM feds from Capital Markets went from $230 million to $250 million in the year. I think they were up modestly.  But what you really saw, the big driver, when you add up deployment for us in infrastructure, core private equity growth and real estate equity, so these are the areas that are going to generate on deployment can generate sizable capital markets fees, that deployment for us went 2.3x, went up 2.3x in 2021. And Capital Markets fees cumulatively, similarly, went up 2.3x, went from $150 million to about $350 million.  So it is a -- the dynamic that you have is one where deployment is becoming a lot more broad-based. And again, KCM is not solely going to be based on how we're deploying capital, but it's certainly going to be one of those factors. So I think, really, in that number, as Rob said, you're seeing a real development in the footprint, in the framework of the firm, which is exciting from a management fee standpoint. And it's also exciting from a Capital Markets standpoint.\nRobert Lewin: Glenn, one other. I know you had referenced the impact of the Capital Markets environment have on monetizations. I think the big advantage here as we come into 2022 with over $15 billion of embedded revenue that sits in our balance sheet between gross unrealized carry and the embedded gains of our investment portfolio. And I think Q1, and we were off to a good start from the monetization perspective, a good example of that. We don't need straight-line markets up to be able to monetize that $15 billion of embedded revenue, but what we will need is we will need a market environment that does have some stability over periods of time and is flexible in nature. And I think there's going to be areas where we're going to be able to continue to pick our spots in this kind of a market environment and generate monetizations for our shareholders.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gerry O'Hara with Jefferies.\nGerald O'Hara: Great. Hoping we could get an update just on the strategic investments within your kind of perpetual capital sleeves. Clearly, a nice uptick year-over-year, but perhaps you can talk about some of the drivers of that increase and what we might be able to expect on a go-forward basis.\nCraig Larson: I think -- Gerry, it's Craig, very broad-based again. I think when you look at a lot of the core is an example area for us in -- from a perpetual standpoint where we're raising capital. Infrastructure, real estate, as I mentioned, 2 aspects of both Europe and Asia real estate perpetual or capital is going to be perpetual in nature. Global dynamic by itself continues to grow and scale, in addition to that, which is great.  And I think we've, over time, also mentioned these longer-dated strategic-type partnerships. That activity continues. It's multi-asset class. It's again capital where you can have recycling, which can be very valuable from an economic standpoint. You're not going to see that activity from us every quarter. But again, those dialogues continue, and we'll keep you up to date and abreast on that.\nRobert Lewin: Gerry, one other thing, if you look at Page 5 on our press release, you can see our perpetual capital. It was up year-on-year over 7x. Now a lot of that is Global Atlantic. But what we don't want to get lost in that slide is that, ex Global Atlantic, our perpetual capital year-on-year was still up 4x versus this time last year. And so there's a lot of momentum across that part of our business.\nGerald O'Hara: Great. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, I appreciate the thoughts around the private wealth channel. But as it relates to the sort of investment, I think last quarter you talked about sort of looking to triple headcount, if my notes are right, and continuing to sort of invest in operations and technology. Can you just perhaps give us an update on how things have progressed there and how we're tracking relative to perhaps where you were last quarter.\nCraig Larson: Gerry, it's Craig. So we don't really want to get into the habit, honestly, of giving individual headcount updates on the part of the business and where we are from that. But again, suffice to say, this part is a real strategic priority for us, as we've spoken about. And there's lots of underlying activity and growth. We feel really well positioned and we're very active as it relates to hiring talent on a global basis. I hope that, that gives you a clear sense of the importance for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America.\nCraig Siegenthaler: So my question is on Global Atlantic. I just want to get an update on your progress to reinvest Global Atlantic's portfolio into KKR-originated product. And also how this could or will impact your blended fee rate as GA reaches your longer-term objective?\nRobert Lewin: Craig, it's Rob. That's going to be a multiyear process, and we're going to do it in a very prudent way and make sure that we're rotating GA's balance sheet from quality investments that they had today into opportunities for KKR to be able to invest that capital with a similar or better risk level and at an increased yield. And so that process is taking place. And I would say 11 months in, we're probably in a better place than we thought we'd be at the beginning of the deal. But there's no doubt, as we complete that rotation or we make progress on that rotation, that's going to increase the blended management fee rate in our overall relationship with Global Atlantic. I think that blended management fee rate today is in the mid-teens, and so it definitely has the ability to go up over time based on the rotation that you referenced.\nScott Nuttall: The only thing I'd add, Craig, is that it's going to be a constantly evolving answer to your question because if you think, especially as Global Atlantic pursues block activity, we're bringing on more assets, and then those blocks need to be rotated themselves. So I'm not sure we'll ever reach stasis, frankly. But to Rob's point, we're a bit ahead of where we thought we'd be, and we'll keep you updated. But the block activity has obviously been significant since we signed the deal.\nCraig Siegenthaler: And just one other question on that one. What assets or KKR-originated assets are being allocated into Global Atlantic today?\nRobert Lewin: Yes. It's a lot across our real estate credit franchise, our private credit franchise, structured finance, asset-based finance. Those are really the big areas of opportunity that we're working together with the GA team.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.\nBrian Mckenna: This is Brian McKenna for Devin. So there's clearly a lot of momentum across the entire platform, and I appreciate all the color on the outlook. But what do you think will be the biggest driver of growth over the next 5 years? And then what products will be the biggest contributor to achieving your FRE and DE targets of $4 plus and $7 plus?\nRobert Lewin: Yes. Brian, it's Rob. I'll take the first shot at it. The reality is we've got a lot of confidence across many parts of our business. I'll call out a few, and we talked about them on our prepared remarks.  Asia is a really massive long-term opportunity for us, and we've talked about in the past that we think we could take our Asia business and make it one day as big as our North America business. That's for a couple of reasons. One, we think more than global -- excuse me, half of global growth is going to come out of that region over the next several years. Two, we have a huge head start and competitive advantage versus our competitors. And really, the key for us is to take our leading position there with our leading position across infrastructure, real estate, credit growth equity on a global base in the marriage of those 2 things. And we think that could lead to a lot of growth for us in that part of the world. We've got 5 products, ex private equity, that will be fundraising for capital in Asia in 2022. So that's really a big theme for us. What we're doing across real assets and real estate and infrastructure we think is really exciting. We've talked about our build out of private wealth. So there's a number of different avenues and ways that we have to be able to achieve P&L growth over the next several years.\nScott Nuttall: Yes. Brian, it's Scott. Thanks for asking the question, it's kind of fun to answer, honestly. Because we talked about last April, we just got a lot on. We went from 6 to something like 28 investing strategies over the last decade plus, so it's kind of -- the answer to your question, it's hard to be succinct, frankly. We got to scale everything we started, which is a long list of asset classes, real estate, infrastructure, growth, insurance, core. The list goes on and on. We have an opportunity to meaningfully expand our client base. We talked about private wealth a lot today, but there's a lot happening also in the institutional channels. We're creating new growth vectors, so not just the existing 28, but you're going to see more things from us in terms of other ways that we can grow. I think smart M&A is going to continue to play a real role here, not only expanding through Global Atlantic, but we're also looking at other acquisitions, and then having the balance sheet and the currency gives us real tools to accelerate our growth.  So we've got lots of opportunities to scale, and we haven't even hit all of them today. I'm not sure we're going to be able to identify 1 or 2 biggest drivers, I think it's going to come from a lot of different places. And part of the reason you hear such confidence in our voices to double again after we doubled in such a short period of time is everything I just mentioned.\nBrian Mckenna: Yes. Got it. Appreciate the color there. And then just 2 quick modeling questions for Rob. How should we think about margin expansion in 2022 relative to 2021? And then is there any updated guidance on the tax rate moving forward?\nRobert Lewin: Yes. I'll start with the second one. What we -- our tax rate this year was a little over 17%. And what we said over time is we would expect that to migrate up to statutory rate in the low 20s. As it relates to margin, we've talked about operating in the low 60s. In Q4, we were at 63%. In 2021, we were at 63%, so a little bit ahead of where we thought we would be. We're investing a lot back into the firm right now. So I think low 60s is the right level to think about in the near term. But we believe over the medium term that we could take our margins to mid-60s on a sustainable basis if we're able to execute on the revenue opportunity in front of us. And so that's what we're very much focused on as we continue to invest back into the business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Just back on the retail side. Of the $50 billion in private wealth assets right now, are you able to break that out between what you would call democratized products? I know those are still very much in development but just to try to get a sense of how you're thinking about that fundraising in retail from new products. Scott, you mentioned obviously some products on the yield side gaining attention. Maybe just a flavor of that growth path of that 10% to 20% to 30%to 50%. Maybe even just in the next 1 to 2 years, what kind of AUM you think you could raise in new democratized products in retail? And then to what extent would there be significant placement fees attached with the retail side of that?\nCraig Larson: Brian, it's Craig. Why don't I start? Look, in terms of where we are today, we have 3 broad democratized solutions that are on a bunch of different platforms, in addition to bespoke solutions that are tailored for individual platforms.  To your first question, we have about $5 billion of AUM across that family, if you will. And we do believe over time that we'll have democratized products really across all of our asset classes. And alongside of that, we're going to continue to invest in sales, marketing, data, digital talent, et cetera. And alongside of where we are today, we do expect we'll see these products launched on additional platforms over the course of the year which will be additive to all of this.  So it feels like, collectively, we're off to a great start. It still feels to us like we're in the earliest stages. One of those products that seems to be taking or having a lot of mind share, we only began accepting capital in June, it's off to a great start. It's pressed in the real estate business.  So it just feels like we have a lot of momentum, which is really exciting for us. We don't have any breakdown of democratized products for you in terms of where we think that number could grow. There's certainly lots of data points out there that highlight the opportunity. And again, just given the investment we have, the brand investment performance, we think we're really well positioned to be a big winner in a massive end market.\nBrian Bedell: Fair enough. And then just on the follow-up, just the timing of a couple of things. The -- your expectation of the $38 billion that's not earning management fees now. Over what time frame do you expect the rest of that to move into fee-paying AUM? And then the dry powder also, $112 billion, is almost double what it was 6 quarters ago. As you raise product, should we be thinking of that deploying that dry powder running down in terms of how you're seeing opportunities to invest that you concerned that within the call? Or is it possible that, that dry powder will continue to build given your fundraising?\nRobert Lewin: Brian, it's Rob. So on your -- on the first part of your question, I'd say in that $38 billion, I mean, it's a mix of different things. In some cases, it's some investment products where the fee turns on when you invest it, and some of those have lives of 3, 4, 5 years from an investment period perspective. And so I think about that on a blended basis of about 3 years.  And some of the other products, it's just capital we've raised and funds that we haven't yet turned on. And so we would think that, that's more in the next 3-, 6-ish month time frame. So I think on a blended basis, a couple of years overall feels like a reasonable assumption for that $38 billion, maybe a little bit inside of that.  And then as it relates to the dry powder, it's a tough question to answer. It is really a function of how active the investment environment is, coupled with our fundraising activity. And so I think what you've heard from us a number of times on this call is the excitement we have for future fundraising. At the same time, in these volatile markets, we think the opportunity for us to be leaning it from an investment perspective might get more interesting. And so I think it will just be a balance of those 2 things. Hard to be prescriptive about where that number goes over the next couple of quarters.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprys: I wanted to circle back to a comment Scott had made. Scott, you had mentioned that the quantum of opportunity was greater than anticipated. I'd just be curious to hear your perspectives on why that's been the case. What's changed across the industry over the past 12 to 18 months? And as you look forward, are there any sort of risk to the outlook that you're paying attention to, either regulatory-wise? Clearly, there's been some movement there or on the macro front. Just curious your perspectives there.\nScott Nuttall: Thanks for the question, Michael. Yes, I think part of it is -- let me take it back to kind of the strategy that we laid out last April, which is that we said that we only wanted to be in businesses where we thought we already were or could get to be top 3 in the world. And we wanted to stay focused in those areas. And I think part of the reason you hear us saying now that we think the quantum of the opportunity is greater than we anticipated is the end markets that we're facing off against are growing quite rapidly. And we're finding investor appetite, not only from the traditional sources, but new sources, are increasing faster than we'd anticipated.  So end markets are growing very quickly, and more and more people are investing in what we do. And so that's kind of part one to the answer to your question as to why the quantum is greater than we'd anticipated. We already expected growth. I think it's a bit more than we expected.  The other thing I'd say is that we are approaching top 3 faster than we'd anticipated in some of these asset classes. And a lot of that's on the back of good investment performance and building like and trust with a broader client base. And so the end opportunity is bigger than probably we thought, and we're getting there more rapidly than we thought. And so the definition of top 3 in terms of what that means in terms of magnitude of AUM, revenue, profitability is, therefore, bigger than what we'd anticipated probably 12, 18 months ago.  The risks I think are pretty straightforward. We've got to execute. It's a pretty straightforward business when you back up. If you have strong investment performance and you have products that clients want to invest in and they like you and they trust your judgment and you perform for them through a cycle, it's very straightforward to scale. So a lot of the risks, and this is one of the reasons we like our business so much, it's on us. We've got execution in front of us. We just need to perform. And I think a big part of the reason you've seen us scaling so rapidly is we've had really strong investment performance at the same time that we've been operationalizing a broader client base. And we do see a significant amount of running room on both of those topics.  So I know there's been a couple of questions today about market volatility, and it's been a little more bumpy at the beginning of this year than what we saw last. But from our standpoint, that tends to be quite good news. We've talked about the $112 billion of dry powder, if we can invest into volatility, that tends to create long-term opportunity for us in terms of incremental revenue and profit down the road. So a long way of saying we really like the way we're positioned right now. Low volatility is probably good for our business long term, and the opportunity ahead is significant.\nMichael Cyprys: And just on the regulatory point, just any sort of thoughts there around potential for regulatory changes, enhanced transparency around fees, et cetera?\nScott Nuttall: Look, I think the level of regulatory scrutiny of our space is probably a positive for larger players that are more institutionalized. And so there's aspects of how the regulatory environment is developed that I think the barriers to entry in our space have gone up, and that's good for incumbent players. So nothing that we see that I would call out today. Our job is to react to what the regulators talk to us about. And so far, we actually think it's been long term helpful to our business.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. And just a quick cleanup question for Rob, if I could. Just hoping you might be able to update us on the amount of capital that was invested off the balance sheet in '21 and the realizations as well off the balance sheet in 2021 and how that compared to 2020, if you have that.\nRobert Lewin: Yes. Activity was certainly up across the board, Mike. We monetized just over $3 billion of the balance sheet in 2021. And we deployed about $3.7 billion. That deployment does not include Global Atlantic. So if you include Global Atlantic in that number, we'd be a little bit below $7 billion of deployment for the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Finian O'Shea with Wells Fargo Securities.\nFinian O'Shea: To follow on the insurance topic, are you able to touch on what you're seeing on the regulatory agenda, focusing more on structured products and alternative asset manager affiliates and if you see any major impact to the product that you and your peers are providing to insurance clients?\nRobert Lewin: Thanks for the question. It's a topical one, and we're spending a lot of time internally focused on it. Part of the answer is similar to the answer Scott just gave from a regulatory -- overall regulatory environment perspective. I'd say the insurance industry, just like other financial services industries, is going through a period of change. In general, the industry is getting more sophisticated, and we think that is ultimately a good thing for policyholders. And so as a result of that, we think it's entirely appropriate for regulators to adapt as the industry evolves, and we think smart regulation is a good thing for the industry overall.  And so as it relates to Global Atlantic specifically, we've got really close and transparent relationships with all of our regulators. We know they are working to gather information and industry feedback. And beyond that, there's really not a lot that we can comment on. All that we can say is that we don't anticipate really any major change to our core business model, which is investing thoughtfully behind the long-term promises that we're making as an institution to policyholders. I appreciate the question, and it is a topical one.\nOperator: Our final question this morning comes from the line of Rufus Hone with Bank of Montreal.\nRufus Hone: Great. Had one on Global Atlantic. Clearly, strong AUM and earnings growth since the acquisition, and I was curious if you anticipate any change in the appetite for block transactions and on your regular quarterly inflows as interest rates start to rise. Any details there would be helpful.\nRobert Lewin: Yes. So no change in our appetite. It's been an area of very meaningful and we think very smart growth that Global Atlantic has had over the past 12 months. I would say the space around block transactions, I'm sure, as you noted, has become a little bit more competitive. But we think with our capital base, quality of our management team, the relationships we have and really our systems and processes, they position us all to compete really effectively for block transactions. I think a big reason why Global Atlantic partnered up with KKR, in addition to that, was our capabilities on the asset management side and our ability to rotate assets in these blocks into KKR-originated product. And so when you combine all of that, we think we're really well positioned. No change in appetite, and the institutional part of GA's business will continue to be a big growth driver for them going forward.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Larson for any final comments.\nCraig Larson: We would just really like to thank everybody for your interest in KKR, and we look forward to chatting with you next quarter. Take care. Thanks again.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Scott Nuttall",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. As Craig and Rob reviewed, 2021 was a very strong year with record AUM, FRE and earnings. The hard work of the last 10 to 15 years of business-building began to show up in bigger ways last year, and we're ahead of where we thought we would be at this point. And with a record $112 billion of dry powder, we are well capitalized to invest in opportunities presented by more volatile markets and an evolving macro picture. In summary, we feel incredibly well positioned.  While we're together today, I also want to give you a little color on our annual planning meetings. Last week, we gathered 35 of our partners for 2 full days to review where we are, where we're going and what we need to get right to capture the opportunity in front of us. It was an extremely energizing discussion.  As we discussed at our Investor Day last April, we had significant runway in all of our businesses and see the opportunity to meaningfully scale across multiple platforms and markets simultaneously, including Asia, real estate, infrastructure, our core suite of products, private wealth, growth, impact in ESG, insurance, credit and private equity, amongst others. What we discussed last week is that our progress makes us even more confident in the opportunity ahead and what these businesses can become. Said another way, we believe we can get to the destination faster than we thought a year ago, and the quantum of the growth opportunity is greater than we anticipated.  So while 2021 was a great year for the firm, what's particularly exciting is how the progress we made last year positions us for more growth in the years ahead. And critically, Joe and I have never had more confidence in our team. We have a focused and highly motivated group driving our businesses and functions and responsible for each of our growth initiatives. So we enter 2022 with significant conviction in our growth prospects, our model and our people and look forward to keeping you updated throughout the year.  And with that, we're happy to take your questions. Question-and-Answer Session Yes. The only thing I would add, Alex, agree with Craig, no change in LP appetite. The only incremental color I'd give is, if anything, we're seeing more interest in real assets with yield. So anything with some inflation protection, so think infrastructure and real estate. As we see inflation expectations go up, we're finding even more interest in those asset classes. Rob, do you want to pick up on the second part? Yes. The only thing I'd add, Bill, last quarter, we said we thought we could double fee-related earnings in TDE over the next 5 years. That's still very much the case. So no updated guidance for '22, but suffice it to say, we well exceeded what we told you a year ago. The only thing I'd add, Craig, is that it's going to be a constantly evolving answer to your question because if you think, especially as Global Atlantic pursues block activity, we're bringing on more assets, and then those blocks need to be rotated themselves. So I'm not sure we'll ever reach stasis, frankly. But to Rob's point, we're a bit ahead of where we thought we'd be, and we'll keep you updated. But the block activity has obviously been significant since we signed the deal. Yes. Brian, it's Scott. Thanks for asking the question, it's kind of fun to answer, honestly. Because we talked about last April, we just got a lot on. We went from 6 to something like 28 investing strategies over the last decade plus, so it's kind of -- the answer to your question, it's hard to be succinct, frankly.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Robert Lewin",
            "content": "Thanks a lot, Craig. Now to walk you through our quarterly P&L, our management fees increased by 49% this quarter versus Q4 of 2020. Management fee growth was driven by close across a number of active funds in the quarter. These closes, alongside our investment activity, bring fee-paying AUM to $357 billion million. The fundraising success experienced over the past few quarters is really starting to flow through this line with another $38 billion of committed capital not yet paying fees.  Our net transaction and monitoring fees were primarily driven by our capital markets franchise this quarter, which earned $320 million. This is a high point for us. This revenue figure also encompasses a record number of transactions in a single quarter, and we only had one fee event that was greater than $20 million.  For the year, Capital Markets totaled $847 million with revenues diversified by type, approximately 1/4 of our revenues related to each of private equity, infrastructure as well as third-party clients with the remaining quarter diversified across multiple different asset classes.  Moving to our expenses. Fee-related compensation came in right at that 22.5% mark, the midpoint of the range we've discussed previously, while our other operating expenses came in at $140 million. The increase here was driven by higher placement fees as well as professional fees given high activity levels across the firm. We are also all back in the office across most of our locations, leading to an uptick in operating costs versus this time last year. In total, this brings our fee-related earnings to $606 million for the quarter, which is up 45% versus Q4 of 2020. The quarterly and yearly FRE margin both came in at 63%. And on a per-share basis, FRE is $2.23 for the year.  Now moving on to realizations. Realized carried interest totaled $568 million in the quarter. Our realized incentive fees totaled $351 million in the quarter, largely due to Marshall Wace's strong investment performance. And realized investment income totaled $336 million. Together, these earnings streams resulted in $1.4 billion of asset management operating earnings. Our insurance segment also experienced an incredibly strong quarter with $347 million of operating earnings.  In Q4, Global Atlantic sold its interest in Origis Energy, a solar renewable energy developer, at 12x cost, resulting in a $200-plus million benefit to segment operating earnings. This was really an amazing result for Global Atlantic and all of its shareholders while still recognizing that 12x gains are not representative of our go-forward expectations here.  Excluding all variable investment income for the year at GA, ROE would have still been a bit above 14%. This return represents a strong core operating level and modestly above our 12% to 13% expected range.  Most importantly, a year into our partnership with GA, we couldn't feel any better about our collective progress, including the performance of management, the profitability of our stake, scaling of the AUM and the integration of our teams.  In total, our after-tax distributable earnings were $1.4 billion for the quarter or $1.59 per share. Comparing 2021 to 2020, DE per share is up over 2x. Alongside an increase in earnings, we are also seeing continued compounding in our book value per share, which now totals $28.77. As a component of this, our 61% economic interest in Global Atlantic's book value now totals $3.4 billion, up 15% since the first quarter of our ownership.  In summary, our business continues to perform at an exceptionally high level, and this is clearly evident in both our Q4 as well as our 2021 results.  Now there are 2 additional topics I would like to go through in a bit more detail. The first is our potential. In 2021, we generated almost $5 billion of distributable operating income, really a step function increase from the $2.3 billion that we generated in 2020. And to be clear, we don't believe these results yet reflect even our run rate profitability, let alone our potential.  There are a number of reasons why we have room to run. Let's start with management fees. At 12/31, we had $38 billion of committed capital that isn't yet running through our management fee line. A year ago, that number was $20 billion. And as that $38 billion, which has a weighted average management fee north of 100 basis points, is either invested or enters its investment period, it will drive management fees in a meaningful way. And I will come to our future fundraising potential from here in just a minute.  Next are our embedded gains. Gross unrealized carry at year-end totaled $8.6 billion compared to $4.7 billion a year ago. So even after a record realization year, gross unrealized carry increased over 80%, positioning us really well for future realized performance income. And embedded balance sheet gains at 12/31 were $6.7 billion, up from $4.4 billion a year ago. So similarly, while we saw a meaningful step-up in balance sheet realizations in 2021, our embedded gains increased over 50%.  And finally, as the overall footprint of the firm continues to grow, leading to increased deployment and more relationships, this, in turn, continues to expand the opportunities we expect to have in our Capital Markets business, so really strong performance in 2021 over the really meaningful potential still yet in front of us.  That leads into the second topic I'd like to touch on: fundraising and our pipeline. As we look forward, we expect to be fundraising across 30-plus strategies in 2022, so we have a lot of runway and opportunity in front of us.  In terms of areas of focus, I'd highlight 4. The first area is private wealth. We now manage a little over $50 billion in private wealth assets, and we've been investing meaningfully into this channel. Historically, private wealth has contributed about 10% to 20% of the money that we raise annually. With the investments we're making in people, technology and new product innovation, alongside the strength of our brand and our track record, we believe over time that it should be 30% to 50% of the money that we raise.  The second area would be Asia. More than half of global GDP growth is expected to come from Asia. And as a reminder, 8 of our 21 offices are in the region. We were early in Asia, and we've seen significant scaling as AUM across our Asia-dedicated strategies has gone from $20 billion to $42 billion over the last 2 years with private equity being the biggest driver of that growth. In 2022, we expect to be fundraising for 5 Asia-focused strategies outside of PE across our infrastructure, real estate, credit and growth businesses. We have a leading footprint in Asia today, and building on our presence is a priority and a big opportunity for us.  The third area would be our broader core franchises. These are all adjacent strategies to what we're doing in private equity, real estate, as well as infrastructure. So think longer-term capital, a lot of which can be raised on a continuous basis for strategies that are leveraging resources and deal flow that are already resident within the firm today. A year ago, we were at $17 billion of AUM across core. And today, that figure is north of $40 billion. In 2022, we look to continue the momentum and expect to be fundraising across 5 distinct strategies in private equity, real estate and infrastructure.  And the fourth area is what we're doing across our real estate franchise. A year ago, AUM across real estate was $15 billion. Today, that figure is $41 billion. In 2022, we expect to fundraise across 10 distinct real estate strategies, including the next generation of our opportunistic real estate strategies across all 3 geographies.  And with that, let me turn it over to Scott. Yes, Alex. As it relates to the management fee piece of it, Alex, we've never felt as good as we do right now about our ability to sustainably grow management fees over time. Obviously, I referenced the $38 billion of capital that hasn't yet flown through our management fee line item, the 30-plus products Craig just went through, our relationship with Global Atlantic where assets are much higher than where we thought it would be and, frankly, just the new product innovation that's happening across the firm today that gives us visibility around our ability to grow management fees tomorrow. So I think the expectation should certainly be continued management fee growth from us and being able to do so on a sustainable basis over time. Yes. Alex, the key for us on capital allocation is to have a consistent approach, and you've heard that for us over the last number of years, and we'd anticipate that continuing. And so as we think about our overall capital allocation strategy, we want to make sure that we're striking the right balance between capital return to shareholders and investing back into KKR for growth, so long as that can be done at high ROEs and above our cost of equity.  So let's take those in order. You would have seen, obviously, that we just increased our dividend 7%, third consecutive year since we became a C-corp where we've increased our dividend.  And then we want to continue to invest back into KKR stock, as you said. Certainly at these levels, we feel really good about our overall body of work on our share buyback. We've repurchased or retired north of 80 million shares now. That's almost 10% of KKR shares outstanding, almost 15% of our free float. And our goal is to keep our share count flat as it relates to employee dilution. So I think the expectation over time would certainly see us be in the market and acquiring and retiring KKR stock.  In terms of balancing that with overall opportunity to grow KKR, it is a big priority for us to reinvest back into KKR, whether that's in M&A or supporting new products or supporting new innovations so long as we're seeing returns that are commensurate with that capital commitment. And over the last number of years, we certainly have.  So we're going to continue to have a capital allocation framework that is very much ROE-based. We feel that's a real core competency of ours as we think about moving capital around to the highest ROE opportunity. And if you think about our overall capital allocation framework, I think it's also worth remembering that KKR is an employee base is the single-largest shareholder in KKR. So we come at that from a very aligned basis. Yes. Rob, some good news here. As it relates to Q1, we already have a good amount of visibility into some pretty meaningful revenue from monetization activity. As of now, that figure is around $700 million, maybe a bit above that. As you know, that's collectively across both our performance as well as our investment income. And as a reminder, that is from deals that are already closed or have been signed up and that we expect to close in Q1. So we're off to a really good start there. This is one of the strongest figures we've ever had at this stage of the quarter. And then the other I know relevant thing for your models is the split. It's weighted around 75-25 carry investment income right now. So yes, we feel like a pretty good start to the year and gives us some support going into Q1 in 2022. Bill, it's Rob. Thanks for the question. Maybe let's start with where we think interest rates are going, and so we do see rates certainly increasing like the rest of the market. I think we're likely to get 4 more fed funds increases this year. But at the same time, we do see that coming on the back of robust financial conditions. So our expectation is that we can be in an environment here where rates are still low or negative over the next couple of years, which I think is an overall positive place for us to be from a business model perspective.  Now of course, there are uncertainties around weights are going, but I think there's a number of areas where we're, I think, pretty well competitively positioned. As you referenced, Global Atlantic, they are largely biased to benefit from interest rates rising over time. So $120 billion of capital there as well as how we think about their individual channel and our ability to be able to generate sales from that channel we think are all positively biased in a rising rate environment.  And so I think there's a number of other areas around KKR as well where we think we're competitively well positioned. You look at our credit business, over $200 billion or close to $200 billion of AUM. Much of our third-party business there is floating rate exposure in nature. So as interest rates rise, all things equal, our returns go up. And the hurdle rates across many of those products tend to be fixed in nature, so the likelihood of earning additional incentive fees is that much higher. So hopefully, that helps answer your question. Yes. No updates to the numbers. Bill, obviously, we're well ahead of where we thought we would be even 6 or 12 months ago.  And as it relates to both fundraising as well as management fee growth, this isn't just a result of acceleration of fundraisers. In many cases, we have well exceeded the expectations that we have for ourselves, and so we continue to see a robust environment to be able to raise capital. And as I mentioned earlier, we continue to see an environment where we should be able to really drive substantial management fee growth as well as FRE growth off of a base of $2.23. So we should be well ahead of our target for 2022 that we laid out. I think it was about 12 months ago. It's Rob. So let's -- I think it's worth spending a little bit of time on our Capital Markets business. It did have a really step-function increase in 2021. If you take a step back, our Capital Markets business over the last several quarters has averaged about $200 million of revenue per quarter. Now markets have definitely been open and compliant, but I think we've also continued to really take share here.  So I think that's -- as you think about our business in a market environment where capital is being deployed, it can be still a relatively volatile market environment. But in one where there's activity, we think that's a reasonable run rate for our business.  But much more important for us is how we take our business from the $850 million of revenue in 2021 and over the next several years continue to take a lot of share and grow that in a meaningful way. And we think we've got plans in place to be able to do that. We've gone through this a bunch of times. It includes following KKR in terms of its own product expansion, following KKR in terms of its own geographic expansion. We think by hiring the right capabilities internally, that could lead to a lot of revenue growth. And I think it's worth calling out our non-KKR issuer business, our third-party business, it generated almost $200 million of revenue in 2021. And I think that really speaks to our business model and the quality of our people, that we were able to take that business and scale to the point that is not too different from a revenue perspective from where our Capital Markets business was in aggregate not too long ago. Glenn, one other. I know you had referenced the impact of the Capital Markets environment have on monetizations. I think the big advantage here as we come into 2022 with over $15 billion of embedded revenue that sits in our balance sheet between gross unrealized carry and the embedded gains of our investment portfolio. And I think Q1, and we were off to a good start from the monetization perspective, a good example of that. We don't need straight-line markets up to be able to monetize that $15 billion of embedded revenue, but what we will need is we will need a market environment that does have some stability over periods of time and is flexible in nature. And I think there's going to be areas where we're going to be able to continue to pick our spots in this kind of a market environment and generate monetizations for our shareholders. Gerry, one other thing, if you look at Page 5 on our press release, you can see our perpetual capital. It was up year-on-year over 7x. Now a lot of that is Global Atlantic. But what we don't want to get lost in that slide is that, ex Global Atlantic, our perpetual capital year-on-year was still up 4x versus this time last year. And so there's a lot of momentum across that part of our business. Craig, it's Rob. That's going to be a multiyear process, and we're going to do it in a very prudent way and make sure that we're rotating GA's balance sheet from quality investments that they had today into opportunities for KKR to be able to invest that capital with a similar or better risk level and at an increased yield. And so that process is taking place. And I would say 11 months in, we're probably in a better place than we thought we'd be at the beginning of the deal. But there's no doubt, as we complete that rotation or we make progress on that rotation, that's going to increase the blended management fee rate in our overall relationship with Global Atlantic. I think that blended management fee rate today is in the mid-teens, and so it definitely has the ability to go up over time based on the rotation that you referenced. Yes. It's a lot across our real estate credit franchise, our private credit franchise, structured finance, asset-based finance. Those are really the big areas of opportunity that we're working together with the GA team. Yes. Brian, it's Rob. I'll take the first shot at it. The reality is we've got a lot of confidence across many parts of our business. I'll call out a few, and we talked about them on our prepared remarks.  Asia is a really massive long-term opportunity for us, and we've talked about in the past that we think we could take our Asia business and make it one day as big as our North America business. That's for a couple of reasons. One, we think more than global -- excuse me, half of global growth is going to come out of that region over the next several years. Two, we have a huge head start and competitive advantage versus our competitors. And really, the key for us is to take our leading position there with our leading position across infrastructure, real estate, credit growth equity on a global base in the marriage of those 2 things. And we think that could lead to a lot of growth for us in that part of the world. We've got 5 products, ex private equity, that will be fundraising for capital in Asia in 2022. So that's really a big theme for us. What we're doing across real assets and real estate and infrastructure we think is really exciting. We've talked about our build out of private wealth. So there's a number of different avenues and ways that we have to be able to achieve P&L growth over the next several years. Yes. I'll start with the second one. What we -- our tax rate this year was a little over 17%. And what we said over time is we would expect that to migrate up to statutory rate in the low 20s. As it relates to margin, we've talked about operating in the low 60s. In Q4, we were at 63%. In 2021, we were at 63%, so a little bit ahead of where we thought we would be. We're investing a lot back into the firm right now. So I think low 60s is the right level to think about in the near term. But we believe over the medium term that we could take our margins to mid-60s on a sustainable basis if we're able to execute on the revenue opportunity in front of us. And so that's what we're very much focused on as we continue to invest back into the business. Brian, it's Rob. So on your -- on the first part of your question, I'd say in that $38 billion, I mean, it's a mix of different things. In some cases, it's some investment products where the fee turns on when you invest it, and some of those have lives of 3, 4, 5 years from an investment period perspective. And so I think about that on a blended basis of about 3 years.  And some of the other products, it's just capital we've raised and funds that we haven't yet turned on. And so we would think that, that's more in the next 3-, 6-ish month time frame. So I think on a blended basis, a couple of years overall feels like a reasonable assumption for that $38 billion, maybe a little bit inside of that.  And then as it relates to the dry powder, it's a tough question to answer. It is really a function of how active the investment environment is, coupled with our fundraising activity. And so I think what you've heard from us a number of times on this call is the excitement we have for future fundraising. At the same time, in these volatile markets, we think the opportunity for us to be leaning it from an investment perspective might get more interesting. And so I think it will just be a balance of those 2 things. Hard to be prescriptive about where that number goes over the next couple of quarters. Yes. Activity was certainly up across the board, Mike. We monetized just over $3 billion of the balance sheet in 2021. And we deployed about $3.7 billion. That deployment does not include Global Atlantic. So if you include Global Atlantic in that number, we'd be a little bit below $7 billion of deployment for the year. Thanks for the question. It's a topical one, and we're spending a lot of time internally focused on it. Part of the answer is similar to the answer Scott just gave from a regulatory -- overall regulatory environment perspective. I'd say the insurance industry, just like other financial services industries, is going through a period of change. In general, the industry is getting more sophisticated, and we think that is ultimately a good thing for policyholders. And so as a result of that, we think it's entirely appropriate for regulators to adapt as the industry evolves, and we think smart regulation is a good thing for the industry overall.  And so as it relates to Global Atlantic specifically, we've got really close and transparent relationships with all of our regulators. We know they are working to gather information and industry feedback. And beyond that, there's really not a lot that we can comment on. All that we can say is that we don't anticipate really any major change to our core business model, which is investing thoughtfully behind the long-term promises that we're making as an institution to policyholders. I appreciate the question, and it is a topical one. Yes. So no change in our appetite. It's been an area of very meaningful and we think very smart growth that Global Atlantic has had over the past 12 months. I would say the space around block transactions, I'm sure, as you noted, has become a little bit more competitive. But we think with our capital base, quality of our management team, the relationships we have and really our systems and processes, they position us all to compete really effectively for block transactions. I think a big reason why Global Atlantic partnered up with KKR, in addition to that, was our capabilities on the asset management side and our ability to rotate assets in these blocks into KKR-originated product. And so when you combine all of that, we think we're really well positioned. No change in appetite, and the institutional part of GA's business will continue to be a big growth driver for them going forward."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to KKR's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, this conference is being recorded. I will now hand the call over to Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.\nCraig Larson: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2021 earnings call. I'm joined this morning by Scott Nuttall, our co-CEO; and by Rob Lewin, our CFO.  We would like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, which is available on the Investor Center section at kkr.com. And as a reminder, we report our segment numbers on an adjusted share basis.  This call will contain forward-looking statements which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to our SEC filings and our earnings release for cautionary factors related to these statements.  Now turning to our results. We're pleased to be reporting another very strong quarter with fee-related earnings per share of $0.60 and after-tax distributable earnings of $1.05 per share. Both of these figures are as high as we've ever reported. Building on the success we've had in fundraising, management fees increased 16% from just last quarter, and management fees are up over 50% since the third quarter of 2020 to $559 million. This growth is the key driver behind the 60% increase in our fee-related earnings per share that you see on a year-over-year basis. Book value per share for the quarter came in at $28.06, up 38% from 1 year ago.  And turning to fundraising. We continue to have a great deal of momentum. New capital raised in the quarter totaled $28 billion organically, bringing the year-to-date figure to $102 billion. Last year, in 2020, for the full year, we raised $44 billion, and that was a record year for KKR. So over the first 9 months of 2021, we've raised over 2x what we raised for all of last year, and that's with an active pipeline of fundraising initiatives as we look forward.  Focusing on the $28 billion raised in the third quarter, we'd highlight 2 things. First, in private markets, 40% of the capital raised in the quarter came from our real estate business. We held the final close of our Americas Real Estate Fund. REPA III is more than 2x larger than its predecessor, and total AUM across the real estate platform now totals $36 billion. And Global Atlantic was particularly active with block activity helping add $14 million of new capital, largely in public markets.  And alongside all of this fundraising, we're finding interesting opportunities to invest. We deployed a record $15 billion into private market strategies into the quarter, as well as $10 billion in public markets. This brings our total deployment for the quarter to a record $24 billion and on a year-to-date basis to $50 billion. One of the key drivers here is the continued scaling of our infrastructure and real estate platforms. Year-to-date, real assets deployment is a little more than half of total deployment in private markets. If we look back in 2020, real assets comprised 25% of private markets deployment. So as real assets deployment is scaling, private markets deployment is increasing and is becoming more diversified. In public markets, the scale of our credit platform grew meaningfully before the Global Atlantic acquisition, and that growth has continued after GA. So similarly, you're seeing a step-up in deployment here with the increase driven by both direct corporate origination as well as in asset-based finance.  To give you a sense, last year, total private and opportunistic credit deployment was a little over $10 billion. Through the first 9 months of 2021, that has increased to $23 billion. So deployment has more than doubled, and we're only 9 months into the year.  Now I'll turn the call over to Rob to walk you through some additional details. Rob?\nRobert Lewin: Thanks a lot, Craig. Just as we continue to see strength in the fundraising and deployment front, our funds continue to generate really strong relative investment performance. Our flagship private equity funds increased by 11% in the quarter and 79% over the LTM period, while the entire PE portfolio appreciated 9% and 52%, respectively.  In real assets, our opportunistic real estate state funds increased by 14% in the quarter and 29% over the LTM. Infrastructure continues to perform really well, up 4% in the quarter and 19% over the last 12 months. And on the public markets side, our leverage and alternative credit funds increased by 1% and 2% in the quarter, respectively, with continued performance over the LTM, up 11% and 26%.  The combination of strong investment performance, as well as the capital raising that Craig just went through, has yielded a really robust acceleration of our AUM, which now totals $459 billion, and our fee-paying AUM is $349 billion. That's up 7% and 9%, respectively, versus just last quarter. When comparing our AUM and fee paying AUM relative to this time last year, they're both up, close to 100%. And importantly, much of this AUM is now either perpetual capital or in long-dated partnerships. Just 9 months ago, this number was $55 billion. It's now $205 billion out of our almost $460 billion of AUM. You can see this growth and the transformational change in the composition of our AUM on Page 16 of the earnings release.  And finally, as it relates to our capital base, we currently have $38 billion of committed capital that comes online and becomes fee paying at a weighted average rate of over 100 basis points when the capital is either invested or enters its investment period.  Now turning to our quarterly P&L. Our management fees increased over 50% this quarter versus the same time last year. As we signaled on last quarter's call, management fee growth was driven by a combination of new capital raised and various newer funds hitting their run rate. Net transaction monitoring fees were primarily driven by our capital markets franchise, which saw a continued strength this quarter and were up 24% versus the same quarter in 2020. And over the last 12 months, our capital markets transaction fees have totaled $720 million, which is 42% higher than the average during the 2018 to 2020 time period.  The growth in the platform is stemming from many of the expansion areas that we touched on at our April Investor Day, including our build-out of real asset, core PE and third-party coverage, which have all generated meaningful market share gains. We remain really constructive around the future growth of this business. This all brings us to fee-related earnings of $530 million for the quarter, which is up 63% versus Q3 2020. On a per-share basis, our FRE is $2.02 over the last 12 months.  Moving on to realizations. Realized performance income came in at $433 million for the quarter driven by exits in Bountiful, Ingersoll-Rand and Academy. Realized investment income totaled $448 million for the quarter driven by additional exits in Mr. Cooper and Flutter.  Even with these very strong monetization figures, we have still seen healthy gains in both our unrealized carried interest and the embedded gains from our balance sheet investments. Gross unrealized carried interest increased to $8.5 billion, while our embedded gains on investments increased to $7.1 billion. That's almost $16 billion of embedded revenue, which has grown over 70% since the start of the year, and that's all happened while we've been generating record levels of realizations.  Coming back to our P&L. Our asset management operating earnings were a bit north of $1 billion for the quarter, which is up 80% from the same quarter last year. And our insurance segment operating earnings totaled $115 million, largely driven by strong core operating performance at Global Atlantic, together with the sale of 2 strategic investments that helped bolster net investment income.  In total, our after-tax distributable earnings per share came in at $1.05 for the quarter and $3.47 for the LTM period. Both numbers are up 100% and 79%, respectively, versus the prior period.  Turning to our balance sheet. Book value per share came in at $28.06, which was up 38% year-over-year, driven primarily by strong investment performance. It's worth noting that our result for this quarter includes an $0.80 increase to our deferred tax liability associated with the corporate reorganization that we announced last month and that we expect to close next year.  In summary, we are really doing all the things that matter most for our business to perform at a high level and to ensure that we're set up well for the future. We keep coming back to these 5 things and really do believe we are optimizing for outcomes across the board. Number one, we are sourcing unique investment opportunities in which to put our capital to work. Our year-to-date deployment is up 2.5x. Our investment performance has been exceptionally strong, both on an absolute basis and relative to many of our peers. Because of this performance, our monetization opportunities have been abundant, and we have delivered substantial distributions to our clients and record levels of monetization for our shareholders. And these first 3 points all enable us to have the fundraising successes we have achieved. $100-plus billion of year-to-date flows is the proof point, and this sets us up incredibly well for the future.  And finally, we have conviction that our business model allows us to generate greater financial outcomes. And I think you're clearly seeing that flow through our P&L.  We have also talked on these calls and on Investor Days about inflection points. Our overall business has seen a fundamental shift, an inflection point, in its operating level. Beyond our distributable earnings being up approximately 2x since this time last year, all of our forward indicators are in the best shape they've ever been in. AUM is up 2x. Year-to-date fundraising is up 3x, and the embedded gains in our balance sheet have increased by approximately 300% in just the last year. We really couldn't be any more excited about the future.  And with that, let me turn it over to Scott.\nScott Nuttall: Thank you, Rob, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. Craig and Rob did a nice job walking through our numbers, which were strong again this quarter. So I'm going to spend my time on a few strategic areas of focus and give you our sense for how we're progressing.  The first is perpetual and long-dated strategic capital. As you know, we are big believers in the power of compounding in all aspects of our business, including AUM. The more capital we can attract, that is perpetual or recycles, the faster we expect our AUM will scale and compound over the long term. A year ago, perpetual and strategic capital was $49 billion, 21% of our total AUM. Today, that number is $205 billion or 45%, $49 billion to $205 billion in 1 year. So we've seen over a 4x increase in 12 months, and we are nowhere near done. We have a lot of new ideas and efforts to generate even more perpetual capital going forward.  The second big strategic focus area is insurance. As you know, Global Atlantic advance materially in this area. GA assets have grown from $75 billion a year ago to $120 billion at the end of Q3, a 60% increase. In addition, we have seen our AUM from third-party insurance clients increased from $33 billion a year ago to $48 billion today, an increase of 45%. Putting GA and third party together, our insurance AUM has grown from $108 billion pro forma for GA to $167 billion in a year or an increase of 55%. While we're pleased with the progress, keep in mind, we only closed the GA deal in February of this year and see a lot more opportunity for significant growth in insurance.  The third area of focus is private wealth. As you know, individual investors have been 10% to 20% of the capital we've raised the last few years. We believe that with the investments we're making, combined with our brand and performance, that number will ramp to 30% to 50% of the capital we raised over the next several years. We are investing in sales, marketing, data and digital talent, and we are creating more democratized products that are relevant for a wide number of individual investors. This is a big opportunity for us, and we think we're incredibly well positioned.  So long story short, the Q3 numbers are strong, but they tell only a small part of the story of what's happening at the firm. These initiatives and others give us confidence we can more than double KKR again over the next 5-or-so years, including our fee-related earnings, where we see a clear path from the $2 of FRE per share we've achieved over the last 12 months to an excess of $4 over that time frame. So while recent growth has been exciting, we see a lot more ahead. And with that, we're happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.\nAlexander Blostein: Great. So maybe we'll pick up, Scott, on where you left off with doubling the business again and growing FRE to north of $4 a share. As you go through the kind of key initiatives that you outlined, whether it's perpetual capital insurance or private wealth, can we zone in on private wealth just maybe a little bit more? As you think about the ramp to 30% to 50% of kind of flows from that channel, what is sort of the key product and maybe key distribution partnerships that you're considering? Obviously, we have KREST out there, so would be good to get an update on that. But how else are you thinking about tackling this part of the market?\nCraig Larson: Alex, it's Craig. Thanks for asking about -- taking a step back, we think the opportunity within private wealth to introduce tailored democratized products really is massive, and we think we're incredibly well positioned.  Now to review, we have 3 broad solutions that are on multiple platforms as well as bespoke solutions that are tailored for individual platforms. And in total, we've raised about $2 billion year-to-date. So we're raising a couple of hundred million a month. So we're pleased with our first steps here. We're just getting started, as you know, and we're focused on ramping. So I thought maybe it made sense to touch on the democratized parts initially as it relates broadly to the ramping and the momentum that we have.  Scott or Rob, do you want to add on?\nRobert Lewin: Yes. Just a couple of things I'd add, Alex. I appreciate the question. As Craig mentioned, today, the products that we have, we put in this democratized category, focus on credit, real estate, private equity. And we have a number of others that we're working on across different asset classes.  In addition to those that I'd put more into kind of the '40 Act, fully democratized zone. We also have a number of our funds that we actually sell through private wealth platforms, which is another big contributor. And in the past, as I mentioned, it's been about 10% to 20% of the total money we've raised has been from that individual investor channel, broadly defined. I think what Craig mentioned is really critical. Though it is still early, we see a lot of upside here. That's why we're guiding you that we think that 10% to 20% number will move up to 30% to 50% over time, and it's an area for us that -- where we see a significant amount of growth ahead. In addition to building our own team, which we continue to expand and invest in, we are creating partnerships, to your point, with external managers. We'll have more to share with you on that front over time, but we're creating partnerships with wealth platforms around the world, in addition to building our own team.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup.\nWilliam Katz: Okay. Congrats, Scott, on promotion. Just coming back to maybe your commentary and I think embedded in part of Alex's question. But can you expand a little bit on a lot more to do like yet on perpetual capital? Is that just retail? Are there other opportunities out there to continue to scale that more annuitized business opportunity?\nScott Nuttall: Happy to, Bill, and I appreciate the kind words. I think we see it across a number of different aspects of our business. There's the institutional channel. I think there's a lot of focus lately for good reason on private wealth, but we're continuing to invest in the build-out of our institutional capabilities as well. So we've seen a 40% increase, just as an example, there and headcount focused on institutional fundraising. So I think you're going to see it institutionally where we're continuing to talk to partners about long-dated partnerships, some with recycling. So that's going to be part of the answer to your question.  Part of it, of course, will be what we just talked about in terms of private wealth in the individual investor. Part of it will be growing in insurance where we see opportunities all around the world. And then we're working on new structures and new designs where we could actually elongate our -- the duration of our capital base even further to a variety of different channels.  So a bunch of different opportunities all across the world, and I think you'll continue to hear us talk about this going forward. So the $49 billion to $205 billion is great progress, but we expect to continue to make great progress here going forward.\nWilliam Katz: Okay. And just a quick follow-up for Rob. So I appreciate the sort of the broad guidance of on pace to sort of double FRE over the next few years, but it seems like your management fees are pacing even more quickly than maybe the last set of guidance. Can you just level set where we are in terms of pacing to the previous goal? And then how -- against ongoing capital raising, how that might play through over 2022?\nRobert Lewin: Yes, sure. Bill, thanks for the question. I think, in retrospect, I think it's fair that some of the historical guidance we gave over the last 6 to 12 months is on the conservative side. But at the same time, if you look, our business has so much more momentum today than it did, even 6 or 12 months ago. And you could look at how we're performing in our different fundraises globally, all or pretty much all well ahead of expectations. The assets we have from Global Atlantic are far ahead of where we expected them to be. The momentum in our capital markets business is as good as it's ever been. And the last piece of it, less on fees, but I think also really pertinent to the discussion of growth going forward is we now have $16 billion of unrealized revenue or close to that on our balance sheet.  And so if you come back to your question around where growth can go from here, I think we should pause on the $100 billion of capital that we've raised year-to-date. If you think about it, only a very small percentage of the revenue and economics that we expect from this capital has hit our P&L so far in 2021. The vast majority of it is going to be in 2022 and beyond.  And the other neat point on the $100 billion of AUM that we've raised is that 50% of it has come from strategies that we weren't even in 5 years ago. So the ability to scale from there on that piece of the capital base, we think, is very real as well.  So maybe bringing that back full circle to where you were going and what we expect of ourselves, while our earnings base today is at a higher level than we expected 6, 12 months ago, as Scott mentioned earlier, we still have every expectation that if we execute really well going forward that we can more than double our FRE off of this higher base.  And likewise, looking at the full picture of our P&L, even off the higher distributable earnings number, the $3.50 or so that we've delivered over the LTM period, I also think we've got clear line of sight in that same period of time, the strong execution to double that to $7 plus. And so hopefully, that gives you a broader picture for how we're thinking about growth across the platform, Bill.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore.\nGlenn Schorr: One quick one. There's a transaction or 2 in the secondary space lately. It feels like a strategic need. For as great as you're doing, you can do greater. Curious on what your plans are at this point for organic versus inorganic build in that area.\nScott Nuttall: Thanks for the question, Glenn. Nothing new to report today. We continue to assess whether there's someone that we could partner with or buy all or a meaningful portion of or whether we should build our own. As we've talked about in the past, the secondary and co-invest space is adjacent to a lot of what we do. It's something we think we could be a value-added partner to somebody or build something truly distinctive. So it's not a have to do, but it is something that we continue to spend time on. Nothing new to share with you today however, but we're continuing to spend time there.\nGlenn Schorr: Okay. Maybe we could follow up on. You teased us in the past with a comment about the Asia franchise, at some point, being as big as the Americas. Maybe you could break down a little bit more in terms of retail, institutional and which asset classes might be -- what might we expect to see have more growth in the next couple of years as opposed to the someday.\nRobert Lewin: Yes. Glenn, it's Rob. Clearly, we've got a first-rate private equity franchise in Asia, a $15 billion fund, probably somewhere around close to double the size of our next biggest competitor in the region. The growth opportunity from here continues to be in private equity. We think it's still very much an under-addressed private equity alternatives market.  But really, it's the marriage between the best-in-class teams we have across 8 offices in Asia and what we do in the private equity side with the global capabilities that we're building up in areas like real estate, infrastructure, credit, growth equity, what we're doing in capital markets. We think the marriage of those 2 things with our market-leading position will create a bunch of growth going forward for us in that part of the world where we've got a real competitive advantage and think a real moat around the business franchise that we've built so far. And for our competitors to catch up requires a lot of investment.  So we feel really good about how we're situated. And we continue to believe that, over time, our Asia Pac business can be as big as our U.S. business one day.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Robert Lee with KBW.\nRobert Lee: Great. Scott, also, congrats on the promotion. Just really maybe is a little bit of a riff on Glenn's question. But as he mentioned, there's a lot of action in the secondaries market, like M&A, but you've talked about your CPS business as being a replacement for that. Could you maybe update us on that initiative and how you see that kind of progressing as maybe a replacement for secondaries or fund to funds business?\nScott Nuttall: Sure. Happy to take it, Rob, and thanks for the congrats. Yes. So CPS, and we haven't talked about it in a while, but it stands for customized portfolio solutions. So this is a team and a business that we built on the back of the observation that a number of institutional investors were trying to get exposure to private equity, in particular, but did not have a big team to get after that and wanted a bit of an outsourced solution and partner to try to build a more diversified pool of private equity exposures.  And so the team has built a business which has a combination of KKR funds and co-invest. And third party, we think best-in-class private equity partners also investing in their funds and looking at their co-investment.  And so the business has continued to perform really quite nicely. It's now about $6 billion of AUM and has been quietly a top quartile performer. And we'll continue to scale that business, and we're getting more traction with investors around the world. So it's an opportunity for upside and a real nice performer for us that we think will continue to get bigger over time, and we'll keep you posted.\nRobert Lee: Great. And then maybe as a follow-up, going to the inevitable question, I guess, on capital management. So I mean, you've got a huge amount of embedded gains on the balance sheet from your own investments, could carry businesses growing at a higher rate. Is there -- or do you think about, call it, a tipping point where, hey, we've got enough kind of cash generation that we can more than amply fulfill our capital needs and growth requirements and maybe start shifting towards somewhat greater return of capital, whether it's a little bit higher dividend payout or share buyback or something? Do you feel like that tipping point may be approaching the next couple of years?\nRobert Lewin: Yes. I'll start off, Rob, and I'm sure Scott will jump in as well. I think the most important thing to any capital allocation framework is to make sure that you're consistent. And our approach to capital allocation has always been very much ROE based. And so we're always going to start that with what's an appropriate level of capital return to our shareholders and balancing that with investment back into KKR growth, assuming that it's able to achieve compelling ROEs. So let's take those in order.  We've said that we will continue to evaluate our dividend policy on an annual basis. We'll do that in Q1 next year. But what we've said is we'd look to grow that consistently over time. We want to continue to be a buyer of KKR stock. We feel really good about our body of work here over the last 5, 6 years. We've repurchased or retired close to 80 million shares. It's almost 10% of our outstanding shares today, close to 15% of our free float. We'd look to continue to do that going forward, and we're going to look to invest back into KKR for growth.  And I do think one of the areas of core competency that we do have is to be able to move capital around to the highest ROE opportunity. And if we're not finding that inside of the KKR platform, then we'd certainly evaluate greater returns of capital to shareholders through one of the first 2 buckets. That's really how we're going to approach it. And I think probably the most important point of any here is we do this in a really aligned way. The KKR employees are, as a group, the largest shareholder in KKR. And so we -- as we think about how to allocate our capital base, obviously, the mindset there comes from a very aligned perspective.\nScott Nuttall: Yes. The only thing I would add is the balance sheet, if you really step back and look at how we -- it has allowed us to grow our fee-related earnings a lot faster, whether it's seeding new businesses. And as a reminder, 10 years ago, we were in 6 investing businesses, and now we're in 28. The balance sheet has clearly accelerated the growth of what we're trying to do in terms of the organic build.  Our capital markets business, as you know, we operate in a capital-light model, but we've used the balance sheet to be able to scale the growth of capital markets in a meaningful way and perhaps, even more powerfully, M&A. If you think about Marshall Wace and our partnership there, if you think about Global Atlantic, we've been able to use the balance sheet to really convert balance sheet earnings into fee-related earnings and TDE.  And so we view it, Rob, as a strategic weapon. So you'll continue to see us use it that way and think of it that way. And then to Rob's point, we'll continue to reassess the dividend level and buybacks and try to get the balance as right we can with the vantage point of being the largest shareholder.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Congrats, Scott. Just maybe just go back to the fundraising, obviously way ahead of schedule here compared with your Investor Day. And just wanted to get a sense of -- for 2022 as we move into that year, is it even possible for that to be as successful on a fundraising standpoint versus '21 if we ignore insurance blocks? And what would be some of the drivers given you've raised your flag -- a couple of your flagships already?\nCraig Larson: Brian, it's Craig. Why don't I start? Thanks for the question. We don't have any updated fundraising guidance for 2022, but let me try and help frame things. I think really what you're seeing in this quarter is kind of interesting in this way is what you're seeing is the continued scaling of businesses and the increased diversification across the firm.  7 or 8 years ago, if we reported one of the strongest fundraising quarters in our history, it would have meant we had a big fundraising event in private equity. And so today, we're reporting an excellent new capital raise figure. New capital raised in Q3 is the second highest quarterly figure we reported in our history, and over 90% of that is coming from strategies outside of traditional private equity. So in private markets, half the capital was raised in infrastructure and real estate, as we talked about it. We have all these new initiatives. As Rob had mentioned, 50% of the capital year-to-date being raised from areas that didn't even exist within the framework of the firm 5 years ago. In Global Atlantic, as you mentioned, again, AUM meaningfully above where we would have ever expected it would have been at the time of announcement. And when you think of huge addressable market opportunities like we've touched on with these democratized products, that's all on the come.  So we don't have an updated figure for next year, but it just continues to feel like there's real momentum, and we're really well positioned, which is exciting.\nScott Nuttall: Yes. The only thing I'd add, Brian, is, look, as Craig said, we got a lot of ways to win now. The firm is really scaling and diversifying. Last time I counted out what we have coming to market in the next 12 to 18 months, it's something like 27 different line items. So there's lots of different products in the market, and that's away from Global Atlantic.\nBrian Bedell: Yes. No. That's it. It's incredibly powerful. But maybe as we think about that march towards $4 of FRE, if you could comment on a couple of areas, in addition to your traditional ones, and that being the -- on the retail side, that moved into 30% to 50%. Do you see that as an incrementally positive growth driver to that FRE target over and above what your traditional plan is in the institutional channels?  And then I guess sort of same question on the capital markets business. I mean, that's had -- moves up and down, of course, but it's had some pretty good secular growth. And is that also a substantial component to that $4?\nScott Nuttall: I think it's any more substantial than it would be today, on the second question. And on the first question, look, I think the opportunities we see in private wealth give us that much more confidence that it's in excess of $4 in 5-or-so years. And I think the in excess of is something you should focus on, and we'll try to do better than $4. But I think retail, private wealth opportunity gives us more confidence we have an opportunity to continue to outperform expectations.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Gerry O'Hara with Jefferies.\nGerald O'Hara: Great. Seeing obviously the three block transactions in the quarter is encouraging, but perhaps you could give us just a little bit of sense on what the kind of competitive dynamics are within that insurance and annuity business from your end.\nScott Nuttall: Thanks, Gerry. It's Scott. Look, it is a competitive environment, and we see -- we have competition across everything that we do. We have a lot of smart competitors. They tend to be responsible, smart competitors, and so we've been able to pick our spots and lean in on opportunities where we think we have a clear competitive advantage. And we've been really pleased with the progress we've been able to make.  As I've mentioned in the past, one of the key reasons that we wanted to create the partnership with Global Atlantic is the strength of the management team. And they have really built really nice relationships all around the world with different counterparties, and that's allowed us to lean into these blocks. And so yes, there's been a significant flow of block activity. We expect it will continue. We expect it will be competitive, and we expect we'll continue to win our share.\nGerald O'Hara: Fair enough. And perhaps one for Rob. I know we're still kind of early days here in the fourth quarter. But if you might be able to give us any sort of update or line of sight into 4Q monetization activity, that would, as always, be appreciated.\nRobert Lewin: Yes. No problem, Gerry. You're right. We're early in the quarter, but we already have really good visibility into Q4 and into record levels, I think, of monetization activity, and we will turn into revenue. Size of now, that figure is north of $1 billion. So that's collectively across both our performance and investment income. As a reminder, this is going to be from deals that are either already closed today or have been signed up and we expect to close in Q4. I'd also note that for this quarter, for Q4, this figure also includes revenue from incentive fees that have already been booked through our hedge fund partnerships.  In terms of how that breaks down from a split perspective, so you could think about flow-through to profitability, I would say it's probably slightly weighted towards carried interest right now relative to both investment income as well as the performance income that comes from our hedge fund partnerships. If you recall, the latter has the same 10% to 20% comp load as our investment income. So hopefully, that gives you a flavor of what's ahead in Q4. But again, another strong monetization quarter for us.\nOperator: The next question is coming from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.\nBrian Mckenna: This is Brian McKenna for Devin. So just to follow up on realization activity, so you have about $5 billion of net unrealized carried interest and $7 billion of embedded gains on the balance sheet. So assuming the capital markets remain open and business trends continue to be healthy, how quickly do you think you can work through this pipeline of realizations over time?\nRobert Lewin: Yes. Brian, it's a good question, obviously. And I -- we're going to be balanced. And what you've seen so far in 2021 is while we've had record levels -- year-to-date, I believe our monetizations and our revenue from monetizations is better than any year we've had for a full year. And even through that period of time, we've still grown our embedded gains and unrealized gains in our balance sheet. I think that comes from investment performance. So we can continue to generate strong investment performance in the future, which we feel good about, especially given the portfolio construction that we have in place. we think we'll continue to be able to generate healthy levels of monetizations and keep the pipeline for future years in place.  But obviously, a lot of it comes down to execution, and it's really hard to forecast from here. But I think if you look back at our -- really 2020, even a volatile period of time in 2021, you've seen a consistent level of monetizations even as our unrealized gains and embedded gains in our balance sheet have grown.\nScott Nuttall: Yes. The only thing I would add, Brian, as you heard Rob referenced before, that, in addition to kind of having confidence, we can at least double fee-related earnings in the next 5-or-so years. We think we can do the same with distributable earnings per share. And obviously, having a line of sight that we do in terms of embedded value in both carry and balance sheet gains is part of the reason we have that confidence. But to Rob's point, we'll continue to monetize. And hopefully, we'll continue to replenish with other unrealized gains and other investments perform.\nBrian Mckenna: Great. And then just on the FRE margin, that stepped up nicely in the quarter to about 65% from 62% in the first half of 2021. So how should we think about the FRE margin moving forward? Is that 65% a good place to be?\nRobert Lewin: Brian, what we've talked about historically is probably a low 60s FRE margin. We were 61% last year. Year-to-date, even with a solid Q3, we're about 63%, so kind of in line where we thought we'd be. What we've also flagged is we intend to continue to invest across technology, distribution and marketing. And so you could see our OpEx line ticking up a bit. But the goal going forward over the next number of years is to be at a place where we're sustainably generating mid-60s types of FRE margins. But I think the guidance going forward will continue to be in that low 60% range. And hopefully, there will be periods of time where that can go up and ultimately be in a place where we're more sustainably generating those types of margins that are in the mid-60s.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Cyprys from Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprys: It's Mike Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Just wanted to follow up on the private wealth opportunity. I was just hoping you could elaborate a little bit on the investments you're making in sales, marketing, distribution, digital distribution, if you could just elaborate a little bit on that. How large is the sales team today? Where do you think that can be over the next couple of years? And how do you think about buy versus build versus rent?\nScott Nuttall: Thanks, Michael. It's Scott. I'll take that. In terms of the investment that we're making, first, the investment we're making is in headcount. So the team, kind of probably 18-plus months ago, it was probably around 10 people. It's now pushing 40. I would expect that number will likely triple or so again from here over the relatively near term. So we'll continue to build the focused private wealth team out, including marketing. That's kind of investment 1.  Investment 2 will be in all things tech and operations, around making sure that we're able to service the private wealth client in a best-in-class way. So we're continuing to make investments there. You heard Rob referenced some investments we're going to continue to make in technology. Some of that will be around the space. But those are the 2 predominant, in addition to what I talked about before, which is product development.  In terms of buy versus build versus rent, we are clearly building, and we're doing some renting as we sit here today. And we are, as part of our corporate development efforts, assessing whether there's anything that could make sense to buy. But right now, it is build and rent and create partnerships, and we'll let you know if we find anything that we think is interesting enough to move into the buy category.\nRobert Lewin: Yes. Mike, just one quick thing to add on. As we think about headcount growth in SaaS space or really across the firm, it's important to note that we would expect to be able to operate within our stated comp range on fees in the 20% to 25% range. And so even with increased heads, I wouldn't expect that to impact our margins.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. And just a follow-up, if I could, just around capital deployment. Clearly, a very strong quarter, $8 billion deployed across infrastructure and real estate. In particular, I thought stood out, that's $24 billion or so annualized pace there. Just can you talk a little bit about the actions that you're taking to increase deployment capacity within your real assets business in terms of the actions you've taken to get to this level? And as you look out over the next couple of years, where would you like to see that deployment pace and capacity be in, say, 3 or 5 years? And what are the actions you need to take in order for that to be materially higher from where it is today?\nCraig Larson: Mike, it's Craig. Why don't I start, just give you some facts around deployment? And I expect Scott will add on as it relates to investments for tomorrow. And I'm glad you asked about it. Honestly, we probably haven't talked about deployment as much detail as we should. As you note, we've continued to be really active. Year-to-date -- or in the quarter, $15 billion. Year-to-date, we're at -- we're approaching $30 billion. So when you look at that deployment figure through 9 months, that's already meaningfully above where we were in 2020, and that was a record year for us. So deployments have been really healthy.  I think a couple of thoughts on that, first, relates back to that thought of diversification. And as you noted, again, the strength we've seen in real assets with that amount in the quarter being pretty equally split between our real estate business and infrastructure. And if you contrast that with 2019 and 2020, again, this quarter, those businesses were about 60% of deployment in private markets. Combined, they were about 25% in 2019 and 2020. So as those businesses have scaled, as we've entered new asset classes like core -- and again, it's interesting when you think of core -- real estate core infrastructure, those end markets are larger in size than opportunistic.  So again, that addressable market for us has been increasing. You're seeing that in deployment. Core PE had its actually most active deployment quarter for us in the year. So while these businesses are growing and scaling, you're seeing that in terms of deployment.  I think one other point that's just interesting as it relates to private equity, we're being disciplined. So the level of activity is exceptionally high. There's a ton of flow. But really, what you've seen in the numbers is we're being disciplined, and we're drawing lines and really looking to pick our spots. So despite the overall healthy amount of deployment, year-to-date, private equity deployment is actually on pace to be below that in 2020.  And in public markets, again, the credit platform was growing materially before GA, continues to scale post GA. So that's driving a real step-up in deployment. That's both in terms of corporate origination as well as in asset-based finance.\nScott Nuttall: Yes. No. It's a great question, Mike. I mean, we do see a real opportunity to meaningfully expand these real estate and infrastructure platforms. As you know, both of those were more or less created over the course of the last 10 to 12 years. These are very large end markets and that there's a significant amount of client interest in all things real assets. If you have yield and inflation protection, which these asset classes do, you've got a real significant investor appetite right now.  There's probably 5 things I'd point to. One is we're just, regular way, scaling of the more opportunistic strategies. So if you think about it, it wasn't that long ago, we were an infrastructure, one, how that platform has scaled materially from $1 billion to -- in the teens per fund, so big opportunity as we continue to scale the opportunistic platform.  The same thing is true in real estate. You can see REPA I to REPA III, but we also have a European real estate opportunistic strategy, same thing in Asia. So real opportunity. Just keep scaling those platforms regular way on the back of performance.  Second would be what we're doing in core. We have raised meaningful capital this year for core infrastructure and for core plus real estate. Again, very large end markets. Those are performing well and scaling.  Third is going global. A lot of what we've done started in the U.S. We're now expanding to Europe and Asia, so you're going to see us have a Europe and Asia core plus real estate strategy. That's something that we'll continue to add to our suite of products as we continue to take these efforts global and real assets.  Fourth would be selling to individuals. We talk about KREST a lot, but there's various other products that we're in the process of creating and other versions of real assets democratized for the individual investor.  And then to Craig's good point, it's not just equity. There's also a big opportunity to continue to scale what we're doing in real estate credit. Global Atlantic has allowed us to meaningfully expand that business, and we see more opportunities around the world, including in Europe, where we're going to start building a real estate credit platform there. So a long way of saying we agree with you. There's a lot of growth opportunity.\nOperator: At this time, we've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back to management for closing remarks.\nCraig Larson: Rob, thank you for your help. And everybody, thank you for joining us. Please follow up with us directly with any follow-ups. Otherwise, we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thanks again.\nOperator: This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. We thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Scott Nuttall",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. Craig and Rob did a nice job walking through our numbers, which were strong again this quarter. So I'm going to spend my time on a few strategic areas of focus and give you our sense for how we're progressing.  The first is perpetual and long-dated strategic capital. As you know, we are big believers in the power of compounding in all aspects of our business, including AUM. The more capital we can attract, that is perpetual or recycles, the faster we expect our AUM will scale and compound over the long term. A year ago, perpetual and strategic capital was $49 billion, 21% of our total AUM. Today, that number is $205 billion or 45%, $49 billion to $205 billion in 1 year. So we've seen over a 4x increase in 12 months, and we are nowhere near done. We have a lot of new ideas and efforts to generate even more perpetual capital going forward.  The second big strategic focus area is insurance. As you know, Global Atlantic advance materially in this area. GA assets have grown from $75 billion a year ago to $120 billion at the end of Q3, a 60% increase. In addition, we have seen our AUM from third-party insurance clients increased from $33 billion a year ago to $48 billion today, an increase of 45%. Putting GA and third party together, our insurance AUM has grown from $108 billion pro forma for GA to $167 billion in a year or an increase of 55%. While we're pleased with the progress, keep in mind, we only closed the GA deal in February of this year and see a lot more opportunity for significant growth in insurance.  The third area of focus is private wealth. As you know, individual investors have been 10% to 20% of the capital we've raised the last few years. We believe that with the investments we're making, combined with our brand and performance, that number will ramp to 30% to 50% of the capital we raised over the next several years. We are investing in sales, marketing, data and digital talent, and we are creating more democratized products that are relevant for a wide number of individual investors. This is a big opportunity for us, and we think we're incredibly well positioned.  So long story short, the Q3 numbers are strong, but they tell only a small part of the story of what's happening at the firm. These initiatives and others give us confidence we can more than double KKR again over the next 5-or-so years, including our fee-related earnings, where we see a clear path from the $2 of FRE per share we've achieved over the last 12 months to an excess of $4 over that time frame. So while recent growth has been exciting, we see a lot more ahead. And with that, we're happy to take your questions. Happy to, Bill, and I appreciate the kind words. I think we see it across a number of different aspects of our business. There's the institutional channel. I think there's a lot of focus lately for good reason on private wealth, but we're continuing to invest in the build-out of our institutional capabilities as well. So we've seen a 40% increase, just as an example, there and headcount focused on institutional fundraising. So I think you're going to see it institutionally where we're continuing to talk to partners about long-dated partnerships, some with recycling. So that's going to be part of the answer to your question.  Part of it, of course, will be what we just talked about in terms of private wealth in the individual investor. Part of it will be growing in insurance where we see opportunities all around the world. And then we're working on new structures and new designs where we could actually elongate our -- the duration of our capital base even further to a variety of different channels.  So a bunch of different opportunities all across the world, and I think you'll continue to hear us talk about this going forward. So the $49 billion to $205 billion is great progress, but we expect to continue to make great progress here going forward. Thanks for the question, Glenn. Nothing new to report today. We continue to assess whether there's someone that we could partner with or buy all or a meaningful portion of or whether we should build our own. As we've talked about in the past, the secondary and co-invest space is adjacent to a lot of what we do. It's something we think we could be a value-added partner to somebody or build something truly distinctive. So it's not a have to do, but it is something that we continue to spend time on. Nothing new to share with you today however, but we're continuing to spend time there. Sure. Happy to take it, Rob, and thanks for the congrats. Yes. So CPS, and we haven't talked about it in a while, but it stands for customized portfolio solutions. So this is a team and a business that we built on the back of the observation that a number of institutional investors were trying to get exposure to private equity, in particular, but did not have a big team to get after that and wanted a bit of an outsourced solution and partner to try to build a more diversified pool of private equity exposures.  And so the team has built a business which has a combination of KKR funds and co-invest. And third party, we think best-in-class private equity partners also investing in their funds and looking at their co-investment.  And so the business has continued to perform really quite nicely. It's now about $6 billion of AUM and has been quietly a top quartile performer. And we'll continue to scale that business, and we're getting more traction with investors around the world. So it's an opportunity for upside and a real nice performer for us that we think will continue to get bigger over time, and we'll keep you posted. Yes. The only thing I would add is the balance sheet, if you really step back and look at how we -- it has allowed us to grow our fee-related earnings a lot faster, whether it's seeding new businesses. And as a reminder, 10 years ago, we were in 6 investing businesses, and now we're in 28. The balance sheet has clearly accelerated the growth of what we're trying to do in terms of the organic build.  Our capital markets business, as you know, we operate in a capital-light model, but we've used the balance sheet to be able to scale the growth of capital markets in a meaningful way and perhaps, even more powerfully, M&A. If you think about Marshall Wace and our partnership there, if you think about Global Atlantic, we've been able to use the balance sheet to really convert balance sheet earnings into fee-related earnings and TDE.  And so we view it, Rob, as a strategic weapon. So you'll continue to see us use it that way and think of it that way. And then to Rob's point, we'll continue to reassess the dividend level and buybacks and try to get the balance as right we can with the vantage point of being the largest shareholder. Yes. The only thing I'd add, Brian, is, look, as Craig said, we got a lot of ways to win now. The firm is really scaling and diversifying. Last time I counted out what we have coming to market in the next 12 to 18 months, it's something like 27 different line items. So there's lots of different products in the market, and that's away from Global Atlantic. I think it's any more substantial than it would be today, on the second question. And on the first question, look, I think the opportunities we see in private wealth give us that much more confidence that it's in excess of $4 in 5-or-so years. And I think the in excess of is something you should focus on, and we'll try to do better than $4. But I think retail, private wealth opportunity gives us more confidence we have an opportunity to continue to outperform expectations. Thanks, Gerry. It's Scott. Look, it is a competitive environment, and we see -- we have competition across everything that we do. We have a lot of smart competitors. They tend to be responsible, smart competitors, and so we've been able to pick our spots and lean in on opportunities where we think we have a clear competitive advantage. And we've been really pleased with the progress we've been able to make.  As I've mentioned in the past, one of the key reasons that we wanted to create the partnership with Global Atlantic is the strength of the management team. And they have really built really nice relationships all around the world with different counterparties, and that's allowed us to lean into these blocks. And so yes, there's been a significant flow of block activity. We expect it will continue. We expect it will be competitive, and we expect we'll continue to win our share. Yes. The only thing I would add, Brian, as you heard Rob referenced before, that, in addition to kind of having confidence, we can at least double fee-related earnings in the next 5-or-so years. We think we can do the same with distributable earnings per share. And obviously, having a line of sight that we do in terms of embedded value in both carry and balance sheet gains is part of the reason we have that confidence. But to Rob's point, we'll continue to monetize. And hopefully, we'll continue to replenish with other unrealized gains and other investments perform. Thanks, Michael. It's Scott. I'll take that. In terms of the investment that we're making, first, the investment we're making is in headcount. So the team, kind of probably 18-plus months ago, it was probably around 10 people. It's now pushing 40. I would expect that number will likely triple or so again from here over the relatively near term. So we'll continue to build the focused private wealth team out, including marketing. That's kind of investment 1.  Investment 2 will be in all things tech and operations, around making sure that we're able to service the private wealth client in a best-in-class way. So we're continuing to make investments there. You heard Rob referenced some investments we're going to continue to make in technology. Some of that will be around the space. But those are the 2 predominant, in addition to what I talked about before, which is product development.  In terms of buy versus build versus rent, we are clearly building, and we're doing some renting as we sit here today. And we are, as part of our corporate development efforts, assessing whether there's anything that could make sense to buy. But right now, it is build and rent and create partnerships, and we'll let you know if we find anything that we think is interesting enough to move into the buy category. Yes. No. It's a great question, Mike. I mean, we do see a real opportunity to meaningfully expand these real estate and infrastructure platforms. As you know, both of those were more or less created over the course of the last 10 to 12 years. These are very large end markets and that there's a significant amount of client interest in all things real assets. If you have yield and inflation protection, which these asset classes do, you've got a real significant investor appetite right now.  There's probably 5 things I'd point to. One is we're just, regular way, scaling of the more opportunistic strategies. So if you think about it, it wasn't that long ago, we were an infrastructure, one, how that platform has scaled materially from $1 billion to -- in the teens per fund, so big opportunity as we continue to scale the opportunistic platform.  The same thing is true in real estate. You can see REPA I to REPA III, but we also have a European real estate opportunistic strategy, same thing in Asia. So real opportunity. Just keep scaling those platforms regular way on the back of performance.  Second would be what we're doing in core. We have raised meaningful capital this year for core infrastructure and for core plus real estate. Again, very large end markets. Those are performing well and scaling.  Third is going global. A lot of what we've done started in the U.S. We're now expanding to Europe and Asia, so you're going to see us have a Europe and Asia core plus real estate strategy. That's something that we'll continue to add to our suite of products as we continue to take these efforts global and real assets.  Fourth would be selling to individuals. We talk about KREST a lot, but there's various other products that we're in the process of creating and other versions of real assets democratized for the individual investor.  And then to Craig's good point, it's not just equity. There's also a big opportunity to continue to scale what we're doing in real estate credit. Global Atlantic has allowed us to meaningfully expand that business, and we see more opportunities around the world, including in Europe, where we're going to start building a real estate credit platform there. So a long way of saying we agree with you. There's a lot of growth opportunity."

            "name": "Robert Lewin",
            "content": "Thanks a lot, Craig. Just as we continue to see strength in the fundraising and deployment front, our funds continue to generate really strong relative investment performance. Our flagship private equity funds increased by 11% in the quarter and 79% over the LTM period, while the entire PE portfolio appreciated 9% and 52%, respectively.  In real assets, our opportunistic real estate state funds increased by 14% in the quarter and 29% over the LTM. Infrastructure continues to perform really well, up 4% in the quarter and 19% over the last 12 months. And on the public markets side, our leverage and alternative credit funds increased by 1% and 2% in the quarter, respectively, with continued performance over the LTM, up 11% and 26%.  The combination of strong investment performance, as well as the capital raising that Craig just went through, has yielded a really robust acceleration of our AUM, which now totals $459 billion, and our fee-paying AUM is $349 billion. That's up 7% and 9%, respectively, versus just last quarter. When comparing our AUM and fee paying AUM relative to this time last year, they're both up, close to 100%. And importantly, much of this AUM is now either perpetual capital or in long-dated partnerships. Just 9 months ago, this number was $55 billion. It's now $205 billion out of our almost $460 billion of AUM. You can see this growth and the transformational change in the composition of our AUM on Page 16 of the earnings release.  And finally, as it relates to our capital base, we currently have $38 billion of committed capital that comes online and becomes fee paying at a weighted average rate of over 100 basis points when the capital is either invested or enters its investment period.  Now turning to our quarterly P&L. Our management fees increased over 50% this quarter versus the same time last year. As we signaled on last quarter's call, management fee growth was driven by a combination of new capital raised and various newer funds hitting their run rate. Net transaction monitoring fees were primarily driven by our capital markets franchise, which saw a continued strength this quarter and were up 24% versus the same quarter in 2020. And over the last 12 months, our capital markets transaction fees have totaled $720 million, which is 42% higher than the average during the 2018 to 2020 time period.  The growth in the platform is stemming from many of the expansion areas that we touched on at our April Investor Day, including our build-out of real asset, core PE and third-party coverage, which have all generated meaningful market share gains. We remain really constructive around the future growth of this business. This all brings us to fee-related earnings of $530 million for the quarter, which is up 63% versus Q3 2020. On a per-share basis, our FRE is $2.02 over the last 12 months.  Moving on to realizations. Realized performance income came in at $433 million for the quarter driven by exits in Bountiful, Ingersoll-Rand and Academy. Realized investment income totaled $448 million for the quarter driven by additional exits in Mr. Cooper and Flutter.  Even with these very strong monetization figures, we have still seen healthy gains in both our unrealized carried interest and the embedded gains from our balance sheet investments. Gross unrealized carried interest increased to $8.5 billion, while our embedded gains on investments increased to $7.1 billion. That's almost $16 billion of embedded revenue, which has grown over 70% since the start of the year, and that's all happened while we've been generating record levels of realizations.  Coming back to our P&L. Our asset management operating earnings were a bit north of $1 billion for the quarter, which is up 80% from the same quarter last year. And our insurance segment operating earnings totaled $115 million, largely driven by strong core operating performance at Global Atlantic, together with the sale of 2 strategic investments that helped bolster net investment income.  In total, our after-tax distributable earnings per share came in at $1.05 for the quarter and $3.47 for the LTM period. Both numbers are up 100% and 79%, respectively, versus the prior period.  Turning to our balance sheet. Book value per share came in at $28.06, which was up 38% year-over-year, driven primarily by strong investment performance. It's worth noting that our result for this quarter includes an $0.80 increase to our deferred tax liability associated with the corporate reorganization that we announced last month and that we expect to close next year.  In summary, we are really doing all the things that matter most for our business to perform at a high level and to ensure that we're set up well for the future. We keep coming back to these 5 things and really do believe we are optimizing for outcomes across the board. Number one, we are sourcing unique investment opportunities in which to put our capital to work. Our year-to-date deployment is up 2.5x. Our investment performance has been exceptionally strong, both on an absolute basis and relative to many of our peers. Because of this performance, our monetization opportunities have been abundant, and we have delivered substantial distributions to our clients and record levels of monetization for our shareholders. And these first 3 points all enable us to have the fundraising successes we have achieved. $100-plus billion of year-to-date flows is the proof point, and this sets us up incredibly well for the future.  And finally, we have conviction that our business model allows us to generate greater financial outcomes. And I think you're clearly seeing that flow through our P&L.  We have also talked on these calls and on Investor Days about inflection points. Our overall business has seen a fundamental shift, an inflection point, in its operating level. Beyond our distributable earnings being up approximately 2x since this time last year, all of our forward indicators are in the best shape they've ever been in. AUM is up 2x. Year-to-date fundraising is up 3x, and the embedded gains in our balance sheet have increased by approximately 300% in just the last year. We really couldn't be any more excited about the future.  And with that, let me turn it over to Scott. Yes. Just a couple of things I'd add, Alex. I appreciate the question. As Craig mentioned, today, the products that we have, we put in this democratized category, focus on credit, real estate, private equity. And we have a number of others that we're working on across different asset classes.  In addition to those that I'd put more into kind of the '40 Act, fully democratized zone. We also have a number of our funds that we actually sell through private wealth platforms, which is another big contributor. And in the past, as I mentioned, it's been about 10% to 20% of the total money we've raised has been from that individual investor channel, broadly defined. I think what Craig mentioned is really critical. Though it is still early, we see a lot of upside here. That's why we're guiding you that we think that 10% to 20% number will move up to 30% to 50% over time, and it's an area for us that -- where we see a significant amount of growth ahead. In addition to building our own team, which we continue to expand and invest in, we are creating partnerships, to your point, with external managers. We'll have more to share with you on that front over time, but we're creating partnerships with wealth platforms around the world, in addition to building our own team. Yes, sure. Bill, thanks for the question. I think, in retrospect, I think it's fair that some of the historical guidance we gave over the last 6 to 12 months is on the conservative side. But at the same time, if you look, our business has so much more momentum today than it did, even 6 or 12 months ago. And you could look at how we're performing in our different fundraises globally, all or pretty much all well ahead of expectations. The assets we have from Global Atlantic are far ahead of where we expected them to be. The momentum in our capital markets business is as good as it's ever been. And the last piece of it, less on fees, but I think also really pertinent to the discussion of growth going forward is we now have $16 billion of unrealized revenue or close to that on our balance sheet.  And so if you come back to your question around where growth can go from here, I think we should pause on the $100 billion of capital that we've raised year-to-date. If you think about it, only a very small percentage of the revenue and economics that we expect from this capital has hit our P&L so far in 2021. The vast majority of it is going to be in 2022 and beyond.  And the other neat point on the $100 billion of AUM that we've raised is that 50% of it has come from strategies that we weren't even in 5 years ago. So the ability to scale from there on that piece of the capital base, we think, is very real as well.  So maybe bringing that back full circle to where you were going and what we expect of ourselves, while our earnings base today is at a higher level than we expected 6, 12 months ago, as Scott mentioned earlier, we still have every expectation that if we execute really well going forward that we can more than double our FRE off of this higher base.  And likewise, looking at the full picture of our P&L, even off the higher distributable earnings number, the $3.50 or so that we've delivered over the LTM period, I also think we've got clear line of sight in that same period of time, the strong execution to double that to $7 plus. And so hopefully, that gives you a broader picture for how we're thinking about growth across the platform, Bill. Yes. Glenn, it's Rob. Clearly, we've got a first-rate private equity franchise in Asia, a $15 billion fund, probably somewhere around close to double the size of our next biggest competitor in the region. The growth opportunity from here continues to be in private equity. We think it's still very much an under-addressed private equity alternatives market.  But really, it's the marriage between the best-in-class teams we have across 8 offices in Asia and what we do in the private equity side with the global capabilities that we're building up in areas like real estate, infrastructure, credit, growth equity, what we're doing in capital markets. We think the marriage of those 2 things with our market-leading position will create a bunch of growth going forward for us in that part of the world where we've got a real competitive advantage and think a real moat around the business franchise that we've built so far. And for our competitors to catch up requires a lot of investment.  So we feel really good about how we're situated. And we continue to believe that, over time, our Asia Pac business can be as big as our U.S. business one day. Yes. I'll start off, Rob, and I'm sure Scott will jump in as well. I think the most important thing to any capital allocation framework is to make sure that you're consistent. And our approach to capital allocation has always been very much ROE based. And so we're always going to start that with what's an appropriate level of capital return to our shareholders and balancing that with investment back into KKR growth, assuming that it's able to achieve compelling ROEs. So let's take those in order.  We've said that we will continue to evaluate our dividend policy on an annual basis. We'll do that in Q1 next year. But what we've said is we'd look to grow that consistently over time. We want to continue to be a buyer of KKR stock. We feel really good about our body of work here over the last 5, 6 years. We've repurchased or retired close to 80 million shares. It's almost 10% of our outstanding shares today, close to 15% of our free float. We'd look to continue to do that going forward, and we're going to look to invest back into KKR for growth.  And I do think one of the areas of core competency that we do have is to be able to move capital around to the highest ROE opportunity. And if we're not finding that inside of the KKR platform, then we'd certainly evaluate greater returns of capital to shareholders through one of the first 2 buckets. That's really how we're going to approach it. And I think probably the most important point of any here is we do this in a really aligned way. The KKR employees are, as a group, the largest shareholder in KKR. And so we -- as we think about how to allocate our capital base, obviously, the mindset there comes from a very aligned perspective. Yes. No problem, Gerry. You're right. We're early in the quarter, but we already have really good visibility into Q4 and into record levels, I think, of monetization activity, and we will turn into revenue. Size of now, that figure is north of $1 billion. So that's collectively across both our performance and investment income. As a reminder, this is going to be from deals that are either already closed today or have been signed up and we expect to close in Q4. I'd also note that for this quarter, for Q4, this figure also includes revenue from incentive fees that have already been booked through our hedge fund partnerships.  In terms of how that breaks down from a split perspective, so you could think about flow-through to profitability, I would say it's probably slightly weighted towards carried interest right now relative to both investment income as well as the performance income that comes from our hedge fund partnerships. If you recall, the latter has the same 10% to 20% comp load as our investment income. So hopefully, that gives you a flavor of what's ahead in Q4. But again, another strong monetization quarter for us. Yes. Brian, it's a good question, obviously. And I -- we're going to be balanced. And what you've seen so far in 2021 is while we've had record levels -- year-to-date, I believe our monetizations and our revenue from monetizations is better than any year we've had for a full year. And even through that period of time, we've still grown our embedded gains and unrealized gains in our balance sheet. I think that comes from investment performance. So we can continue to generate strong investment performance in the future, which we feel good about, especially given the portfolio construction that we have in place. we think we'll continue to be able to generate healthy levels of monetizations and keep the pipeline for future years in place.  But obviously, a lot of it comes down to execution, and it's really hard to forecast from here. But I think if you look back at our -- really 2020, even a volatile period of time in 2021, you've seen a consistent level of monetizations even as our unrealized gains and embedded gains in our balance sheet have grown. Brian, what we've talked about historically is probably a low 60s FRE margin. We were 61% last year. Year-to-date, even with a solid Q3, we're about 63%, so kind of in line where we thought we'd be. What we've also flagged is we intend to continue to invest across technology, distribution and marketing. And so you could see our OpEx line ticking up a bit. But the goal going forward over the next number of years is to be at a place where we're sustainably generating mid-60s types of FRE margins. But I think the guidance going forward will continue to be in that low 60% range. And hopefully, there will be periods of time where that can go up and ultimately be in a place where we're more sustainably generating those types of margins that are in the mid-60s. Yes. Mike, just one quick thing to add on. As we think about headcount growth in SaaS space or really across the firm, it's important to note that we would expect to be able to operate within our stated comp range on fees in the 20% to 25% range. And so even with increased heads, I wouldn't expect that to impact our margins."

        "content": "Craig Larson: Good morning, everyone and welcome to our Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. I\u2019m joined this morning by Scott Nuttall, our Co-President and Co-COO; and by Rob Lewin, our CFO. We would like to remind everyone that we\u2019ll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP fingers in our press release, which is available on the Investor Center section at kkr.com. The call will contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to our earnings release as well as our SEC filings for cautionary factors related to these statements. Turning to our results. This quarter really was an exceptional quarter with record fundraising, deployment and monetization activity alongside continued strong investment performance. Fee-related earnings per share, as well as after tax distributable earnings per share were both record quarterly figures for us coming in at $0.53 and $1.05 respectively. Management fees increased over 40% year-over-year to $480 million, helping drive the 68% increase you see in fee-related earnings. And our monetization activities drove the after-tax DE figure, which is 2.5x the number we reported in the second quarter of last year. Our assets under management are now $429 billion, up over 90% from one year ago and up 17% just since last quarter. This reflects both record fundraising in the quarter as well as strong portfolio appreciation. And our book value per share, which is mark-to-market at every quarter is now $27.03. Net accrued carry on the balance sheet increased 13% since March 31, strong growth even after all of Q2\u2019s realization activity and net cash and investments totaled $17 per share compared to $12 one year ago. So in terms of today\u2019s call, I will kick things off with an overview of our fundraising activity, before turning things over to Rob, to walk through this quarter\u2019s results. And Scott will provide a few closing remarks before we head into Q&A. So turning to fundraising. We had an exceptionally strong quarter with $59 billion of new capital raised on an organic basis. To help put this into perspective, this compares to $44 billion of new capital raised for all of 2020, which itself was a record year for KKR. Differentiated investment performance on behalf of our limited partners, continued scaling across our businesses and creativity and innovation all contributed to the fundraising results you\u2019re seeing, which exceeded our expectations. A few highlights. First, we held initial closes across the next vintages of our North America Private Equity, Global Infrastructure and Core Private Equity strategies raising over $40 billion collectively in the quarter. Let me give a few more details here. With the $14.3 billion first close North America XIII is already larger than its predecessor and together with our Asia and Europe Private Equity funds, total committed capital across our three active PE funds on a global basis now exceeds $35 billion. In Infra, with just the first close already totaling $14.2 billion, Infrastructure IV is almost twice the size of its predecessor fund and together with the success we\u2019ve had in Asia Infra and Core Infra over the last 12 months, total AUM across the infrastructure platform now stands at $38 billion and that\u2019s $38 billion compares to $14.5 billion a year ago. And in terms of Core Private Equity, we held the first close on our most recent flagship at $12 billion, including $8 billion of third-party capital. AUM in Core Private Equity is now $28 billion and that $28 billion compares to $12 billion a year ago. The second fundraising highlight is the continued progress we\u2019ve seen in perpetual capital with activity in this quarter across infrastructure, real estate as well as credit. This quarter, we raised an incremental $5 billion in our open-ended core infrastructure strategy, bringing AUM here to $7 billion. We launched KREST, a 40 Act vehicle with re-taxation that\u2019s focused on individuals investors. In credit, our two publicly-traded BDCs, FSK and FSKR completed their merger to form one of the two largest BDC platforms with $16 billion of AUM. And in July, Global Atlantic announced two reinsurance block transactions. We expect these two transactions to add approximately $10.5 billion of perpetual AUM in the third quarter and the pipeline here continues to be strong. Perpetual capital is now 30% of AUM an inclusive of long dated strategic partnerships and that includes a new multi-asset class partnership we closed this quarter that figure is 43%. And remember, we have $21 billion of cash and investments on our balance sheet. The third fundraising highlight is our real estate platforms continued scaling. Focusing first on our opportunistic funds. We held a final close at REPE II our second European fund in the quarter. At $2.1 billion REPE II was 3 times the size of REPE I and with continued fundraising at our third America\u2019s fund REPA III is now at $3 billion, more than 50% larger than REPA II and we have yet to hold a final close. With these closes, we are now a clear top five opportunistic real estate manager when you aggregate our three regional funds. Looking at the real estate platform more broadly. We now have 10 strategies focused across equity and credit on a global basis in a variety of different fund structures, targeting both institutional and retail clients. Real estate AUM in total is now $32 billion, and that $32 billion compares to $11 billion 12 months ago with tremendous room for continued growth. And finally, as you think about your models of future management fees, we now have $42 billion of committed capital with a weighted average management fee rate of just over 100 basis points that becomes payable when the capital is invested or enters its investment period. Last quarter, that amount was a little over $20 billion. So all in all, we had an excellent quarter and importantly, as we look forward over the next 12 months, we continue to have a robust fundraising pipeline across strategies as well as across geographies. So with that, let me turn it over to Rob.\nRob Lewin: Thanks a lot, Craig. I\u2019ll start off with our segment financial results for the quarter. Management fees came in at $480 million that\u2019s up 9% from Q1 and up over 40% from this time last year. The investment periods for America\u2019s VIII and in Infra IV both commenced in the quarter. So you saw partial quarters impact from these funds. Health Care Growth II and European real estate were also additive to management fees in the quarter. Our capital markets business had an excellent quarter with $219 million in fees. Transaction activity here was really diversified. We actually only had one fee event that was larger than $20 million and 50% of our revenues came from activity outside of the U.S. It was also a strong quarter for our third-party capital markets business with $61 million of revenues. We continue to get really good traction in this part of our business. Fee-related compensation came in at $170 million, a 22.5% compensation ratio. And our other operating expenses were $115 million modestly elevated with almost $20 million of placement fees recognized this quarter, given all of our fundraising activities. All of this brings us to record fee-related earnings of $470 million or $0.53 per share for the quarter. That is up 68% year-over-year, and also represents a 62% margin. Turning to realizations, carried interest came in at just over $600 million, while realized investment income was approximately $370 million, bringing total realization activity to just under $1 billion for the quarter. Realization spent multiple funds, product and geographies. The diversification of our model really contributes to this broad base performance. In terms of our expenses, realized performance comp was $413 million and realized investment comp was $55 million. And on a year-to-date basis, our total compensation margin within our asset management segment, including equity-based comp is currently 36%. Moving onto our insurance segment, this quarter was the first full quarter of operating earnings from Global Atlantic, which totaled $128 million largely driven by strong core operating performance, as well as the sale of a strategic equity investment that helped bolster net investment income by $47 million. ROE for the quarter was 17% or 14% excluding this variable investment income. Putting it all together, our after-tax distributable earnings came in at $926 million or $1.05 per share. On a year-to-date basis, our after-tax DE is $1.80 per share. These results are up 143% and 98% from the same time last year, really highlighting the momentum that we are seeing across the firm today. Our book value per share came in at $27.03 this quarter. The embedded gains in our balance sheet are currently $6.6 billion, as of June 30, which is up approximately $1 billion from Q1 and up over $5 billion from the same point last year, despite our high levels of realization activity over the corresponding periods. And our net cash and investments per share increased 12% from March 31 to $17 per share. Turning to our investment performance, which continues to be a real differentiator for us. We saw strong results again this quarter. Our PE portfolio appreciated 9% while our mature flagships appreciated 13%. Real estate continued to show strength increasing by 10% for the quarter. Our infrastructure business was relatively flat for the quarter, but continues to perform well overall up 21% over the last 12 months. And our credit funds are similarly performing well. Leveraged credit and alternative credit were up 2% and 6% in the quarter, respectively. Shifting to deployment, we had an extremely active quarter with total capital invested of approximately $19 billion. In private markets, deployment was diversified with $7 billion invested quite equally across private equity, infrastructure and real estate. With the remaining billion in growth and core strategies, and in public markets, we deployed over $10 billion across our private credit, dislocation and direct lending strategies. Despite this record level of deployment, dry powder now stands at $112 billion, which is up 63% from last quarter. And before I hand it off to Scott, I wanted to spend just a minute on our fundraising in Q2. While Craig mentioned that this is a record quarter for us, I think just as important is the quality of the capital that we raised. To give you a few stats, 98% of the capital we raised in Q2 has a contractual life of over eight years. Once turned on the fee paying capital is a blended fee rate of just under 100 basis points. And finally, 88% of the capital is either carry or an incentive fee eligible. So what we have accomplished over the last few months is going to have a very meaningful impact on our financial results for several years to come. And with that, let me hand it off to Scott.\nScott Nuttall: Thank you, Rob, and thank you everyone for joining our call. As Rob and Craig just explained, we had an exceptional quarter. Investment performance and capital raising are at record levels and broad based across strategies and geographies. Capital markets had second best quarter ever with significant activity across KKR and third-party business. On the insurance front, the Global Atlantic integration is proceeding well. And we continue to win new blocks alongside organic growth. And on top of all of this, we continue to launch new efforts and expand our product offerings, including in the retail market, providing even greater growth opportunities down the road. This quarter shows in outcomes of what we discussed at our April Investor Day. We are at an inflection point in a number of our businesses and see multiple ways for the firm to continue to grow AUM, revenues and profits. Let me highlight two examples from this quarter. First, we raised $8 billion of third-party capital for core PE, bringing AUM in that strategy to $28 billion. As a reminder, this business was created less than five years ago. And second, we\u2019ve raised $7 billion for core infrastructure, a strategy that was launched less than a year ago. We are off to a great start here and on our way to being a market leader in this large and growing space. These are just two examples of how we are innovating and creating adjacent strategies to further scale our businesses in a highly efficient fashion. So there\u2019s a lot of good to talk about this quarter. Within all the good, we are particularly proud of our investment performance. Our flagship private equity funds are up 86% over the last 12 months. Real assets are up 21%, and alternative credit is up 30%. The combination of this broad-based and strong investment performance, a growing client base across channels and multiple maturing businesses, plus the launching of new strategies and raising more permanent capital and Global Atlantic and capital markets scaling significantly is incredibly powerful. You saw this power in our Q2 results. The firm is executing at a high level and we have a lot of road ahead of us. With that, we\u2019re happy to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nAlex Blostein: Great. Good morning. Thanks everybody for taking the question. So maybe starting with a bit of an obvious of fundraising and a management fee question here, clearly very impressive start to the fundraising cycle, as you mentioned with $59 billion in the second quarter, and really, I guess more than halfway to your 2021-2022 investor day targets. So it\u2019s helping with so much momentum in the business. Can you give us an update on how much larger you expect the flagship fundraisers to be relative to the first closed figures that you mentioned and how should we ultimately think about the $100 billion plus target from here and really maybe trying to breakdown the plus a little bit more. Thanks.\nRob Lewin: Good morning, Alex. It\u2019s Rob. Thanks for the question. We can get into fundraising sides doing private placement rules, but let me just spend a minute on your question as it relates to how we\u2019re thinking about fundraising. Maybe take a step back, and as a reminder, in February of this past year, we had introduced FRE per share guidance. We set at the time that we saw a clear path to comfortably exceeding $2 per share of FRE next year. Now at our Investor Day in April, you referenced $100 billion figure. We thought it would be helpful for our investors to understand some of the building blocks behind that FRE growth. So we noted that we expected to raise north of $100 billion of capital over the next couple of years. Part of the reason why we decided to give that statistic was that 2020 and itself was a record fundraising year at $44 billion. And so what we wanted to ensure people took away is that we didn\u2019t think that that was a peak result for us. As it relates to this quarter, the fundraising that we announced exceeded our expectations and what we saw this quarter was more than just the pulling forward. I think a fundraising I expect in a future quarters, across several strategies, we really have exceeded the expectations that we set for ourselves at the beginning of the year. So I think it is fair to say that we feel a lot better, a better outlook for new capital raised over the next couple of years. And that will be certainly north of that $100 billion plus number that we put out there a couple of months ago. And I also think it\u2019s fair to say that we feel even better, but achieving or exceeding the FRE targets that we put out at the beginning of this year, given all of the momentum that we have across our business today.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi, thanks very much. I\u2019m curious with all the growth across both core PE and core infra that you just noted. I wonder what you could tell us about the LP base and how much overlap there is with your opportunistic funds, meaning are the same clients that buy into the opportunistic funds buying into core PE or is this an expanding client base?\nCraig Larson: Hey Glenn, it\u2019s Craig, why don\u2019t I start on that? And I think you\u2019re right. It is interesting on the topic of core more broadly. When you look at core PE, core infra, core real estate, we now have around $37 billion of AUM across these strategies, and we\u2019re seeing real interests, longer dated, lower risk reward profile compared to opportunistic and importantly, those that have a yield that\u2019s attached. So we think the end markets are massive, really are for these core strategies, huge opportunity for us, really pleased with the first steps that you\u2019ve seen. I think in terms of those first steps, we have seen the bigger investors wide say sovereign wealth funds, pension plans, insurance companies. They\u2019ve been particularly active as the long dated nature of the investments in these strategies is in line with their long dated liabilities. And I think importantly, on the last part of your question, they view these strategies as a complement to the regular way opportunistic strategies and not in lieu of these strategies. And I think in the long-term or I should not even say, long-term look, you should expect us to explore the best ways for us to package and bring these types of products also to the retail market. As again, the end markets here are massive.\nScott Nuttall: I think, the only thing I\u2019d add, it\u2019s Scott, is if you look at by dollars into your question, there is not that much overlap between core and our opportunistic vehicles, there\u2019s some, but we\u2019re finding that these strategies are allowing us to expand our investor base.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of William Katz with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nWilliam Katz: Okay. Thank you very much. Yes, so I\u2019ll try to squeeze a two-part question in, so I\u2019m sorry to cheat the rules a little bit. First, just sort of tying back to the FRE discussion? You\u2019ve also sort of laid out that you felt like you could get the $4 to $5 of DE somewhere between 2023 and 2024. Obviously, if you analyze this quarter, you\u2019re already there. So just sort of question, how to think about that from here. And then secondly, a broader question for you, it seems like there is a very fast land grab going on in the retail channel. You seem to have terrific momentum. Is there any risk of or opportunity here where we\u2019re scale will win out quicker, such that if I\u2019m a retail distributor they may only be willing to work with five or 10 players, including KKR and so the branded players are wondering how the dialogues going on that score. Thank you.\nRob Lewin: Hey Bill, it\u2019s Rob, I\u2019ll take the first part of the question around those the guidance that we put out a couple of months ago. So we don\u2019t have any updated guidance for this call, and obviously we\u2019ll consider providing updated guidance in the future, but not as for today, I would say that I think it\u2019s very fair to acknowledge that we are ahead of where we thought we would be. We are well ahead of expectation across most of our fundraising activity. The assets that we manage on behalf of both Atlantic are ahead of expectations. The momentum in our capital markets business is really good right now, maybe as good as it\u2019s ever been. And we\u2019ve got a lot of momentum across our performance which has generated a lot of embedded gains that sit across our carried interest in our balance sheet. And so we feel really good about the potential to drive meaningful additional revenue growth from here, as well as profitability growth. The one other thing, I would say out Bill, which is tangential, I suppose to your question that we often get is where we are from modernization perspective in Q3. We already have really good visibility here into meaningful revenue and monetization activity. As of right now, we have line of sight of approximately $650 plus million of performance in investment income. As a reminder, this is from deals that are already closed or opened signed up. And we expect to close in the third quarter. In terms of the FRE is important from a compensation perspective, probably around 50% carry right now, and 50% weighted towards investment income. The last thing I\u2019d say here is that I\u2019d underscore that all of these are really approximations at this stage. But this is our best view right now from all the identified deal activity we expect to close in the upcoming quarter.\nScott Nuttall: And Bill, the second part of your question on the retail channel. But we\u2019re really encouraged. We\u2019ve been investing aggressively in that space and we\u2019ve doubled the size of the team in the last 12 months. And we\u2019re continuing to invest in that build-out. Part of the reason we\u2019re encouraged is even as we\u2019re doing that, build out in the U.S., we\u2019re also investing to build out Europe and Asia, and we\u2019re seeing significant engagement across private wealth and retail. We\u2019re already \u2013 it\u2019s kind of mid-teens percentage of our fundraising coming from that channel. So as an example, in the second quarter, about 14% of the money we raised was actually from retail and we don\u2019t think we\u2019re anywhere near our potential yet. So there\u2019s a lot of opportunity ahead of us. In terms of the question about land grab, we were finding that we haven\u2019t engaged a set of partners as we continue to build out a distribution in this space. We\u2019re already on a number of platforms, adding products to those, and then developing new relationships all around the world. So we haven\u2019t run into any resistance. If anything we\u2019re finding is significant and growing interest in all things alternatives and a lot of interest in the registered funds in particular.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Lee: Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I\u2019m just curious, with fundraising going so well ahead of target and fund size is increasing substantially, maybe even more than you originally anticipated, how is this changing your commitments to the funds? I mean, are you reducing meaningfully how much you\u2019re committing in order to maintain capacity for third-party investors? I mean, how has this kind of shaping how you think of your own capital commitments?\nScott Nuttall: We\u2019re obviously very meaningful investors in our funds. We liked that we liked that positioning on our balance sheet, but when you look at our balance sheet capital relative to our fund capital. It\u2019s a fairly small percentage. And so it really doesn\u2019t need it to capacity and it hasn\u2019t impacted in material way, how we thought about committing capital to our strategies from, it\u2019s a good question, but that is \u2013 that\u2019s, we do separate out those two things.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Please proceed with your question.\nPatrick Davitt: Hey guys. Good morning. So you mentioned the capital markets didn\u2019t really have any of that the chunky kind of numbers where you could see [indiscernible] a little over 200 million a quarter. So if we assume, deal activity remains this, I think you do have a couple of those chunky ones coming through in the second half that this kind of $200 million pluses is kind of a pretty good run rate, assuming activity levels stay this high.\nRob Lewin: Hey, Patrick, it\u2019s Rob. So the way we think about our capital markets business really isn\u2019t quarter-to-quarter. I think you\u2019ve heard from us quite a bit, especially more recently that we see a lot of growth in that business, both secularly and then ability for us to be able to take market share on a global basis, we really think about that from an annual perspective and over a multi-year period of time, but I think as you look at the first half of 2021, roughly $330 million of fees, I think are LTM is about $680 million in our capital markets business. With a healthy amount of deal activity around the world, we think those are the types of numbers that hopefully should be achievable for us. And also the debt base, our expectation is over the next number of years is we should really be able to scale that business going forward.\nOperator: Our next question come from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Kotowski: Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. You flagged the north \u2013 the three funds North America XIII, Global Infra IV, and, and healthcare 2% as having been turned on in the quarter. And I wonder if you could talk about how much of an impact that had on base management fees? And I guess I\u2019m also the second part of it is a little \u2013 I\u2019m surprised that you would have turned the funds on so early in that like Americas XII and infra three both still have around like $4 billion of uncalled commitments in them. So I wonder if you can flesh all those things out a bit.\nRob Lewin: Yes. Chris, it\u2019s Rob. So a couple of things on \u2013 when you look at our investment vehicles, summary, I guess you\u2019re looking at Pages 20 and Page 21 of our earnings release. The uncalled commitments there represent what\u2019s called from the fund what they exclude is the amount of committed capital that we have two different strategies out there that has not been called yet as well as reserves in those funds. And so, as an example, our Americas XII fund on an adjusted basis they closer to $1.3 billion. And so I think that would be much more in line with how you would think about when to turn on that fund. And as it relates to your the first part of your question on management fees. You\u2019re right. Those funds turned on. I think about two-thirds of the way the big ones through the quarter. And so we\u2019d expect a little bit of an additional ramp up in Q3 as those funds get going. And we turn to post-investment period on the predecessor funds as they run off, I think management fee number there, that could be in the range of $40 plus million for the third-quarter more of on a run rate basis, I think is something that would be an approximation that I think would be a reasonable one at this stage.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Arnaud Giblat with Exane BNP. Please proceed with your question.\nArnaud Giblat: Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could give us an update on how you view used opportunities to deploy capital and specifically what target returns are being discussed with investors. Have these been or are these the same targeted returns that you used to have or have they been scaled back given current market levels?\nCraig Larson: Sure. Arnaud, it\u2019s Craig, why don\u2019t I start, I\u2019ll let Scott on give an update in terms of overall target returns. And I\u2019m glad you asked about deployment because honestly, given all we\u2019ve had to go through today, we probably haven\u2019t talked about deployment as much detail as we should. I think the main takeaway is we\u2019re continuing to deploy actively. So in terms of private markets first we\u2019ve continued to invest meaningfully first half deployment was a little over $12 billion LTM deployments, a little over $24 million. So again, that pace has been very healthy and what you\u2019re really seeing there is diversification. So Rob mentioned this in our prepared remarks, deployment in Q2 was between $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion individually across all the private equity infrastructure and real estate. So we\u2019ve had a really nice balance with the growth strategies and core making up that incremental piece. I think in terms of themes, you\u2019re seeing investments in really good companies with strong growth prospects. And I think overall at the moment, there\u2019s probably more dislocation in Asia, this leading to better opportunities for us in that region. And in public markets, what you\u2019re really seeing is, is the growth in the overall footprint of the firm. So AUM and our credit business has increased from a little over $70 billion a year ago to $170 billion as of June 30. So you\u2019re seeing a meaningful increase in deployment in public markets, just recognizing just \u2013 again, the dramatic increase in the footprint of the firms. So in terms of the $10 billion this quarter, again, that was pretty actively \u2013 that was actively deployed across a number of strategies, direct lending, opportunistic credit, asset based finance, et cetera.\nRob Lewin: Yes. And Arnaud your question around targeted returns. The short answer is, there hasn\u2019t really been any change in how we think about it. And we talked about this a bit on prior calls. But one of the things we\u2019ve been very focused on the last several years is having the firm get behind some themes that we think will benefit over the next several years. And frankly, some of those themes have been accelerated by virtue of what we\u2019ve all just are going through with COVID. So in private equity, if you look at where our deployment has been, as an example, a lot of deployment in digital and technology, areas like health and wellness, cyber security, nesting and series of themes like those. Infrastructure, again, fiber and telecom would be a couple of themes we\u2019ve been investing behind and renewables and real estate, industrial properties, multifamily and credit asset based finance as the banks have pulled back and housing. And then, Global Atlantic is obviously a very big investment behind the thematic of savings tax deferral, the aging population and people looking to manage their own retirement wealth. And so what we\u2019re finding is if you get behind these big themes, there\u2019s a big opportunity to generate outsized returns. And there\u2019s a lot of dispersion in the market. There\u2019s going to be some of these areas and themes that we think will be big winners. We\u2019re getting behind those. And I think part of the reason you\u2019ve seen our returns be so strong is we\u2019ve in effect been overweight a lot of those sectors that are benefiting those themes that are working and underweight others. So we think by continuing to pursue that effort we\u2019ve got an opportunity to continue to generate outsize returns and our targets haven\u2019t really changed.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Cyprys: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to circle back to core PE and core infrastructure. I appreciate those are longer dated strategies with lower return targets. I would just hope that you can elaborate a bit on the platform that you\u2019ve built out there, the investment strategy more broadly. What sort of deals can make sense and maybe can remind us how the economics work for KKR. And what\u2019s your sense on the timeframe for putting all that capital to work?\nCraig Larson: So Mike, it\u2019s Craig, why don\u2019t I start there? In infrastructure is an interesting place to begin. So at our Investor Day, we walked through infrastructure really as a case study in terms of how we look to build an investment platform. And so that begins with strong performance of flagship strategies. And then you can \u2013 there\u2019s a focus on scaling those flagships and innovating and that innovation can happen geographically. So you\u2019ve seen that with Asia Infra, and can also come through adjacent strategies and you\u2019ve seen that through core PE. So that\u2019s really where we are today. We have a built out infra franchise with three distinct market segments, our Global Infra Fund Series Asia, and for fund series and diversified core. And in terms of core and the focus on those investments, core infra is really targeting more mature cash generative assets with a focus on long-term predictable cash flows. So we\u2019re looking for simplicity and low execution risk all in that open-ended perpetual vehicle. And so our focus here is we want to buy simplicity and hold simplicity. That\u2019s really the focus. In terms of core private equity, that\u2019s really of innovation where we can\u2019t find a home for great investment opportunities. And so this again is a long duration strategy where we expect to hold investments and compound value for 10 to 15 years. But as you noted again, the risk reward is different than our opportunistic PE funds. We\u2019re looking for a mid-teen IRR businesses with less disruption risk, very good cash flows, often consolidation opportunities and fragmented sectors. Again, we\u2019ve been at this business longer at this point. We have what you think is a really incredible portfolio of companies. The gross IRR here today since inception is 27%. And I think there\u2019s a final point as it relates to core and the business model because given the participation on our balance sheet, core PE has really contributed to the compounding of our book value. So when you look at the core line on Page 14 of our press release, you see $4.2 billion of fair value that was part of the $17.5 billion of investments. That $4.2 billion has just under $2 billion of cost associated with it. So we have over $2 billion of embedded gains on our balance sheet. So with shareholders were participating in the economics from the third-party capital management fees and carry with performance over time. But in addition, that compounding aspect is an additional powerful way that we also can participate in the success here.\nScott Nuttall: Hey, Michael, it\u2019s Scott. Just a couple of things I\u2019d add. One, the point I understand, this is deal flow we were already seeing. So to Craig\u2019s point, think lower risk, longer duration opportunities that we really like the risk reward, but it did not fit into opportunistic vehicles. But were investments, we liked, nonetheless, we now have homes for those investments. We did not before. And because of the fact that this was deal flow, we were already seeing it was being sourced by our existing teams. We have not had to build new teams to actually prosecute these strategies. So the existing teams are actually just forcing these investments, if they don\u2019t fit in the opportunistic fund then they can be considered for core. And so it\u2019s been a highly profitable, incremental source of AUM and fees for us. And it\u2019s something that we\u2019re really monetizing deal flow that was already here. And in terms of the deployment period, we have been very actively deploying that. I think our expectation is for core PE that\u2019ll probably get deployed over a three to five-year period and for core infrastructure with this first pool of capital we\u2019re operating at a current run rate that would be faster than that. And we\u2019ll continue to add capital to that strategy as well over time. Rob, why don\u2019t you pick up on economics?\nRob Lewin: Yes. Mike, so the management fees on both these products get paid when the capital is invested. And so this capital is largely in AUM right now and over time gravitate towards fee paying AUM and the capital costs both these strategies are carrying except if fee eligible. And so we think we\u2019ll be a contributor to performance revenue over the long-term.\nCraig Larson: And Mike, it\u2019s Craig, one final point is kind of an interesting statistic and this actually ties into Glenn\u2019s question earlier, but it\u2019s interesting when you look at core infra of the $7 billion of capital, that\u2019s been raised over 40% of the commitments have come from LPs that are new to KKR. So in terms of how these strategies are helping us really broaden the LP base again, it\u2019s an interesting statistic.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Lee: Thanks for taking my follow-up. I guess, just on the Global Atlantic, is it possible to just get a number one, a sense of what their kind of regular flow is? Like, if we think about it outside of reinsurance transactions, what you\u2019re seeing is kind of quarter-to-quarter regular flow, if they don\u2019t do the transaction. And then maybe just update us on the amount of capital that they\u2019ve got available once they get through the $10 billion of deals closing this quarter.\nScott Nuttall: Great Rob, I\u2019ll take that, it\u2019s Scott. Look, in terms of the way to think about it, organic away from a block activity, a couple of things I\u2019d point. One, remember they have a significant distribution presence and are raising money in the individual sector. And so if you want to think about that $8 billion to $10 billion of annual flow give or take that\u2019s kind of a good starting number to work with. But on the institutional side, I know the block activity is the stuff that gets the press release and gets more and more focus and attention. There\u2019s also a number of other things that we do there. We have flow reinsurance arrangements with a number of different counterparties. There\u2019s pension risk transfer activity, which is incredibly active and it\u2019s getting more active, especially this year. We\u2019re also active in the funding agreement markets. So there\u2019s a lot of ways to grow on the institutional side as well that is a significant. And those are also billion dollar plus opportunities individually. And so, we see that as another way to grow. So in terms of the answer to the question, you could think $8 billion to $10 billion plus several billion on top of that from more of the kind of flow related institutional business away from blocks. And in terms of the capital available question, as a reminder, when we actually closed the transaction earlier this year, we raised an incremental $250 million with primary capital and there is runoff in this business as well. So we\u2019re generating new capital by virtue of our earnings. We\u2019re freeing up capital with some of the runoff, and we\u2019re replacing that with all the affirmation plus all the block activity. And if the company needs more capital we\u2019re highly confident we\u2019ll be able to access it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nAlex Blostein: Hey guys, thanks for taking the follow-up question here. I had another sort of question around retail and specifically related to KREST. It looks like AUM there is approaching about $700 million, not huge in a context obviously of KKR as a whole, but it\u2019s an important driver potentially, as you think about the affluent and the mass affluent part of the retail market. So, can you maybe walk us through your sort of distributions for KREST specifically how many platforms and sort of the type of platforms that are contributing to flows here, just thinking through kind of warehouse independent broker dealers, et cetera. And really trying to understand any distinct advantages of having something like this in a 40 Act wrapper that sort of really resonates with distribution partners. And I guess lastly here I think Greg, you mentioned that there might be other opportunities to bring additional retail product to market, maybe in core securities, we get some early kind of thoughts on that. Thanks.\nCraig Larson: Alex, why don\u2019t I begin? So just for those of you less familiar, KREST is an acronym for KKR Real Estate Select Trusts. It\u2019s a continuously offered registered closed-end fund with re-taxation that was created for individual investors. And it does \u2013 it features daily pricing and subscriptions via a ticker. So we\u2019re at the very beginning of KREST evolution, which is exciting for us. We began raising capital on two platforms only in June and over time we do expect to see an expansion across many platforms globally. So Alex, we don\u2019t have a whole ton of details. I think the main takeaways for you are really threefold. One, the size of the end markets here are a massive; two it\u2019s a big opportunity for us; and three, we\u2019re really pleased with our first steps. And we\u2019ll keep you abreast as we move forward from here both as it relates to this, in addition to as other products and strategies are launched again, through those products tailored towards the \u2013 towards the retail market.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of William Katz with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nWilliam Katz: Okay. Thanks also for taking the extra questions. So a two-parter again, maybe one for Rob. As you think about the FRE margin 62% this quarter, and was way down a little bit by placement fees, obviously turning on some of the bigger funds. Where do we go from here? And then maybe stepping back, given what seems to be a step function of earnings power, any thoughts on dividend policy? Thank you.\nRob Lewin: Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. And so we\u2019ve signaled in the past that we expect to continue to make some near-term investments here across distribution and technology. But even with those investments, we do see a medium opportunity drive scale efficiencies in our operating expenses. And we think that\u2019s going to yield margin expansion over time. We\u2019ve been operating generally in the low 60s. We do see a pathway over time to take that up to the mid 60s. But we\u2019re going to work through some of that additional investment over the near-term that we\u2019ve flagged that we think is going to pay dividends for us in the long-term. And then your question as it relates to dividend policy, nothing\u2019s changed as it relates to how we think about returning capital to shareholders. Our policy and how we think about that has been consistent for a number of years now. We would expect it to continue to be consistent just to say, we\u2019ll evaluate it annually. We\u2019ll do that at the beginning of the year, like we have done in past years. And our expectation as we have done in past years is that we\u2019re going to look to modestly increase our dividend on an annual basis. So that should be the expectation going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Cyprys: Thanks for taking the follow-up here. More of a follow-up question, I guess, for Rob, if you could just maybe help us out with the deployment and realizations off the balance sheet in the quarter please? Thanks.\nRob Lewin: Sure. The deployment was $800 million off the balance sheet in the quarter, and the realizations were just about $900 million. On a LTM basis, those numbers Mike are 3.1 of deployment and 2.6 of realization.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to hand it back to Mr. Larson for closing remarks.\nCraig Larson: Thank you, everybody for your time this morning. We look forward to chatting with you again after next quarter\u2019s results. Anything in the interim, please, of course, feel free to reach out directly. Thank you once again.",

            "name": "Rob Lewin",
            "content": "Thanks a lot, Craig. I'll start off with our segment financial results for the quarter. Management fees came in at $480 million that's up 9% from Q1 and up over 40% from this time last year. The investment periods for America's VIII and in Infra IV both commenced in the quarter. So you saw partial quarters impact from these funds. Health Care Growth II and European real estate were also additive to management fees in the quarter. Our capital markets business had an excellent quarter with $219 million in fees. Transaction activity here was really diversified. We actually only had one fee event that was larger than $20 million and 50% of our revenues came from activity outside of the U.S. It was also a strong quarter for our third-party capital markets business with $61 million of revenues. We continue to get really good traction in this part of our business. Fee-related compensation came in at $170 million, a 22.5% compensation ratio. And our other operating expenses were $115 million modestly elevated with almost $20 million of placement fees recognized this quarter, given all of our fundraising activities. All of this brings us to record fee-related earnings of $470 million or $0.53 per share for the quarter. That is up 68% year-over-year, and also represents a 62% margin. Turning to realizations, carried interest came in at just over $600 million, while realized investment income was approximately $370 million, bringing total realization activity to just under $1 billion for the quarter. Realization spent multiple funds, product and geographies. The diversification of our model really contributes to this broad base performance. In terms of our expenses, realized performance comp was $413 million and realized investment comp was $55 million. And on a year-to-date basis, our total compensation margin within our asset management segment, including equity-based comp is currently 36%. Moving onto our insurance segment, this quarter was the first full quarter of operating earnings from Global Atlantic, which totaled $128 million largely driven by strong core operating performance, as well as the sale of a strategic equity investment that helped bolster net investment income by $47 million. ROE for the quarter was 17% or 14% excluding this variable investment income. Putting it all together, our after-tax distributable earnings came in at $926 million or $1.05 per share. On a year-to-date basis, our after-tax DE is $1.80 per share. These results are up 143% and 98% from the same time last year, really highlighting the momentum that we are seeing across the firm today. Our book value per share came in at $27.03 this quarter. The embedded gains in our balance sheet are currently $6.6 billion, as of June 30, which is up approximately $1 billion from Q1 and up over $5 billion from the same point last year, despite our high levels of realization activity over the corresponding periods. And our net cash and investments per share increased 12% from March 31 to $17 per share. Turning to our investment performance, which continues to be a real differentiator for us. We saw strong results again this quarter. Our PE portfolio appreciated 9% while our mature flagships appreciated 13%. Real estate continued to show strength increasing by 10% for the quarter. Our infrastructure business was relatively flat for the quarter, but continues to perform well overall up 21% over the last 12 months. And our credit funds are similarly performing well. Leveraged credit and alternative credit were up 2% and 6% in the quarter, respectively. Shifting to deployment, we had an extremely active quarter with total capital invested of approximately $19 billion. In private markets, deployment was diversified with $7 billion invested quite equally across private equity, infrastructure and real estate. With the remaining billion in growth and core strategies, and in public markets, we deployed over $10 billion across our private credit, dislocation and direct lending strategies. Despite this record level of deployment, dry powder now stands at $112 billion, which is up 63% from last quarter. And before I hand it off to Scott, I wanted to spend just a minute on our fundraising in Q2. While Craig mentioned that this is a record quarter for us, I think just as important is the quality of the capital that we raised. To give you a few stats, 98% of the capital we raised in Q2 has a contractual life of over eight years. Once turned on the fee paying capital is a blended fee rate of just under 100 basis points. And finally, 88% of the capital is either carry or an incentive fee eligible. So what we have accomplished over the last few months is going to have a very meaningful impact on our financial results for several years to come. And with that, let me hand it off to Scott. Good morning, Alex. It's Rob. Thanks for the question. We can get into fundraising sides doing private placement rules, but let me just spend a minute on your question as it relates to how we're thinking about fundraising. Maybe take a step back, and as a reminder, in February of this past year, we had introduced FRE per share guidance. We set at the time that we saw a clear path to comfortably exceeding $2 per share of FRE next year. Now at our Investor Day in April, you referenced $100 billion figure. We thought it would be helpful for our investors to understand some of the building blocks behind that FRE growth. So we noted that we expected to raise north of $100 billion of capital over the next couple of years. Part of the reason why we decided to give that statistic was that 2020 and itself was a record fundraising year at $44 billion. And so what we wanted to ensure people took away is that we didn't think that that was a peak result for us. As it relates to this quarter, the fundraising that we announced exceeded our expectations and what we saw this quarter was more than just the pulling forward. I think a fundraising I expect in a future quarters, across several strategies, we really have exceeded the expectations that we set for ourselves at the beginning of the year. So I think it is fair to say that we feel a lot better, a better outlook for new capital raised over the next couple of years. And that will be certainly north of that $100 billion plus number that we put out there a couple of months ago. And I also think it's fair to say that we feel even better, but achieving or exceeding the FRE targets that we put out at the beginning of this year, given all of the momentum that we have across our business today. Hey Bill, it's Rob, I'll take the first part of the question around those the guidance that we put out a couple of months ago. So we don't have any updated guidance for this call, and obviously we'll consider providing updated guidance in the future, but not as for today, I would say that I think it's very fair to acknowledge that we are ahead of where we thought we would be. We are well ahead of expectation across most of our fundraising activity. The assets that we manage on behalf of both Atlantic are ahead of expectations. The momentum in our capital markets business is really good right now, maybe as good as it's ever been. And we've got a lot of momentum across our performance which has generated a lot of embedded gains that sit across our carried interest in our balance sheet. And so we feel really good about the potential to drive meaningful additional revenue growth from here, as well as profitability growth. The one other thing, I would say out Bill, which is tangential, I suppose to your question that we often get is where we are from modernization perspective in Q3. We already have really good visibility here into meaningful revenue and monetization activity. As of right now, we have line of sight of approximately $650 plus million of performance in investment income. As a reminder, this is from deals that are already closed or opened signed up. And we expect to close in the third quarter. In terms of the FRE is important from a compensation perspective, probably around 50% carry right now, and 50% weighted towards investment income. The last thing I'd say here is that I'd underscore that all of these are really approximations at this stage. But this is our best view right now from all the identified deal activity we expect to close in the upcoming quarter. Hey, Patrick, it's Rob. So the way we think about our capital markets business really isn't quarter-to-quarter. I think you've heard from us quite a bit, especially more recently that we see a lot of growth in that business, both secularly and then ability for us to be able to take market share on a global basis, we really think about that from an annual perspective and over a multi-year period of time, but I think as you look at the first half of 2021, roughly $330 million of fees, I think are LTM is about $680 million in our capital markets business. With a healthy amount of deal activity around the world, we think those are the types of numbers that hopefully should be achievable for us. And also the debt base, our expectation is over the next number of years is we should really be able to scale that business going forward. Yes. Chris, it's Rob. So a couple of things on \u2013 when you look at our investment vehicles, summary, I guess you're looking at Pages 20 and Page 21 of our earnings release. The uncalled commitments there represent what's called from the fund what they exclude is the amount of committed capital that we have two different strategies out there that has not been called yet as well as reserves in those funds. And so, as an example, our Americas XII fund on an adjusted basis they closer to $1.3 billion. And so I think that would be much more in line with how you would think about when to turn on that fund. And as it relates to your the first part of your question on management fees. You're right. Those funds turned on. I think about two-thirds of the way the big ones through the quarter. And so we'd expect a little bit of an additional ramp up in Q3 as those funds get going. And we turn to post-investment period on the predecessor funds as they run off, I think management fee number there, that could be in the range of $40 plus million for the third-quarter more of on a run rate basis, I think is something that would be an approximation that I think would be a reasonable one at this stage. Yes. And Arnaud your question around targeted returns. The short answer is, there hasn't really been any change in how we think about it. And we talked about this a bit on prior calls. But one of the things we've been very focused on the last several years is having the firm get behind some themes that we think will benefit over the next several years. And frankly, some of those themes have been accelerated by virtue of what we've all just are going through with COVID. So in private equity, if you look at where our deployment has been, as an example, a lot of deployment in digital and technology, areas like health and wellness, cyber security, nesting and series of themes like those. Infrastructure, again, fiber and telecom would be a couple of themes we've been investing behind and renewables and real estate, industrial properties, multifamily and credit asset based finance as the banks have pulled back and housing. And then, Global Atlantic is obviously a very big investment behind the thematic of savings tax deferral, the aging population and people looking to manage their own retirement wealth. And so what we're finding is if you get behind these big themes, there's a big opportunity to generate outsized returns. And there's a lot of dispersion in the market. There's going to be some of these areas and themes that we think will be big winners. We're getting behind those. And I think part of the reason you've seen our returns be so strong is we've in effect been overweight a lot of those sectors that are benefiting those themes that are working and underweight others. So we think by continuing to pursue that effort we've got an opportunity to continue to generate outsize returns and our targets haven't really changed. Yes. Mike, so the management fees on both these products get paid when the capital is invested. And so this capital is largely in AUM right now and over time gravitate towards fee paying AUM and the capital costs both these strategies are carrying except if fee eligible. And so we think we'll be a contributor to performance revenue over the long-term. Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. And so we've signaled in the past that we expect to continue to make some near-term investments here across distribution and technology. But even with those investments, we do see a medium opportunity drive scale efficiencies in our operating expenses. And we think that's going to yield margin expansion over time. We've been operating generally in the low 60s. We do see a pathway over time to take that up to the mid 60s. But we're going to work through some of that additional investment over the near-term that we've flagged that we think is going to pay dividends for us in the long-term. And then your question as it relates to dividend policy, nothing's changed as it relates to how we think about returning capital to shareholders. Our policy and how we think about that has been consistent for a number of years now. We would expect it to continue to be consistent just to say, we'll evaluate it annually. We'll do that at the beginning of the year, like we have done in past years. And our expectation as we have done in past years is that we're going to look to modestly increase our dividend on an annual basis. So that should be the expectation going forward. Sure. The deployment was $800 million off the balance sheet in the quarter, and the realizations were just about $900 million. On a LTM basis, those numbers Mike are 3.1 of deployment and 2.6 of realization."

            "name": "Scott Nuttall",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob, and thank you everyone for joining our call. As Rob and Craig just explained, we had an exceptional quarter. Investment performance and capital raising are at record levels and broad based across strategies and geographies. Capital markets had second best quarter ever with significant activity across KKR and third-party business. On the insurance front, the Global Atlantic integration is proceeding well. And we continue to win new blocks alongside organic growth. And on top of all of this, we continue to launch new efforts and expand our product offerings, including in the retail market, providing even greater growth opportunities down the road. This quarter shows in outcomes of what we discussed at our April Investor Day. We are at an inflection point in a number of our businesses and see multiple ways for the firm to continue to grow AUM, revenues and profits. Let me highlight two examples from this quarter. First, we raised $8 billion of third-party capital for core PE, bringing AUM in that strategy to $28 billion. As a reminder, this business was created less than five years ago. And second, we've raised $7 billion for core infrastructure, a strategy that was launched less than a year ago. We are off to a great start here and on our way to being a market leader in this large and growing space. These are just two examples of how we are innovating and creating adjacent strategies to further scale our businesses in a highly efficient fashion. So there's a lot of good to talk about this quarter. Within all the good, we are particularly proud of our investment performance. Our flagship private equity funds are up 86% over the last 12 months. Real assets are up 21%, and alternative credit is up 30%. The combination of this broad-based and strong investment performance, a growing client base across channels and multiple maturing businesses, plus the launching of new strategies and raising more permanent capital and Global Atlantic and capital markets scaling significantly is incredibly powerful. You saw this power in our Q2 results. The firm is executing at a high level and we have a lot of road ahead of us. With that, we're happy to take your questions. I think, the only thing I'd add, it's Scott, is if you look at by dollars into your question, there is not that much overlap between core and our opportunistic vehicles, there's some, but we're finding that these strategies are allowing us to expand our investor base. And Bill, the second part of your question on the retail channel. But we're really encouraged. We've been investing aggressively in that space and we've doubled the size of the team in the last 12 months. And we're continuing to invest in that build-out. Part of the reason we're encouraged is even as we're doing that, build out in the U.S., we're also investing to build out Europe and Asia, and we're seeing significant engagement across private wealth and retail. We're already \u2013 it's kind of mid-teens percentage of our fundraising coming from that channel. So as an example, in the second quarter, about 14% of the money we raised was actually from retail and we don't think we're anywhere near our potential yet. So there's a lot of opportunity ahead of us. In terms of the question about land grab, we were finding that we haven't engaged a set of partners as we continue to build out a distribution in this space. We're already on a number of platforms, adding products to those, and then developing new relationships all around the world. So we haven't run into any resistance. If anything we're finding is significant and growing interest in all things alternatives and a lot of interest in the registered funds in particular. We're obviously very meaningful investors in our funds. We liked that we liked that positioning on our balance sheet, but when you look at our balance sheet capital relative to our fund capital. It's a fairly small percentage. And so it really doesn't need it to capacity and it hasn't impacted in material way, how we thought about committing capital to our strategies from, it's a good question, but that is \u2013 that's, we do separate out those two things. Hey, Michael, it's Scott. Just a couple of things I'd add. One, the point I understand, this is deal flow we were already seeing. So to Craig's point, think lower risk, longer duration opportunities that we really like the risk reward, but it did not fit into opportunistic vehicles. But were investments, we liked, nonetheless, we now have homes for those investments. We did not before. And because of the fact that this was deal flow, we were already seeing it was being sourced by our existing teams. We have not had to build new teams to actually prosecute these strategies. So the existing teams are actually just forcing these investments, if they don't fit in the opportunistic fund then they can be considered for core. And so it's been a highly profitable, incremental source of AUM and fees for us. And it's something that we're really monetizing deal flow that was already here. And in terms of the deployment period, we have been very actively deploying that. I think our expectation is for core PE that'll probably get deployed over a three to five-year period and for core infrastructure with this first pool of capital we're operating at a current run rate that would be faster than that. And we'll continue to add capital to that strategy as well over time. Rob, why don't you pick up on economics? Great Rob, I'll take that, it's Scott. Look, in terms of the way to think about it, organic away from a block activity, a couple of things I'd point. One, remember they have a significant distribution presence and are raising money in the individual sector. And so if you want to think about that $8 billion to $10 billion of annual flow give or take that's kind of a good starting number to work with. But on the institutional side, I know the block activity is the stuff that gets the press release and gets more and more focus and attention. There's also a number of other things that we do there. We have flow reinsurance arrangements with a number of different counterparties. There's pension risk transfer activity, which is incredibly active and it's getting more active, especially this year. We're also active in the funding agreement markets. So there's a lot of ways to grow on the institutional side as well that is a significant. And those are also billion dollar plus opportunities individually. And so, we see that as another way to grow. So in terms of the answer to the question, you could think $8 billion to $10 billion plus several billion on top of that from more of the kind of flow related institutional business away from blocks. And in terms of the capital available question, as a reminder, when we actually closed the transaction earlier this year, we raised an incremental $250 million with primary capital and there is runoff in this business as well. So we're generating new capital by virtue of our earnings. We're freeing up capital with some of the runoff, and we're replacing that with all the affirmation plus all the block activity. And if the company needs more capital we're highly confident we'll be able to access it."

During today\u2019s presentation all parties will be in listen-only mode. Following management\u2019s prepared remarks, the conference will be open for questions. [Operator Instructions] I\u2019ll now hand the call over to Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.\nCraig Larson: Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2021 earnings call. I\u2019m joined this morning by Scott Nuttall, our Co-President and Co-COO; and by Rob Lewin, our CFO. We would like to remind everyone that we\u2019ll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, which is available on the Investor Center section at KKR.com. This call will contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to our press release and our SEC filings for cautionary factors related to these statements. Earlier this morning, we posted our earnings release presentation. You\u2019ll likely have noticed a few changes. First, recognizing this is the first quarter post the closing of The Global Atlantic acquisition, we\u2019re now reporting our results with two segments, our Asset Management segment, in addition to a new Insurance segment, which reflects our approximate 60% interest in GA\u2019s financial results. In addition, given the changes we made to our compensation framework that we introduced last quarter, a number of the line items on our segment income statement have changed. We ran through this on our Q4 call, as well as at Investor Day. Now to help with comparability, we posted a presentation on our website in early April with three years of recast financial information on a quarterly basis. That presentation, of course, is still available on the Investor Center section of our website and it could be helpful for you to refer to that as you consider our results compared to prior periods. And finally, we\u2019ve changed the framework of the earnings release itself to make results easier to digest, while improving our disclosure and transparency at the same time. We trust that you will find the new framework, as well as the additional disclosure to be helpful. Now I expect many of you joined us at our Investor Day only three weeks ago. For those of you that didn\u2019t have the opportunity, we would encourage you to watch a replay of the event and review the accompanying presentation both of which can be found on our website. We really feel that the event helps everyone gain a better understanding of where we are now with the firm. And importantly, all of the opportunities we have to continue to grow and scale from here. And right on the heels of this event, we\u2019re pleased to be reporting an excellent quarter. After-tax distributable earnings came in at $0.75 per share. Fee related earnings are $0.41 per share. Management fees increased 31% year-over-year, driving the 36% increase in our FRE per share compared to the first quarter of 2020. Our assets under management are now $367 billion. This reflects the closing of Global Atlantic, strong investment performance, in addition to continued fundraising momentum. And our book value per share, which is mark-to-market every quarter is now $25.84. This is up over 50% from the $16.52 we reported one year ago and is 12% ahead of the figure we reported just last quarter. The continued growth in our book value was really a testament to the strong investment performance we\u2019re seeing across the firm. And finally, as we announced last quarter, we increased our dividends beginning with this quarter. So our annualized dividend per share is now $0.58. In terms of today\u2019s call, I will kick things off with an overview of investment performance and fundraising before turning it over to Rob to walk through this quarter\u2019s financials, and at the end, Scott will provide a few closing remarks and we\u2019ll head into Q&A. So to begin, we\u2019ve continued to have very strong investment performance. Beginning first with private equity, the portfolios a whole appreciated 19% in the quarter and is up 56% over the last 12 months. And performance in our flagship fund has been even stronger, up 28% for the quarter and up almost 80% over the last 12 months. At our Investor Day, one of the themes we discussed was the importance of winning in tech and the significance of the investments we\u2019ve made in tech. Remember that 38% of our private equity deployment over 2018 to 2020 was in companies with tech and digital theme. And you\u2019re seeing the impact of these investments within our performance figure. AppLovin, our mobile technology investment in North America\u2019s wealth fund went public earlier this quarter and is currently trading at about 15 times our costs. And Darktrace and KnowBe4, two cybersecurity businesses also both went public over the last couple of weeks and are trading well north of costs. These were three of our six portfolio companies that went public in April. And alongside of this IPO activity, we see strong performance at private tech oriented investments like Internet Brands, OneStream Software, Byte Dance, RB Media, Kokusai Electric and Calabrio, a software business that we exited earlier in Q2. We\u2019ve seen continued performance across our real asset strategies. Over the past 12 months our opportunistic real estate funds withstood all the market volatility, appreciating 13%, while in infrastructure, the portfolio appreciated 18%. Turning to credit, our alternative credit composite appreciated 7% in the quarter and 19% over the last 12 months. We\u2019ve seen differentiated investment performance within our dislocation strategy and performance in the quarter and LTV periods were strong within Lending Partners III and Special Sits II. And our leverage credit composite appreciated 2% in the quarter at 25% over the last 12 months. And looking at our performance here over a broader timeframe, both our standalone high yield and bank loan track records continue to rank as top quartile over one year-year, three-year, five-year and seven-year timeframes. And reflecting the strong investment performance across strategies, our balance sheet investment portfolio appreciated 12% in the quarter and is up 52% on a trailing 12-month basis. Now on the heels of strong investment performance, we\u2019re seeing continued momentum in fundraising with $15 billion of new capital raised in Q1 and $51 billion over the trailing 12 months. Notably, in the first quarter, we held the final close on our Asia IV Fund raise at $15 billion. Building on our differentiated investment track record, Asia IV is the largest private equity fund dedicated to investing in the Asia-Pacific region. And Asia IV really continues the momentum across our Asia-Pacific platform, given the final closings held just last quarter for our inaugural Asia infrastructure and real estate funds. Fundraising activity in the quarter also included new capital raised in our healthcare strategic growth strategy, core infrastructure and our opportunistic America\u2019s real estate strategy. We also raised our first SPAC and we\u2019re active in the CLO markets raising new CLOs in the quarter both in the U.S., as well as Europe. And our fundraising was not only strong for the core itself, but also diversified across many strategy. We\u2019ve a lot of conviction in our fundraising momentum going forward as we remain focused on our over 20 strategies that we expected come to market. And with that, let me turn it over Rob.\nRob Lewin: Thanks a lot, Craig. I\u2019m going to begin this morning by reviewing our segments financial results for the quarter. Our fee revenues totaled $586 million in Q1. Of particular note here, our management fees continued their robust growth and came in at $440 million, which is 31% ahead of last year. And adding to our strong management fee quarter, our Capital Markets business generated $112 million of transaction fees, which saw nice contributions across the Board. We remain very encouraged by the forward pipeline in our Capital Markets business, as well as opportunities here for continued risk. Fee related compensation came in at $132 million or 22.5% of fee related revenues. Right in the midpoint of that 20% to 25% annual range we introduced last quarter. And our other operating expenses totaled $19 million. Putting those pieces together, our fee related earnings were $364 million or $0.41 per share and our FRE margin was 62% for the quarter. We continue to be very confident that our FRE will comfortably exceed $2 per share next year. Our fundraising momentum is as good as it has ever been. The asset base of Global Atlantic continues to grow and we have very good line of sight to larger pools of capital and during their investment periods. Moving to our realized performance income, we generated $170 million of revenue for the quarter and our realized investment income was $460 million, which is a high point for us as a firm. But some of these revenue line items is approximately $630 million for the quarter. Our only cost associated with our realized performance and realized investment income is compensation, which came in right at of the respective annual ranges we indicated earlier this year. So in total, our Asset Management operating earnings came in at $817 million for the quarter. On top of that, our share of Global Atlantic\u2019s earnings added an incremental $63 million for the months of February and March, bringing total distributable operating earnings to $880 million, which is up 68% year-on-year. And finally, our after-tax distributable earnings came in at $660 million or $0.75 per share. One additional note here, our tax rate in the quarter was a bit elevated. The driver of this was a large accident that was structured in a way that resulted in the recognition of 100% of our tax expense, while only realizing approximately 50% of the investment income. Absent this, our after-tax DE would have been $0.81 for the quarter versus the $0.75 we reported this morning. Looking forward, we do expect will benefit from the reverse of this, as that investment is monetized and those gains become realized without the burden of the tax expense. Turning to deployment, coming off a record year in 2020, our total capital investment came in at $7 billion for the quarter and $31 billion over the last 12 months, which is up over 30% from the prior period. Importantly, when you dig a little deeper, our private markets deployment, which is generally longer dated and has higher profit potential, was up 77% versus the prior LTM period. That\u2019s bigger is really the best representation for how we lean in as an organization over the last 12 months. With much of that capital having been deployed or committed during the market downturn earlier in 2020. We do think our activity levels here are relatively distinguished across our many peers, where deployment across private market strategies tended to be flat to down year-over-year. At the same time, we\u2019ve never deployed more capital in our 45-year history. We are very confident that this elevated level of deployment will serve us well for years to come as those investments mature. And finally, turning to our balance sheet. Our book value per share is currently $25.84, which is up 12% from last quarter and up more than 50% versus March of 2020. Even if you compare this performance to pre-pandemic levels, our book value per share is up almost 35% in a little bit over a year and it\u2019s another tangible example of our business models ability to compound capital. Moving away from the specifics of the quarter, as I look at our overall performance, I think, there are really four things worth noting. First, we had a really strong quarter. We reported $0.41 of FRE per share and $0.75 after-tax DE per share, and as you know from our guidance, we expect an acceleration in both of these figures. The second relates to the strong investment performance we\u2019ve continued to deliver on behalf of our limited partners. Craig ran you through the performance statistics for the quarter, as well as the last 12 months really do stand out. But I think even more telling and differentiating our platform versus others is our investment performance over a multiyear period of time. As just one example, our current flagship Americas, Europe and Asia PE fund had gross returns of 49%, 26% and 44% from inception. This is directly led to the high levels of fundraising momentum that we are currently benefiting from. And this framework is not limited to private equity. At our Investor Day, we detailed the strength of our investment performance across our four growth and real asset and credit platforms. As a firm, we have a 45-year history of investment excellence and we\u2019re continuing to build on this long track record of success. Third point is the significant amount of related earnings inside of the firm that we expect to flow through our operating earnings over the next number of years. At our Investor Day, one of the statistics we discussed was the $9.1 billion of total unrealized gains in our balance sheet at the end of 2020. Those are embedded gains from our investments, as well as gross unrealized carry. That $9.1 billion increase to $12.3 billion as of the end of March. That number can obviously move around a bit and will apart be driven by the overall tone in the markets. However, the $3 plus billion move in only three months and in a quarter with a heavy level of realized activity. I think really illustrates the strength of the underlying investments and also what it means for our ability to generate realized profitability over the next number of years. And finally, we\u2019re off to a really great start with GA and we really just began to see the impact of how Global Atlantic can flow through our financial results. There\u2019s a lot more for us to do here and we\u2019ll keep you abreast of our progress in the quarters ahead. All of this really does support why we expect significant acceleration of after-tax DE to the $4 to $5 range by the 2023, 2024 timeframe. Remember, this earnings power is largely already in our firm. We have a lot of conviction that we\u2019ll be able to execute on our strategy and continue to deliver really meaningful results for our LPs, shareholders, employees and all the communities that we operate in. And with that, let me hand it off to Scott for some closing thoughts.\nScott Nuttall: Thank you, Rob, and thank you everyone for joining our call today. Given the reason Investor Day, I\u2019m going to be very brief. As a firm, we have never had a stronger team, better connectivity, stronger investment results, higher unrealized gains and carry, more businesses scaling and reaching their inflection points, and more fund in and coming in. As a result, we have never had more ways to grow, more visibility on that growth and we\u2019re confident in our future. And all of that is before Global Atlantic, which gives us even more perpetual capital, even more visibility, even more ways to grow and a fantastic management that will make us even stronger and faster. We are hopeful all that came through during the Investor Day and we are looking forward to keeping you updated on our progress. With that, we\u2019re happy to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question will be coming from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi. I appreciate the call -- question. I guess I was just like a -- maybe a little follow up on a few things that we didn\u2019t fully cover during Investor Day or today and just like maybe if you\u2019re still in pursuing long dated partnerships as you refer 10% that you earn. And maybe just comment on thoughts around where you're at in building these various platforms. Thanks a lot.\nScott Nuttall: Hey, Glenn. Thanks for the questions. First, with respect to long dated partnerships, we are still pursuing those. So these for everybody\u2019s benefit are the oftentimes multi-decade recycling strategic partnerships that will create with institutional investors largely, largely they\u2019re invested across asset classes and have some component of recycling to them. And so we continue to pursue those. They take a long time to structure. But we continue to have an active pipeline. So don\u2019t take any message from the Investor Day lack of commentary just continues to be something that we\u2019re focused on going. We\u2019ll have update for you over time, because there\u2019s a couple that are getting close. On the secondary side, as we\u2019ve mentioned in the past, we continue to look at the space. We\u2019re analyzing whether we want to build or whether there\u2019s something that might make sense to buy, really hard to have to buy work from a cultural fit standpoint at times, but we are looking and we\u2019ll have more to share with you over time. But nothing more to share today except that we continue to pursue it.\nGlenn Schorr: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nAlex Blostein: Great. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. So, clearly, looks like momentum in the business is very strong, lots of LP demand and you are guys\u2019 performance continues to be really good. Has this backdrop change the capacity for some of the flagship funds that you\u2019re currently in the market with? And if the demand sort of exceeds the capacity appetite you have in those flagship vehicles? Any other ways you\u2019re thinking you could sort of monetize on that demand? Thanks.\nScott Nuttall: Thanks for the question, Alex. As you know, it\u2019s really been a great fundraising environment, by the best we\u2019ve seen in a long time. We\u2019re seeing increased engagement from investors across the Board across different asset classes and we do find ourselves in some situations in the happy circumstance where a fund might be a capacity constraint and we\u2019re able to talk to them about different things that we\u2019re doing. So, for example, as you know, we raise our private equity flagship funds in a bit of a different way than others. We have three regional funds, as opposed to one global fund and we just closed Asia, we\u2019re in the market right now with Americas, Europe will come relatively quickly on the back of the Americas fundraise. There\u2019s core, there\u2019s growth, there\u2019s a lot of different ways we can talk to investors across just privately before you get to real assets and credit. And so that incremental potential demand that we oftentimes will see especially lately, we\u2019re able to pivot some of that unmet demand into some of these other asset classes and strategies that are adjacent and that\u2019s the focus right now.\nAlex Blostein: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question will be coming from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. My question is on Global Atlantic, I noticed on slide were actually page 17 of the press release had $12 billion of Global Atlantic AUM sits in private markets, while the rest is in public markets. What strategies or assets does the $12 billion private markets invest in and are these KKR strategies today or is there an opportunity to rotate this AUM into KKR strategies in the future?\nRob Lewin: Hey, Craig. It\u2019s Rob. Really good question and so a couple things. As we thought about our IMA and how to approach in that across our strategy, we really looked at where the underlying investments were at Global Atlantic, most of those are credit oriented and will fit in our public markets business, but there are a number that are in the real estate space, principally real estate credit and so we\u2019ve put those across our real estate business. As it relates to rotating the Global Atlantic balance sheet and to take their products, we are in the very early innings of that. We think there\u2019s a lot of opportunity for the Global Atlantic balance sheet, as well as our Asset Management businesses being able to get that rotation done. We\u2019re just a couple months in here and that\u2019s going to take some time to make sure that we get ramped up. We\u2019ll provide additional updates over time. But we\u2019re not really seeing the benefit of that the Global Atlantic had nor the KKR.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will be coming from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your questions.\nDevin Ryan: Great. Good morning, everyone. Question just on the outlook for monetizing some of the embedded gains on the balance sheet just given recent performance. And I guess I want to maybe tie it into proposals around capital gains rates potentially changing and if that might accelerate definitely the thought around some of the balance sheet gains? And just bigger picture kind of any views around potential tax changes on the portfolio? I appreciate it we don\u2019t have too much detail yet. But any color would be helpful? Thanks.\nScott Nuttall: Yeah. Thanks a lot, Devin. I\u2019ll answer the second part of your question first. Potential pending tax legislation will have no impact on how we monetize our portfolio. It is really about making sure that we\u2019re a fiduciary for our clients and exiting it at the appropriate time. In terms of our outlook for monetizing the portfolio, as you noted, there\u2019s a very significant amount of embedded gains. Our expectation is here -- here is that we\u2019ve got a number of assets particularly on the core side that for a number of years can compound in capital, but we also have a fairly mature portfolio that we think can get realized over the coming quarters here. I know one of the questions that we get a lot in this forum and so I will answer as part of this overall questions is what our forward visibility looks like in terms of monetizing our revenue from an investment perspective and a performance perspective. As relates to Q2 specifically, we already have visibility and a very substantial amount of revenue we have. As of now, that line of sight is $700 plus million of performance and investment income. So as a reminder, this is from deals that are already closed or have been signed up and that we expect to close in Q2. In terms of split, as I know that for now especially our articulating compensation. I\u2019d say, it\u2019s probably 60 to two-thirds carried interest and the remainder in investment income.\nOperator: Next question is coming from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Carrier: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. You guys mentioned being very active in deploying capital over the last year, which is position you will and we\u2019re seeing it in the performance. But just maybe, how are you thinking about deployment at this point, given one hand, you got rising valuations, you get the outlook for economic growth is fairly robust. So just an update there?\nCraig Larson: Hey, Mike. It\u2019s Craig. Why don\u2019t I start there? I think you\u2019re right, the first part of the answer does relate to the overall market where you\u2019re seeing tremendous activity and you really do see this in broad M&A stats. So Global announced M&A volumes in Q1, we\u2019re two excellent they were last year and it\u2019s actually been the most active start to the year in terms of broad M&A. Now, in terms of us in a market like this, where you have a lot of activity and a lot of interested sellers, given valuations and that activity, discipline is critical. And alongside of that, we think that a strong thematic approach is also critical and so it is important to really pick your spots, where to lean in and you want to really need to have deep expertise, in addition to real conviction. And so you\u2019re right, you\u2019ve heard us talk about our focus for some time now, for instance, on some of the tech and digital themes, Joe ran through that at Investor Day, almost 40% of our deployment in private markets, again, were investments with tech and digital themes over the last three years. And I think, we\u2019re still very busy and opportunities that fit this framework. Now, I think, the ones that we\u2019re attracted to are going to be companies that need capital for primary growth and we do view that a little differently versus someone who\u2019s simply looking to monetize an asset or an asset, if you will. But again, discipline is an important part of the equation. There\u2019s no question about it.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Pleased proceed with your question.\nChris Harris: Great. Thanks. There\u2019s a little bit of moving parts with a P&L, you got G&A coming in for a partial quarter, beginning of the second quarter, guys, how should we be thinking about the weighted average blended fee rate for KKR as an organization?\nRob Lewin: Yeah. That\u2019s a good question. Obviously, you\u2019re right, you\u2019ve got two months of GA, as opposed to full three months. I think on that basis you\u2019d certainly be able to look at it in a cleaner way on the quarter. Of course, given where our IMA is sat and we talked at the last call that that\u2019s maximum of 30 basis points, that\u2019s going to have downward pressure on overall fee margin. But I think Q1 could be a good indication, probably, with a little bit more downward pressure, because you have the extra month offset by the fact that, we\u2019ve got a really good and healthy outlook in fundraising across a number of our private strategies that have higher fee rates associated with them. So a bit of a challenging question to fully answer, Chris, but hopefully, that gives you a little bit of a flavor around where blended fee rates can go across the enterprise.\nChris Harris: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will be coming from the line of Gerry O\u2019Hara with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nGerry O\u2019Hara: Great. Thanks. I was hoping we might be able to get a little bit more color as it relates to the performance fee revenue line item that I think is new this quarter. But is there any sort of seasonality to that line item, anniversaries, perhaps, of product and what products in particular, we might be tracking or looking at to get a sense of how that line item might grow? Thank you.\nRob Lewin: Yeah. Thanks for your question, Gerry. It is new this quarter and really reflects how we\u2019ve tried to revamp our P&L to make it on a lot of ways. We think easier to understand and also more comparable with a number of our peers. And so what you\u2019d expect to see in that line item. Really our incentive fees more from our perpetual capital vehicles, where the incentive fees that we generate are based on the underlying yield of the portfolio as opposed to mark-to-market. So things that are more stable in nature, the types of products that you\u2019re going to see in there are going to be Type 1 incentive fees across our BDC platform, some of the core vehicles that we\u2019re raising across infrastructure and credit, we\u2019ve got a couple of SMEs that got have comparable type of fee arrangement. So those are the types of fees you\u2019re going to see. We see a big opportunity over the next number of years to really scale that line item up for the firm and we thought it made sense to break it out as distinct from incentive fees based off of mark-to-market performance, like, a number of our peers have done in the past.\nGerry O\u2019Hara: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question today will be coming from the line of Michael Cyprus with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Cyprus: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. My question is a little bit more of a follow up from Investor Day, just on the origination platforms. I was hoping you could maybe elaborate around some of the origination platforms that you\u2019ve been building out in partnership with a number of different specialty finance companies. I believe these are mostly partnerships. So I just -- how do you think about the trade-offs of partnering versus owning when it comes to these origination platforms? And what situation do you think it might make sense to own and maybe you could just talk about some of the capabilities that you think could make sense to add over the next couple years?\nScott Nuttall: Thanks. Very good question, Michael. It\u2019s Scott. As we mentioned at Investor Day, we have created or been partnered with others on about 16 or so origination platforms. And they\u2019re getting to be quite substantial, 4,000 employees, $100 plus billion of AUM or balance sheet across the entire group. Just by way of background, these were largely created out of our private credit business, in particular, private credit opportunities vehicles, where we saw an opportunity in asset based finance on the back of banks pulling back from a number of different asset classes, where we thought the risk reward was really pretty interesting. That effort was started clearly before the Global Atlantic transaction. And so what we\u2019re doing right now is we\u2019re in the process of thinking about how do we want to pivot this strategy and how do we want to evolve what we\u2019re doing there in light of the significant demand that Global Atlantic has for those underlying asset classes and that origination. And so, think of it this way, we started really just funding entirely out of the funds and then we started to move a little bit more of a hybrid approach. So we created an aircraft leasing business as an example called Altavair, that was created as almost like a joint venture between our infrastructure business, our private credit business and our balance sheet. And so we\u2019ve been moving in the direction of actually trying to think about the answer to your question this own versus partner. And I think what you\u2019ll find and we\u2019ll share this, our thinking with you going forward, is that we are going to have some of these that will be more transitory and we own for a while and then move on and sell as fiduciaries for our funds. And we may have some that over time move into more the Altavair type approach which is a bit of a hybrid. But with the addition of Global Atlantic, it really broaden us how we can think about investing in this space and some of this stuff, it might make sense to make more permanent either on the KKR balance sheet or the Global Atlantic balance sheet, or both.\nMichael Cyprus: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will be coming from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Pleased proceed with your questions.\nRobert Lee: Hi. Great. Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. While this has come on Investor Day, but I think, it would be just a helpful refresher on Global Atlantic really maybe a two parter, if you just refresh us on the amount of capital available for their growth right now. I mean, I know you injective when you bought it. I think something $250 million. There\u2019s a sidecar vehicle, I believe, too, but updating -- maybe an update on their growth capacity as it stands today would be helpful? And then also maybe GA kind of standalone, what was its organic growth in the quarter kind of separate from this, how it appears being added to your income statement balance sheet?\nRob Lewin: Hi, Rob. I will take the first shot at that. So that\u2019s good question, and obviously, one of the big opportunities for us is to really be able to work with the GA management to go get the scale, which they believe is out there in the industry, and Alan, at our Investor Day, as you noted, did a really good job articulating the different $1 billion plus growth opportunities that are available. And so we\u2019ve got a couple of different ways to be able to go after that and do feel like we\u2019re well set up. One, we raised $250 million of primary capital at the time of closing a couple months ago the first primary capital raise that the company has done. So that\u2019s very meaningful in terms of our ability to scale up the platform. Number two, you noted the sidecar, and we think there\u2019s a real opportunity from the sidecar finance perspective going forward that can start to be able to go after these growth opportunities. And the last and I\u2019d say, Rob, is one of the big strategic attractions of this transaction, I think, both for the GA management team and also as we evaluated this deal was our ability to help them access capital, when really meaningful growth opportunities are became available. And so, we\u2019re very focused on that and I do think that there\u2019s a real opportunity here for us to be able to go obtain additional capital, if it\u2019s required for things that make a ton of sense from a growth perspective for GA.\nRobert Lee: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will be coming from the line of Chris Harris, Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Harris: Thanks. Hey, Rob. I know this is really tough to estimate, but how should we be thinking about like a, quote-unquote, normalized tax rate for KKR now going forward. I know there was some noise in the first quarter? And then, related to that, I just want to confirm that the Insurance earnings are coming in to P&L post-tax?\nRob Lewin: Yeah. Thanks, Chris. Good question. So, yes, the -- our Insurance segment, we thought the right way to illustrate that was on a post-tax basis and so that\u2019s a fully tax number that you\u2019re seeing for our Insurance segment. As it relates to our blended tax rate, and I would say, our guidance here really hasn\u2019t changed since we became C-Corp and we benefit from a step up in basis that we had at the time of the C-Corp conversion. And that\u2019s why you see our tax rate out for the time being that has trended below the statutory rate, obviously, this quarter, in particular, you had some noise, upward pressure that I mentioned. But I think, a mid-to-high-teens type tax rate that\u2019s going up over time and landing in the low 20s at the statutory rate over time, as our step up comes down over time is the right way to think about taxes at KKR. So, not too dissimilar from what you\u2019ve heard from us over the years, other than the fact that the step up will continue to come down over time and our tax rate will slowly migrate up.\nChris Harris: Thank you.\nOperator: At this time, I\u2019ll turn the floor back to management for any additional comments.\nCraig Larson: Okay. Great. Well, thank you very much and thank you, everybody, for your continued interest in KKR. We know that with the Investor Day and our earnings amount of time that you\u2019ve spent focused on us has been considerable this quarter. We\u2019re, of course, available for any additional follow-up questions. And otherwise, we\u2019ll look forward to reviewing our Q2 results in three months. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you everyone. This will conclude today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rob Lewin",
            "content": "Thanks a lot, Craig. I'm going to begin this morning by reviewing our segments financial results for the quarter. Our fee revenues totaled $586 million in Q1. Of particular note here, our management fees continued their robust growth and came in at $440 million, which is 31% ahead of last year. And adding to our strong management fee quarter, our Capital Markets business generated $112 million of transaction fees, which saw nice contributions across the Board. We remain very encouraged by the forward pipeline in our Capital Markets business, as well as opportunities here for continued risk. Fee related compensation came in at $132 million or 22.5% of fee related revenues. Right in the midpoint of that 20% to 25% annual range we introduced last quarter. And our other operating expenses totaled $19 million. Putting those pieces together, our fee related earnings were $364 million or $0.41 per share and our FRE margin was 62% for the quarter. We continue to be very confident that our FRE will comfortably exceed $2 per share next year. Our fundraising momentum is as good as it has ever been. The asset base of Global Atlantic continues to grow and we have very good line of sight to larger pools of capital and during their investment periods. Moving to our realized performance income, we generated $170 million of revenue for the quarter and our realized investment income was $460 million, which is a high point for us as a firm. But some of these revenue line items is approximately $630 million for the quarter. Our only cost associated with our realized performance and realized investment income is compensation, which came in right at of the respective annual ranges we indicated earlier this year. So in total, our Asset Management operating earnings came in at $817 million for the quarter. On top of that, our share of Global Atlantic's earnings added an incremental $63 million for the months of February and March, bringing total distributable operating earnings to $880 million, which is up 68% year-on-year. And finally, our after-tax distributable earnings came in at $660 million or $0.75 per share. One additional note here, our tax rate in the quarter was a bit elevated. The driver of this was a large accident that was structured in a way that resulted in the recognition of 100% of our tax expense, while only realizing approximately 50% of the investment income. Absent this, our after-tax DE would have been $0.81 for the quarter versus the $0.75 we reported this morning. Looking forward, we do expect will benefit from the reverse of this, as that investment is monetized and those gains become realized without the burden of the tax expense. Turning to deployment, coming off a record year in 2020, our total capital investment came in at $7 billion for the quarter and $31 billion over the last 12 months, which is up over 30% from the prior period. Importantly, when you dig a little deeper, our private markets deployment, which is generally longer dated and has higher profit potential, was up 77% versus the prior LTM period. That's bigger is really the best representation for how we lean in as an organization over the last 12 months. With much of that capital having been deployed or committed during the market downturn earlier in 2020. We do think our activity levels here are relatively distinguished across our many peers, where deployment across private market strategies tended to be flat to down year-over-year. At the same time, we've never deployed more capital in our 45-year history. We are very confident that this elevated level of deployment will serve us well for years to come as those investments mature. And finally, turning to our balance sheet. Our book value per share is currently $25.84, which is up 12% from last quarter and up more than 50% versus March of 2020. Even if you compare this performance to pre-pandemic levels, our book value per share is up almost 35% in a little bit over a year and it's another tangible example of our business models ability to compound capital. Moving away from the specifics of the quarter, as I look at our overall performance, I think, there are really four things worth noting. First, we had a really strong quarter. We reported $0.41 of FRE per share and $0.75 after-tax DE per share, and as you know from our guidance, we expect an acceleration in both of these figures. The second relates to the strong investment performance we've continued to deliver on behalf of our limited partners. Craig ran you through the performance statistics for the quarter, as well as the last 12 months really do stand out. But I think even more telling and differentiating our platform versus others is our investment performance over a multiyear period of time. As just one example, our current flagship Americas, Europe and Asia PE fund had gross returns of 49%, 26% and 44% from inception. This is directly led to the high levels of fundraising momentum that we are currently benefiting from. And this framework is not limited to private equity. At our Investor Day, we detailed the strength of our investment performance across our four growth and real asset and credit platforms. As a firm, we have a 45-year history of investment excellence and we're continuing to build on this long track record of success. Third point is the significant amount of related earnings inside of the firm that we expect to flow through our operating earnings over the next number of years. At our Investor Day, one of the statistics we discussed was the $9.1 billion of total unrealized gains in our balance sheet at the end of 2020. Those are embedded gains from our investments, as well as gross unrealized carry. That $9.1 billion increase to $12.3 billion as of the end of March. That number can obviously move around a bit and will apart be driven by the overall tone in the markets. However, the $3 plus billion move in only three months and in a quarter with a heavy level of realized activity. I think really illustrates the strength of the underlying investments and also what it means for our ability to generate realized profitability over the next number of years. And finally, we're off to a really great start with GA and we really just began to see the impact of how Global Atlantic can flow through our financial results. There's a lot more for us to do here and we'll keep you abreast of our progress in the quarters ahead. All of this really does support why we expect significant acceleration of after-tax DE to the $4 to $5 range by the 2023, 2024 timeframe. Remember, this earnings power is largely already in our firm. We have a lot of conviction that we'll be able to execute on our strategy and continue to deliver really meaningful results for our LPs, shareholders, employees and all the communities that we operate in. And with that, let me hand it off to Scott for some closing thoughts. Hey, Craig. It's Rob. Really good question and so a couple things. As we thought about our IMA and how to approach in that across our strategy, we really looked at where the underlying investments were at Global Atlantic, most of those are credit oriented and will fit in our public markets business, but there are a number that are in the real estate space, principally real estate credit and so we've put those across our real estate business. As it relates to rotating the Global Atlantic balance sheet and to take their products, we are in the very early innings of that. We think there's a lot of opportunity for the Global Atlantic balance sheet, as well as our Asset Management businesses being able to get that rotation done. We're just a couple months in here and that's going to take some time to make sure that we get ramped up. We'll provide additional updates over time. But we're not really seeing the benefit of that the Global Atlantic had nor the KKR. Yeah. That's a good question. Obviously, you're right, you've got two months of GA, as opposed to full three months. I think on that basis you'd certainly be able to look at it in a cleaner way on the quarter. Of course, given where our IMA is sat and we talked at the last call that that's maximum of 30 basis points, that's going to have downward pressure on overall fee margin. But I think Q1 could be a good indication, probably, with a little bit more downward pressure, because you have the extra month offset by the fact that, we've got a really good and healthy outlook in fundraising across a number of our private strategies that have higher fee rates associated with them. So a bit of a challenging question to fully answer, Chris, but hopefully, that gives you a little bit of a flavor around where blended fee rates can go across the enterprise. Yeah. Thanks for your question, Gerry. It is new this quarter and really reflects how we've tried to revamp our P&L to make it on a lot of ways. We think easier to understand and also more comparable with a number of our peers. And so what you'd expect to see in that line item. Really our incentive fees more from our perpetual capital vehicles, where the incentive fees that we generate are based on the underlying yield of the portfolio as opposed to mark-to-market. So things that are more stable in nature, the types of products that you're going to see in there are going to be Type 1 incentive fees across our BDC platform, some of the core vehicles that we're raising across infrastructure and credit, we've got a couple of SMEs that got have comparable type of fee arrangement. So those are the types of fees you're going to see. We see a big opportunity over the next number of years to really scale that line item up for the firm and we thought it made sense to break it out as distinct from incentive fees based off of mark-to-market performance, like, a number of our peers have done in the past. Hi, Rob. I will take the first shot at that. So that's good question, and obviously, one of the big opportunities for us is to really be able to work with the GA management to go get the scale, which they believe is out there in the industry, and Alan, at our Investor Day, as you noted, did a really good job articulating the different $1 billion plus growth opportunities that are available. And so we've got a couple of different ways to be able to go after that and do feel like we're well set up. One, we raised $250 million of primary capital at the time of closing a couple months ago the first primary capital raise that the company has done. So that's very meaningful in terms of our ability to scale up the platform. Number two, you noted the sidecar, and we think there's a real opportunity from the sidecar finance perspective going forward that can start to be able to go after these growth opportunities. And the last and I'd say, Rob, is one of the big strategic attractions of this transaction, I think, both for the GA management team and also as we evaluated this deal was our ability to help them access capital, when really meaningful growth opportunities are became available. And so, we're very focused on that and I do think that there's a real opportunity here for us to be able to go obtain additional capital, if it's required for things that make a ton of sense from a growth perspective for GA. Yeah. Thanks, Chris. Good question. So, yes, the -- our Insurance segment, we thought the right way to illustrate that was on a post-tax basis and so that's a fully tax number that you're seeing for our Insurance segment. As it relates to our blended tax rate, and I would say, our guidance here really hasn't changed since we became C-Corp and we benefit from a step up in basis that we had at the time of the C-Corp conversion. And that's why you see our tax rate out for the time being that has trended below the statutory rate, obviously, this quarter, in particular, you had some noise, upward pressure that I mentioned. But I think, a mid-to-high-teens type tax rate that's going up over time and landing in the low 20s at the statutory rate over time, as our step up comes down over time is the right way to think about taxes at KKR. So, not too dissimilar from what you've heard from us over the years, other than the fact that the step up will continue to come down over time and our tax rate will slowly migrate up."

            "content": "Thank you, Rob, and thank you everyone for joining our call today. Given the reason Investor Day, I'm going to be very brief. As a firm, we have never had a stronger team, better connectivity, stronger investment results, higher unrealized gains and carry, more businesses scaling and reaching their inflection points, and more fund in and coming in. As a result, we have never had more ways to grow, more visibility on that growth and we're confident in our future. And all of that is before Global Atlantic, which gives us even more perpetual capital, even more visibility, even more ways to grow and a fantastic management that will make us even stronger and faster. We are hopeful all that came through during the Investor Day and we are looking forward to keeping you updated on our progress. With that, we're happy to take your questions. Hey, Glenn. Thanks for the questions. First, with respect to long dated partnerships, we are still pursuing those. So these for everybody's benefit are the oftentimes multi-decade recycling strategic partnerships that will create with institutional investors largely, largely they're invested across asset classes and have some component of recycling to them. And so we continue to pursue those. They take a long time to structure. But we continue to have an active pipeline. So don't take any message from the Investor Day lack of commentary just continues to be something that we're focused on going. We'll have update for you over time, because there's a couple that are getting close. On the secondary side, as we've mentioned in the past, we continue to look at the space. We're analyzing whether we want to build or whether there's something that might make sense to buy, really hard to have to buy work from a cultural fit standpoint at times, but we are looking and we'll have more to share with you over time. But nothing more to share today except that we continue to pursue it. Thanks for the question, Alex. As you know, it's really been a great fundraising environment, by the best we've seen in a long time. We're seeing increased engagement from investors across the Board across different asset classes and we do find ourselves in some situations in the happy circumstance where a fund might be a capacity constraint and we're able to talk to them about different things that we're doing. So, for example, as you know, we raise our private equity flagship funds in a bit of a different way than others. We have three regional funds, as opposed to one global fund and we just closed Asia, we're in the market right now with Americas, Europe will come relatively quickly on the back of the Americas fundraise. There's core, there's growth, there's a lot of different ways we can talk to investors across just privately before you get to real assets and credit. And so that incremental potential demand that we oftentimes will see especially lately, we're able to pivot some of that unmet demand into some of these other asset classes and strategies that are adjacent and that's the focus right now. Yeah. Thanks a lot, Devin. I'll answer the second part of your question first. Potential pending tax legislation will have no impact on how we monetize our portfolio. It is really about making sure that we're a fiduciary for our clients and exiting it at the appropriate time. In terms of our outlook for monetizing the portfolio, as you noted, there's a very significant amount of embedded gains. Our expectation is here -- here is that we've got a number of assets particularly on the core side that for a number of years can compound in capital, but we also have a fairly mature portfolio that we think can get realized over the coming quarters here. I know one of the questions that we get a lot in this forum and so I will answer as part of this overall questions is what our forward visibility looks like in terms of monetizing our revenue from an investment perspective and a performance perspective. As relates to Q2 specifically, we already have visibility and a very substantial amount of revenue we have. As of now, that line of sight is $700 plus million of performance and investment income. So as a reminder, this is from deals that are already closed or have been signed up and that we expect to close in Q2. In terms of split, as I know that for now especially our articulating compensation. I'd say, it's probably 60 to two-thirds carried interest and the remainder in investment income. Thanks. Very good question, Michael. It's Scott. As we mentioned at Investor Day, we have created or been partnered with others on about 16 or so origination platforms. And they're getting to be quite substantial, 4,000 employees, $100 plus billion of AUM or balance sheet across the entire group. Just by way of background, these were largely created out of our private credit business, in particular, private credit opportunities vehicles, where we saw an opportunity in asset based finance on the back of banks pulling back from a number of different asset classes, where we thought the risk reward was really pretty interesting. That effort was started clearly before the Global Atlantic transaction. And so what we're doing right now is we're in the process of thinking about how do we want to pivot this strategy and how do we want to evolve what we're doing there in light of the significant demand that Global Atlantic has for those underlying asset classes and that origination. And so, think of it this way, we started really just funding entirely out of the funds and then we started to move a little bit more of a hybrid approach. So we created an aircraft leasing business as an example called Altavair, that was created as almost like a joint venture between our infrastructure business, our private credit business and our balance sheet. And so we've been moving in the direction of actually trying to think about the answer to your question this own versus partner. And I think what you'll find and we'll share this, our thinking with you going forward, is that we are going to have some of these that will be more transitory and we own for a while and then move on and sell as fiduciaries for our funds. And we may have some that over time move into more the Altavair type approach which is a bit of a hybrid. But with the addition of Global Atlantic, it really broaden us how we can think about investing in this space and some of this stuff, it might make sense to make more permanent either on the KKR balance sheet or the Global Atlantic balance sheet, or both."

During today\u2019s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. And following management\u2019s prepared remarks, the conference will be opened for questions. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now hand the call over to Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.\nCraig Larson: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. This morning, as usual, I\u2019m joined by Rob Lewin, our Chief Financial Officer; and Scott Nuttall, our Co-Chief Executive Officer. We\u2019d like to remind everyone that we will refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, which is available on the Investor Center section at kkr.com. And as a reminder, we report our segment numbers on an adjusted share basis. This call will contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to our earnings release and our SEC filings for cautionary factors about these statements. So this quarter, we\u2019re pleased to be reporting solid results with $0.63 of fee-related earnings per share and $0.92 of after-tax distributable earnings per share. I\u2019ll start by walking through the quarter. So beginning first with management fees. Management fee growth continues to be a real bright spot for us. In Q4, management fees were $706 million, that\u2019s up 5% compared to last quarter, and up 19% compared to Q4 of 2021. And comparing full year 2022 to 2021, management fees increased 28% from $2.1 billion to $2.7 billion. Growth in full year 2022 was greatest within our Real Assets business where management fees increased over 50%. Net transaction and monitoring fees were $195 million, with our Capital Markets business, generating $144 million of revenue in the quarter. Now to go through expenses. Our fee-related compensation margin for the quarter was 20%, which is at the low end of our 20% to 25% range. Rob is actually going to circle back on this topic in a moment. And other operating expenses for us were $177 million. The increase here compared to last quarter was driven by higher professional fees given activity levels across the firm as well as increased expenses related to capital raising. So in total, fee-related earnings for Q4 were $559 million or $0.63 per share with an FRE margin of 61%. Moving to realized performance income. We generated $339 million with realized carried interest driven by monetizations of Minnesota Rubber and Plastics as well as a number of public positions while realized incentive fees were driven by the crystallization of performance fees at Marshall Wace. Realized investment income was $223 million for the quarter. Overall, our asset management operating earnings came in at $946 million. Now turning to our insurance segment. Global Atlantic had another strong quarter, generating $165 million of operating earnings. This quarter, the results were driven by an increase in invested assets from new business growth alongside a continued rotation into higher-yielding assets. This resulted in after-tax DE for us of $822 million, or $0.92 per share. Now turning to investment performance and Pages 7 and 8 of our earnings release. Page 7 shows investment performance across our major asset classes for the fourth quarter as well as the full year. Beginning first with traditional private equity, the portfolio was flat in Q4 and off 14% for the year. Those figures are below public indices for the quarter and ahead of public indices for 2022. In real estate in the quarter, the portfolio was marked down by 8%, driven by a widening of cap rates on unrealized investments, offset some by strong rent growth in the quarter. And for the year, the portfolio appreciated 3% meaningfully ahead of public REITs as well as broad real estate indices. The infrastructure portfolio was up 3% in the quarter and up 9% for the year, very strong performance in infra given broad volatility again across markets. And on the leveraged credit side, the portfolio was up 3% for the quarter and minus 3% for the year. And our alternative credit portfolio was up 1% in Q4 and up 2% for the year. Volatility in 2022, of course, was not limited to trust the equity markets, investment grade and high-yield indices declined 13% and 11% over the course of the year. Now perhaps more important are the figures that you see on Page 8 of the earnings release. This page shows investment performance since inception across our recent funds that have been investing for two-plus years. The figures you see here, of course, reflects any marks taken in Q4 or over the course of 2022. Looking at this page and taken together, we continue to feel very good about the returns we\u2019ve been generating on behalf of our clients. In terms of our balance sheet investments, performance was flat in the quarter and down 5% for the year, again, against a volatile backdrop. Of note here, core private equity investments on the balance sheet have continued to perform. For the quarter and the year, the core PE portfolio appreciated 7% \u2013 excuse me, appreciated 5% and 7%, respectively. Turning to capital metrics. We raised $16 billion in the quarter. This was driven by fundraising across our growth and traditional PE strategies, leverage credit, a block transaction at Global Atlantic alongside incremental flows at GA. This brings our full year 2022 total new capital raised to $81 billion. Our assets under management increased to $504 billion as of 12/31 with fee-paying AUM coming in at $412 billion. We continue to find opportunities to invest deploying $16 billion in the quarter. Infrastructure and traditional private equity accounted for about half of the Q4 deployment with opportunities to disperse globally. And finally, before handing it to Rob, consistent with our historical approach, we\u2019re pleased to announce our intention to increase our annual dividend policy from $0.62 to $0.66 per share. This change will go into effect for the dividend announced alongside first quarter 2023 earnings. And at the same time, we\u2019ve increased our stock repurchase authorization back up to $500 million. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Rob.\nRob Lewin: Thanks a lot, Craig. And thank you, everyone, for joining our call this morning. I thought I would begin by giving you a sense of our recent annual planning meetings. We got our senior team together earlier this year to review where we are as firm, where we\u2019re going and most importantly, what we need to get right to capture the opportunity that is in front of us. Listening and participating in these discussions was incredibly energizing. We\u2019ve never had a stronger team and been more aligned around where we are going as a firm. We have a number of very clear avenues for long-term and sustainable growth and more confidence than ever in our ability to achieve it. I\u2019m going to step through some of these more material opportunities for growth in a minute. But before I do that, I first wanted to emphasize just a few points about 2022. Starting with our fundraising, we raised $81 billion of capital last year, the second most active year in our history and of course, all against a much more complex market backdrop and without significant contributions from our flagship strategies. Over 70% of our fundraising last year came in our real assets and credit businesses, strategies that are often front of mind for our clients in rising interest rate as well as inflationary environments. Moving to deployment, we invested a healthy amount of capital over the last 12 months. Looking at private equity and real assets taken together, deployment here was approximately 20% greater in 2022 compared to 2021 as teams were able to find very creative ways to put capital to work. For example, across PE, growth in Infra, we announced or closed on ten take private transactions over the course of the year. And as our footprint has scaled and become more diversified, so has our deployment. Real asset strategies were 16% of total firm deployment activity in 2020, that number totaled almost 40% in 2022. Over that same two-year period, credit deployment has increased approximately two and a half times as the business has expanded with Global Atlantic as a partner and new focus funds such as asset-based finance. And finally, I\u2019d like to circle back to our compensation expense and the comp margins that you saw in Q4. Fee-related compensation was 20% of fee-related revenues. That is at the low end of the 20% to 25% range that we\u2019ve articulated historically. While realized investment income comp was 10% of realized investment income, also at the low end, in this case, of the outlined 10% to 20% range. Carried interest comp was at the mid of the quarter which, as a reminder, is 65%. This had the impact of reducing our total compensation margin for the quarter, which including equity-based comp, was 32%. Given realized carried interest generation across KKR over the course of 2022, we felt that we could move to the low end of our FRE and investment income compensation ranges and show some expense discipline in support of our operating earnings, while importantly, still ensuring that we have the capacity to recruit, retain and incent world-class investment, distribution and operations talent. As we think about levers that we have as a firm to generate long-term earnings growth from here, operating leverage is really a key component. As a reminder, KKR employees own approximately 30% of our stock. So, we are very well aligned to drive margin improvement across the business. And before I switch gears, let me give you an update on the outlook for Q1 monetization activity. Things have slowed a bit on the monetization side, but nothing that is surprising to us given the environment and how we\u2019re thinking about the timing of when we want to generate realization outcomes for our limited partners. So, as we stand here today, we have visibility on approximately $250 million of monetization-related revenue for the first quarter. Now turning the page and looking forward, we think there are really six key areas that are going to drive significant growth for KKR for several years to come. The first area is real assets, where we have seen meaningful growth across our platform. AUM at the end of Q4 stood at $119 billion. That\u2019s compared to just $28 billion at the end of 2019, so four times growth in three years. Growth in infrastructure has been driven not only by our flagship fund, but also our extension into areas such as core as well as Asia Pacific. The real estate platform continues to grow across a full suite of ten-plus products, further propelled by both Global Atlantic on the credit side and our acquisition of KJRM on the equity side. Our momentum across our real assets platform is obviously quite significant and aligns well with a big area of current focus from our limited partners. The second area of meaningful growth for KKR is continuing to leverage our market-leading position in Asia Pacific. Looking at our progress in 2022, our Asia infrastructure strategy raised almost $6 billion, the largest in the geography, and we closed on our first Asia credit fund as well. Looking ahead, we expect our Asia real estate strategy to expand in 2023 as well our Asia tech growth franchise. And as I mentioned a moment ago, our acquisition of KJRM, which is our Japanese real estate business, is a great example of how we can use our balance sheet to strategically pursue inorganic growth to both enhance our market position as well as to access differentiated forms of capital. Looking at this progress altogether. Our Asia-focused AUM has now increased to $60 billion at the end of the year, that\u2019s up roughly three times since 2019. Our local presence paired with our KKR toolkit has created industry-leading business against very compelling long-term macro fundamentals in the region. The third area for us is core private equity, which is just a massive opportunity. As the addressable market is very significant, and the P&L impact can be positive across so many different parts of our financials. And most importantly, it is an area where we believe that we have the business model and culture that sets us up well to be the best global player in the asset class. As a quick reminder, Core PE is a long-duration investment strategy, and we expect to hold these investments for 10 to 15 plus years. We currently have 19 businesses within our core portfolio. These businesses generally have lower leverage than traditional private equity investments tend to be less cyclical and are more cash generative. These traits do create a more stable earnings profile within the portfolio. Today, we manage roughly $18 billion of third-party capital, which I believe is the largest in our space. The AUM we manage positively impacts our management fees, transaction fees as well as carried interest. But core PE also accounts for over 30% of our balance sheet investments. Yet these investments only accounted for 1% of our after-tax distributable earnings in 2022 when you look at their flow-through impact to realized investment income. Looking at this another way, and to highlight this point even further, if you look through our balance sheet to the core PE portfolio, our portion of the company\u2019s EBITDA totals over $600 million. This is not accounted for in our distributable earnings. Make no mistake, this 30-plus percent allocation is purposeful. It is by design because we have a substantial opportunity to really compound our investments in an asset class where we know that we have differentiated capabilities. The fourth big driver for us is private wealth. We currently manage $67 billion of capital here compared to $37 billion in 2019. Approximately 15% of new capital raise has historically been sourced from this investor cohort, mostly from high net worth clients and in traditional drawdown products. Over time, we expect all private wealth focused capital will account for 30% to 50% of the capital that we raised as a firm. And along this path, we will continue to expand our footprint in the democratized access vehicle space. Our ambitions and views of the long-term opportunities we see for KKR have not changed. Next, my fifth point is our continued focus on the insurance space. Going back to July 2020 at the announcement of the Global Atlantic acquisition, their AUM was $72 billion. Today, it\u2019s close to $140 billion. So it\u2019s grown about 2x in the last 2.5 years. Our thesis in buying GA was multifold. We believe that the combination of a leading life and annuity franchise with multiple ways to expand against compelling market fundamentals, combined with KKR\u2019s origination and capital capabilities could lead to strong growth in AUM, operating earnings and book value while also delivering for policyholders. This has really played out and looking ahead remains a key strategic priority for us. Not only is the $139 billion of GE Capital itself perpetual, but the business has also helped us grow our third-party insurance client AUM to $56 billion. That\u2019s up from $26 billion at the time of the GA acquisition announcement as we have continued to create products that are tailored to this unique investor base. And finally, the sixth high-impact long-term growth driver for us is our balance sheet. I said the same thing last quarter as well. But there\u2019s really not a corporate that I know that doesn\u2019t wish they had more capital availability right now. The balance sheet has a clear competitive advantage in its continued ability to enable and accelerate growth in a way that is less dilutive for our public shareholders. To highlight this point, M&A, our investments in core private equity, our buildup in the insurance space and share buybacks have all accounted for roughly 90% of our net balance sheet deployment over the past five years. And we expect that trend to continue over the coming several years as well. This is just another tool that we have to be able to drive earnings per share over time. To summarize, we continue to feel extremely positive about our future outlook. The six drivers that I just went through are particularly impactful for our long-term success, and we have real conviction across the entirety of our management team in our ability to build on our existing momentum. With that, let me hand it off to Scott.\nScott Nuttall: Thank you, Rob, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. I thought today, I would share how things look from Joe\u2019s and my seat. There is no doubt that markets and the economy remain dynamic. There\u2019s also no doubt many remaining focused on the macro, quarterly results, short-term catalysts and the near-term outlook for our industry and business. In summary, there\u2019s a lot of noise out there. We find that noise is just that noise. We continue to raise capital, find interesting deployment opportunities and selectively monetize our portfolio. It\u2019s business as usual at KKR. So from our seats, while the noise creates some questions, it\u2019s important to not let it become a distraction. Building KKR is a long-term effort that takes years of planning and investment to get right. Many of the businesses we are scaling now were started over 10 years ago. And many of the businesses we are starting now will be scaling for decades to come. We are singularly focused on what we need to get right: talent, culture, performance, clients and operations. If we get those things right, we will double KKR again at a rapid pace. If we don\u2019t, our growth will be slower than it could be. Growth is the result of execution. So as a management team, we are focused on what we can control and executing on those five fronts. The good news is that as we look back at recent progress, we feel like our strategy is being executed well and the results are emerging. Named just a couple of things we look to as evidence. In the last two years, our AUM has doubled from $250 billion to $500 billion and our fee-paying AUM has more than doubled. And over the same two years, our management fees and TDE per share have almost doubled as well. So the results of execution are starting to come through. But these metrics are backward looking. What\u2019s even more encouraging to us is the strong evidence we have of growth continuing to be very attractive for years to come. Some of this may be apparent for these calls and some less so. To name just a few of the things that we are looking at. First, we\u2019ve continued to create new businesses over the last several years. In fact, over 50% of the capital we raised last year was in strategies that did not even exist five years ago. And over 50% of our AUM is not yet scaled in our definition. Said another way, we have had a lot of recent innovation and half of the assets we now manage are still approaching the inflection part of the growth curve. Second, our dry powder has grown from $67 billion to $108 billion over the last two years, positioning us well to invest into this environment, which we continue to find attractive. Third, our efforts in democratized products are just starting. We expect to have multiple vehicles launched this year after two years of structuring and team building work. This is upside for us and we expect will be an additional growth engine for the firm across all of our asset classes. Fourth, Global Atlantic goes from strength to strength, and has almost doubled assets since we announced the transaction 2.5 years ago, well ahead of schedule with significant opportunity ahead. Fifth, and maybe less visible, our sales team has grown from 100 people to 280 people in the last two years across institutions, insurance, family offices and private wealth. It typically takes a year or two for a new salesperson to learn our products and hit their stride. The result of this investment will show up over the next couple of years and create even more wind at our back. Sixth, our carry-bearing invested dollars in the ground have increased dramatically. It\u2019s important to understand that the cash carry we generated last year largely came from investments we made five-plus years ago when our AUM was a fraction of what it is today and our carry eligible invested capital was as well. To be specific, the vast majority of last year\u2019s carry came from harvesting investments made when our carry earning invested capital was roughly $50 billion. Today, it\u2019s about $150 billion, up 3 times. So don\u2019t let the near-term monetization environment divert your attention from what matters. The forward is incredibly strong as this much larger scale of invested capital matures with the returns on the slide Craig showed you. And finally, and perhaps most important, our team has never been stronger or more cohesive. In summary, over the last several years, we\u2019ve made the investments for the next leg of growth at KKR and see years of opportunity ahead. And as we\u2019ve done all this, the earnings power of KKR continues to increase. This is true regardless of the near-term noise and markets and is what gives us such confidence in our outlook. So don\u2019t get distracted by the noise. The signals are strong and our confidence is high. With that, we\u2019re happy to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we\u2019ll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Good morning, everyone. Hope you\u2019re all doing well.\nCraig Larson: Hey Craig, good morning.\nRob Lewin: Hey Craig.\nCraig Siegenthaler: So my question is on Global Atlantic. I wanted to get an update and hear how early stage credit quality metrics have trended inside of this business, especially given prospects that we may be entering a recession in the U.S. in the first half of this year.\nRob Lewin: Hey Craig, it\u2019s Rob. Thanks a lot for the question. The very short answer is that GA continues to trend really well as it relates to its credit exposures. We\u2019ve talked about this in prior calls, but 95% of GA\u2019s book is rated NAIC 1 or NAIC 2, so investment-grade in nature. The equity book at GA is sub 1% of total assets. And so we\u2019ve done a bottoms up across the entire portfolio as we\u2019ve gone into year-end and feel really good with how the strength of the balance sheet is holding up.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nAlex Blostein: Hey guys, good morning. I was hoping maybe we could talk a little bit about margins and scale in the business. So Rob, this is probably for you. But you guys were able to bring down FRE comp this year partially because of pretty good monetization activity this year, I think, as you alluded in your prepared remarks. So if monetization income weakens in 2023 for variety of cyclical factors, should we think about that drifting back higher? Or is there enough sort of scale in the business where FRE comp rate could be at a lower run rate on a more sustainable basis? And I guess, bigger picture, I was hoping we can maybe just, again, kind of double click into how monetization activity flows through the margins in other parts of the business. You guys report and we sort of think about it in silos, but that\u2019s ultimately not how you sort of pay your people. So wrapping all of that around, we\u2019re hoping get a little more color. Thanks.\nRob Lewin: Yes. Got it. Thanks, Alex. A lot in there. So let me try and tackle one at a time. First, let me just start with margins. We believe that we\u2019ve created a business model that allows for best-in-class FRE margins. And we\u2019ve been consistent for a number of quarters now, a number of years now probably that assuming reasonable market conditions. We\u2019ve got a business that can sustainably drive a low 60% FRE margins in spite of some of the investments that we\u2019re making back into our business. But over time, as those investments that we\u2019re making pay off and as the fees come in on the back of those investments as well as the efficiencies, we believe that we can create a business model that delivers mid-60% FRE margins. I think that\u2019s going to come in a couple forms. I think that will come from operating expense leverage. I think it also has the potential to come from compensation expense leverage as you would\u2019ve seen in Q4 of this year. Now taking back to how we thought about compensation margin inside of the quarter, I\u2019d say a couple things as it relates to that. The first, we want make sure that we\u2019ve got and I said this on the prepared remarks, the right amount of compensation in our business such that we can recruit, retain, and incent world-class talent across the board at KKR. And as we looked at the pool of compensation that we had available in 2022, we made the determination that in Q4, we can operate at the bottom end of that range. Now you asked the question of monetization activity comes down next year where might that shake out? I instead would look at it across our total comp margin. And what we\u2019ve guided historically is on a total comp margin, we can operate in the low-40% range. In 2022, we were at 39.7%, I believe, 2019, 2020 and 2021. We were below that 40% guidance number. And if monetization comes down and carried interest comes down, that\u2019s our highest comp margin at 65%. And so all things equal, you would expect compensation margin across the board to come down. So there was a lot in your question, but hopefully I got at most of it and happy to catch up more offline on the topic.\nScott Nuttall: Yes, Alex, the only thing I would add is our people understand that monetizations, if they come down, compensation is going to come down as a result. Our business, you get paid on cash outcomes. So I don\u2019t think that would be a surprise to anybody.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi. Thanks very much. So I\u2019m a big believer in the big picture growth picture that you laid out. So cool with that. One of the five things you talked about getting right is performance, and I think your long-term performance is awesome. I want to focus on 2022 for a second, get the right perspective, PE down 14%. I think just the fourth quarter real estate was down 8%, leveraged credit down 3%. I want to \u2013 I know it\u2019s a longer tail. I know your long-term track record is great. I wonder if we could talk about the right perspective on portfolio composition or how you do marks relative to Publix \u2013 that was only the only Achilles heel that caught my eye in the quarter. Thanks.\nRob Lewin: Yes. Hey, Glenn, Glenn, it\u2019s Rob. Thanks for question. Why don\u2019t I just start with valuation methodology because I think that that\u2019s really important for this discussion? Then Craig and Scott could spend some time as it relates to performance. We\u2019ve been reporting as a public entity now for close to 17 years if you include KPE, which was the predecessor closed-end fund the KKR merged into. And we really do believe that over that period of time, we\u2019ve developed best-in-class process for determining fair value for our Level 3 assets, which are those assets that don\u2019t have observable marks. Our exact process and methodology is, of course, by its nature, different by asset class, but what is most important to us is that we have a consistent process and methodology quarter after quarter after quarter. And we believe that aspect is critical in delivering a fair and representative view on fair value, which we think you\u2019ve seen over time and in 2022. I think the other thing that\u2019s worth mentioning on valuation methodology, as part of our consistent process, we\u2019ve got a third-party valuation agent, excuse me, who is an expert in their respective space and they either perform the valuation exercise or provide positive assurance on those investments. So if you look at our history, we feel we\u2019ve gotten that balance right and that our portfolio is certainly impacted by market movements as well as by inputs like interest rates and equity risk premiums that might impact DCFs offset over the course of the year by operating performance as well. And so I think it\u2019s important really to understand that our methodology doesn\u2019t change and it\u2019s consistent quarter-over-quarter. And in that respect, we feel really good that we\u2019re delivering the right representative mark across our portfolio.\nCraig Larson: And then Glenn, it\u2019s Craig. I did have \u2013 why don\u2019t I just pick up on one of the statistics you mentioned on opportunistic real estate. And there are really two points there. Rob\u2019s already hit on the first just as it relates to the consistency around that process for us and the work we do with evaluation agent. In the case of real estate, specifically that value agent will look at recent transactions and they\u2019ll come up with cap rate and discount rate assumptions for that specific quarter. So in a quarter like Q4, transaction activity was really muted. Volumes in the U.S. were off something like 60%, but in those observable transactions our cap rates widened. And so that\u2019s really what drove the performance figure in real estate that you saw for the quarter. Now, the second point, which we think is more important honestly, is the fundamentals in the portfolio itself. As our \u2013 we continue to feel great about the portfolio as well as those fundamentals. So our exposures continue to be weighted towards those assets and themes where you\u2019re seeing strong fundamentals and strong growth. Industrial assets, data centers, rental housing, student housing, storage, those are over 80% of the portfolio in total, and we\u2019re seeing strong fundamentals and cash flow growth there. On the flip side, we globally have only 1% exposure to retail, and our U.S. office exposure is below 5%. And then just to help put those two things together, to give you a sense, if we had used constant cap rate and discount rate assumptions in Q4, you actually would\u2019ve seen the portfolio marked up in the quarter instead of that down for the quarter percentage that you did see. So again we are really benefiting from strong underlying NOI growth, and that dynamic is really the reason that we put in Page 8. So I think as our clients evaluate us across our strategies, they\u2019re looking at this inception performance, much less focused on any 90 day period, et cetera. And I think when you look at, since inception, as you noted and we appreciate that in your beginning of the question, the performance figures and in the case of real assets and real estate, the blue bars, I think we feel great about how we\u2019ve been performing on behalf of our clients.\nScott Nuttall: Hey Glenn, it\u2019s Scott. Just \u2013 if I were you, I\u2019d be trying to figure out is there anything to worry about here? And the punchline from my standpoint is no. I think as the guy said, we\u2019ve had a very consistent methodology. It\u2019s not at all surprise given the markets have been off, multiples have been off, they see some marks come down, but they\u2019re just that marks. What matters to us is the fundamental operating performance of the portfolio, which continues to be really strong. If anything, we feel even better that we got it right in terms of investing behind the right themes the last several years, revenue and profitability metrics remain strong. The fundamental operating performance of our real asset book and our credit book remains strong, candidly, bit stronger than I might have expected given what\u2019s going on with the economy and the backdrop. So, overall we\u2019re not worried about it. I would suggest you\u2019re not worried about it either. My expectation is as markets rebound, you\u2019ll see the marks rebound as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian McKenna with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian McKenna: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So you\u2019ve done a great job expanding into a number of adjacent strategies and products over the past several years. I\u2019m curious though, as we think about the next three to five years, should we expect this expansion into new areas to persist or will more of the focus be going deeper in the strategies you have today and moving more of these platforms from earlier stages of the life cycle to more mature and scale stages?\nRob Lewin: Brian, thanks for the question. I think it\u2019s going to be much more focused around taking what we have today and scaling that up. We think there\u2019s more than enough room to have very substantial growth. And as we\u2019ve outlined, our 2026 profitability measure is greater than $4 of FRE per share, $7 of TD per share, that doesn\u2019t rely on adding a lot of new products that we\u2019re doing. That said, we continue the focus on innovation. We are likely to add products over time where we believe there\u2019s large addressable markets and where we can be a top player in the world of what we do. But that list is going to be small because I think we believe that if we go execute on what we have in front of us today take that 50% of our products that aren\u2019t yet at scale and get them to scale that the growth opportunity is going to be much larger than starting something new from scratch.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Brown with KBW. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Brown: Great. Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to start with GA. It\u2019s clearly a strong quarter there. And then given the favorable rate backdrop and the good new business trends that you\u2019ve been seeing, any thoughts on how we should think about the next six to 12 months from that business? If you could maybe touch on the net investment income and the net cost of insurance, that would certainly be helpful. Thanks.\nRob Lewin: Yes. Great. Thanks a lot for the question. Clearly, Global Atlantic in the two years of our ownership has had really outstanding performance. And we had targeted 12% to 13% type of ROEs. We\u2019ve out achieved that over the course of 2021 and again in 2022. I do still believe that that\u2019s the right level which to model GA on a go-forward basis. We are benefiting right now on the investment \u2013 net investment side of the business, we\u2019re certainly benefiting from greater deployment as we\u2019ve rotated on our portfolio, which we took some upfront losses on given where interest rates are and have put that into higher-yielding securities. We\u2019ve also benefited while we are pretty well asset liability matched. We do have a decent size floating rate book. And so as interest rates have gone up, GA has benefited from that as well. At the same time, though, cost of insurance has, of course, gone up the price at which we price our annuities has gone up. But I think the team has done a really good job on the operating expense side of the business. And overall, you\u2019re seeing that operating leverage flow through. So, we continue to be really encouraged. I think 12% to 13% still the right range to model that business going forward, and hopefully, they\u2019re going to continue to be able to outperform.\nOperator: Our next question is from Gerry O\u2019Hara with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nGerry O\u2019Hara: Great, thanks. Good morning folks. Obviously, fund raising [ph] remains a topical item. So just sort of hoping you could comment a little bit on how conversations with LPs have been evolving over the past several months. And also to the extent you might be able to sort of address this whole dynamic around LP allocations and their sort of \u201cbudget\u201d as we look into 2023 and beyond. Thank you. \nScott Nuttall: Thanks, Gerry, it\u2019s Scott. I\u2019ll take that one. It\u2019s hard to answer that question in Chris [ph] fashion because it kind of depends on where you are and who you\u2019re talking to. So there\u2019s no doubt, kind of as we got into the back half of last year, some of our LPs were struggling with allocations on the back of a reduced denominator, that was predominantly a U.S. pension fund dynamic. As the calendar has turned, and there\u2019s a new budget year, some of that has softened and we\u2019re having conversations that indicate they\u2019re looking to put capital to work. But if you go outside the U.S., Middle East, Asia, sovereign wealth, insurance, in particular, you find investors aren\u2019t struggling with those same issues. In fact, several of them are very forward leaning and trying to figure out how to invest into this environment. So the overall picture is not consistent depending on where you are. What is very consistent, though is, we\u2019re finding this year, just like last, a lot of interest in a couple of themes. Anything with inflation protection and yield. So, I think real estate, infrastructure, credit, significant amount of interest. I\u2019d say an increased awareness that in times like this, all things, private equity tend to perform quite well. So it should be some very strong vintage years coming out of this period of time. So people are kind of swinging a bit to think about how to take advantage of this environment. So, I\u2019d say people are more in their front foot this year overall than maybe last year. And there\u2019s more of the conversations gearing toward how do I invest into this in a thoughtful way. And then part of that is people look back and post-GFC and maybe post the initial stages of COVID, some of which they were maybe a little bit more aggressive in terms of deploying into the environment spend. And I think that\u2019s what\u2019s leading to some of this shift in sentiment.\nOperator: Our next question is from Bill Katz with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nBill Katz: Okay thank you very much. Good morning everyone and appreciate taking the question. Maybe circling back to one of your growth drivers. If you could talk a little bit about on the global private wealth opportunity. You mentioned a couple of new products coming out. Maybe update us on what you\u2019re hearing from the respective channels, just given some of the mixed macro backdrop with higher yields in more liquid products. And what might be having in terms of behavior and demand as you scale the business? Thank you.\nCraig Larson: Bill, it\u2019s Craig. Why don\u2019t I start? Look, I think the tone in any near-term period is going to be influenced by what we all see in broad markets. But I think we\u2019d encourage everybody not to miss what really is a huge opportunity for us. And when we look at how we\u2019re positioned with our brand, our track record, our ability to innovate the relationships that we enjoy with distribution partners. I think some of the things that Scott mentioned in our prepared remarks, we spent the better part of the last two years really as a firm positioning ourselves to be able to launch a handful of new products, and we\u2019re on the cusp of currently. So, I think we just feel really well positioned in what is an enormous massive addressable market. And again, our views of the opportunity here hasn\u2019t changed. And I think, I guess one final thought in a product like KREST, again, we think the performance of KREST and the experience that people have had with that as an entry has been great. So performance was an 8% \u2013 over an 8% return in 2022, 16% inception to date, over a 5% current yield. So, I think when we look at the initial experience that investors have had from the democratize products, we feel very good about what they\u2019ve experienced.\nOperator: Our next question is from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Please proceed with your question.\nPatrick Davitt: Thanks, good morning. I have another follow-up on the real estate market. Is there any specific region or specific type of assets in the portfolio where those transaction cups \u2013 comps drove the mark? And as a follow-up to that, could you give us an idea of where the cap rates were moved to and where they were before?\nCraig Larson: Patrick, we haven\u2019t disclosed the specific cap rates. I think the dynamic this quarter is, one, I think I wouldn\u2019t be \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you\u2019d actually see a real variability in those cap rate assumptions is, again, it\u2019s \u2013 each manager is probably going to view the data points differently. And what you\u2019re going to see in this 90-day period. And again, like the book that we have is going to be predominantly U.S. based just given the maturation of our portfolio. And again, from an overall exposure piece, as I\u2019d mentioned, our largest allocation is 35% in those industrial themes and 80% in those themes where we\u2019re continuing to see really strong growth. But almost by definition, those are going to have the big \u2013 just given the significance of those in the portfolio, those are the instances that are going to be the biggest contributors to that movements in the court. [Ph]\nOperator: Our next question is from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. Just wanted to come back to the retail democratized part of the retail strategy. Maybe if you could just remind us on the AUM you have right now in the actual democratized products where you might think that could go to over the long term. Realize it\u2019s a \u2013 it\u2019s definitely a long-term build. And then, how many products you plan to launch this year? And then, going back to the FRE margin, part of that as you scale the overall business and improve the FRE margins, should we be thinking of the rollout of those democratized products as a near-term headwind as you pay for shelf space and build up the infrastructure to scale that?\nCraig Larson: Hi, Brian. It\u2019s Craig. Why don\u2019t I start? And then, we\u2019ll let Rob pick up on the FRE margin impact. Just in terms of framing that significance for us, again, we\u2019ve got about 500 billion of AUM, roughly 6 billion are in these democratized vehicles today. So it\u2019s a little over 1% of our AUM. In terms of the launch of additional products and where we are from here, given SEC rules and filings that we\u2019ve made, we can\u2019t get into a lot of the specifics. But suffice to say we think there\u2019s more to come in the first half of the year, and we\u2019ll keep you abreast as we continue to make progress.\nRob Lewin: Brian, some of those costs that you reference are costs that we\u2019ve talked about, where we\u2019ve been investing back into the firm in distribution and marketing as well as in technology. Some of that technology supports our efforts in the democratized vehicles. So as we talk about operating in the low 60s and over time, gravitating our business model to get to the mid-60s, that incorporates how we\u2019re thinking about the democratized access vehicle space.\nScott Nuttall: And Brian, the only thing I\u2019d add is, we\u2019ve said over time, if you look at kind of what we\u2019ve been selling to individual investors, so think democratized plus the more traditional fund formats sold through platforms to individuals, that\u2019s been roughly 10% to 15% of the capital we\u2019ve been raising ex-GA. And we\u2019ve said that we expect that over time to trend to 30% to 50%. So to your question of where do we think this goes over time, think of it as kind of an increasing percentage of a larger base. And we\u2019ve also shared over time that we expect to have democratized versions of what we\u2019re doing across all of our major product areas in the near term and that\u2019s still the case.\nOperator: Our next question is from Finian O\u2019Shea with Wells Fargo Security. Please proceed with your question.\nFinian O\u2019Shea: Hi, everyone. Good morning. A follow on to the insurance ROE, appreciate your color on portfolio rotation into higher yields driving the impact, with that considered, how long should we expect the normalized ROE remaining elevated in today\u2019s environment with today\u2019s portfolio understanding the inputs can be hard to predict?\nRob Lewin: Yes, Fin, thanks for the question. Listen, I do think that 12% to 13% range continues to be a good one for next year. And while there\u2019s some things that can elevate that number as we look forward, there were some timing elements in 2022 as well on that portfolio rotation. So I think that\u2019s still the good range for the near term. As I said, we hope that the GA team is able to generate returns that are in excess of that. They\u2019ve done that in 2021 and 2022. But our internal modeling suggests that\u2019s the right range for 2023.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Cyprys: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just on deployment, just curious how you would characterize the 71 billion of capital that was deployed in 2022. Seems like a large quantum of capital, similar level as 2021, but a tougher backdrop. So just curious how you\u2019d characterize that relative to your full potential? And what\u2019s the scope for that deployment to say grow at a meaningfully step function higher level, maybe in 2023 or 2024. Just how you\u2019re thinking about the capacity you have to deploy and what that might look like five years from now? And then just a quick housekeeping question for Rob, just if you could help quantify the investments and realizations off the balance sheet in the quarter? Thank you.\nCraig Larson: Hey, Mike. It\u2019s Craig. Why don\u2019t I start on deployment. I think a couple of things. When you look at our activities, one, look, the primary markets are pretty shut. Capital is very precious. Those are good things for us in particularly when you look at a 100 plus billion of dry powder that we have as a firm. So I think when we look back at our activities in 2022, I think we feel very good about capital that we put to work. We\u2019re value focused. We love carve-outs. One of the things Rob talked about that I think is pretty interesting against just the amount of public to privates we did in an environment where public markets are really dislocated. So I think for us to have announced or closed on 10 take privates is a pretty interesting statistic. Eight of those were done outside of the U.S. in private equity, infrastructure, real estate. So I think on balance we feel really good about that balance of activity. A couple of other thoughts just, if you look at deployment, some statistics that as we go through things, it\u2019s always kind of interesting to reflect back. I think one, you\u2019re seeing real diversification. So in 2022, traditional private equity deployment for us was $14 billion, real estate was $14 billion, infrastructure was $13 billion. So I think when you look back at this \u2013 it\u2019s really a reflection of how the firm has meaningfully grown and diversified by strategy and by geography. Kind of brings us to the second point which is some of the growth you\u2019ve seen. So in real assets, as an example is our infra and real estate footprint has grown, you\u2019ve seen deployment grow meaningfully. Rob gave some of the statistics earlier on AUM growth in these businesses, but real assets deployment in 2018 through 2020 averaged a little over $4 billion a year be equally split between infra and real estate. Last year, that was $28 billion. So again, we\u2019ve gone from $4 billion to $28 billion, again pretty equally split between those two businesses for us. And the third point, and I think this is not as well understood, but it\u2019s interesting when you look at private equity deployment for us, as I think there\u2019s a \u2013 again, I think we look at \u2013 we feel good about when we deployed where we leaned in. Let me give you a couple of statistics there. So I think in 2020 during COVID, I think everyone remember, we leaned in. So our deployment was around 33% higher in 2020 versus 2019. I think we are more active than our peers. I think people remember that. In 2021, it almost felt like the industry felt the need to play catch-up and industry deployment was up materially. So in the U.S., PE investment activity in 2021 was more than double 2020. I think that\u2019s what many people remember and in some ways, fear. For us, deployment was flat. So again, you didn\u2019t see any kind of an acceleration into that really throughout the environment. And then in 2022, again a year with a lot of volatility and challenge debt markets as you noted, deployment for the industry was down over 20%, deployment for us and private equity was up 35%. So again, I think you\u2019ve seen this really thoughtful dynamic over time of how we look to deploy and take advantage of dislocation. And then the final point just relates to credit. Again, that same scaling thought. So in 2019, total credit deployment was $10 billion. 2020, that deployment was $10.3 billion, and last year deployment for us was $25 billion. So as the credit business has grown, as GA has come online, you\u2019ve seen a meaningful increase in that deployment. So again, long-winded answer, but hopefully that gives a little bit of flavor for the activities you saw last year.\nScott Nuttall: Yes. The only color I\u2019d add to that, Mike, is if you take the numbers apart you\u2019re right, deployment was relatively flat in the low $70 billion in 2022 versus 2021. But if you look at the makeup, there\u2019s a bit of a shift. Credit was actually down year-over-year. Part of that is overall transaction activity in the market, part of it is we had a lot of work on the GA front to do in 2021, in particular. But if you look at private markets, I think private equity, infrastructure and real estate our deployment was actually up 20%. So we were leaning in to Craig\u2019s point into kind of what was happening with the markets last year after maybe being a little bit more cautious in late 2021 in a high valuation environment.\nRob Lewin: Then Mike, real quickly our realization deployments were about $400 million for the quarter off the balance sheet.\nOperator: Our next question is from Arnaud Giblat with BNP. Please proceed with your question.\nArnaud Giblat: Good morning. If I could just follow up quickly on the last question. Could you talk about a bit about the outlook a bit more on deployments? Are you seeing financing conditions improve in private equity? Is the bidder spread starting to narrow a lot of the participants in the industry are talking about that as an issue? Is that improving? And equally, if you could comment a bit more on infra. I mean that\u2019s obviously been a very active area of the market. How are you seeing the pipeline of opportunities for deploying there?\nCraig Larson: Yes. Thanks for the question. I think on deployment, I looked at the debt markets haven\u2019t fully healed, but despite that, we\u2019ve continued to find ways to deploy capital. I do think the capital markets business actually gives us a real leg up in helping to put together the debt side of a cap structure. Where we\u2019re interested now would include those areas where we think we can really bring our operational resources to bear and move the needle. Again, we love carve-outs. We\u2019ve been very active public to privates. I think by strategy, you actually hit on probably the single busiest area in our firm, and that\u2019s infrastructure. And I think infrastructure has just continued to be a real success story and a real growth story for us. I think it\u2019s \u2013 when we look back at our April 2021 Investor Day, we gave a bunch of statistics there of actually where we thought Infra would be over the course of 2022. Just to give you a sense, at that point Infra-AUM was $17 billion. We estimated at that Investor Day that Infra-AUM would exceed $30 billion and as of year-end we\u2019re at $51 billion against that $30 billion estimate all organic. We look for management fees effectively to double from that $150 million to $275 million to $300 million was our estimate for 2022. And for the full year, infra management fees came in at $340 million, so nicely ahead of the top end of that range. And we\u2019ve got $9 billion of infra for capital that will become fee-paying as it\u2019s invested at a weighted average fee rate of about 120 basis points. So not only will we build the high end, but we\u2019ve got lots of visibility towards future management fee growth. And I think as we look at opportunities for us, that opportunity for continued growth and innovation hasn\u2019t stopped. So again, we think it\u2019s an asset class that can lend itself nicely to the democratized marketplace. And we think the renewable space is again an area where our presence can increase. So I appreciate you\u2019re asking about, but it\u2019s been a real bright spot for us.\nScott Nuttall: Yes. The only color I\u2019d add, Arnaud, is that our pipelines have been strong this year across asset classes. And I think to your question, it does take about a year for the public and private market valuations to start to align. We\u2019re getting close to lapping that, and we\u2019re starting to see that show up in the pipeline.\nOperator: Our next question is from Rufus Hone with BMO. Please proceed with your question.\nRufus Hone: Great. Good morning. Thanks very much. Just a follow-up question on Global Atlantic. I was just curious to get your thoughts around the outlook for inorganic growth for GA in the coming quarters. Any color on the pipeline that would be helpful. And would you consider raising or bringing on third-party investors to accelerate organic growth and M&A even further? Thank you. \nRob Lewin: Yes. Thanks for the question, Rufus. You\u2019ve hit on a spot of a lot of activity, actually. And our pipeline around the institutional side of our business at Global Atlantic as frankly is big as it\u2019s been certainly since our ownership and probably since Jay\u2019s founding. And so a lot of resources going into the institutional side of the business. And that\u2019s both in the U.S., but that\u2019s also global. I think there\u2019s a real opportunity to leverage KKR\u2019s franchise in Europe and Asia to help Global Atlantic grow in those parts of the world. So a lot of effort there. We do have today, as you talk about third-party close capital, we do have side car pool capital called IV Today [ph] that participates alongside some of our block reinsurance activity. It\u2019s a big part of our go-forward strategy, and I would certainly look to continue to be able to add capacity to the IV strategy to help support Global Atlantic and its growth in the future.\nOperator: Our next question is from Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Kotowski: Good morning and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the core private equity business. And I think if I heard him correctly, I think Rob referenced that it\u2019s $600 million of EBITDA which is about 15% of your pretax earnings, but only 1% of DE. And I guess I\u2019m wondering when and how \u2013 what is your philosophy or outlook on when and how the EBITDA starts converting into DE. I mean, do we have to wait 15 or 20 years until these investments are mature and ready to be monetized? Are these companies in a position where they can start throwing off steady dividends? Or do the cash flows have to be reinvested to keep the growth going? Or are there dividend recaps down the line? Or what is the, I guess, the strategy for converting the EBITDA into DE for KKR shareholders?\nScott Nuttall: Really appreciate the question, Chris. Let me start. Really, what we want to do first is highlight to you and all of our shareholders the fact that we think there is a fantastic portfolio that we\u2019re building in core that is generating a significant amount of underlying value creation. And you\u2019re right, it\u2019s not yet showing up in our distributable earnings. Part of that \u2013 the reason for that is because we report DE, which as you know, is a cash metric. These investments by their very nature amend for a very long period of time. So it shows up in our marked book value per share, but not in DE. And you\u2019re right, we would need to sell them or we would need to pay dividends or do some kind of a dividend recap for actually needed to show up in DE. But even that, I think would understate the quality of the underlying earnings because these businesses are designed to have recurring revenue and recurring bottom line. And so part of what we\u2019re doing now is just sharing with you that we\u2019ve got a little bit of that disconnect that we\u2019re building this portfolio that we feel great about. As the largest shareholder, and we think it will show up in some parts of the financial statements but not others today. Some of these businesses will start to pay dividends in the near term. So we\u2019ll share that with you as we go along. But one of the things that we\u2019ve been discussing is how over time, can we make it even more clear the value that\u2019s being created in that part of our strategy and what are the ways to do that. And just 1 example, Global Atlantic, as you know, we consolidate our share of GA\u2019s earnings, which is a long-term compounding investment that has a lot of other strategic benefits to it but not dissimilar to some of the things that we\u2019re doing with the core portfolio in terms of the underlying. It\u2019s just GA shows up in earnings and core today doesn\u2019t at least yet. So part of what we want to do is create a dialogue with you and our shareholders so you know what we\u2019re seeing. And then over time, we\u2019ll discuss how can we actually remedy that, but it\u2019s a good problem, not a bad problem.\nOperator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Craig Larson for closing comments.\nCraig Larson : Rob, thanks for your help this morning, and thank you all for your continued interest in KKR, and we look forward to giving you further updates on our progress in the quarters ahead. Thanks again, everybody.\nRob Lewin: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Rob Lewin",
            "content": "Thanks a lot, Craig. And thank you, everyone, for joining our call this morning. I thought I would begin by giving you a sense of our recent annual planning meetings. We got our senior team together earlier this year to review where we are as firm, where we're going and most importantly, what we need to get right to capture the opportunity that is in front of us. Listening and participating in these discussions was incredibly energizing. We've never had a stronger team and been more aligned around where we are going as a firm. We have a number of very clear avenues for long-term and sustainable growth and more confidence than ever in our ability to achieve it. I'm going to step through some of these more material opportunities for growth in a minute. But before I do that, I first wanted to emphasize just a few points about 2022. Starting with our fundraising, we raised $81 billion of capital last year, the second most active year in our history and of course, all against a much more complex market backdrop and without significant contributions from our flagship strategies. Over 70% of our fundraising last year came in our real assets and credit businesses, strategies that are often front of mind for our clients in rising interest rate as well as inflationary environments. Moving to deployment, we invested a healthy amount of capital over the last 12 months. Looking at private equity and real assets taken together, deployment here was approximately 20% greater in 2022 compared to 2021 as teams were able to find very creative ways to put capital to work. For example, across PE, growth in Infra, we announced or closed on ten take private transactions over the course of the year. And as our footprint has scaled and become more diversified, so has our deployment. Real asset strategies were 16% of total firm deployment activity in 2020, that number totaled almost 40% in 2022. Over that same two-year period, credit deployment has increased approximately two and a half times as the business has expanded with Global Atlantic as a partner and new focus funds such as asset-based finance. And finally, I'd like to circle back to our compensation expense and the comp margins that you saw in Q4. Fee-related compensation was 20% of fee-related revenues. That is at the low end of the 20% to 25% range that we've articulated historically. While realized investment income comp was 10% of realized investment income, also at the low end, in this case, of the outlined 10% to 20% range. Carried interest comp was at the mid of the quarter which, as a reminder, is 65%. This had the impact of reducing our total compensation margin for the quarter, which including equity-based comp, was 32%. Given realized carried interest generation across KKR over the course of 2022, we felt that we could move to the low end of our FRE and investment income compensation ranges and show some expense discipline in support of our operating earnings, while importantly, still ensuring that we have the capacity to recruit, retain and incent world-class investment, distribution and operations talent. As we think about levers that we have as a firm to generate long-term earnings growth from here, operating leverage is really a key component. As a reminder, KKR employees own approximately 30% of our stock. So, we are very well aligned to drive margin improvement across the business. And before I switch gears, let me give you an update on the outlook for Q1 monetization activity. Things have slowed a bit on the monetization side, but nothing that is surprising to us given the environment and how we're thinking about the timing of when we want to generate realization outcomes for our limited partners. So, as we stand here today, we have visibility on approximately $250 million of monetization-related revenue for the first quarter. Now turning the page and looking forward, we think there are really six key areas that are going to drive significant growth for KKR for several years to come. The first area is real assets, where we have seen meaningful growth across our platform. AUM at the end of Q4 stood at $119 billion. That's compared to just $28 billion at the end of 2019, so four times growth in three years. Growth in infrastructure has been driven not only by our flagship fund, but also our extension into areas such as core as well as Asia Pacific. The real estate platform continues to grow across a full suite of ten-plus products, further propelled by both Global Atlantic on the credit side and our acquisition of KJRM on the equity side. Our momentum across our real assets platform is obviously quite significant and aligns well with a big area of current focus from our limited partners. The second area of meaningful growth for KKR is continuing to leverage our market-leading position in Asia Pacific. Looking at our progress in 2022, our Asia infrastructure strategy raised almost $6 billion, the largest in the geography, and we closed on our first Asia credit fund as well. Looking ahead, we expect our Asia real estate strategy to expand in 2023 as well our Asia tech growth franchise. And as I mentioned a moment ago, our acquisition of KJRM, which is our Japanese real estate business, is a great example of how we can use our balance sheet to strategically pursue inorganic growth to both enhance our market position as well as to access differentiated forms of capital. Looking at this progress altogether. Our Asia-focused AUM has now increased to $60 billion at the end of the year, that's up roughly three times since 2019. Our local presence paired with our KKR toolkit has created industry-leading business against very compelling long-term macro fundamentals in the region. The third area for us is core private equity, which is just a massive opportunity. As the addressable market is very significant, and the P&L impact can be positive across so many different parts of our financials. And most importantly, it is an area where we believe that we have the business model and culture that sets us up well to be the best global player in the asset class. As a quick reminder, Core PE is a long-duration investment strategy, and we expect to hold these investments for 10 to 15 plus years. We currently have 19 businesses within our core portfolio. These businesses generally have lower leverage than traditional private equity investments tend to be less cyclical and are more cash generative. These traits do create a more stable earnings profile within the portfolio. Today, we manage roughly $18 billion of third-party capital, which I believe is the largest in our space. The AUM we manage positively impacts our management fees, transaction fees as well as carried interest. But core PE also accounts for over 30% of our balance sheet investments. Yet these investments only accounted for 1% of our after-tax distributable earnings in 2022 when you look at their flow-through impact to realized investment income. Looking at this another way, and to highlight this point even further, if you look through our balance sheet to the core PE portfolio, our portion of the company's EBITDA totals over $600 million. This is not accounted for in our distributable earnings. Make no mistake, this 30-plus percent allocation is purposeful. It is by design because we have a substantial opportunity to really compound our investments in an asset class where we know that we have differentiated capabilities. The fourth big driver for us is private wealth. We currently manage $67 billion of capital here compared to $37 billion in 2019. Approximately 15% of new capital raise has historically been sourced from this investor cohort, mostly from high net worth clients and in traditional drawdown products. Over time, we expect all private wealth focused capital will account for 30% to 50% of the capital that we raised as a firm. And along this path, we will continue to expand our footprint in the democratized access vehicle space. Our ambitions and views of the long-term opportunities we see for KKR have not changed. Next, my fifth point is our continued focus on the insurance space. Going back to July 2020 at the announcement of the Global Atlantic acquisition, their AUM was $72 billion. Today, it's close to $140 billion. So it's grown about 2x in the last 2.5 years. Our thesis in buying GA was multifold. We believe that the combination of a leading life and annuity franchise with multiple ways to expand against compelling market fundamentals, combined with KKR's origination and capital capabilities could lead to strong growth in AUM, operating earnings and book value while also delivering for policyholders. This has really played out and looking ahead remains a key strategic priority for us. Not only is the $139 billion of GE Capital itself perpetual, but the business has also helped us grow our third-party insurance client AUM to $56 billion. That's up from $26 billion at the time of the GA acquisition announcement as we have continued to create products that are tailored to this unique investor base. And finally, the sixth high-impact long-term growth driver for us is our balance sheet. I said the same thing last quarter as well. But there's really not a corporate that I know that doesn't wish they had more capital availability right now. The balance sheet has a clear competitive advantage in its continued ability to enable and accelerate growth in a way that is less dilutive for our public shareholders. To highlight this point, M&A, our investments in core private equity, our buildup in the insurance space and share buybacks have all accounted for roughly 90% of our net balance sheet deployment over the past five years. And we expect that trend to continue over the coming several years as well. This is just another tool that we have to be able to drive earnings per share over time. To summarize, we continue to feel extremely positive about our future outlook. The six drivers that I just went through are particularly impactful for our long-term success, and we have real conviction across the entirety of our management team in our ability to build on our existing momentum. With that, let me hand it off to Scott. Hey Craig. Hey Craig, it's Rob. Thanks a lot for the question. The very short answer is that GA continues to trend really well as it relates to its credit exposures. We've talked about this in prior calls, but 95% of GA's book is rated NAIC 1 or NAIC 2, so investment-grade in nature. The equity book at GA is sub 1% of total assets. And so we've done a bottoms up across the entire portfolio as we've gone into year-end and feel really good with how the strength of the balance sheet is holding up. Yes. Got it. Thanks, Alex. A lot in there. So let me try and tackle one at a time. First, let me just start with margins. We believe that we've created a business model that allows for best-in-class FRE margins. And we've been consistent for a number of quarters now, a number of years now probably that assuming reasonable market conditions. We've got a business that can sustainably drive a low 60% FRE margins in spite of some of the investments that we're making back into our business. But over time, as those investments that we're making pay off and as the fees come in on the back of those investments as well as the efficiencies, we believe that we can create a business model that delivers mid-60% FRE margins. I think that's going to come in a couple forms. I think that will come from operating expense leverage. I think it also has the potential to come from compensation expense leverage as you would've seen in Q4 of this year. Now taking back to how we thought about compensation margin inside of the quarter, I'd say a couple things as it relates to that. The first, we want make sure that we've got and I said this on the prepared remarks, the right amount of compensation in our business such that we can recruit, retain, and incent world-class talent across the board at KKR. And as we looked at the pool of compensation that we had available in 2022, we made the determination that in Q4, we can operate at the bottom end of that range. Now you asked the question of monetization activity comes down next year where might that shake out? I instead would look at it across our total comp margin. And what we've guided historically is on a total comp margin, we can operate in the low-40% range. In 2022, we were at 39.7%, I believe, 2019, 2020 and 2021. We were below that 40% guidance number. And if monetization comes down and carried interest comes down, that's our highest comp margin at 65%. And so all things equal, you would expect compensation margin across the board to come down. So there was a lot in your question, but hopefully I got at most of it and happy to catch up more offline on the topic. Yes. Hey, Glenn, Glenn, it's Rob. Thanks for question. Why don't I just start with valuation methodology because I think that that's really important for this discussion? Then Craig and Scott could spend some time as it relates to performance. We've been reporting as a public entity now for close to 17 years if you include KPE, which was the predecessor closed-end fund the KKR merged into. And we really do believe that over that period of time, we've developed best-in-class process for determining fair value for our Level 3 assets, which are those assets that don't have observable marks. Our exact process and methodology is, of course, by its nature, different by asset class, but what is most important to us is that we have a consistent process and methodology quarter after quarter after quarter. And we believe that aspect is critical in delivering a fair and representative view on fair value, which we think you've seen over time and in 2022. I think the other thing that's worth mentioning on valuation methodology, as part of our consistent process, we've got a third-party valuation agent, excuse me, who is an expert in their respective space and they either perform the valuation exercise or provide positive assurance on those investments. So if you look at our history, we feel we've gotten that balance right and that our portfolio is certainly impacted by market movements as well as by inputs like interest rates and equity risk premiums that might impact DCFs offset over the course of the year by operating performance as well. And so I think it's important really to understand that our methodology doesn't change and it's consistent quarter-over-quarter. And in that respect, we feel really good that we're delivering the right representative mark across our portfolio. Brian, thanks for the question. I think it's going to be much more focused around taking what we have today and scaling that up. We think there's more than enough room to have very substantial growth. And as we've outlined, our 2026 profitability measure is greater than $4 of FRE per share, $7 of TD per share, that doesn't rely on adding a lot of new products that we're doing. That said, we continue the focus on innovation. We are likely to add products over time where we believe there's large addressable markets and where we can be a top player in the world of what we do. But that list is going to be small because I think we believe that if we go execute on what we have in front of us today take that 50% of our products that aren't yet at scale and get them to scale that the growth opportunity is going to be much larger than starting something new from scratch. Yes. Great. Thanks a lot for the question. Clearly, Global Atlantic in the two years of our ownership has had really outstanding performance. And we had targeted 12% to 13% type of ROEs. We've out achieved that over the course of 2021 and again in 2022. I do still believe that that's the right level which to model GA on a go-forward basis. We are benefiting right now on the investment \u2013 net investment side of the business, we're certainly benefiting from greater deployment as we've rotated on our portfolio, which we took some upfront losses on given where interest rates are and have put that into higher-yielding securities. We've also benefited while we are pretty well asset liability matched. We do have a decent size floating rate book. And so as interest rates have gone up, GA has benefited from that as well. At the same time, though, cost of insurance has, of course, gone up the price at which we price our annuities has gone up. But I think the team has done a really good job on the operating expense side of the business. And overall, you're seeing that operating leverage flow through. So, we continue to be really encouraged. I think 12% to 13% still the right range to model that business going forward, and hopefully, they're going to continue to be able to outperform. Brian, some of those costs that you reference are costs that we've talked about, where we've been investing back into the firm in distribution and marketing as well as in technology. Some of that technology supports our efforts in the democratized vehicles. So as we talk about operating in the low 60s and over time, gravitating our business model to get to the mid-60s, that incorporates how we're thinking about the democratized access vehicle space. Yes, Fin, thanks for the question. Listen, I do think that 12% to 13% range continues to be a good one for next year. And while there's some things that can elevate that number as we look forward, there were some timing elements in 2022 as well on that portfolio rotation. So I think that's still the good range for the near term. As I said, we hope that the GA team is able to generate returns that are in excess of that. They've done that in 2021 and 2022. But our internal modeling suggests that's the right range for 2023. Then Mike, real quickly our realization deployments were about $400 million for the quarter off the balance sheet. Yes. Thanks for the question, Rufus. You've hit on a spot of a lot of activity, actually. And our pipeline around the institutional side of our business at Global Atlantic as frankly is big as it's been certainly since our ownership and probably since Jay's founding. And so a lot of resources going into the institutional side of the business. And that's both in the U.S., but that's also global. I think there's a real opportunity to leverage KKR's franchise in Europe and Asia to help Global Atlantic grow in those parts of the world. So a lot of effort there. We do have today, as you talk about third-party close capital, we do have side car pool capital called IV Today [ph] that participates alongside some of our block reinsurance activity. It's a big part of our go-forward strategy, and I would certainly look to continue to be able to add capacity to the IV strategy to help support Global Atlantic and its growth in the future. Thank you."

            "name": "Scott Nuttall",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. I thought today, I would share how things look from Joe's and my seat. There is no doubt that markets and the economy remain dynamic. There's also no doubt many remaining focused on the macro, quarterly results, short-term catalysts and the near-term outlook for our industry and business. In summary, there's a lot of noise out there. We find that noise is just that noise. We continue to raise capital, find interesting deployment opportunities and selectively monetize our portfolio. It's business as usual at KKR. So from our seats, while the noise creates some questions, it's important to not let it become a distraction. Building KKR is a long-term effort that takes years of planning and investment to get right. Many of the businesses we are scaling now were started over 10 years ago. And many of the businesses we are starting now will be scaling for decades to come. We are singularly focused on what we need to get right: talent, culture, performance, clients and operations. If we get those things right, we will double KKR again at a rapid pace. If we don't, our growth will be slower than it could be. Growth is the result of execution. So as a management team, we are focused on what we can control and executing on those five fronts. The good news is that as we look back at recent progress, we feel like our strategy is being executed well and the results are emerging. Named just a couple of things we look to as evidence. In the last two years, our AUM has doubled from $250 billion to $500 billion and our fee-paying AUM has more than doubled. And over the same two years, our management fees and TDE per share have almost doubled as well. So the results of execution are starting to come through. But these metrics are backward looking. What's even more encouraging to us is the strong evidence we have of growth continuing to be very attractive for years to come. Some of this may be apparent for these calls and some less so. To name just a few of the things that we are looking at. First, we've continued to create new businesses over the last several years. In fact, over 50% of the capital we raised last year was in strategies that did not even exist five years ago. And over 50% of our AUM is not yet scaled in our definition. Said another way, we have had a lot of recent innovation and half of the assets we now manage are still approaching the inflection part of the growth curve. Second, our dry powder has grown from $67 billion to $108 billion over the last two years, positioning us well to invest into this environment, which we continue to find attractive. Third, our efforts in democratized products are just starting. We expect to have multiple vehicles launched this year after two years of structuring and team building work. This is upside for us and we expect will be an additional growth engine for the firm across all of our asset classes. Fourth, Global Atlantic goes from strength to strength, and has almost doubled assets since we announced the transaction 2.5 years ago, well ahead of schedule with significant opportunity ahead. Fifth, and maybe less visible, our sales team has grown from 100 people to 280 people in the last two years across institutions, insurance, family offices and private wealth. It typically takes a year or two for a new salesperson to learn our products and hit their stride. The result of this investment will show up over the next couple of years and create even more wind at our back. Sixth, our carry-bearing invested dollars in the ground have increased dramatically. It's important to understand that the cash carry we generated last year largely came from investments we made five-plus years ago when our AUM was a fraction of what it is today and our carry eligible invested capital was as well. To be specific, the vast majority of last year's carry came from harvesting investments made when our carry earning invested capital was roughly $50 billion. Today, it's about $150 billion, up 3 times. So don't let the near-term monetization environment divert your attention from what matters. The forward is incredibly strong as this much larger scale of invested capital matures with the returns on the slide Craig showed you. And finally, and perhaps most important, our team has never been stronger or more cohesive. In summary, over the last several years, we've made the investments for the next leg of growth at KKR and see years of opportunity ahead. And as we've done all this, the earnings power of KKR continues to increase. This is true regardless of the near-term noise and markets and is what gives us such confidence in our outlook. So don't get distracted by the noise. The signals are strong and our confidence is high. With that, we're happy to take your questions. Yes, Alex, the only thing I would add is our people understand that monetizations, if they come down, compensation is going to come down as a result. Our business, you get paid on cash outcomes. So I don't think that would be a surprise to anybody. Hey Glenn, it's Scott. Just \u2013 if I were you, I'd be trying to figure out is there anything to worry about here? And the punchline from my standpoint is no. I think as the guy said, we've had a very consistent methodology. It's not at all surprise given the markets have been off, multiples have been off, they see some marks come down, but they're just that marks. What matters to us is the fundamental operating performance of the portfolio, which continues to be really strong. If anything, we feel even better that we got it right in terms of investing behind the right themes the last several years, revenue and profitability metrics remain strong. The fundamental operating performance of our real asset book and our credit book remains strong, candidly, bit stronger than I might have expected given what's going on with the economy and the backdrop. So, overall we're not worried about it. I would suggest you're not worried about it either. My expectation is as markets rebound, you'll see the marks rebound as well. Thanks, Gerry, it's Scott. I'll take that one. It's hard to answer that question in Chris [ph] fashion because it kind of depends on where you are and who you're talking to. So there's no doubt, kind of as we got into the back half of last year, some of our LPs were struggling with allocations on the back of a reduced denominator, that was predominantly a U.S. pension fund dynamic. As the calendar has turned, and there's a new budget year, some of that has softened and we're having conversations that indicate they're looking to put capital to work. But if you go outside the U.S., Middle East, Asia, sovereign wealth, insurance, in particular, you find investors aren't struggling with those same issues. In fact, several of them are very forward leaning and trying to figure out how to invest into this environment. So the overall picture is not consistent depending on where you are. What is very consistent, though is, we're finding this year, just like last, a lot of interest in a couple of themes. Anything with inflation protection and yield. So, I think real estate, infrastructure, credit, significant amount of interest. I'd say an increased awareness that in times like this, all things, private equity tend to perform quite well. So it should be some very strong vintage years coming out of this period of time. So people are kind of swinging a bit to think about how to take advantage of this environment. So, I'd say people are more in their front foot this year overall than maybe last year. And there's more of the conversations gearing toward how do I invest into this in a thoughtful way. And then part of that is people look back and post-GFC and maybe post the initial stages of COVID, some of which they were maybe a little bit more aggressive in terms of deploying into the environment spend. And I think that's what's leading to some of this shift in sentiment. And Brian, the only thing I'd add is, we've said over time, if you look at kind of what we've been selling to individual investors, so think democratized plus the more traditional fund formats sold through platforms to individuals, that's been roughly 10% to 15% of the capital we've been raising ex-GA. And we've said that we expect that over time to trend to 30% to 50%. So to your question of where do we think this goes over time, think of it as kind of an increasing percentage of a larger base. And we've also shared over time that we expect to have democratized versions of what we're doing across all of our major product areas in the near term and that's still the case. Yes. The only color I'd add to that, Mike, is if you take the numbers apart you're right, deployment was relatively flat in the low $70 billion in 2022 versus 2021. But if you look at the makeup, there's a bit of a shift. Credit was actually down year-over-year. Part of that is overall transaction activity in the market, part of it is we had a lot of work on the GA front to do in 2021, in particular. But if you look at private markets, I think private equity, infrastructure and real estate our deployment was actually up 20%. So we were leaning in to Craig's point into kind of what was happening with the markets last year after maybe being a little bit more cautious in late 2021 in a high valuation environment. Yes. The only color I'd add, Arnaud, is that our pipelines have been strong this year across asset classes. And I think to your question, it does take about a year for the public and private market valuations to start to align. We're getting close to lapping that, and we're starting to see that show up in the pipeline. Really appreciate the question, Chris. Let me start. Really, what we want to do first is highlight to you and all of our shareholders the fact that we think there is a fantastic portfolio that we're building in core that is generating a significant amount of underlying value creation. And you're right, it's not yet showing up in our distributable earnings. Part of that \u2013 the reason for that is because we report DE, which as you know, is a cash metric. These investments by their very nature amend for a very long period of time. So it shows up in our marked book value per share, but not in DE. And you're right, we would need to sell them or we would need to pay dividends or do some kind of a dividend recap for actually needed to show up in DE. But even that, I think would understate the quality of the underlying earnings because these businesses are designed to have recurring revenue and recurring bottom line. And so part of what we're doing now is just sharing with you that we've got a little bit of that disconnect that we're building this portfolio that we feel great about. As the largest shareholder, and we think it will show up in some parts of the financial statements but not others today. Some of these businesses will start to pay dividends in the near term. So we'll share that with you as we go along. But one of the things that we've been discussing is how over time, can we make it even more clear the value that's being created in that part of our strategy and what are the ways to do that. And just 1 example, Global Atlantic, as you know, we consolidate our share of GA's earnings, which is a long-term compounding investment that has a lot of other strategic benefits to it but not dissimilar to some of the things that we're doing with the core portfolio in terms of the underlying. It's just GA shows up in earnings and core today doesn't at least yet. So part of what we want to do is create a dialogue with you and our shareholders so you know what we're seeing. And then over time, we'll discuss how can we actually remedy that, but it's a good problem, not a bad problem."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to KKR's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I will now hand the call over to Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead, sir.\nCraig Larson: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2022 earnings call. This morning, as usual, I'm joined by Rob Lewin, our Chief Financial Officer; and Scott Nuttall, our Co-Chief Executive Officer.  We'd like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, which is available on the Investor Center section at kkr.com. And as a reminder, we report our segment numbers on an adjusted share basis.  This call will contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to our earnings release and our SEC filings for cautionary factors about these statements.  I'm going to begin the call by spending a few minutes walking through the quarter. So we look at our results, I think they really highlight the resiliency of our business model. Our management fees for the quarter were $671 million. That's up 20% compared to Q3 of last year. Management fee growth for the quarter as well as over the last 12 months has been most meaningful within our Real Assets business which, as you'll recall, we began reporting separately last quarter. Net transaction and monitoring fees were $168 million for the quarter with capital markets contributing $116 million.  To go through our expenses. Our fee-related compensation margin consistent with prior quarters, was 22.5%, and other operating expenses increased modestly from last quarter, coming in at $146 million.  In total, our fee-related earnings grew to $542 million or $0.61 per share with an FRE margin of 61%. The -- this is now the eighth consecutive quarter that our FRE margin has exceeded 60%. Next, realized performance income was $498 million, with realized carried interest driven by monetizations of CHI overhead doors, Fiserv as well as Max Healthcare. Realized investment income was $285 million, driven by similar monetization events.  Adding these 2 lines together, so looking at realized performance income, together with realized investment income, really to get a complete picture of our monetization activities Total realized gains for the first 9 months of the year are 10% ahead of last year, given all of the volatility experienced across markets in 2022, we think this speaks to the breadth of our platform, and again, the resiliency of our business model.  So overall, our Asset Management operating earnings were $959 million. And our Insurance segment had another very strong quarter, generating $127 million of operating earnings. Together, this resulted in after-tax distributable earnings of $824 million or $0.93 per share.  Turning to investment performance. You can see the details of the quarter and the LTM period on Page 7 of the press release. Just looking at this page, the traditional private equity portfolio was down 4% in the quarter compared to broad indices that were down 5% to 6%. And over the last 12 months, the PE portfolio was minus 8% compared to the S&P 500 and MSCI World indices that were down 15% and 19%, respectively.  In Real Assets, our portfolio has continued to perform again in a quarter with a lot of volatility. The opportunistic real estate portfolio was minus 1% in the quarter and plus 11% over the last 12 months, while the infra portfolio was up in the quarter and is plus 5 LTM.  On the leveraged credit side, the portfolio was up 1% in the quarter and down 5% over the last 12 months, and our alternative credit portfolio was down 1% for the quarter and up 3% in the LTM. There's been meaningful volatility in the credit markets over these periods as well. The high-yield index declined 1% in the quarter and is off 15% over the last 12 months just as a point of comparison.  In terms of our balance sheet investments, investment performance was flat in the quarter and down 5% over the last 12 months. Core private equity, which Rob will touch on in a moment and is still our largest allocation, was up 2% in the quarter, and it's up 8% over the LTM.  Turning to fundraising in the quarter. We raised $13 billion, bringing new capital raised to $65 million year-to-date.  With that, our assets under management increased to $496 billion, and fee paying AUM now totals $398 billion. To help put these figures into perspective, over the past 2 years, both our AUM and our FPAUM have more than doubled. We also continue to deploy capital with $16 billion invested in Q3. And Credit strategies invested $7 billion in the quarter, with the remainder of the quarter's deployment roughly split between real assets and private equity.  And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Rob.\nRobert Lewin: Thanks a lot, Craig, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying a few words on the operating environment. As you know, the third quarter and really the first 9 months of 2022, were very challenging across markets. High levels of inflation are clearly impacting global consumers, while the sharp increase in interest rates has had multiple knock-on effects that will invariably slow much of the global economy. In turn, equity and bond indices have been very volatile and virtually all of them are down significantly year-to-date. And capital markets activity has meaningfully slowed. Global equity and credit issuance is significantly below historical norms.  Now despite all of this volatility and uncertainty, the overall mood and sentiment across KKR is quite positive. And we thought it would be worthwhile this morning to go through 5 key reasons why we feel the way we do.  First, let me remind you why our business model positions us well for periods like this one. There are a few key reasons why. About 90% of our capital is perpetual or committed for an average of 8 years or more from inception. Our management fees are largely calculated on committed or invested capital. And as a result, are more insulated from fluctuating NAVs of our funds. Therefore, much of our management fees are highly predictable, and that visibility in turn, provides us with the continued ability to invest back into the firm for growth.  We also have $43 billion of committed capital yet to turn on that has a weighted average management fee rate of about 100 basis points. And finally, and may be most critical in moments like these, we have $113 billion of uncalled capital from our investors that we can use to invest into the current dislocation.  While those statistics are all meaningful in their own right, I think it's also helpful when viewed in comparison to where we were as a firm, even a short while back. 2.5 years ago, March 31, 2020. So right as we entered COVID, we had $57 billion of dry powder with $19 billion of committed capital yet to earn management fees. That compares to the $113 billion and $43 billion I mentioned a moment ago. So both of these figures have doubled more or less over the last 2.5 years. And when you consider our relative positioning as a firm, those numbers don't account for the significant increase we have had in perpetual capital. largely due to our partnership with Global Atlantic and our acquisition of KJRM as well as the meaningful increase in the diversification of our business, both by geography and strategy.  This brings me to my second reason for optimism. We're fortunate due to our fundraising success and definitely a bit of luck on timing that we are in a position to deploy a significant amount of dry powder with asset prices more dislocated and while capital is quite scarce.  As a result, we are starting to become a lot more constructive on our opportunity sets. We are already finding opportunities across the credit landscape. Our real estate and corporate credit teams are all very active. But more exciting is our outlook for the coming 12 to 18 months across all asset classes and geographies. We are mobilizing our teams and resources against what we see as a growing opportunity to put our client capital to work.  Take for example, in private equity. Oftentimes, our best vintages result from investments made during periods of market distress. Think the early 2000s, the GFC or what we went through a couple of years ago. We think 2023 could present such an opportunity. And the key here is that we have really set ourselves up to be able to outperform in this environment, given our expertise and breadth across geographies, industries and asset classes.  And most importantly, our culture really incentivizes our people to work across the firm to ensure that both information and capability travel and that we can make each other better. As a result, we are uniquely positioned to find creative and attractive investment opportunities.  Turning now to performance, which is my third point. Please turn to Page 8 of the earnings release. As Craig went through every quarter, we report our investment performance for the quarter and trailing 12-month period across our major asset classes. This really though, only tells part of the story as it doesn't capture investment returns since inception. These funds all continue to outperform their comparable public indices. Our clients, really all channels relying us to produce differentiated outcomes compared to what they can achieve in traditional asset classes. And that is just what we've been doing.  Now to be clear, we certainly have today and will, in the future, a handful of more difficult situations to manage. But our thematic approach, which we have talked about many times, and our focus on portfolio construction, are 2 critical reasons why you see this kind of outperformance, which brings me to my fourth point. The strength of our fund performance continues to allow us to raise capital from our investors.  Q3 new capital raised of $13 billion brings year-to-date fundraising to $65 billion. To put that number in perspective, that's already our second best year of fundraising ever, and we still have a quarter to go.  Even more notably, this was against a much more challenging fundraising backdrop than the past few years and with many of our largest flagships in the market. And looking ahead over the next 12 to 18 months, we continue to have a really active calendar and remain constructive about the outlook for scaling our strategies that are coming to market.  And finally, I want to turn to my fifth point. and focus on the competitive differentiation that our balance sheet creates in periods like these. There's not a corporate that I know that doesn't wish they had more capital availability right now. And we are very confident in our ability to deploy our excess capital in opportunities that can both generate compelling investment returns and also help build and scale the firm at the same time.  Part of what generates this confidence is the strength of our existing investment portfolio. Our focus on asset allocation and really where the puck is going, has served us well. While the S&P 500 declined 15% over the last 12 months, our balance sheet was off only 4.7%.  And over the last 3 and 5 years, our annual returns have been 16% and 14%. Also several hundred basis points ahead of the S&P over these periods. One of the key drivers of this outperformance is the shift that we made a few years ago to increase our exposure to real assets. The fair value of our real assets investments have increased from $2.4 billion 2 years ago,to $4.2 billion as of 9/30 and today represent almost 1/4 of our investment portfolio.  Our largest allocation on the balance sheet remains core private equity, and this really gets into business building and how the balance sheet allows us to play offense. As a reminder, core PE is a long-duration investment strategy, where we expect to hold these investments for 10 to 15-plus years and believe they carry a more modest risk return profile compared to our traditional private equity model. We're looking for mid- to high-teens gross IRRs that we can compound for north of a decade. These are businesses we believe have strong secular tailwinds with defensible market positions, solid cash flow dynamics and as a result, benefit from a more stable earnings profile.  So from a standing start 6 years ago, we've put together this really incredible global portfolio of 17 companies with $32 billion of AUM that is both third-party capital together with balance sheet capital. We believe we have the largest core asset management business in the world. And as shareholders, we are all participating in core PE through the compounding of value on our balance sheet, alongside the management fees, capital markets revenue, fee-related earnings and carried interest that is generated over time. That combination is incredibly powerful.  Our acquisition of Global Atlantic in July 2020, right on the heels of COVID, is perhaps the best example of how our balance sheet positions us to play offense when others could not during that period of severe dislocation. We have deep conviction that GA can be a long-term compounder of capital much like core private equity, and we are partnered here with a first rate management team. So far, GA has been performing exceptionally well. Over the last 12 months, they have generated an ROE of about 21%. And well ahead of our expectations. While AUM has increased from approximately $70 billion at announcement to over $130 billion as of 9/30, really helping to also drive our asset management economics.  Core Private Equity and Global Atlantic are great examples, but they're just 2 of many. We know that our model will continue to allow us to find ways to use the balance sheet where we can simultaneously generate compelling investment returns and also use it to grow and scale the firm at the same pace. We have also created a liability structure on our balance sheet that allows for playing real offense in this environment.  We have very intentionally funded ourselves with long-dated liabilities that have fixed cost of capital. The average maturity of our recourse debt is around 20 years, and it is a weighted average fixed coupon of approximately 3% after tax. Obviously, that just isn't replicable today and represents a huge asset for us right now. With all of this, hopefully, it's clear why we remain so excited about our long-term opportunities.  So in summary, number one, our model is durable and diverse with significant recurring revenues. Two, the next 12 to 18 months should present great deployment opportunities and we are extremely well positioned to invest into them. Number three, we are generating excellent investment performance on behalf of our clients. And fourth, our fundraising success has been notable, especially given the backdrop, and we remain very well positioned to achieve growth from here. And finally, number five, our balance sheet is a strategic differentiator whose value is even more meaningful in moments like these.  The opportunity set in front of us over the next 5 to 10 years is immense, and we have never felt better positioned competitively. That's why the tone inside the firm is so constructive right now. Our long-term goals that we have articulated for 2026 are unchanged, and we have a great deal of confidence in our ability to achieve that.  And with that, Scott, Craig and I are happy to take any questions that you have.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.\nAlexander Blostein: Apologies for two putter, but promise they're kind of related. So just starting with private equity. So financing costs are obviously up pretty meaningfully growth slower, credit spreads are widening. So I hear the optimism to deploy capital, but curious how you're thinking about deployment in private equity specifically, and how are the return profile of where you could deploy money today varies versus what you could have done a couple of years ago? In other words, are you still underwriting to high teen to 20% IRRs. And I guess the lower multiples, the lower entry multiples enough to offset both the growth headwinds as well as higher financing costs. And then I had a quick follow-up just on the growth in private equity management fees for the next 12 to 18 months.\nCraig Larson: Alex, thank you for the multiple partner. Why don't I start? Look, a couple of observations just on deployment. One, public market and why do we start there, public market valuations have obviously come down very meaningfully. Our macro team does this work every quarter where they look across a breadth of markets and asset classes and look at current valuations versus a 20-year average and Japanese equities, as an example, are at 8% of their long-term average. That's just 1 example. That's a pretty remarkable statistic.  And at the same point in time, capital is obviously very precious, as you noted. So I think the combination of markets coming down, together with capital being very precious is a great thing for us. And we have lots of tools at our disposal in terms of finding ways to be relevant. I expect you remember our deployment history during COVID again, in a period which even arguably was more dramatically dislocated and more dramatically shut down. I think we feel great about the connectivity that we had as a firm and the opportunities that we were able to find in terms of deploying capital in private equity and private markets broadly. And I guess the final thought that I'd make just as it relates to the financing market is, look, we have 70 people globally in our capital markets business and the strategic value of this business increases during periods of volatility and distress. And so I think as it relates to our ability to finance transactions, given our position, the best-in-class talent we have here on a global basis, our ability to access and finance the capital markets during periods of distress is actually something that we think of as being as a real competitive advantage for us.\nScott Nuttall: Alex, it's Scott. Just a couple of things I'd add on to what Craig said. You're right. Financing costs are up. I'd say multiples, generally speaking, are down more than financing costs are up. And if you look kind of over time and you run out the math, paying a little bit more to get the financing in place, doesn't have that large an impact on returns as long as you've got the right assets, the right thematic and you're able to make the company better while you own it. So the bottom line is we are still pricing the IRRs to where we were before. It's just a bit of a different mix.\nCraig Larson: And then, Alex, switching to your question as it relates to management fees across private equity and growth from here. Obviously, as you know, a couple of our big flagships, we got done over the last 12 to 24 months. But we continue to raise a number of adjacent products that we're excited about that are in their scaling phase. And also remember that our core private equity business is a business that generates management fees as capital is deployed as opposed to committed capital at the onset of the fund. And so as we continue to deploy capital and core private equity, you should see some natural growth there as well. So we're constructive as it relates to growth in our private equity management fees over the coming quarters. And then obviously, at some point there in the future, we'll have a reraise of our flagship strategies.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America.\nCraig Siegenthaler: So my question is on Global Atlantic. I wanted to see how early stage credit quality metrics have trended inside of GA in 3Q. And we know it's coming off very strong levels, but have you seen a pickup in delinquencies, non-accruals, criticized assets, OTTI. And then if the U.S. does enter an economic recession next year or at least if the economy does slow a lot, do you expect to see a pickup in OTTI next year off of a very, very low base currently?\nRobert Lewin: Great. Craig, thanks for the question. So the short answer is that we have not seen any deterioration of credit quality across Global Atlantic. And as you look forward and as you look at different sensitivities, we feel really good with how that book is positioned. I would note that of their NAIC rated assets, that 95-plus percent of them are NAIC 1 or 2, so investment-grade in nature. And so we feel really good about the underlying strength of the book at Global Atlantic.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gerry O'Hara with Jefferies.\nGerald O'Hara: Just kind of circling back, I guess, on some comments made in some of the recent quarters. just around the expansion of platform distribution for some of the democratized retail products. Hoping we could get an update there. And perhaps any kind of commentary around flows in the quarter would also be helpful.\nCraig Larson: Gerry, it's Craig. I'm glad you asked about why don't I start? First, just to your specific question on flows. We did see new capital raise in the quarter slow versus Q2 with volatility in the quarter. I guess we're not really terribly surprised by that. So new capital raise across all of our democratized products was about $500 million in the quarter, and KREST would have been about half of that.  Now what that doesn't tell you is all that's going on under the hood because there's quite a lot. I think first, just as it relates to Crest and distribution, there are 3 main wire houses in the U.S. As you know, we've been on 1 of those since we launched 15 months ago and we're really pleased with our market share and our positioning there. We were added to a second warehouse in August and then launched on the third right at the very end of September. So with all the volatility in the quarter and the timing of these launches, you're not really seeing the impact of that in our 9 to 30 numbers, but the breadth of our distribution there certainly increased in the quarter.  Second, we did make a series of filings, as you may have seen on our infrastructure products. Now unfortunately, not that we have an active registration statement on file, there isn't a lot of additional detail we can give you here because of the SEC's private placement rules, but I wanted to highlight that as something noteworthy.  Third, we have made additional filings on additional private equity as well as credit products in the quarter. And fourth, we continue to hire and onboard and build the team that's focused on this opportunity for us. I think the main takeaways, if you were to kind of step back from the 90-day period, if you will, is we expect to have democratized products across our 4 main asset classes, real estate, infrastructure, private equity and credit. This continues to be a real priority for us, and the great news for us, one, this is a huge end market. It's a massive opportunity. And in many ways, it's all upside for us, and it continues to feel like we're really wonderfully well positioned against this just enormous opportunity.\nScott Nuttall: Yes. The only thing I would add, Gerry, it's Scott, as Rob mentioned that we continue to feel great about what we shared with you in terms of our growth plans through 2026. We had very little on private wealth in those numbers. So to Craig's point, this is all in front of us and upside for us relative to what's in the firm today. And hopefully, it will provide upside to the trajectory we shared with you at our Analyst Day amongst other quarterly calls.\nOperator: Our next question is with Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research.\nPatrick Davitt: Can you give us an update on the announced but not closed realizations for 4Q? And then maybe taking a step back, any updated broader thoughts on the potential for realized cash flow to come down over the next few quarters into next year given the decrease [indiscernible] and more difficulty getting deals done?\nRobert Lewin: Sure. Patrick, thanks for the question. Based on transactions that have happened or where we have deals that have either been signed up or we expect that have closed or we expect to close this quarter, we've got approximately $350 million of realized performance revenue and realized investment revenue that we feel good about. So continued momentum on the monetization front in spite of the environment. And if we achieve those numbers, and this price is important, ballpark around 30% comes from carried interest and the balance from realized investment income and incentive fees that will come in at that lower comp range. And so a higher flow-through on monetization is at least what we've got quarter-to-date. In respect of realized monetization revenue in the future, of course, some of this is going to be impacted by the environment. and I've said this before, we don't need straight line up markets when we need or periods of time where volatility is down and pockets of time where volatility is down to be able to monetize our portfolio. And while you're right, we've taken some marks as an industry and as a firm, we still have approximately $9 billion of embedded revenue that sits on the balance sheet across our carried interest outline item as well as our balance sheet. And so that's the fair value of those assets relative to their cost that gives us a good bit of visibility in terms of generating meaningful revenue in the future when we do get those pockets or opportunities to be able to monetize our portfolio.\nOperator: Our next question is from Bill Katz with Credit Suisse.\nUnidentified Analyst: So maybe circling back to the insurance platform. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the implications of higher interest rates as it relates to any kind of lapse or surrender dynamics and/or block opportunities.\nRobert Lewin: Bill, it's Rob. I'll take this or I'll start. Overall, the punchline is we think GA should be a net beneficiary of a rising rate environment for a couple of reasons, and I'll touch on surrenders at the end. One, flows should be better, both on the individual as well as on the institutional side of that business. I think on the individual side, it's just easier to be able to sell and distribute a 4% annuity than it is a 1.5% annuity.  And then on the institutional side, you referenced blocks. We should benefit here. We're seeing this in our pipeline because all things equal, our reinsurance clients are going to realize lower losses in a higher rate environment. And so I think that's why you're seeing our pipeline pick up on the block side. As it relates to the balance sheet specifically, assets and liabilities are pretty tightly matched at GA, as you know. So we don't expect much impact here, but we definitely do have some floating rate exposure. And so overall, we should be doing better on the balance sheet in a higher rate environment.  And then you mentioned surrenders at the end. It's still early, of course. But so far in 2022, as well as in Q3 of 2022, we've experienced lower surrenders than what we were expecting. If we attribute a good part of this to the design of our products, which is incentivize policyholders from surrendering before they are expected to do so. And so as you think about Global Atlantic and our policies, but 75% of those policies either have surrender charges or aren't able to be surrendered get back to product design and why we feel like we got our arms around that kind of a risk in a rising rate environment. but of course, something that we continue to watch. But the punchline is, we think in this kind of a rising rate type of environment that we're in right now, GA should be a net beneficiary.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.\nBrian Bedell: My question is on fundraising, the $13 billion for 3Q. Can you unpack the real asset component of the fundraising that could only get about 1/3 or so of that from the fund tables within that $6 billion in that segment. And then also if you can sort of comment on the pension plan appetite and your view on that channel given rising long-term rates.  And then just one comment on the fundraising so far year-to-date being the second best year. I imagine it's still a challenging environment near term, at least. So I just want to be sure that you're not expecting fundraising to exceed the 2021, which, of course, was a record year with flagships.\nCraig Larson: Brian, it's Craig. Why don't I start. And I'll start on your last point first. Look, I think with market volatility, the tone of the fundraising market has become more challenging. But to be clear, we feel great about the body of work here. So as Rob noted and as you mentioned a second ago, new capital raise for the first 9 months of $65 billion, again, through 9 months, already the second most active fundraising year for in our history without a lot of flagships in the market.  And when I think back to where consensus estimates were for us at the beginning of this year, that number for 2022 for the full year was in that $55 billion to $60 billion range. So again, we've already raised more capital relative to what was expected at the outset of the year. and that's been accomplished in a more difficult fundraising environment, and we still got another quarter to go.  So look, I think, again, we feel great about everything that we've accomplished a couple of other thoughts. One, you mentioned the fundraising that we've had in some of the real assets areas. And when I think of activity for us in strategy like infrastructure, real estate and credit. So strategies that can -- or should participate in a rising rate environment or our inflation protected. That's been 2/3 of the capital that we've raised over the trailing 12 months.  And then finally, I think also in terms of innovation, over half of the capital we raised in the trailing 12 months, again, were in strategies that didn't exist within taking our 5 years ago. In real assets, one of those contributors to the quarter is a great example. So our Asia infrastructure strategy is a great example of this. It was outside of the mandate of our flagship fund series, the first generation fund. Again, we feel great about performance. And that was certainly one of the contributors to real assets in the quarter. That would have been the largest piece as it relates to the infrastructure component. And then within real estate, you had a handful of components. The largest of which would have included GA's contribution within our real estate footprint. But again, I think the main takeaway, we feel really great about everything that we've done so far this year.\nScott Nuttall: Yes. The only thing I would add, Brian, to your pension plan question, if there's no doubt some U.S. pension plans are getting their bearings right now in trying to figure out where the market is going to go. But we're having a lot of very productive conversations to Craig's point, around anything that's got an inflation protection element or yield. So within credit, infrastructure, real estate. We're having a lot of good dialogues on those fronts even with some of those that are still getting their bearings and may be more active early part of next year than the end of this year.  But remember, we're spending a lot of time with institutions we've never spent time with before. So insurance companies globally are trying to figure out how to navigate the rate environment. Sovereign wealth funds have a different dynamic entirely as do family offices and high net worth investors. So we're having more dialogue than we've ever had before about the markets in the macro and introducing what we're doing.  And I think to the bigger broader point, and you referenced this in your question, we were incredibly fortunate. We raised over $120 billion last year. Our large flagships have been in the market over the last couple of years before the more recent more challenged markets. So we really got a bit lucky with our timing, and that's why we have the $113 billion of dry powder to put to work.  In an environment like this, companies still need capital. And we find private capital tends to have less competition at a time like this. Public markets are more difficult. Corporate M&A is more challenged. So we've got a lot of capital to put to work. Companies still need it.\nOperator: Our next question is with Arnaud Giblat with BNP.\nArnaud Giblat: My question is regarding capital deployment and infrastructure. You hopefully give us quite an update on private equity. I'm just wondering if you could sum in for a second on infra other key players out there have been broadly unaffected by the macro environment deploying quite quick.  I'm just wondering specifically how you see the outlook in terms of deployment in infrastructure? And should we be thinking of a similar time frame as you experienced in the past and where the opportunity set may align in front?\nCraig Larson: Yes, Craig, why don't I start? Look, on the main point, there is a massive need for infrastructure capital globally. And alongside of that massive need, you're really seeing a step function change in the footprint of our business. So whether that's our Global and for fund series, Asian for fund series, diversified core AUM 2 years ago was $15 billion, and today, we're at $50 million. So alongside of that presence, you're seeing similarly a step function increase in terms of our deployment and that teams remained among the busiest within KKR. We've invested $11 billion of capital globally over the last 12 months in infrastructure. In 2020, that number was a little over $2 billion. So again, you've seen a big ramp in that activity, and that's something that I think we'd expect that you should continue to see for us.  One of our largest deployments in the quarter was in a -- it was a take private of a French renewables business. We have another take private that is announced is scheduled to close in Q4. And I think the take private dynamic is actually also something that's just worth mentioning. It's true in infrastructure. It's also true more broadly. We've announced again or we've closed on for take private this year with a fifth set to close in Q4. But again, the main takeaway on Infra is a high level of activity for us.\nScott Nuttall: Yes, Arnaud, it's Scott. I'd say the punchline is consistent with your comment. Our pipeline is strong across both value-add and core infrastructure. So we've been announcing deals and we continue to have a full pipeline.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprys: Maybe just continuing with the real asset theme there. Can you talk a little bit about how you're expanding your capacity to invest in real assets? Where are you looking to expand the platform as you look out over the next year or where are you hiring? Can you also talk about the sort of added benefit on the transactional revenue side as real asset deployment continues to come up. It looks like that was pretty strong in the quarter there as well. And then just a cleanup question for Rob, if you could just mention the investments and realizations off the balance sheet in the quarter.\nScott Nuttall: You want to start with realizations?\nRobert Lewin: Sure, in the quarter, Mike, thanks for the question. About $800 million of deployment and monetization, so that's a little bit north of $400 million off of the balance sheet.\nCraig Larson: Why don't I start on the first part, I'll let Scott then that. Look, I think if you look at a statistic to kind of help frame the growth and the presence in the marketplace, we had $118 billion of AUM in real assets at the end of the quarter. Two years ago, that number was 30. And naturally, in the evolution of these businesses, your CapEx runs through your income statement. And so you hire people, you need to bring on world-class talent to then have the opportunity to raise capital. And then you're looking to earn your right to grow, build and scale both those funds themselves as well as where you see opportunities to expand into other areas where you can be relevant.  So I think we feel great about the progress that we've made, but our hockey sticks aren't in the air as I think we see the opportunity set ahead of us and look where the leading 1 or 2 providers are in some of those businesses, and it just feels like there's a tremendous opportunity for us to continue to build and grow and scale off of all of the growth that you've already begun to see.\nScott Nuttall: Yes. Just a couple of other thoughts, Mike. Thanks for the question. Just take real estate, we'll take the 2 pieces of real assets in turn. Real estate, a few things I'd call out. One is Asia. We continue to expand the team. You saw the acquisition that we completed in Japan of the platform now called KJRM. We have 160 people now in Tokyo focused on what is the second largest real estate market in the world, and that's a J-REIT platform as a reminder. So Asia would be one thing I'd call out.  We've also expanded the platform. We started an opportunistic, but we've also now expanded to core plus. And so we're raising capital across U.S., Europe and Asia core plus. So that would be a second area I'd call out. Third would be credit. Right now, we think the real estate credit opportunity is very attractive as those financing markets have become more challenged in the traditional format. We're seeing excess return and a very strong pipeline across all we do in real estate credit. That platform, as a reminder, is now approaching $30 billion of AUM, that's all on top of the regular way opportunistic funds where we remain highly thematic and we're raising capital and continuing to build the teams.  In infrastructure, similar set of themes. I'd call out again, Asia. Our Asia infrastructure platform. Rob referenced it from a fundraising standpoint, but we continue to see a lot of opportunity there and frankly, less on the ground competition, and that platform has scaled meaningfully and quite quickly. We are also building out our core infrastructure business and moving from value add into core in a bigger way. And per the discussion earlier about some of the take private, I'd say Europe would be another area that I called out. There's just a lot of activity and a lot of opportunity in particular lately on the renewable and energy transition front.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rufus Hone with BMO Capital Markets.\nRufus Hone: I was hoping to get your thoughts around the trajectory of fee-related performance revenues and a fairly big increase this quarter from the Real Assets business. Can you give us a bit more detail about how we might think about the growth of that line item looking at a year or two and perhaps if you take a normalized view on investment performance and growth of some of the democratized products?\nRobert Lewin: Yes, Rufus, you hit on it there at the end. As we think about that line item in our P&., -- that is going to be largely driven by our open-ended and more perpetual vehicles that are more yield based in nature. As you would have heard a couple of times already on this call, we have a lot of conviction that we can scale that part of our business. We've got a lot of conviction that we continue to perform on behalf of that client base and as you combine those 2 things, our view as you look over the coming quarters and years, you're going to see a real ramp up in that line item over time.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is from Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer & Company.\nChristoph Kotowski: Yes. I wonder if you could give us your thoughts on the financing markets. I guess Twitter has done Tenneco got European approval. So the banks are, in fact, kind of perhaps have some inventory to work through. And I'm wondering if you can talk a bit about how long do you think that, that is going to be an obstacle for financing transactions in the public markets? And how much is that an obstacle for you to do pursue public to privates in general?\nCraig Larson: Chris, it's Craig, why don't I start? Look, the financing markets have become more challenging, certainly relative to a year ago and 6 months ago. But again, we look at that, honestly, as an opportunity for us, and we mentioned it earlier. If you go back to 2020, we very creatively were able to find lots of ways to deploy capital in very dislocated environments. So I'm not at all trying to minimize your thoughts or points of view on the banks, et cetera. And you've seen a lot of the impacts of that in broad statistics. But when you see that the broadly syndicated market in Q3 was at its lowest level since the global financial crisis. That gives you a sense of how dislocated markets are and what that means and how things can become more challenging and financing in the broadly syndicated markets.  Now there is a flip side to that coin, obviously, as it relates to private credit. And I think we look at the environment in private credit currently, and we are very, very constructive. So when syndicated markets are challenged. And as Scott mentioned earlier, companies still need capital. That's a really interesting opportunity for us.  So base rates are higher, spreads are higher, protections are better. The risk reward just feels like it feels very attractive to us at this moment in time. And the opportunity for us in our direct lending business is not only going to be in new transactions and new deals like the ones that you referenced, but historically, around half of our deployment has traditionally come from companies where we're the incumbent lender. And in markets like these where volumes are down and there's uncertainty, that percentage is even going to be higher. So if you look more recently, that number would be at about 70%. So I think there are two sides of that coin, again, on the top of broadly.\nScott Nuttall: Yes, Chris, it's Scott. Just a couple of other things. One, I use the word obstacle. I think first, it's important to understand, we think it's a real opportunity for us. So to Craig's point, private credit deployment, real estate credit deployment, we are seeing dramatically more interesting risk reward than we saw even a few months ago. I'd also point to mezzanine. We think this is going to be a really interesting opportunity for mezz. New transactions with sponsors in particular, tend to be over-equitized in this type of environment and you've got a more attractive risk reward there. Opportunistic credit fundraising. Every time the high-yield market trades below 85%, the 1-year returns tend to be in the high 20s. And so we're having really productive dialogue with investors all around the world who are looking to pivot into the leveraged credit markets on the traded side in addition to the private side.  You're right, new deals are harder to finance. It's part of the reason we built the capital markets business, and we have that team sitting in the middle of the firm that can dock directly to debt investors, so we can place our own capital structures. You may lean a bit more on the private credit market in this environment, maybe some portable capital structures. But we're finding ways to get deals done. So I think as we sit here today, we're finding ourselves incredibly enthusiastic about the opportunity that this environment represents for a large part of the firm across our credit platforms.\nOperator: It appears that there are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Craig Larson for closing comments.\nCraig Larson: We'd just like to thank everybody for your time and interest in KKR, and we look forward to connecting next quarter. Thank you so much.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Scott Nuttall",
            "content": "Alex, it's Scott. Just a couple of things I'd add on to what Craig said. You're right. Financing costs are up. I'd say multiples, generally speaking, are down more than financing costs are up. And if you look kind of over time and you run out the math, paying a little bit more to get the financing in place, doesn't have that large an impact on returns as long as you've got the right assets, the right thematic and you're able to make the company better while you own it. So the bottom line is we are still pricing the IRRs to where we were before. It's just a bit of a different mix. Yes. The only thing I would add, Gerry, it's Scott, as Rob mentioned that we continue to feel great about what we shared with you in terms of our growth plans through 2026. We had very little on private wealth in those numbers. So to Craig's point, this is all in front of us and upside for us relative to what's in the firm today. And hopefully, it will provide upside to the trajectory we shared with you at our Analyst Day amongst other quarterly calls. Yes. The only thing I would add, Brian, to your pension plan question, if there's no doubt some U.S. pension plans are getting their bearings right now in trying to figure out where the market is going to go. But we're having a lot of very productive conversations to Craig's point, around anything that's got an inflation protection element or yield. So within credit, infrastructure, real estate. We're having a lot of good dialogues on those fronts even with some of those that are still getting their bearings and may be more active early part of next year than the end of this year.  But remember, we're spending a lot of time with institutions we've never spent time with before. So insurance companies globally are trying to figure out how to navigate the rate environment. Sovereign wealth funds have a different dynamic entirely as do family offices and high net worth investors. So we're having more dialogue than we've ever had before about the markets in the macro and introducing what we're doing.  And I think to the bigger broader point, and you referenced this in your question, we were incredibly fortunate. We raised over $120 billion last year. Our large flagships have been in the market over the last couple of years before the more recent more challenged markets. So we really got a bit lucky with our timing, and that's why we have the $113 billion of dry powder to put to work.  In an environment like this, companies still need capital. And we find private capital tends to have less competition at a time like this. Public markets are more difficult. Corporate M&A is more challenged. So we've got a lot of capital to put to work. Companies still need it. Yes, Arnaud, it's Scott. I'd say the punchline is consistent with your comment. Our pipeline is strong across both value-add and core infrastructure. So we've been announcing deals and we continue to have a full pipeline. You want to start with realizations? Yes. Just a couple of other thoughts, Mike. Thanks for the question.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Robert Lewin",
            "content": "Thanks a lot, Craig, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying a few words on the operating environment. As you know, the third quarter and really the first 9 months of 2022, were very challenging across markets. High levels of inflation are clearly impacting global consumers, while the sharp increase in interest rates has had multiple knock-on effects that will invariably slow much of the global economy. In turn, equity and bond indices have been very volatile and virtually all of them are down significantly year-to-date. And capital markets activity has meaningfully slowed. Global equity and credit issuance is significantly below historical norms.  Now despite all of this volatility and uncertainty, the overall mood and sentiment across KKR is quite positive. And we thought it would be worthwhile this morning to go through 5 key reasons why we feel the way we do.  First, let me remind you why our business model positions us well for periods like this one. There are a few key reasons why. About 90% of our capital is perpetual or committed for an average of 8 years or more from inception. Our management fees are largely calculated on committed or invested capital. And as a result, are more insulated from fluctuating NAVs of our funds. Therefore, much of our management fees are highly predictable, and that visibility in turn, provides us with the continued ability to invest back into the firm for growth.  We also have $43 billion of committed capital yet to turn on that has a weighted average management fee rate of about 100 basis points. And finally, and may be most critical in moments like these, we have $113 billion of uncalled capital from our investors that we can use to invest into the current dislocation.  While those statistics are all meaningful in their own right, I think it's also helpful when viewed in comparison to where we were as a firm, even a short while back. 2.5 years ago, March 31, 2020. So right as we entered COVID, we had $57 billion of dry powder with $19 billion of committed capital yet to earn management fees. That compares to the $113 billion and $43 billion I mentioned a moment ago. So both of these figures have doubled more or less over the last 2.5 years. And when you consider our relative positioning as a firm, those numbers don't account for the significant increase we have had in perpetual capital. largely due to our partnership with Global Atlantic and our acquisition of KJRM as well as the meaningful increase in the diversification of our business, both by geography and strategy.  This brings me to my second reason for optimism. We're fortunate due to our fundraising success and definitely a bit of luck on timing that we are in a position to deploy a significant amount of dry powder with asset prices more dislocated and while capital is quite scarce.  As a result, we are starting to become a lot more constructive on our opportunity sets. We are already finding opportunities across the credit landscape. Our real estate and corporate credit teams are all very active. But more exciting is our outlook for the coming 12 to 18 months across all asset classes and geographies. We are mobilizing our teams and resources against what we see as a growing opportunity to put our client capital to work.  Take for example, in private equity. Oftentimes, our best vintages result from investments made during periods of market distress. Think the early 2000s, the GFC or what we went through a couple of years ago. We think 2023 could present such an opportunity. And the key here is that we have really set ourselves up to be able to outperform in this environment, given our expertise and breadth across geographies, industries and asset classes.  And most importantly, our culture really incentivizes our people to work across the firm to ensure that both information and capability travel and that we can make each other better. As a result, we are uniquely positioned to find creative and attractive investment opportunities.  Turning now to performance, which is my third point. Please turn to Page 8 of the earnings release. As Craig went through every quarter, we report our investment performance for the quarter and trailing 12-month period across our major asset classes. This really though, only tells part of the story as it doesn't capture investment returns since inception. These funds all continue to outperform their comparable public indices. Our clients, really all channels relying us to produce differentiated outcomes compared to what they can achieve in traditional asset classes. And that is just what we've been doing.  Now to be clear, we certainly have today and will, in the future, a handful of more difficult situations to manage. But our thematic approach, which we have talked about many times, and our focus on portfolio construction, are 2 critical reasons why you see this kind of outperformance, which brings me to my fourth point. The strength of our fund performance continues to allow us to raise capital from our investors.  Q3 new capital raised of $13 billion brings year-to-date fundraising to $65 billion. To put that number in perspective, that's already our second best year of fundraising ever, and we still have a quarter to go.  Even more notably, this was against a much more challenging fundraising backdrop than the past few years and with many of our largest flagships in the market. And looking ahead over the next 12 to 18 months, we continue to have a really active calendar and remain constructive about the outlook for scaling our strategies that are coming to market.  And finally, I want to turn to my fifth point. and focus on the competitive differentiation that our balance sheet creates in periods like these. There's not a corporate that I know that doesn't wish they had more capital availability right now. And we are very confident in our ability to deploy our excess capital in opportunities that can both generate compelling investment returns and also help build and scale the firm at the same time.  Part of what generates this confidence is the strength of our existing investment portfolio. Our focus on asset allocation and really where the puck is going, has served us well. While the S&P 500 declined 15% over the last 12 months, our balance sheet was off only 4.7%.  And over the last 3 and 5 years, our annual returns have been 16% and 14%. Also several hundred basis points ahead of the S&P over these periods. One of the key drivers of this outperformance is the shift that we made a few years ago to increase our exposure to real assets. The fair value of our real assets investments have increased from $2.4 billion 2 years ago,to $4.2 billion as of 9/30 and today represent almost 1/4 of our investment portfolio.  Our largest allocation on the balance sheet remains core private equity, and this really gets into business building and how the balance sheet allows us to play offense. As a reminder, core PE is a long-duration investment strategy, where we expect to hold these investments for 10 to 15-plus years and believe they carry a more modest risk return profile compared to our traditional private equity model. We're looking for mid- to high-teens gross IRRs that we can compound for north of a decade. These are businesses we believe have strong secular tailwinds with defensible market positions, solid cash flow dynamics and as a result, benefit from a more stable earnings profile.  So from a standing start 6 years ago, we've put together this really incredible global portfolio of 17 companies with $32 billion of AUM that is both third-party capital together with balance sheet capital. We believe we have the largest core asset management business in the world. And as shareholders, we are all participating in core PE through the compounding of value on our balance sheet, alongside the management fees, capital markets revenue, fee-related earnings and carried interest that is generated over time. That combination is incredibly powerful.  Our acquisition of Global Atlantic in July 2020, right on the heels of COVID, is perhaps the best example of how our balance sheet positions us to play offense when others could not during that period of severe dislocation. We have deep conviction that GA can be a long-term compounder of capital much like core private equity, and we are partnered here with a first rate management team. So far, GA has been performing exceptionally well. Over the last 12 months, they have generated an ROE of about 21%. And well ahead of our expectations. While AUM has increased from approximately $70 billion at announcement to over $130 billion as of 9/30, really helping to also drive our asset management economics.  Core Private Equity and Global Atlantic are great examples, but they're just 2 of many. We know that our model will continue to allow us to find ways to use the balance sheet where we can simultaneously generate compelling investment returns and also use it to grow and scale the firm at the same pace. We have also created a liability structure on our balance sheet that allows for playing real offense in this environment.  We have very intentionally funded ourselves with long-dated liabilities that have fixed cost of capital. The average maturity of our recourse debt is around 20 years, and it is a weighted average fixed coupon of approximately 3% after tax. Obviously, that just isn't replicable today and represents a huge asset for us right now. With all of this, hopefully, it's clear why we remain so excited about our long-term opportunities.  So in summary, number one, our model is durable and diverse with significant recurring revenues. Two, the next 12 to 18 months should present great deployment opportunities and we are extremely well positioned to invest into them. Number three, we are generating excellent investment performance on behalf of our clients. And fourth, our fundraising success has been notable, especially given the backdrop, and we remain very well positioned to achieve growth from here. And finally, number five, our balance sheet is a strategic differentiator whose value is even more meaningful in moments like these.  The opportunity set in front of us over the next 5 to 10 years is immense, and we have never felt better positioned competitively. That's why the tone inside the firm is so constructive right now. Our long-term goals that we have articulated for 2026 are unchanged, and we have a great deal of confidence in our ability to achieve that.  And with that, Scott, Craig and I are happy to take any questions that you have. Great. Craig, thanks for the question. So the short answer is that we have not seen any deterioration of credit quality across Global Atlantic. And as you look forward and as you look at different sensitivities, we feel really good with how that book is positioned. I would note that of their NAIC rated assets, that 95-plus percent of them are NAIC 1 or 2, so investment-grade in nature. And so we feel really good about the underlying strength of the book at Global Atlantic. Sure. Patrick, thanks for the question. Based on transactions that have happened or where we have deals that have either been signed up or we expect that have closed or we expect to close this quarter, we've got approximately $350 million of realized performance revenue and realized investment revenue that we feel good about. So continued momentum on the monetization front in spite of the environment. And if we achieve those numbers, and this price is important, ballpark around 30% comes from carried interest and the balance from realized investment income and incentive fees that will come in at that lower comp range. And so a higher flow-through on monetization is at least what we've got quarter-to-date. In respect of realized monetization revenue in the future, of course, some of this is going to be impacted by the environment. and I've said this before, we don't need straight line up markets when we need or periods of time where volatility is down and pockets of time where volatility is down to be able to monetize our portfolio. And while you're right, we've taken some marks as an industry and as a firm, we still have approximately $9 billion of embedded revenue that sits on the balance sheet across our carried interest outline item as well as our balance sheet. And so that's the fair value of those assets relative to their cost that gives us a good bit of visibility in terms of generating meaningful revenue in the future when we do get those pockets or opportunities to be able to monetize our portfolio. Bill, it's Rob. I'll take this or I'll start. Overall, the punchline is we think GA should be a net beneficiary of a rising rate environment for a couple of reasons, and I'll touch on surrenders at the end. One, flows should be better, both on the individual as well as on the institutional side of that business. I think on the individual side, it's just easier to be able to sell and distribute a 4% annuity than it is a 1.5% annuity.  And then on the institutional side, you referenced blocks. We should benefit here. We're seeing this in our pipeline because all things equal, our reinsurance clients are going to realize lower losses in a higher rate environment. And so I think that's why you're seeing our pipeline pick up on the block side. As it relates to the balance sheet specifically, assets and liabilities are pretty tightly matched at GA, as you know. So we don't expect much impact here, but we definitely do have some floating rate exposure. And so overall, we should be doing better on the balance sheet in a higher rate environment.  And then you mentioned surrenders at the end. It's still early, of course. But so far in 2022, as well as in Q3 of 2022, we've experienced lower surrenders than what we were expecting. If we attribute a good part of this to the design of our products, which is incentivize policyholders from surrendering before they are expected to do so. And so as you think about Global Atlantic and our policies, but 75% of those policies either have surrender charges or aren't able to be surrendered get back to product design and why we feel like we got our arms around that kind of a risk in a rising rate environment. but of course, something that we continue to watch. But the punchline is, we think in this kind of a rising rate type of environment that we're in right now, GA should be a net beneficiary. Sure, in the quarter, Mike, thanks for the question. About $800 million of deployment and monetization, so that's a little bit north of $400 million off of the balance sheet. Yes, Rufus, you hit on it there at the end. As we think about that line item in our P&., -- that is going to be largely driven by our open-ended and more perpetual vehicles that are more yield based in nature. As you would have heard a couple of times already on this call, we have a lot of conviction that we can scale that part of our business. We've got a lot of conviction that we continue to perform on behalf of that client base and as you combine those 2 things, our view as you look over the coming quarters and years, you're going to see a real ramp up in that line item over time."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now hand the call over to Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.\nCraig Larson: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2022 earnings call. This morning, as usual, I\u2019m joined by Rob Lewin, our CFO; and Scott Nuttall, our Co-Chief Executive Officer. We\u2019d like to remind everyone that we\u2019ll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, which is available on the Investor Center section at kkr.com. And as a reminder, we report our segment numbers on an adjusted share basis. This call will contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future rental performance. Please refer to our earnings release and our SEC filings for cautionary factors about these statements. This quarter, we\u2019re reporting fee-related earnings per share of $0.52 and after-tax distributable earnings of $0.95. Looking at the first half of 2022 compared to 2021, we feel very good about our performance. Against a challenging market backdrop, our management fees are up 39%, fee-related earnings increased 28% and our after-tax DE increased 14%. Now, before we go into more details on our results, we\u2019d like to highlight the changes to our business lines that we posted to our website last week and are also reflected in today\u2019s earnings release. We\u2019ve seen a dramatic increase in the scale of our real assets business. So, we split private markets into two business lines, private equity and real assets. Our private equity business line is comprised of our traditional PE, core PE and growth strategies while real assets include real estate, infrastructure and energy. And at the same time, we\u2019re changing the name of our public markets business line to credit and liquid strategies, a more descriptive name for the capital that we manage here. The driver of these changes is the growth and increasing significance of our real assets business. KKR today is a meaningfully more diversified firm by strategy and by geography than it was only a few years ago. To give you a sense of the growth we\u2019ve experienced here at the end of 2019, so two and a half years ago, real assets AUM was $28 billion. Today, that number is $114 million. So it\u2019s over four times the size today compared to just two and a half years ago, and the drivers of this growth are several. At the end of 2019, infrastructure AUM was $15 billion, driven by the scaling of our flagship fund together with our expansion into adjacencies like Asia and core infra, AUM today is almost $50 billion. Within real estate, AUM has increased from $9 million at the end of 2019 to over $60 billion today, and that\u2019s pretty evenly split between real estate equity and real estate credit. Our opportunistic equity strategies have been scaling. We now have core plus [ph] strategies across the Americas, Europe and Asia. We acquired the Japanese REIT business earlier this year, and that\u2019s all alongside a meaningful increase in the breadth of our real estate credit platform driven by Global Atlantic. And in energy, our strategic positioning has improved through our ownership interest in Crescent Energy, while AUM has increased to almost $4 billion. Page 9 of the earnings release helps profile is increasing significant more visually. So the bars that you see on this page in total reflect to what we previously referred to as private markets. And you see each of the bars broken into their private equity and real assets components. So alongside of the AUM growth we just ran through, you\u2019re beginning to see a meaningful increase in real asset management fees and deployment. And at the same time, private equity strategies have been scaling. AUM increased from $92 billion at the end of 2019 to $172 billion [ph] today, driven by the continued growth of our flagship private equity funds alongside the scaling of core private equity and our growth strategies. When you look at the private equity figures for June 30, 2022, and compare those to 2019, AUM, management fees and capital invested have all been growing at a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 30%. Now turning to the quarter itself in our key operating metrics. Assets under management came in at $491 billion. That\u2019s up 14% year-over-year, while fee-paying AUM increased to $384 billion, up 20% compared to last year. This growth is driven by our continued fundraising momentum with $25 billion of new capital raised in Q2 and $52 billion for the first half of the year. In terms of fundraising for the quarter, we\u2019d highlight four things. First, really building on what we just ran through a few moments ago, is the increasing significance of real assets as fundraising across infrastructure and real estate contributed over 40% of new capital raised in the quarter. Of particular note, we closed on over $4 billion of capital for our Asia Infrastructure strategy. Second, we closed on a new $5 billion multi-asset class strategic partnership in the quarter. The broad framework of this partnership is similar to those we\u2019ve talked about with you before. It\u2019s long-dated in nature with recycling provisions. And with around $2 billion recently committed, the net impact on new capital raised in Q2 was approximately $3 billion. This helps bring our total strategic and perpetual capital to $232 billion or 44% of our fee-paying AUM. Third is Global Atlantic. It\u2019s been a good environment for organic activity at GA as new capital raised in the quarter totaled approximately $6 billion. This is seen in both our credit and real assets business lines. And finally, the fourth point is really the breadth of activity that we\u2019re seeing across the credit business. In addition to GA, we were active in the CLO markets in the U.S. and Europe and the private credit markets. And of note here, in Q2, we held the final closing of our Asia Credit Fund. And early in Q3, we announced the final close of our asset-based finance firm. Now alongside of our capital raising, we also continue to find compelling opportunities in which to invest. We deployed $19 billion in the quarter and over $40 billion year-to-date. Again, one of the key drivers of our activity in the quarter was our real assets business with $8 billion of capital invested. Within Infrastructure, core infra was most active deploying across the U.S. and Europe, real estate credit, including Global Atlantic and KREF totaled $4 billion. Real estate equity investment was concentrated in the Americas, really on both the opportunistic and core plus fronts and private equity accounted for $6 billion in the quarter, driven by activity in the U.S. In credit, deployment of $5 billion was driven by GA-related private credit activity. And importantly, at the end of the quarter, we had $115 billion of dry powder ready to deploy into new opportunities. Now before turning it over to Rob, we want to spend a few minutes on a piece of KKR that permeates everything that we do, and that\u2019s ESG. So two things here. First, in June, we published our 11th annual Sustainability Report. The report this year titled scaling up outlines how we\u2019ve been scaling efforts to manage ESG issues across our investment portfolio as well as our global operations. This year marked a significant expansion of the scope of our ESG reporting, which builds on our history of transparency. We hope you\u2019ll take time to go through the report in more detail. And on the back of that, we want to drill down and spend a few minutes on the S in ESG, the social component. This is really important to us. And one spot where we\u2019ve shown real leadership and we\u2019re going to walk through now is our work around broad employee ownership in our portfolio of companies. And we plan to share more stories like this with you in the future. Many of you will recall Pete Stavros\u2019 presentation on C.H.I Overhead Doors at our 2018 Investor Day. We were the fourth private equity owner of the business. It\u2019s across to our manufacturing business and EBITDA margins at that time were already top quartile for building products company at 21%. Now one of the things that our team saw was an opportunity to engage with this workforce in a way that hadn\u2019t been done before. And so began our seven-year journey. We introduced a broad-based equity program at the outset of our investment, so all 800 employees, largely hourly workers, received an ownership interest in the company and we continue to invest in the employee base along the way. And by partnering with the workforce, operational improvements were seen at every level. Injury rates declined meaningfully, employee engagement increased meaningfully and product quality improved. So in total, revenues more than doubled over our ownership and EBITDA more than tripled as EBITDA margins increased from 21% to 35%, all organic. So it was a very successful investment for us. It was a 10x multiple of money transactions for our clients. And through the broad-based equity program, it was also a very successful investment for the employees of C.H.I. On average, the warehouse and factory workers each made $175,000 on the sale and the most tenured workers made approximately $800,000. So they are in multiples of their annual salary through the sale. And now just this morning, we\u2019re pleased to have announced the sale of Minnesota Rubber and Plastics or MRP. Like C.H.I, we introduced a broad-based equity ownership program across all of MRP employees, including many hourly workers when we acquired MRP in 2018. Over 1,300 non-management employees across six countries and four states. In the company and it employs it performs, we\u2019ve seen significant improvements in safety, waste reduction, the speed of new product delivery and earnings growth as EBITDA margins grew from 21% to 25% over our ownership. So again, this will be a strong investment for our fund investors. We expect the sale to be a 3x multiple of our cost in approximately three and a half years. And at the same time, we think it\u2019s a great event for MRP\u2019s employees. On average, employees will receive 100% of their annual income and equity payouts from the sale with the more tenured employees receiving 200% of their annual income. And now we want to turn these experiences into a movement. We\u2019ve implemented broad-based employee ownership programs across many of our traditional PE and impact investments over 25 to-date. We\u2019ve touched over 50,000 employees, and that number is going to grow meaningfully from here. In addition, we have found a new nonprofit called Ownership Works to support public and private companies that are transitioning to shared ownership models like the ones we implemented at C.H.I and MRP. At this time, Ownership Works includes over 60 member firms pursuing this mission. We think part of creating a movement will be storytelling, which is why we walked through the C.H.I and MRP examples, and we look forward to having many additional stories to review with you in the quarters and years ahead. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Rob.\nRob Lewin: Thanks a lot, Craig, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call this morning. First, to go through our quarterly P&L. Our management fees came in at $655 million. That\u2019s up 36% compared to the second quarter of 2021. To put that into context, Q2 of 2021 already reflected a full quarter of Global Atlantic management fees. So the 35% plus growth really reflects the organic momentum that we have across the firm today. Net transaction and monitoring fees were $107 million for the quarter. The decrease here was driven by our capital markets business, which I will spend a bit of time on shortly. As it relates to our expenses, our fee-related comp margin consistent with prior quarters, was 22.5%. Operating expenses totaled $137 million. This increase was driven by a few things, including a heightened level of activity in corporate travel and office operations as well as continued investments in both our technology build-out and marketing organization. This is all critical investment that we feel is setting us up for future growth and is very consistent with our plans for the year. Bringing it all together, our fee-related earnings totaled $461 million or $0.52 per share this quarter. Moving to our realization related revenue, which was very positive for us this quarter, and in aggregate, represented one of our highest in the firm\u2019s history. Realized performance income came in at $731 million. Our carried interest was driven by monetization of internet brands, a number of public market exits and the sales of opportunistic real estate assets. Realized investment income totaled $277 million, driven by these same transactions. In total, our asset management operating earnings were just over $950 million. Our Insurance segment also had a very strong quarter, generating $137 million of operating earnings. Together, these earnings streams resulting in after-tax DE of $840 million or $0.95 per share. Year-to-date, our after-tax DE was over $1.8 billion, up 14% year-on-year, which I think highlights the continued strength of our business model. Taking a step back from the quarterly numbers, the momentum across the firm continues to be exceptionally strong. And there is high confidence that we\u2019re doing the things that we need to do really across the board to set ourselves up for the future. We have had continued fundraising success with $52 billion of new capital raised year-to-date. We are on our way to reaching our goal of being top three in everything that we do. And with 65% of that new capital coming into our real assets and credit businesses we\u2019re becoming a meaningfully more diversified asset management firm. Management fees in turn, are up 39% for the first half of 2022 and with $44 billion of AUM that will become fee-paying when it enters its investment period, we have a good line of sight on future management fee growth. The quality of our investment portfolio is evidenced by our relative investment performance, as well as our ability to monetize these investments through the cycle. Realized gains for KKR are up in the first half of 2022 compared to the same period last year. Though we had a lighter quarter in capital markets, fees for the first half of 2022 are approximately $340 million, very solid against what has clearly been a challenged market backdrop since the beginning of the year. We remain really excited about the potential for our capital markets business. We have a unique business model and an ability to recruit and retain best-in-class talent. Additionally, we have $25 billion of total cash and investments on our balance sheet. Last quarter on this call, we spent a lot of time detailing the strength of both our investment portfolio as well as the unique nature of our long-dated and fixed liabilities. We have no doubt that our position here represents a real competitive advantage, especially in a more volatile market environment, and it will allow for us to emerge from this period in an even stronger position. Turning to our investment performance. The traditional private equity business was down 7% in the quarter compared to broad indices that were down over 16%. And over the last 12 months, the portfolio was up 4%, while the MSCI World was down 14%. Importantly, inception-to-date IRRs for the key flagship returns across geographies remains strong at 32%, 19% and 38% across our Americas, Europe and Asia portfolio companies. Similarly, opportunistic real estate was up 1% in the quarter and over the last 12 months, up 23%. With infrastructure down 1% and up 8% over the last 12 months. On the leveraged credit side, the portfolio was down 6% for the quarter and down 5% for the last 12 months. Our alternative credit portfolio was down 1% in Q2 and up 6% in the LTM. Next, to go through our balance sheet. Investment performance was down 5% in the quarter and up 1% over the last 12 months. We spent time last quarter reviewing the core private equity portfolio. Core PE remains the largest allocation on our balance sheet today. Over 30% of our investments are in the strategy. For Q2, this portfolio was down 2.5%, but up 16% over the last 12 months. The underlying fundamentals of the core PE portfolio remain resilient, with organic revenue and EBITDA up approximately 12% and 10%, respectively, through the first half of 2022. Turning a minute to focus on our Asia franchise. With the closing of our acquisition of the Japanese REIT manager KJRM, the growth in our Asia Infra strategy and our first Asia private credit fund, we continue to feel that we have a really differentiated position in a critical geography. Our Asia-focused capital has increased threefold since the end of 2019, now reaching $59 billion. Most recently, we have raised over $4 billion of capital so far for our Asia infrastructure strategy, making the capital raised already larger than its predecessor, which at $3.8 billion was previously the largest infra fund in the region. We now clearly have the number one franchise in a space that is a tremendous addressable market and real secular tailwinds. As a result of all of this activity, the moat that we have created around our Asia business continues to expand. Finally, I want to take a minute just to review our long-term financial goals. As we have stated on the last few calls, we expect our FRE to be $4-plus per share and our after-tax distributable earnings to be over $7 per share by 2026. These goals have not changed. And we continue to have a great deal of confidence in our ability to meet or exceed our targets. Relative to what we are all reading right now in many corporate headlines, KKR is in a really unique position where we have both the P&L and the business momentum to be able to continue investing back into our business for growth. It\u2019s one of the many reasons that we are all so excited about the long-term potential. And with that, let me hand it off to Scott.\nScott Nuttall: Thank you, Rob, and thank you, everybody, for joining our call this morning. A few weeks ago, we hosted a conference for our global private equity and real asset clients. People from around the world came and spent three days with us at our first in-person event like this since 2019. I thought today, I\u2019d share a handful of key takeaways from the event. First, as a whole, investment performance has never been stronger across the firm. This is a quarterly earnings call. So the discussion on investment performance tends to be focused on the last 90 days. But when you take a step back and look at inception to date IRRs across our key funds, we\u2019ve been delivering differentiated absolute and relative performance for our clients. Second, we\u2019ve talked a great deal on these calls about how we\u2019re highly thematic in our investment approach. This was evident in all of the presentations. We think we got the macro right. And with volatility expected to continue and a more challenging economic environment ahead of us, it will be critical for us to continue to be on the right side of key macro trends and highly connected across the firm. Third, we\u2019ve been balanced investors. As just one example, across our traditional PE funds over the last 12 months, we\u2019ve returned more capital than we deployed. This is in contrast to perception and has helped us in the fundraising numbers that you\u2019ve been seeing. Fourth, our newer businesses are off to a fantastic start. Over the last five years, we\u2019ve launched a series of adjacencies that are early in their life cycle. You\u2019re seeing innovation across our firm. And in our experience, it takes 10 years for businesses to scale and inflect in a way that can move the needle. So there continues to be a great deal of growth ahead of us. And finally, our people. We have never felt better about the talent in the firm. It was fun to be able to show up our deep bench at the conference. As we listen to three days of presentations and discussions, it becomes apparent, we have a unified team that is focused on generating exceptional outcomes. Our numbers speak to the strength, quality and resiliency, not only of our model, but of our most important asset, our people. As we step back from the conference and the markets for a minute, while there\u2019s no doubt the operating environment has shifted compared to six months ago, we are not overly concerned with near-term volatility or the business cycle. In fact, nothing has changed about the path we are on. With record dry powder, multiple scaling businesses, a large and liquid balance sheet and further innovation and expansion underway, our confidence level is high. And we find it as exactly times like this when we make some of our best investments and strategic moves. So, our outlook has not changed, and we are focused on capitalizing on the opportunity any short-term market behavior gives us to create even greater long-term value for all of us. With that, we\u2019re happy to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you very much sir. [Operator Instructions] The first question then is from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAlex Blostein: Hey, good morning everybody, thanks for the question. Question on deployment and a bit of a multipart, I guess, but all related. So the $44 billion of committed capital, they\u2019ll turn on fees once deployed. Can you help break down, which businesses these balances sit within? And how are you thinking about the pace and timing of deploying this capital over the next over the next 12 months or so? What it means for management fees and transaction fees is kind of part of that? And I guess when you take a little bit of a step back, we\u2019ve seen a pretty meaningful decline in sponsor-backed announcements in the space over the last month or two. To what extent is sort of tighter financial conditions do you think could weigh on KKR\u2019s ability to deploy capital?\nRob Lewin: Good morning, Alex, it\u2019s Rob. Thanks a lot for the question. When you look at the $44 billion of capital, that\u2019s up, I think, $8 billion quarter-over-quarter from last quarter, blended management fee rate on that is just north of 1%, at 1.04%. And it\u2019s spread pretty nicely across our three asset management businesses. And so in our private equity business, our core private equity business would be reflected in that number across real assets. You see our Asia Infrastructure strategy where so far, we\u2019ve raised over $4 billion of capital, as Craig noted, that has not yet turned on, so it would be in that $44 billion figure. And then our credit business, most of our credit business, the closed-end funds are going to be turned on when that capital gets invested. And so it\u2019s spread nicely across our three asset management businesses.\nCraig Larson: And then Alex, it\u2019s Craig. Maybe just on point two. Look, I think as it relates to deployment, it\u2019s interesting. A couple of things. One, just on the stacks. private equity and real assets deployment in the first half of the year was $27 billion. That\u2019s up from 12% in the first half of last year. So, when you look broadly in terms of overall level of activity, you\u2019ve actually seen a healthy amount of activity. Now your point on the state of the credit markets, though, is certainly a fair one. I think we\u2019re seeing a couple of dynamics there. Announced M&A as a whole is down. So, I think when you look at new issuance, you\u2019re seeing that, that overall new issuance number is down. I think banks to us are feeling more cautious. So, I think when you\u2019re seeing both of those things reflected in terms of overall levels of activity in the private credit markets. But I think importantly, markets are open and functioning and we still have the ability to finance transactions. We\u2019re not at a point where our ability to finance transactions is impacting our ability to get things done.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. The next question is from Craig Siegenthaler of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank. Good morning everyone.\nCraig Larson: Good morning.\nCraig Siegenthaler: I had a question on private equity performance. And I know it\u2019s just 90 days. But inside of the 7% mark for corporate Private equity, do you have the breakout of public versus private in the quarter? And also, do you have any color on the main funds like Americas XII, Next Gen 2? Thank you very much.\nRob Lewin: Hey Craig, good morning, it\u2019s Rob. Thanks a lot for the question. Certainly, what you would have seen in the quarter is that our publics were down more than our privates. In part, that was impacted by an M&A trade where on one of our privates strategic trade that resulted in a north of $1 billion write-up on our private portfolio. I think you\u2019re right, when you said it is only a 90-day period. I think that\u2019s important to put into context. We feel really good about how we valued our book this quarter. We spent a lot of time on it. Of course, we\u2019ve got a mix about DCF and comparable companies that are going to flow through and impact our marks. I do think it\u2019s important, though, to think about coming into 2022 where our private equity performance was. And in 2019, we generated a 27% return for our investors. That was 17% in 2020 and 46% in 2021. So we came into this period of volatility with a lot of embedded gains. If you invested $1 with us, there\u2019s a lot of ins and outs of course, but just on those returns alone. In 2019, it would still be worth close to $2 today with some of the marks that we\u2019ve taken in Q2.\nScott Nuttall: Yes. I think the only thing I\u2019d add Craig, fundamentally, the companies are continuing to perform well. So I think you\u2019re largely seeing some multiple contraction this quarter. But in terms of the underlying fundamental performance of the portfolio continues to be strong.\nOperator: Thank you very much. The next question is from Gerry O\u2019Hara of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nScott Nuttall: Hey Gerry, are you there? We can\u2019t hear you.\nOperator: Gerry, your line is open. Would you like to ask\u2026\nGerry O\u2019Hara: How about now? Can you hear me all right?\nScott Nuttall: There we go. Hey Gerry.\nGerry O\u2019Hara: Okay. Thanks. Just actually hoping to get a little bit of an update on capital management. And it looks like just during the quarter, there wasn\u2019t any incremental buybacks or at least from the period from May 1 onward, just kind of hope we might get a little bit of an update how you\u2019re thinking about that and potentially how we should think about it going forward.\nRob Lewin: Hey Gerry, thanks for the question. Like most things, I think in our business, probably looking quarter-to-quarter is a little bit less relevant than looking over time. And since we initiated our buyback program several years ago, we\u2019ve bought back or canceled approximately 85 million shares. I think that\u2019s done, give or take, around $25 per share, which is a little bit lower than our book value today. And so when we look back at our body of work over the last several years, we feel good. In addition to that, if you look at Q2 in isolation, we had also completed the acquisition of KJRM, almost $2 billion and issued no equity as part of that. And so as we think about capital allocation and buybacks, what we are most focused on as a management team is ensuring that we drive the highest level of profitability on a per share basis, and there\u2019s multiple ways of being able to get there. And ultimately, if we\u2019re moving our capital around in a way that maximizes ROE, and we think that\u2019s a real core competency of ours. Then ultimately, we will drive long-term best performance from a profitability on a per share basis. Our expectation is share buybacks are going to continue to be a part of that as we move forward.\nOperator: Thank you very much. And the next question is from Brian Mckenna of JMP. Please go ahead.\nBrian Mckenna: Thanks. Good morning everyone. So if I look at net realized performance income prior to 2021, it was running at about $1 billion annually for a few years despite varying operating backdrops, and then as the business scale that essentially doubled the $2 billion plus in 2021, and based on results in the first half of this year, you\u2019re still run rating at about $2 billion. So is this $2 billion run rate level of reasonable expectation moving forward, despite the more challenging backdrop or if the volatility persists, do you think you\u2019ll trend back towards the prior $1 billion level? Just trying to get some additional perspective here, on the baseline level of realizations moving forward.\nRob Lewin: Yes. Thanks a lot for the question. And so we\u2019re probably going to stay away from providing levels of forward guidance, certainly on things like realization. I think what we will say though is that we\u2019ve been really proud of our ability to be able to monetize through the first half of this year in a highly volatile environment. I think that speaks to a couple of things. Scott touched on the strength of our underlying portfolio. And no doubt, without real strong performance in our portfolio, we wouldn\u2019t have been able to achieve those exits. It also speaks to the diversification of our business model. And what we have talked about over time is a real scaling of our capital that is eligible for carry as well as our deployment. And as a result of that, our expectation over time is you\u2019re going to see our carried interest and realized performance income scaling over time and we think can be pretty significant scaling as we move out a number of years and some of our newer funds that are much larger start to get to scale and are maturing. So hopefully, that gives you a bit of color.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Patrick Davitt of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Davitt: Hi, good morning everyone. It looks like the mark-to-market on the fee paying side of the AUM rolled forward was significantly worse than most people expected. So could you flush out kind of some of the key drivers in the negative marks on the fee-paying AUM side, maybe by strategy and/or vehicle? And in that vein, it looks like management fees actually came in more or less in line. So is it fair to assume that the fee rate on the more negatively marked AUM was dramatically lower than the inflows.\nRob Lewin: Patrick, you hit it perfectly. So the majority of that change in value is a result in really interest rates going up in the fixed income portfolio at Global Atlantic trading down. And so that\u2019s what\u2019s driving it. And as you think about our fee rate on the Global Atlantic pool of capital that\u2019s materially lower than the rest of our business. And so that\u2019s why you end up in a scenario where our management fees are pretty disproportional to what you see in terms of the change in value on our fee-paying assets.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Arnaud Giblat of BNP. Please go ahead.\nArnaud Giblat: Hi, good morning. My question is on secondaries. Could you discuss your view on the outlook [ph] for secondary funds at this point in the cycle? And how you\u2019re thinking about positioning there and gaining exposure either organically or inorganically? Thank you.\nRob Lewin: Yes. And so we have no \u2013 thanks a lot for the question. We have nothing that\u2019s imminent to report as it relates to secondaries, whether that\u2019s organic or inorganic. It\u2019s a space that we continue to look at with interest. It is certainly adjacent to our core private equity strategies across the firm. And so it\u2019s one that we\u2019re spending time on. I think what\u2019s important to note is we\u2019ve talked about our goals, our financial measures that we expect to achieve over the next four to five years generating $4-plus of FRE. That\u2019s based on principally things that KKR is doing today. Doesn\u2019t rely on any inorganic activity. And so while we\u2019ll continue to look at the space, and spend time on it. There\u2019s a lot of areas that we\u2019re focused on KKR that are in front of us that we\u2019ve started where we have track records, and we\u2019ve got a lot of opportunity to scale this.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks. Good morning folks. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just to focus on the real assets segmentation and more strategically and how you\u2019re thinking about it. I guess a two partner first, are you \u2013 you\u2019ve already built this business, obviously, hence this, the \u2013 reason for or justification for segmenting it out, but is there also a change in management focus in focusing on this area disproportionately going forward? And then the second part of that is on the infrastructure side. Can you talk about your view on energy transition? I don\u2019t know if that would fit into an infrastructure strategy or whether you would consider over the long-term raising an energy transition fund. And maybe just your views long-term in that area given that you\u2019ve got a lot of focus on real assets broadly in general.\nCraig Larson: Hey Brian, it\u2019s Craig. Why don\u2019t I start? I\u2019m sure on the overarching question you\u2019re asking, Scott will add. Look, I think in terms of the two businesses, you mentioned in infrastructure, you\u2019re right, we have seen really dramatic scaling in both of those businesses. If you go back to our Investor Day in April of last year, we walked through infrastructure as a case study of how honestly; we look to build investment platforms. Begin with strong performance of flagship strategies and then look to scale and innovate at the same time. And that innovation can come geographically as a big with Asia infra, and it also could come in terms of expansion into new risk/reward as we\u2019ve seen also with core infra. So we have, at this point, three distinct market segments in Infra. We\u2019ve got the global infra funds series, Asia diversified core. It\u2019s interesting at that Investor Day again a little over a year ago. We gave some goals or targets we set out. AUM at that point was $17 billion. We estimated that Infra AUM at the end of this year would exceed $30 billion. We\u2019re in the high 50s now. So we\u2019ve obviously had a lot of success there, all organic. We talked to management fees doubling from $150 to about $300 for 2022. Through the first six months, we\u2019re at $170. So we\u2019re comfortably on our way to exceeding that target. And in terms of real estate, really from a blank \u2013 beginning with a bank like late in 2013, the platform has grown into a powerful, fully integrated platform $60 billion of AUM today split pretty equally between debt and equity. We have over a dozen vehicles with independent economics. So I think when we look at how we\u2019re situated and the opportunities for continued growth, on top of that, we feel great about how we\u2019re positioned. And then you\u2019re right, as it relates to the opportunities that we have to continue to grow and invest in a lot of the areas of ESG. I think to date, you\u2019ve seen that both through our impact strategy. You\u2019ve also seen that through our infrastructure strategy. So nothing new to report on that as it relates to how we think about renewals or a dedicated strategy along those lines, nothing to report today. But I think you\u2019ll continue to see that as a real focus of ours. It\u2019s absolutely one of the six or seven core themes that we\u2019re pursuing on a global basis.\nScott Nuttall: Yes. Brian, just in terms of your question on the strategic focus, is there any change? The answer is no. I think it was really just recognition that these businesses had scaled both infrastructure and real estate were efforts that we started post financial crisis. And we\u2019ve been in business building mode. We continue to be. But we found that there was a time a bit of a misunderstanding under the private markets prior segmentation. There is periodically a presumption that, that was mostly Private equity. And that\u2019s just not the case, as you can see in the chart. Just to give you a sense for the numbers. We deployed about $40 billion in the first half of this year. real assets was $17 billion of the $40 billion; credit was $13 million; and private equity was $10 million. So to the \u2013 partially pick up the prior question on the deal environment, private equity has been sub-25% of our deployment over the last 12 months, give or take, and real assets just as a larger and larger part of our firm. So we thought it was time to break it out and share it with you more explicitly going forward, but no change in focus.\nOperator: Thank you sir. The next question is from Finian O\u2019Shea of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nFinian O\u2019Shea: Hi, good morning. A question on BDCs, one of your peers lowered its fee pretty meaningfully this morning, seeing if you have any initial take on what that might mean for the product line? And maybe if this is more of a first mover or just a one-off for that group? Thank you.\nCraig Larson: Hey Fin, it\u2019s Craig. Thanks for the question. FSK is obviously a publicly-traded entity. It got its own management team, its own shareholders, its own board. So really, it\u2019s probably a better question for their upcoming earnings call and not ours. Just in terms of FSK, broadly, we\u2019re really pleased with the performance of the business and the progress that we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years. But in terms of your specific question on fee structure, we point you to FSK.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. The next question is from Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMichael Cyprys: Hey good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you could talk about retail on the private wealth side. Hoping you could just update us on some of the initiatives there that you have on the retail side. How much was raised in the quarter? Maybe where that, sits from an AUM standpoint today and more broadly on retail, talk about some of the distribution initiatives in the private wealth channel, including around the KREST product and platform expansion. And just a quickie for a cleanup question for Rob at the end, just around the amount of capital raised and monetized off the balance sheet in the quarter. Thank you.\nCraig Larson: Thanks Mike. So why don\u2019t I begin? Just first, as it relates to overall AUM, we have about $70 billion in total. That\u2019s in three buckets. That includes funds and strategies that we market through channels. That also includes the efforts of our own team that is focused on direct sales and activities with wealth and private wealth and high net worth and ultra high net worth individuals. And then that also includes the democratized piece that you\u2019re mentioning, which was a hair below $6 billion as of June 30. In terms of the update on the democratized front, so first on KREST. So reminder on KREST, we began taking third-party capital in June of 2021. As of June 2022, it was $1.3 billion. It crossed that $1 billion threshold earlier this year, obviously. We believe that\u2019s the fastest that any private REIT has crossed that threshold. Performance has been very strong. Net annualized returns net north of 20%. And the distribution footprint is growing, which is great to see. So as I know you will be well aware, in particular, there are three main wire houses in the U.S. KREST has been on e of those since launch. It was onboarded at a second quite recently within the last week, actually, and it\u2019s scheduled to be launched on the third in the coming weeks. So also in Q3 and these are important milestones for us with the wire houses. And at the same time, we\u2019re focused on expanding distribution. That\u2019s true as it relates to the RIA and broker-dealer channels domestically as well as the private wealth channels internationally. So we feel great about the long-term path that KREST is on, the performance that\u2019s delivered and the opportunity ahead of us. And then as it relates again to the \u2013 just your questions on democratize where we are holistically. Again, AUM in total was 5.7% a year ago. It was at 3.5%. We\u2019ve been hiring distribution talent and we expect to continue to do so as we think about broadening distribution of these products. And then finally, you\u2019re going to see more innovation here. So we expect over the coming two or three quarters, we\u2019ll have launched democratized, infrastructure and private equity strategies, and we expect to see those launched quite broadly, both in the U.S. as well as internationally. So I think to date, these democratized products have really been focused in real estate and credit. And it feels to us like there\u2019s real interest in expanding those opportunities into additional asset classes like Infra and PE, where honestly, there\u2019s a lot more white space for us. So I think with our track record, our ability to innovate the brand, how we\u2019re positioned, it just feels like we\u2019re really well positioned.\nRob Lewin: And then my quick follow-up in the quarter, we had realizations of about $400 million off the balance sheet, deployment of about $800 million, and that $800 million does not include the roughly $1.7 billion that went into the KJRM acquisition.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Our next question is from Rufus Hone of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nRufus Hone: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to come back to the fund performance in traditional Private equity. Could you give us a little more detail around the fundamental performance of the portfolio companies, you gave us some helpful metrics related to the core PE book. And I was wondering, how that was tracking relative to the core book. And could you also update us on the marks in growth equity this quarter? Thank you.\nCraig Larson: Sure. And Rufus, you cut out on the second part there. So I\u2019ll let you repeat that or actually, if you could repeat that in a second. So it was private equity portfolio. And then what was the second part?\nRufus Hone: It was around the marks in growth equity this quarter. If you could provide us any detail, that would be great. Thank you.\nCraig Larson: Got it. First, as it relates to the revenue and EBITDA trends I think as Scott noted at the outset, we\u2019ve been really well situated given the focus we have and the themes that we\u2019ve invested behind. So the underlying performance of the portfolio of companies continues to be quite strong. So we\u2019re in \u2013 looking back historically and we look at this on a fair value weighted basis, the revenue and EBITDA growth that we\u2019ve seen in the private equity portfolio is in double digits on a trailing 12-month basis. So we\u2019ve been really pleased with the resiliency that you\u2019ve been seeing in terms of the underlying private equity portfolio. And then as it relates to the growth strategies that we\u2019ve seen in performance this quarter, again, recognizing that the S&P and MSCI were down 16% in the quarter, our next-gen tech portfolio was down in the low double digits. Healthcare was actually up honestly in the quarter. So I think in the quarter, a really volatile period, we feel good about that overall performance and in particular, feel very good about the performance and the experience that our LPs have had on an inception-to-date basis.\nOperator: Thank you very much sir. The next question is from Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer and Company. Please go ahead.\nChris Kotowski: Yes. I thought Craig\u2019s discussion of the equity participation was interesting. But both of the examples you listed were kind of traditional Midwestern industrial companies. And so I\u2019m wondering that kind of deep equity participation is that a strategy that you kind of pursue across the board in all your transactions, whether it\u2019s Private equity, Energy, Health Care or \u2013 do certain industries lend themselves to this kind of deep broad participation and others don\u2019t? And just kind of curious, how you think about employing that strategy strategically.\nScott Nuttall: It\u2019s a great question, Chris. It\u2019s Scott. And astute, so you\u2019re right. We actually started piloting this program with our U.S. industrials private equity investments. And this was a bit over 10 years ago that we started this effort. And so some of what you\u2019re seeing is some of those early investments now being exited, which is why you got C.H.I and MRP as the two examples that have happened in the very recent past. What we have done though is now that we\u2019ve kind of developed this strategy as we are rolling this out across all of our control investments. In private equity starting in North America, and we\u2019re actually looking at it now for Europe and potentially Asia as well. So it was piloted there, and we\u2019re now expanding across everything that we do that\u2019s control. So there\u2019ll be more to come on this, but we\u2019ve been really pleased with the results. And we think this effort is applicable across industries and geographies.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. The next question is from Robert Lee of KBW. Please go ahead.\nRobert Lee: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, I\u2019ll actually have a little bit of a multi-parter. So the first one is maybe, Rob, if you could update us on where things stand this quarter so far as you\u2019re thinking as you\u2019re looking ahead for realization activity? And then second question on \u2013 really on the insurance business. Could you give us a sense of kind of global land contribution to flows, organic growth this quarter, kind of how that business should be a very good environment for obviously, annuity sales and maybe update us on the momentum of that business and with that kind of current spread expectations?\nRob Lewin: Yes. Rob, I\u2019ll take both of those. And so on the monetization point, another positive area for us this quarter, and I think continues to show the momentum. So as we sit here today, based on transactions that have happened or where we have deals that have been signed up and we expect to close this quarter, we have visibility to around $500 million of monetization related revenue. So again, some pretty good momentum on the monetization front in spite of the environment that we\u2019re in. And if we achieve those numbers, ballpark will be about 75% realized performance revenue and the balance from realized investment income. As it relates to Global Atlantic, you are right, in a rising rate environment. I think we see a little bit more momentum certainly in the individual channel from a sales perspective. And flows this quarter were really strong. They were about $6 billion of total inflows in the quarter, which is a great quarter for GA. Again, there\u2019s no block activity in that number. And the spread, give or take, around 100 basis points in the business. And so we\u2019re feeling really good about how GA is positioned going into this period of time and their relationships across the bank and broker-dealer channel I think have served them really well and to take advantage of what is quite an apply environment in terms of annuity sales.\nRobert Lee: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. The next question is a follow-up from Brian McKenna [JMP Securities]. Please go ahead.\nBrian Mckenna: Great. Thanks for the follow up. Just on the quarter-to-date realizations, how much of that $500 million is tied to the C.H.I transaction. And it might be a little early for this, but how has Marshall Wace been performing year-to-date? Just trying to think through what that incentive fee might look like in the fourth quarter? Thanks.\nRob Lewin: Yes, sure. Thanks, Brian. And so we\u2019re not going to give specific numbers on individual deals as it relates to the Q3 monetization. I think the punchline is we feel pretty good across the board in terms of our ability to generate monetization outcomes at least so far this year. And you\u2019ve seen that in Q1 and Q2, and we\u2019re off to a good start in Q3. As it relates to Marshall Wace, maybe just take a step back, we feel great about that partnership. They\u2019re north of $60 billion of AUM today, when we started that partnership. That business was right around $20 billion of AUM maybe a touch below. So they\u2019ve done just a phenomenal job on behalf of their clients and have grown considerably as a result. Again, year-to-date, they\u2019ve got a bunch of different strategies. But overall, the performance has been strong. It\u2019s been on the positive side. We\u2019ll see how things wrap up between now and the end of September. As you know, that will dictate their annual incentive fee for most of what they do. And so as we sit here today, they\u2019re in positive territory, certainly not quite like last year, but we feel overall, just great about that partnership so far.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is a follow-up from Rufus Hone [BMO Capital Markets]. Please go ahead.\nRufus Hone: Great. Thanks for taking the follow-up. I wanted to come back to your earlier comments around returning more capital to LPs than you\u2019ve deployed, and that\u2019s helping conversations in Private equity. And I was wondering whether you\u2019ve seen any change in LP appetite for core Private equity, and how do you view the outlook for deployment there? thank you.\nCraig Larson: So I think we feel \u2013 and Rufus, thanks. I think on core, we\u2019re just really thrilled with how the business is positioned. The opportunities for us, as we think about our trajectory going forward. Now just to give you a sense, two years ago, AUM was $12 billion as of June 30, that number is 32%. And you\u2019re going to see that through our balance sheet. You\u2019ll see that through the management fee line. Over time, with continued performance, you\u2019ll see that in investment income. And again, you\u2019re going to see that over time as it relates to capital markets. So we have a number of ways to win, which is exciting for us. That business is global. So I think it\u2019s just \u2013 it continues to feel like the business is wonderfully well positioned. On the deployment outlook, again, we\u2019re in a choppy environment. So we\u2019ll have to see the willing buyer, willing seller dynamic, certainly, but as we think about the long-term trajectory and opportunity for us, just feel exceptionally and uniquely well positioned.\nRob Lewin: Yes. Just a quick follow-up there, Rufus. So of our $115 billion of dry powder, approximately $13 billion of that is in core Private equity. So we came into this period of time with a lot of firepower in that part of our business. And as Craig said, we feel pretty advantaged. And as we think about owning businesses in that part of our business for a 10- to 15-year period of time, gives you just a different lens in being able to evaluate acquisition opportunities and some of the things that might matter more than a three- to five- to seven-year investment might matter a little bit less when your hold period for that duration of time. So we would continue to expect there to be a real deployment across that business over the next several quarters.\nScott Nuttall: Yes. Just more broadly, as a reminder, Rufus, as we came into this period of time in a really fortunate position around PE broadly, that we had raised the vast, vast majority of the capital for our flagship private equity funds before this year started, including the vast bulk of the capital for our core strategy. So while investors maybe take a little bit of time to get their bearings on PE in particular, that\u2019s not really impacting much what we\u2019re seeing in terms of PE fund raise. The vast majority of capital we\u2019re raising right now is around credit and real assets where we continue to see a good amount of interest.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would now like to turn, the call back to Craig Larson for some closing comments.\nCraig Larson: Chris thanks for your help and thank you everybody for joining us. We really appreciate the time and attention on our quarterly results. And if we don\u2019t speak with you in between, I look forward to chatting with everybody next quarter. Thank you again.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rob Lewin",
            "content": "Thanks a lot, Craig, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call this morning. First, to go through our quarterly P&L. Our management fees came in at $655 million. That's up 36% compared to the second quarter of 2021. To put that into context, Q2 of 2021 already reflected a full quarter of Global Atlantic management fees. So the 35% plus growth really reflects the organic momentum that we have across the firm today. Net transaction and monitoring fees were $107 million for the quarter. The decrease here was driven by our capital markets business, which I will spend a bit of time on shortly. As it relates to our expenses, our fee-related comp margin consistent with prior quarters, was 22.5%. Operating expenses totaled $137 million. This increase was driven by a few things, including a heightened level of activity in corporate travel and office operations as well as continued investments in both our technology build-out and marketing organization. This is all critical investment that we feel is setting us up for future growth and is very consistent with our plans for the year. Bringing it all together, our fee-related earnings totaled $461 million or $0.52 per share this quarter. Moving to our realization related revenue, which was very positive for us this quarter, and in aggregate, represented one of our highest in the firm's history. Realized performance income came in at $731 million. Our carried interest was driven by monetization of internet brands, a number of public market exits and the sales of opportunistic real estate assets. Realized investment income totaled $277 million, driven by these same transactions. In total, our asset management operating earnings were just over $950 million. Our Insurance segment also had a very strong quarter, generating $137 million of operating earnings. Together, these earnings streams resulting in after-tax DE of $840 million or $0.95 per share. Year-to-date, our after-tax DE was over $1.8 billion, up 14% year-on-year, which I think highlights the continued strength of our business model. Taking a step back from the quarterly numbers, the momentum across the firm continues to be exceptionally strong. And there is high confidence that we're doing the things that we need to do really across the board to set ourselves up for the future. We have had continued fundraising success with $52 billion of new capital raised year-to-date. We are on our way to reaching our goal of being top three in everything that we do. And with 65% of that new capital coming into our real assets and credit businesses we're becoming a meaningfully more diversified asset management firm. Management fees in turn, are up 39% for the first half of 2022 and with $44 billion of AUM that will become fee-paying when it enters its investment period, we have a good line of sight on future management fee growth. The quality of our investment portfolio is evidenced by our relative investment performance, as well as our ability to monetize these investments through the cycle. Realized gains for KKR are up in the first half of 2022 compared to the same period last year. Though we had a lighter quarter in capital markets, fees for the first half of 2022 are approximately $340 million, very solid against what has clearly been a challenged market backdrop since the beginning of the year. We remain really excited about the potential for our capital markets business. We have a unique business model and an ability to recruit and retain best-in-class talent. Additionally, we have $25 billion of total cash and investments on our balance sheet. Last quarter on this call, we spent a lot of time detailing the strength of both our investment portfolio as well as the unique nature of our long-dated and fixed liabilities. We have no doubt that our position here represents a real competitive advantage, especially in a more volatile market environment, and it will allow for us to emerge from this period in an even stronger position. Turning to our investment performance. The traditional private equity business was down 7% in the quarter compared to broad indices that were down over 16%. And over the last 12 months, the portfolio was up 4%, while the MSCI World was down 14%. Importantly, inception-to-date IRRs for the key flagship returns across geographies remains strong at 32%, 19% and 38% across our Americas, Europe and Asia portfolio companies. Similarly, opportunistic real estate was up 1% in the quarter and over the last 12 months, up 23%. With infrastructure down 1% and up 8% over the last 12 months. On the leveraged credit side, the portfolio was down 6% for the quarter and down 5% for the last 12 months. Our alternative credit portfolio was down 1% in Q2 and up 6% in the LTM. Next, to go through our balance sheet. Investment performance was down 5% in the quarter and up 1% over the last 12 months. We spent time last quarter reviewing the core private equity portfolio. Core PE remains the largest allocation on our balance sheet today. Over 30% of our investments are in the strategy. For Q2, this portfolio was down 2.5%, but up 16% over the last 12 months. The underlying fundamentals of the core PE portfolio remain resilient, with organic revenue and EBITDA up approximately 12% and 10%, respectively, through the first half of 2022. Turning a minute to focus on our Asia franchise. With the closing of our acquisition of the Japanese REIT manager KJRM, the growth in our Asia Infra strategy and our first Asia private credit fund, we continue to feel that we have a really differentiated position in a critical geography. Our Asia-focused capital has increased threefold since the end of 2019, now reaching $59 billion. Most recently, we have raised over $4 billion of capital so far for our Asia infrastructure strategy, making the capital raised already larger than its predecessor, which at $3.8 billion was previously the largest infra fund in the region. We now clearly have the number one franchise in a space that is a tremendous addressable market and real secular tailwinds. As a result of all of this activity, the moat that we have created around our Asia business continues to expand. Finally, I want to take a minute just to review our long-term financial goals. As we have stated on the last few calls, we expect our FRE to be $4-plus per share and our after-tax distributable earnings to be over $7 per share by 2026. These goals have not changed. And we continue to have a great deal of confidence in our ability to meet or exceed our targets. Relative to what we are all reading right now in many corporate headlines, KKR is in a really unique position where we have both the P&L and the business momentum to be able to continue investing back into our business for growth. It's one of the many reasons that we are all so excited about the long-term potential. And with that, let me hand it off to Scott. Good morning, Alex, it's Rob. Thanks a lot for the question. When you look at the $44 billion of capital, that's up, I think, $8 billion quarter-over-quarter from last quarter, blended management fee rate on that is just north of 1%, at 1.04%. And it's spread pretty nicely across our three asset management businesses. And so in our private equity business, our core private equity business would be reflected in that number across real assets. You see our Asia Infrastructure strategy where so far, we've raised over $4 billion of capital, as Craig noted, that has not yet turned on, so it would be in that $44 billion figure. And then our credit business, most of our credit business, the closed-end funds are going to be turned on when that capital gets invested. And so it's spread nicely across our three asset management businesses. Hey Craig, good morning, it's Rob. Thanks a lot for the question. Certainly, what you would have seen in the quarter is that our publics were down more than our privates. In part, that was impacted by an M&A trade where on one of our privates strategic trade that resulted in a north of $1 billion write-up on our private portfolio. I think you're right, when you said it is only a 90-day period. I think that's important to put into context. We feel really good about how we valued our book this quarter. We spent a lot of time on it. Of course, we've got a mix about DCF and comparable companies that are going to flow through and impact our marks. I do think it's important, though, to think about coming into 2022 where our private equity performance was. And in 2019, we generated a 27% return for our investors. That was 17% in 2020 and 46% in 2021. So we came into this period of volatility with a lot of embedded gains. If you invested $1 with us, there's a lot of ins and outs of course, but just on those returns alone. In 2019, it would still be worth close to $2 today with some of the marks that we've taken in Q2. Hey Gerry, thanks for the question. Like most things, I think in our business, probably looking quarter-to-quarter is a little bit less relevant than looking over time. And since we initiated our buyback program several years ago, we've bought back or canceled approximately 85 million shares. I think that's done, give or take, around $25 per share, which is a little bit lower than our book value today. And so when we look back at our body of work over the last several years, we feel good. In addition to that, if you look at Q2 in isolation, we had also completed the acquisition of KJRM, almost $2 billion and issued no equity as part of that. And so as we think about capital allocation and buybacks, what we are most focused on as a management team is ensuring that we drive the highest level of profitability on a per share basis, and there's multiple ways of being able to get there. And ultimately, if we're moving our capital around in a way that maximizes ROE, and we think that's a real core competency of ours. Then ultimately, we will drive long-term best performance from a profitability on a per share basis. Our expectation is share buybacks are going to continue to be a part of that as we move forward. Yes. Thanks a lot for the question. And so we're probably going to stay away from providing levels of forward guidance, certainly on things like realization. I think what we will say though is that we've been really proud of our ability to be able to monetize through the first half of this year in a highly volatile environment. I think that speaks to a couple of things. Scott touched on the strength of our underlying portfolio. And no doubt, without real strong performance in our portfolio, we wouldn't have been able to achieve those exits. It also speaks to the diversification of our business model. And what we have talked about over time is a real scaling of our capital that is eligible for carry as well as our deployment. And as a result of that, our expectation over time is you're going to see our carried interest and realized performance income scaling over time and we think can be pretty significant scaling as we move out a number of years and some of our newer funds that are much larger start to get to scale and are maturing. So hopefully, that gives you a bit of color. Patrick, you hit it perfectly. So the majority of that change in value is a result in really interest rates going up in the fixed income portfolio at Global Atlantic trading down. And so that's what's driving it. And as you think about our fee rate on the Global Atlantic pool of capital that's materially lower than the rest of our business. And so that's why you end up in a scenario where our management fees are pretty disproportional to what you see in terms of the change in value on our fee-paying assets. Yes. And so we have no \u2013 thanks a lot for the question. We have nothing that's imminent to report as it relates to secondaries, whether that's organic or inorganic. It's a space that we continue to look at with interest. It is certainly adjacent to our core private equity strategies across the firm. And so it's one that we're spending time on. I think what's important to note is we've talked about our goals, our financial measures that we expect to achieve over the next four to five years generating $4-plus of FRE. That's based on principally things that KKR is doing today. Doesn't rely on any inorganic activity. And so while we'll continue to look at the space, and spend time on it. There's a lot of areas that we're focused on KKR that are in front of us that we've started where we have track records, and we've got a lot of opportunity to scale this. And then my quick follow-up in the quarter, we had realizations of about $400 million off the balance sheet, deployment of about $800 million, and that $800 million does not include the roughly $1.7 billion that went into the KJRM acquisition. Yes. Rob, I'll take both of those. And so on the monetization point, another positive area for us this quarter, and I think continues to show the momentum. So as we sit here today, based on transactions that have happened or where we have deals that have been signed up and we expect to close this quarter, we have visibility to around $500 million of monetization related revenue. So again, some pretty good momentum on the monetization front in spite of the environment that we're in. And if we achieve those numbers, ballpark will be about 75% realized performance revenue and the balance from realized investment income. As it relates to Global Atlantic, you are right, in a rising rate environment. I think we see a little bit more momentum certainly in the individual channel from a sales perspective. And flows this quarter were really strong. They were about $6 billion of total inflows in the quarter, which is a great quarter for GA. Again, there's no block activity in that number. And the spread, give or take, around 100 basis points in the business. And so we're feeling really good about how GA is positioned going into this period of time and their relationships across the bank and broker-dealer channel I think have served them really well and to take advantage of what is quite an apply environment in terms of annuity sales. Yes, sure. Thanks, Brian. And so we're not going to give specific numbers on individual deals as it relates to the Q3 monetization. I think the punchline is we feel pretty good across the board in terms of our ability to generate monetization outcomes at least so far this year. And you've seen that in Q1 and Q2, and we're off to a good start in Q3. As it relates to Marshall Wace, maybe just take a step back, we feel great about that partnership. They're north of $60 billion of AUM today, when we started that partnership. That business was right around $20 billion of AUM maybe a touch below. So they've done just a phenomenal job on behalf of their clients and have grown considerably as a result. Again, year-to-date, they've got a bunch of different strategies. But overall, the performance has been strong. It's been on the positive side. We'll see how things wrap up between now and the end of September. As you know, that will dictate their annual incentive fee for most of what they do. And so as we sit here today, they're in positive territory, certainly not quite like last year, but we feel overall, just great about that partnership so far. Yes. Just a quick follow-up there, Rufus. So of our $115 billion of dry powder, approximately $13 billion of that is in core Private equity. So we came into this period of time with a lot of firepower in that part of our business. And as Craig said, we feel pretty advantaged. And as we think about owning businesses in that part of our business for a 10- to 15-year period of time, gives you just a different lens in being able to evaluate acquisition opportunities and some of the things that might matter more than a three- to five- to seven-year investment might matter a little bit less when your hold period for that duration of time. So we would continue to expect there to be a real deployment across that business over the next several quarters."

            "name": "Scott Nuttall",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob, and thank you, everybody, for joining our call this morning. A few weeks ago, we hosted a conference for our global private equity and real asset clients. People from around the world came and spent three days with us at our first in-person event like this since 2019. I thought today, I'd share a handful of key takeaways from the event. First, as a whole, investment performance has never been stronger across the firm. This is a quarterly earnings call. So the discussion on investment performance tends to be focused on the last 90 days. But when you take a step back and look at inception to date IRRs across our key funds, we've been delivering differentiated absolute and relative performance for our clients. Second, we've talked a great deal on these calls about how we're highly thematic in our investment approach. This was evident in all of the presentations. We think we got the macro right. And with volatility expected to continue and a more challenging economic environment ahead of us, it will be critical for us to continue to be on the right side of key macro trends and highly connected across the firm. Third, we've been balanced investors. As just one example, across our traditional PE funds over the last 12 months, we've returned more capital than we deployed. This is in contrast to perception and has helped us in the fundraising numbers that you've been seeing. Fourth, our newer businesses are off to a fantastic start. Over the last five years, we've launched a series of adjacencies that are early in their life cycle. You're seeing innovation across our firm. And in our experience, it takes 10 years for businesses to scale and inflect in a way that can move the needle. So there continues to be a great deal of growth ahead of us. And finally, our people. We have never felt better about the talent in the firm. It was fun to be able to show up our deep bench at the conference. As we listen to three days of presentations and discussions, it becomes apparent, we have a unified team that is focused on generating exceptional outcomes. Our numbers speak to the strength, quality and resiliency, not only of our model, but of our most important asset, our people. As we step back from the conference and the markets for a minute, while there's no doubt the operating environment has shifted compared to six months ago, we are not overly concerned with near-term volatility or the business cycle. In fact, nothing has changed about the path we are on. With record dry powder, multiple scaling businesses, a large and liquid balance sheet and further innovation and expansion underway, our confidence level is high. And we find it as exactly times like this when we make some of our best investments and strategic moves. So, our outlook has not changed, and we are focused on capitalizing on the opportunity any short-term market behavior gives us to create even greater long-term value for all of us. With that, we're happy to take your questions. Yes. I think the only thing I'd add Craig, fundamentally, the companies are continuing to perform well. So I think you're largely seeing some multiple contraction this quarter. But in terms of the underlying fundamental performance of the portfolio continues to be strong. Hey Gerry, are you there? We can't hear you. There we go. Hey Gerry. Yes. Brian, just in terms of your question on the strategic focus, is there any change? The answer is no. I think it was really just recognition that these businesses had scaled both infrastructure and real estate were efforts that we started post financial crisis. And we've been in business building mode. We continue to be. But we found that there was a time a bit of a misunderstanding under the private markets prior segmentation. There is periodically a presumption that, that was mostly Private equity. And that's just not the case, as you can see in the chart. Just to give you a sense for the numbers. We deployed about $40 billion in the first half of this year. real assets was $17 billion of the $40 billion; credit was $13 million; and private equity was $10 million. So to the \u2013 partially pick up the prior question on the deal environment, private equity has been sub-25% of our deployment over the last 12 months, give or take, and real assets just as a larger and larger part of our firm. So we thought it was time to break it out and share it with you more explicitly going forward, but no change in focus. It's a great question, Chris. It's Scott. And astute, so you're right. We actually started piloting this program with our U.S. industrials private equity investments. And this was a bit over 10 years ago that we started this effort. And so some of what you're seeing is some of those early investments now being exited, which is why you got C.H.I and MRP as the two examples that have happened in the very recent past. What we have done though is now that we've kind of developed this strategy as we are rolling this out across all of our control investments. In private equity starting in North America, and we're actually looking at it now for Europe and potentially Asia as well. So it was piloted there, and we're now expanding across everything that we do that's control. So there'll be more to come on this, but we've been really pleased with the results. And we think this effort is applicable across industries and geographies. Yes. Just more broadly, as a reminder, Rufus, as we came into this period of time in a really fortunate position around PE broadly, that we had raised the vast, vast majority of the capital for our flagship private equity funds before this year started, including the vast bulk of the capital for our core strategy. So while investors maybe take a little bit of time to get their bearings on PE in particular, that's not really impacting much what we're seeing in terms of PE fund raise. The vast majority of capital we're raising right now is around credit and real assets where we continue to see a good amount of interest."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to KKR's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I'll now hand the call over to Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.\nCraig Larson: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2021 earnings call. This morning, I'm joined this morning by Scott Nuttall, our Co. Chief Executive Officer; and Rob Lewin, our CFO. We'd like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, which is available on the Investor Center section at kkr.com and as a reminder, we report our segment numbers on an adjusted-share basis. This call will contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to our earnings release and our SEC filings for cautionary factors about these statements. So we're pleased to be reporting strong results this morning. Fee-related earnings per share for the first quarter were $0.69, up 66% year-over-year and as high a quarterly figure as we've ever reported and after-tax DE per share came in at $1.10, that's up almost 50% compared to the first quarter of 2021 and is the second highest quarterly figure we reported. And when you look at the quarter, our results and our activities you're seeing really four things. First, you're seeing the strength and resiliency of our model, as well as our people. Despite all of the volatility and uncertainty, we reported strong results pretty much across every metric. Second, as businesses inside KKR are growing and scaling, they're inflecting and they're having a real impact on our numbers. In private markets, for example, our infrastructure and our real estate platforms of scale, so our real asset strategies comprised over half of both our fundraising and our deployment over the last 12 months. Third, we're finding creative ways to enhance our strategic positioning. Last week we closed on the previously announced acquisition of a Japanese REIT business. It's one of the largest real estate platforms in the second largest real estate market in the world. And finally, despite the volatility and increased uncertainty, our limited partners are continuing to entrust us with their capital. Strong investment performance has been a critical driver of all of the success that we've had here. Now looking at a few topics in more detail, let's begin with fundraising. New capital raised in Q1 totalled $26 billion and $132 billion over the last 12 months. Of note in private markets, both our Global Infrastructure IV fund and North America Fund XIII held final closes in the first quarter. Including employee commitments, Infrastructure IV totalled $17 billion, that's over two times larger than Infra III and North America XIII closed out at $19 billion over 35% larger than its predecessor. Also we're continuing to raise capital for our European private equity strategy. At this point, we are at $7.1 billion already surpassing in size, the prior European PE vintage, and it's worth highlighting the regional approach we've taken in our traditional private equity business with individual funds across the Americas, Asia and Europe, instead of having a single global fund. We think this allows us to maximize our fundraising potential. Committed capital across our three regional private equity funds currently exceeds $40 billion, and we're still raising capital for our European PE strategy. At the same time, it allows us to diversify our carry pools, reduces our vintage risk across these funds and importantly, we're less susceptible to the tone of the fundraising environment at a single point in time. And at public markets, $9 billion of new capital raise is among the highest quarterly figures we've reported. Activity here was widespread, including hedge funds and credit. In alternative credit, we raised capital across our asset-based finance, Asia credit and direct lending strategies, private credit strategies in Europe and the next vintage of our opportunistic strategy. And in leverage credit, we saw activity across a number of separately managed accounts and loan strategies, in addition to our CLO business, where we issued our 41st US CLO in the quarter. Global Atlantic closed on a block transaction in the quarter, which contributed $3 billion. This is reflected in both private and public markets and so these fundraising efforts helped bring AUM to $479 billion and fee paying AUM to $371 billion, both up approximately 30% year-over-year. Turning to investment activities, capital invested in the quarter, totalled $21 billion. In private markets, our real assets platform invested $9 billion of capital, including $4.5 billion in real estate, driven by activity in our Americas and our European opportunistic equity strategies as well as real estate credit. Our infrastructure platform invested over $3 billion of capital led by activity in the US and Asia with $3.5 billion of PE deployment, relatively evenly spread across geographies. In public markets, GAs really added to the pace of investment activity in private credit, most meaningfully in asset-based finance as well as in direct lending. Spending a minute, actually in asset-based finance, we invest in ABF across a number of pools of capital that are all looking for different risk reward, all the way from our private credit funds and our BDC platform to global Atlantic. So the addressable market for us and available investable capital has increased materially as our credit platform\u2019s grown. We're excited about this. And deployment here has become meaningful. In the quarter, total ABF deployment was a little over $5 billion and we had $2.4 billion in direct lending activity and Q1 alongside of this. Now shifting to investment performance, you can see these details on Page 7 of the press release. The private equity portfolio was marked down 5% in the quarter, which was right in line with a decline of the MSCI world. While over the last 12 months, the PE portfolios was up 19%, 800 basis points ahead of the MSCI world. In real assets, our portfolios continue to perform. In real estate, the opportunistic portfolio feels well positioned given its focus on industrial and multi-family themes, you see the opportunistic real estate portfolio appreciated 11% in the quarter and is up 30% over the last 12 months. And in infrastructure, a strategy in our view, that's also well positioned in an inflationary environment, you see the portfolio appreciated 6% in the quarter and it's up 11% over the last 12 months. On the credit side, leverage credit was down two for the quarter and up three over the last 12 months, essentially in line with broad high yields and leverage loan indices, while alternative credit was down 1% in the quarter and up 9% LTM. Circling back to the acquisition of the Japanese REIT, which is now known as KJRM, the acquisition adds AUM, but it really goes far beyond that. It's a wonderfully strategic transaction for us across a number of areas of focus, including real estate Asia, perpetual capital, as well as private wealth. And one final note here as a piece of the financing for the acquisition, in April, we raised approximately $475 million equivalent of Japanese yen denominated notes across a range of maturities at a weighted average coupon of around 1.2%. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob.\nRobert Lewin: Thanks a lot, Craig. I'll try and quickly step through our quarterly financials. Our management fees continue to scale at a really rapid pace, increasing by 46% in the LTM period to $2.3 billion and reaching $625 million just for the quarter alone. Our management fee growth this quarter was really driven by the fundraising activity that Craig ran through. Of note, Europe VI entered its investment period in the quarter and we had approximately $20 million of catch-up fees from the final closes of Americas XIII and Infra IV. Our capital raising success alongside our investment activity brought fee paying AUN to $371 billion, which is up 29% year-on-year. Our net transaction and monitoring fees were $306 million for the quarter, driven primarily by our capital markets franchise, which earned $255 million, almost $1 billion for the LTM period. The quarter's transactions consistent with past trends were diversified across clients, strategies as well as geographies. Our operating expenses totaled $126 million for the quarter. As discussed on previous calls, we would continue to expect modest increases here as we expand our footprint, invest in marketing and technology, and hopefully have our employees back out on the road and traveling. When you pull it all together, our fee-related earnings this quarter increased to $605 million, that's up 66% compared to just a year ago. Moving down our income statement, our realized carried interest totaled $580 million in the quarter while realized investment income came in at $349 million. In any environment, we think these are very solid results. However, when you layer on the volatility in Q1, we were quite pleased in our ability to achieve this outcome and very much reflects the breadth and scale of our firm today. Turning to our insurance segment, we had a very solid quarter generating $116 million of operating earnings. In aggregate, our after tax distributable earnings were $969 million for the first quarter or a $1.10 per share. I now want to turn to our balance sheet for a moment. During periods of market volatility, we'll hear from some who are concerned that the balance sheet increases our risk profile. That's not our perspective. It's actually quite the opposite. So we thought it'd be worthwhile explaining what we believe to be true. That having a balance sheet, especially one with the attributes of ours is a meaningful differentiator and a real positive during periods of market dislocation. Let's begin with the liability side of our balance sheet, which we think is pretty unique and a real source of differentiation. We are very fortunate to have access to long-dated and low cost liabilities. The average maturity of our recourse debt outstanding, including our recent Yen issuance is approximately 20 years with a weighted average coupon of about 3.5% and a 100% of that coupon is fixed. So we have minimal duration risk, no exposure to margin calls, our after-tax cost of debt is less than 3% and we have no risk around rising interest rates. In terms of the asset side of our balance sheet, as you'd expect, we have a very deep commitment to asset allocation risk, which has helped deliver exceptional results for our shareholders. Over the last one, three and five years, our annual returns have been 15%, 20% and 16% respectively. And as we go a layer deeper around KKR's investment portfolio, one of the key strategic decisions we made a number of years ago was the launch of core private equity business. It's a great example of how we used our balance sheet to help create what we believe is today, the largest business of its kind and an important contributor to our management fees and fee-related earnings, as well as representing the largest allocation we have on the balance sheet today. Core private equity is a long duration strategy. We expect to hold these investments for 10 to 50 plus years and believe they carry a more modest risk return profile compared to traditional private equity. We're looking for mid-to-high teens gross IRRs that we can compound for north of a decade. These are businesses we believe have strong secular tailwinds with defensible market positions, solid cash flow dynamics and as a result, benefit from a more stable earnings profile. And with equity and fixed income indices, our 5% plus in the quarter, a key reason our balance sheet portfolio was flat in Q1 was the 3% appreciation in our core portfolio. This portfolio is performing extremely well, and we believe has many of the right attributes to outperform if we go through a period of volatility and real inflation, including having real pricing power. Today, core private equity accounts for 30% of our balance sheet investments or $5.5 billion. Now, we entered core private equity, not only because we thought it would be a stable long-term compounder for our balance sheet, but also because it's highly synergistic with our overall business model. We were confident that we had the ability to become a global leader in core PE asset management, and that our capital markets business would be able to support these investments over time as they access both the debt and equity capital markets. So from a standing start five years ago, we've put together this incredible global portfolio, which now number over 15 companies and growing, and with $32 billion of AUM that is third party capital together with balance sheet capital, we believe we have the largest core PE asset management business in the world and a return since inception have been very strong with a gross IRR of 26%, which gives us the confidence that we'll be able to continue to scale the franchise. And alongside the management fees, we'll earn over the duration of these long data investments, we are also entitled to an annual allocation of carried interest from our clients, which we earn every Q1. For 2021 performance alone, we generated approximately $250 million of carry, which is reflected in Q1 results. So the opportunity for performance-related revenue can be a very significant one-over time with continued compounding, deployment and performance. Moreover, our core portfolio companies have generated approximately 10% of capital markets fees over the last couple of years and as the portfolio grows, we'd expect transaction activity to grow alongside it. So to recap, we have created an exposure on our balance sheet that has performed extremely well and has more stable return characteristics. And we have been able to meaningfully augment our asset level return by becoming the leading asset manager in the base and therefore creating a combination of incremental management fees and carry as well as capital markets revenues. Given the increased scale and diversification of our balance sheet portfolio, we have decided to enhance our disclosure. In our 10-Q beginning this quarter, we will provide the 20 largest balance sheet positions with their cost and fair value, instead of just our five largest investments. We think this will enhance transparency and with 13 of the top 20 positions, as of March 31st being core private equity investments, it will help highlight the performance of this portfolio going forward. Now, turning back to our broader balance sheet strategy and the benefits it provides in periods of dislocation. We think this is the type of environment where our connected and collaborative business model excels. This was particularly evident in the first half of 2020, where I think we really outperformed. Having access to this additional source of capital when the market goes risk off is hugely valuable and we would bet all investment firms would love this of liquidity in markets like these. And finally, there's obviously a huge advantage of this capital base as we pursue strategic acquisitions. The best example of that, there's really no way that we would've been able to pursue Global Atlantic in early 2020 when capital markets were severely dislocated without the benefit of our capital base. And as Craig mentioned, we recently announced a highly strategic acquisition of a Japanese REIT manager, where we funded the entirety of the $1.8 billion purchase price without issuing any equity. We understand the value of that limited dilution to all shareholders, especially right now, given our current trading price. Between these two transactions alone, we expect to generate well north of $300 million of fee-related earnings next year with most coming from perpetual capital. And we required relatively little equity dilution to be able to achieve that. So w0e're using our balance sheet to generate really high ROEs while at the same time, creating additional FRE. And while supporting all this business building and inorganic activity, we've used the balance sheet to buy back our own stock. Since 2015, we have used $2.2 billion to repurchase or retire, 85 million shares at a weighted average price of $25.50. So hopefully that helps provide additional context around the balance sheet, including some examples of its strategic value and how that can enhance overall economic outcomes across different market environments. With that, let me hand it off to Scott.\nScott Nuttall: Thank you, Rob. It's been a dynamic three months since our last call and there's certainly more information to process and uncertainty to navigate. While environments like this are anxiety creating for most, it is exactly times like this, when the strength of our culture and business model becomes more apparent. Our connected firm and culture is excellent at making sure information travels and opportunities find the right pools of capital. With valuations down and costs of capital up, more companies need solutions that are not readily apparent and our clients want more information. The result is the investments we make during times like these have the potential for higher returns and our clients develop an even better understanding of what makes us special. Said another way, when dislocation occurs, you get a real sense for culture and investment acumen, and we feel incredibly well-positioned for this environment. We have record dry powder. We have clients that trust us. We have multiple growing businesses globally. We have sustained our connected culture and we feel ready for what's next. I'm sure we'll talk more to today about the macro and what all this means, but regardless of speculation about near term rates, inflation and the economy, we remain focused on executing our strategy and confident we will achieve the five-year plan we shared with you in November. With that, we're happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our first question will be coming from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nAlex Blostein: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I was hoping we could start with fundraising comments. For the last couple of months, we've heard a lot and talked a lot about some of the crowdedness in the private equity space. It doesn't seem to be affecting you guys a whole lot, given your comments on the latest fundraisers and obviously Europe is going quite well as well. So while I understand it's probably hard to generalize, but maybe you can help us sort of contextualize what are you hearing from LPs that's going well and maybe some of the areas as you look out for the next 12 to 18 months that could become more challenged with respect to your own fundraising efforts.\nScott Nuttall: Great. Thanks for the question, Alex. It's Scott. Good morning. We've heard some of the same comments you have regarding the environment. You're right. We're not really being impacted by this dynamic, but let me give you a little bit of color on what we're seeing and why that's the case. It is true. We are hearing from some LPs that they're seeing GPs come back to the market faster than expected and is a bit of a crowding effect. This is particularly true from our seats around the more traditional and institutional investors. So think some of the public pension funds and some sovereign wealth, but importantly, it's the traditional investors in private equity proper. We're not hearing that about other alternative asset classes. We're also not hearing that from newer investors in the alternative asset class broadly defined including PE. So from our vantage point, we raised $26 billion in the first quarter, $132 billion in the last 12 months and as a reminder, we raise almost all of our flagship private equity funds over the last couple of years. So it's a bit over $40 billion for that fund cycle. So any private equity market crowding is just not impacting what we're doing today. If you look at where we're raising money this year, most of the dollars we're raising is around real estate, infrastructure and credit, where we have a lot of investor interest. If anything, we're seeing that interest go up as inflation and rates rise. So we're really not experiencing that crowding dynamic for multiple reason and that's before you even get to the increased interest from private wealth and insurance company and all the new entrants that we've talked about in prior quarters. So we continue to feel great about how we're positioned. We're not changing our plans for the year. And in terms of your question about what do we see, kind of down the road that could impact us, there's nothing negative. We're kind of feeling a little bit like right now, real assets and credit where you want to be and we're lined up well against that.\nAlex Blostein: Great. Thanks for that. And my follow up is around the wealth channel and Scott, you mentioned you guys are kind of continuing your build out there. I wanted to zoom in on KREST a little bit, really strong investment performance, looks like you guys are up 9%-ish year to date, and that's on the back of north of 20% return last year. The pace has been slower than maybe some of us would've expected. So wondering if you can talk to some of the hurdles that you might be facing in accelerating growth in KREST and getting it out on platforms and what would it take for that product to scale perhaps a little bit faster?\nCraig Larson: Hey Alex, this Craig, why don't I start? And before we -- why don't I take a step back even to just to begin. Look, we think overall the opportunity within private wealth to introduce these tailored democratized products is massive and we think we're really well positioned against this really interesting asset class. And over time, we do expect to have democratized products really across all of our asset classes and alongside of this, we're continuing to invest in sales, marketing data, digital talent, etcetera. So where we are today and we do tend to look at these in a more aggregate basis. We've got the three broad democratized solutions. They're on multiple platforms and on top of that, we have bespoke solutions. They're tailored for individual platforms. Looking across these products, we have about $5.6 billion of AUM and I don't think we really want on these calls to get in the habit of giving individual updates on all of these. I think the overall takeaway that we want you to have is one, we've got a great brand that we think in this channel is second to none, an exceptional long-term track record. I think that can be buttressed from some of the individual product track records that again, appreciate you're noticing. We think we have a proven ability to innovate in product design and we have strong relationships at all levels with these distribution partners. So it's a really exciting long-term opportunity, and we actually feel great about the progress that we've made to date.\nAlex Blostein: Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Cyprys: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just given everything going on from inflationary backdrop, rising rates, supply chain bottleneck, so we're just hoping you could talk a little bit about how you see that impacting your portfolio companies. And maybe you could talk a little bit about how you're helping your portfolio companies manage through this environment. And if you could just update us on what sort of revenue and EBITDA growth trends you're seeing across your portfolios.\nRobert Lewin: Hey, Mike, it's Rob. Thanks for the question. So, as we're looking across our portfolio today, obviously like others, we're seeing a stickier inflation environment. There's three things that we're watching quite a bit. One is labor availability and wage inflation. We're certainly seeing that across our portfolio on a global basis. In, particularly in the US, we're focused on housing short supply there due to underbuilding over the last 15 years, especially as millennials now are moving their way into prime home ownership years. And then the last thing that I think you know is creating the stickiness is just an under-spend on CapEx related to energy supply, which is going to continue put pressure on pricing there. Now, the one thing that we're definitely seeing on the other side of this across our portfolios is an easing around supply chain. And so as we look at 2022, our expectation on inflation is we're going to be in the 7% to 8% range. We do see that moderating into 2023. There's a lot of work that we're doing across our portfolio right now to share best practices. Obviously a lot of work for years has gone into interest rate hedging, and that continues given a potential increase here in rates going forward. But you would've heard us on these calls and in other forums for a long period of time talking about these potential inflationary trends. We feel really good about how we've set up the broader portfolio. As you look at the underlying revenue and earnings growth across our portfolio, it's continues to be exceptionally strong and we feel really good with how we've positioned the overall portfolio going forward.\nScott Nuttall: Hey, Michael it's Scott. Let me just add a couple things. As you know, we have taken this thematic approach the last several years. One of the things that we have been focused on besides some of the very specific themes we've discussed in the past is we knew at some point inflation would show up. So we've been quite focused on investing in businesses all around the world that have real pricing power. And that's part of the reason I think you've seen the portfolio perform well, and in terms of your question about how we're helping our portfolio companies, in addition to the very specific procurement programs and other things that we do to kind of be able to use our scale thoughtfully, we're making sure that they have access to the information that we have, that the information is traveling. They can see what we're seeing across the markets and I think that's helped them get ahead of what you know is kind of happening in some of these supply chains. And the portfolio is performing well. Our stats through last year revenues and EBITDA in a lot of parts of what we're doing up 20%, 30%, we continue to see very strong trends in the first quarter, despite the macro backdrop.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. And just as a follow up question, just around rising rates, I was hoping maybe you could help frame for us how you see rising rates impacting different parts of your business. Maybe just in credit, maybe you could help us understand what portion of the credit book is floating rate and then when we look at GA, how should we think about the sort of repricing of that portfolio there in terms of rising rate benefit, and then on the fixed rate side, how do to think about the timeframe for that? Is there any sort of risk around the liabilities rescinding customer rescision activity in a higher rate environment?\nScott Nuttall: Yeah, of course. All good questions. Thanks Mike. So, there's obviously a lot of pros and cons across our business as it relates to a rising rate environment. But on balance, we feel like we're relatively pretty well positioned. You reference that we've got a very sizable credit business. Most of our leverage credit AUM is floating rate in nature. Most of our private credit AUM is also floating rate in nature. And so as interest rates go up, our returns will go up. And as you know, most of our fun products, our hurdles are fixed. So the likelihood of earning additional incentives goes up as well. On the whole, as we look at Global Atlantic and there's some puts and takes, we think a rising rate environment over time is largely a net positive to Global Atlantic and what you can see certainly is rising rates impacting the fixed income book you referenced, but our assets and liabilities are very well matched at Global Atlantic and so as interest rates rise, the value of your liabilities effectively offset the degradation and value in your assets, in a rising rate environment. I think the other important point to note across KKR and I reference this in our prepared remarks, think about our own liability structure. We've set ourselves up a 20-year duration capital that's all fixed in nature at less than a 3% after-tax cost of debt. And then I think the last thing that we think about at KKR in this kind of a rising rate environment, increased volatility in the markets, potential for multiples to come down is we sit on $115 billion of dry powder across the firm. That's a record number for us and really allows us, I think, to be on our front foot as it relates to investing through this period of time.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thank you.\nScott Nuttall: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please proceed with your questions.\nGlenn Schorr: Hello there. Thanks. So a question, capital markets and transaction fees were pretty good, pretty darn resilient considering the environment. But the markets, got a little worse in April. So I wonder if you could just help talk through, exits down, but deployment is good, diversification is good, like tell us what to expect because I feel like people discount it as a component of management fees, but it's a big piece and it seems to be more resilient than something. Thanks.\nRobert Lewin: Yeah. Hey Glen, it's Rob I'll start off here. So last quarter what we talked about on this call was that we felt like in normal functioning markets, our capital markets is a plus or minus $200 million a quarter type of revenue business. Now in Q4 of last year and Q1 of this year, we were on the plus side of that. Probably a couple things in Q1 this year that we were expecting in Q2 that probably got pulled forward a bit, but I think what's more important is that not mistaken and I think you reference this in your question, not mistaken the quarter-to-quarter variability in our income with the durability of our franchise, as well as its growth prospects. And what you've seen, I think over the last number of years is both, highly durable pipeline to potentially generate fees, a broadening of transactioning transactions and just loss of growth areas and those growth areas are going to come from continuing to follow KKR's loan growth. I referenced core private equity a little bit earlier, but there's a number of different opportunities like that across the firm and obviously we believe we're going to continue to be able to take a lot of share given our business model and our access to talent with third party clients as well. And so as we think about that business and the future, we're very excited to continue to invest behind that and we see a lot of growth over the next number of years.\nGlenn Schorr: That's great. Something you said during the prepared was interesting on ABS deployment I think you said $5 billion with an average fee. So the question I have is you're -- do you expect to be increasing the ramp in terms of ABF both growth and deployment on a quarter basis, and is that going to increase and give a higher steady fee flow coming up from that? I'm just curious on how big of a contributor can that get to?\nCraig Larson: Yeah, Glen it's Craig. Why don't I start? Thanks for the question, and honestly, we probably don't spend enough time talking about the platform that we've built here. So, first taking a step back, ABF is a massive market. So it's 4.5 trillion in size and it's expected to go to 7 trillion plus over the coming four or five years, by, in comparison, the high yield market is a 1.5 trillion market. So we're already talking about a market that is multiples of the high yield market with better growth prospects and much like leverage lending to corporates, look ABF plays a critical part in the financing market. So it's helping finance day-to-day operations through mortgages, credit cards, receivables, financings, equipment leasing, etcetera and what you have is alongside of this massive market, you have high barriers to entry and honestly, in our view, a lack of scale capital. So we're finding attractive risk return and at the same time, we also like the diversification on top of regular away or away from regular way traded credit. So in terms of us in our approach, really three things of note. One, as we noted during the prepared remarks, we have different pools of capital and we're looking for different risk rewards. So that's all the way from private credit funds in the BDC to Global Atlantic. So the addressable market is huge. Our available capital has increased materially. And so to your point, this is why you're seeing this ramp in deployment for us. The second point is we've been busy. So last year deployment exceeded $15 billion, including GA, $5 billion this quarter. So yes, this is as the overall credit platform has grown, this becomes a really interesting air area for us and third, and this is important, we've partnered with 15 or so specially financed platforms globally and those folks who are originating opportunities, that from our view again, are otherwise difficult to access. So these platforms have 5,000 employees over a $100 billion of AUM. They're global, it's across industries, and they're helping us access attractive risk return. So again, we've built this unique platform, which allows us to have confidence when we think of the forward origination. So it's becoming a growing and interesting part of the firm. No question.\nGlenn Schorr: Thanks, Craig. Appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup. Please receive your question.\nBill Katz: Okay. Thank you very much for taking the questions. Look forward to looking through that queue a little bit later on. In terms of maybe going into the new course since the dynamics have changed pre-dramatically first quarter to second quarter, even within the period, can you talk a little bit about where you've seen the opportunity to deploy quarter to date? And then I was wondering if you could speak a little bit to maybe the monetization activity and how the decline in the private equity and the net accrue carries sequentially might impact the opportunity for that realization outlook. Thank you.\nCraig Larson: Thanks Bill. It's Craig. Why don't I start on deployment and then Rob will give the modernization update and look, deployment is a meaty question. So you have inflation interest rates outlook for economic growth, all being front of mind for us as they have in for some time. And alongside of that we expect a number of rate hikes this year with central banks tricking their balance sheet. So against these topics, we're expecting more volatility. So, what are the implications of this? If you one as a firm, we need to be as connected as ever, and we need to continue to be thematic. So in terms of areas of focus for us, a couple of thoughts. One, you've already heard this from what Rob and Scott said earlier, but get long pricing power. So with labor shortages, higher input costs, we think companies with pricing power, our advantage. Number two, own more collateral-based cash flows. So we believe real assets investments that can keep up with nominal GDP are interesting. So that's infrastructure, real estate asset based finance and you heard us again in the prepared remarks. When you look at private, when we're asked about deployment, it often tends to be with a private equity lens for us. So if you look in, both last year and as well as in the first quarter, private equity deployment, as a percentage of our firm has been a teen's percentage. And so as the breadth of the firm's increased, you've seen these real assets become materially greater for us in terms of deployment. So when you look at real assets, in terms of private markets deployment real assets, we're 55% of private markets deployment in 2021, 67% of deployment in the first quarter of this year. Three, digitization automation logistics we're in the midst of an innovation boom in disruption and technological change from our standpoint spins continue. Four, security, including energy security, data payment, cyber, all areas and these are areas where we think we bring a unique lens in a lot of industry expertise. And then five, we're in many ways a savings bull market. And in Asia, you have a billion millennials who want to build a safety net through increased savings for the families. So that means themes like nesting, retirement products, financial planning, all should benefit. And I think the other point in this again, I would just touch on relates to culture and this I'd reinforce something that Scott had touched on, but, we have a culture that's wonderfully connected and our view and dislocation occurs, that some solutions for companies become less apparent and that's when you get a real sense for culture and acumen and we think we have a culture that really allows us to stay wonderfully connected and allows us to be on our front foot in these periods.\nRobert Lewin: Hey, Bill. It's Rob. Let me follow up on your question around returns and monetization. You referenced our Q1 returns in private equity. Just want to put that into context for a bit. We were up 46% in 2021 in PE. And so we gave back about five points in Q1, but over the last 15 months, our PE portfolios still up on 40%. And as you think about that decline, quarter on quarter, the down five points, we actually had a position at 12/31 that was marked at about 24 times multiple of money that traded down about 40% in the quarter, still marked at 14 times multiple of money, still a fantastic investment for us at 3/31 and represented a good chunk of that decline. In terms of the impact around monetization, we feel great about our monetization pipeline, right now, certainly relative to where we are from overall volatility in the markets and so you saw a very healthy Q1 monetization revenue number and as we head into Q2, you're based on transactions that have happened, or that we have line of sight to either through signed deals and LOIs or equivalent, we already have line of sight to $600 plus million of revenue that we feel good about. And I think this represents a couple things. One, just the overall breadth of KKR's portfolio today, global nature, different products, and two, that underlying strength of our portfolio that we've talked about. Now like all quarters, there's definitely some risk in some of these deals happening, but at the same time, given the strength of the pipeline, I referenced there's some upside to these numbers as well. And just in terms of character of revenue, assuming that we're able to achieve these numbers, I'd say about ballpark 75%, that revenue would come from realized performance revenue and then the balance would come from realized investment income. Hopefully that helps provide a bit of color there Bill.\nBill Katz: That's super helpful. And then just as a follow up, I'm not sure if you Rob, or Scott, you want to chime in, but there's been some conversation around some budding regulation in the insurance side. I guess there's sort of a split house between your peers about whether not having a balance sheet is a good or a bad thing with that. I just appreciate your ownership of GAs maybe slightly different to all that. Can you talk a little bit about how you might see any regulatory risk in the insurance business, in any pros or cons that were opportunities that might surface for you as a result? Thank you.\nRobert Lewin: Yeah. Hey Bill, it's Rob. So we talked a bit about this last call. I'd say really no new update from us. What we're focused on with Global Atlantics focused on is continuing to have a really close and transparent relationship with its regulators. We know that the regulatory community continues to gather information and industry feedback, and we want to make sure that Global Atlantic are part of that. Beyond that, there's not a ton that we can comment on other to say that we really don't anticipate many changes to the business model of trying to thoughtfully invest behind the long-term promises that we've made to policy holders. And so, we feel again overall very constructive around the Global Atlantic relationship with its regulators and are focused on continuing that type of transparency in the future.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Brian Mckenna with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your questions.\nBrian Mckenna: Great, thanks. If we annualize the first quarter FRE, you're at a $2.75 run rate for 2022. And as you noted before, back in November, you updated your FRE target to $4 plus in five years or by 2026. So if you're approaching $3 FRE this year, are you willing to move forward this five-year timeline at all?\nRobert Lewin: It's Rob. Thanks a lot for the question. Listen, we don't spend honestly a ton of time thinking about, FRE near-term target is not how we manage our business. And so I think what you're less likely to get from us is a continual update around where we see FRE going in the short term. But what I would tell you is that we will update you hopefully very continually on how we see our business trending. And hopefully what you've heard from us is the level of excitement we have across our firm today. We have so much more momentum today than we had even six or 12 months ago. You look at many of the big product raises we've had over the last six or 12 months, we've well exceeded the fundraising targets that we had for those. We're likely to have Scott mentioned close to 30 products in the market over the course of the next 12 months, many of which are poised to scale in areas like infrastructure, real estate and floating rate credit, areas where we're seeing real secular growth. Obviously Global Atlantics market positioning and where they're sitting from a growth perspective is much better than when we underwrote that transaction two years ago. And a lot of momentum across our capital markets business as I referenced. So our expectation is for really robust near-term and long-term FRE growth. And hopefully that helps give you a little bit of color with that, providing continual updates around FRE targets.\nScott Nuttall: Yeah. The only color I'd add Brian is historically, if you look back when we've shared kind of a view as to where we might end up, we've had a tendency to outperform. Our intention is to continue that record.\nBrian Mckenna: Yes. Got it. Helpful. And then could you talk about the mix of your net unrealized carried interest? How much of the $4.2 billion is tied to traditional private equity products and then how much is related to newer strategies that have expanded meaningfully over the past several years, and then how should we think about that mix evolving over time?\nScott Nuttall: Yeah, it's a good question. I'd say it's still very much weighted towards our traditional private equity products, our regional private equity products today, but you are starting to see a climb in our unrealized carried interest in infrastructure real estate in particular. And as we think about mix and as we look forward to what that can become over time, we certainly see a much higher percentage of our realized carried interests coming from areas like infrastructure and real estate and parts of our credit business.\nBrian Mckenna: Thank you guys.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Please see a few questions.\nPatrick Davitt: Good morning, everyone. Most of my questions have been asked. Could you maybe walk through the economic impact of KGR in particular to AUM and the earnings and maybe also frame how its organic growth has tracked over the last few periods?\nScott Nuttall: Sure. It's Rob. So what we've announced is at current exchange rates, I think close to $14-ish billion of incremental AUM, that's all perpetual capital to managed REITs in the Japan market, we see a lot of opportunity to grow that franchise in Japan. We see a real opportunity to leverage that team and their strength in the Japan markets for the benefit of both our core plus franchise in Japan, as well as our opportunistic franchise in the region. So we believe we should be able to raise more capital from those strategies as a result of this transaction. And lastly, we're setting up our capital markets business to make sure that we're able to support the franchise locally in Japan, as they pursue acquisitions on quite a regular or basis, as well as refinancings. In terms of the economic implications, what we set is that our expectation is on a synergized basis. We should be able to deliver around a $100 million of incremental FRE from that platform in 2023.\nPatrick Davitt: Great, thanks. And then how is the organic growth looked?\nScott Nuttall: It's been strong and they've done a couple things, I think really well. One, they launched the second REIT, which has had a good market following trading at a really nice level relative to book and their organic flows have been strong as well. So this is a business that was started not all that long ago by me to BC [ph] and UBS together. And so really it's been their entire growth has been organic in nature.\nPatrick Davitt: Great. Thanks. And then one quick follow up on the $600 million pipeline. Is that what you expect to close in 2Q or is that kind of a two quarter view?\nScott Nuttall: No, that's a one quarter view based on what we have line of sight on today. So that would be all Q2.\nPatrick Davitt: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next questions is coming from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. So I was looking for a state of the union on your Pan Asia business, especially given the Japanese REIT acquisition. And you also have a pretty big pipeline of fundraising in your Asian products over the near term. But what I was really looking for is what were the real strategic merits of the Japanese REIT acquisition, including cross sell. And then also, how is your China business faring following some decoupling between the West and China? And I know I asked a few questions in there. So I'm just not going to ask the follow up.\nScott Nuttall: Thanks Craig. Maybe I'll start and Craig will chip in here along the way. In terms of just state of the union to our AsiaPac business, we've talked about this in prior calls. We have every expectation that over time, our AsiaPac business will be as big as our US business and we're investing behind that deal and I think the acquisition of the Japanese REIT manager is very much consistent with that overall theme. Just to put some numbers around it. I think at the end of 2019, we had about $20 billion of AUM in AsiaPac. Two plus years forward proforma for the acquisition, we're close to $55 billion. So almost a tripling of our AUM in a short period of time. I think we've got a lot of competitive advantages in the region and we've got a real opportunity to take advantage of that head start, we have the access, we have to talent really across the region to be able to drive further growth. In terms of the strategic merits of the acquisition, honestly, that piece of it was a really short conversation. We want to be able to double down on our lead in Asia. We've got ambitions to really be able to scale a real estate business, both in AsiaPac and in Japan, the second largest real estate market in the world and globally. We want access to more perpetual capital at the firm, as well as different avenues to be able to reach private wealth investors. And so this acquisition, really was something from a strategic perspective, made a ton of sense as we were evaluating it. Craig, you want to hit on\u2026\nCraig Larson: Yeah. Craig on China, a couple of thoughts. One, I think look, China investing in China has become more complex and so we think it's critical to have the right resources in order to navigate the complexity. So we think it's -- you need a best in class local team, but you need more. We think it's important to have specialized resources like our public affairs team, like our global Institute to help navigate that complexity. So we think China is going to continue to be a critical long term engine of global growth. So it's a very important market, no question. And we think we bring unique skills and a differentiated approach to that market. Now, I think when you look at where we've been investing, a lot of it has been behind themes like domestic consumption. So we remain committed to being a leading investor domestically in China. And we want to help leading local firms to continue to grow and prosper and we think we're well positioned and to give you a sense, just a significance overall as a firm, when you look at our exposure, it does remain quite modest just given the breadth of our firm today. So, investments in China from an AUM standpoint are probably, a little over 1% of our AUM just to give you a sense of scale,\nCraig Siegenthaler: Craig, Rob. That was perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes in the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks. Good morning folks. That was my question on Asia as well. So that's -- I think that was a good detail. Can you hear me?\nScott Nuttall: We can, yeah,\nBrian Bedell: Great. Okay, so then I'll just do one as well. Going back to Craig, I think what you said in the prepared remarks on enhancing a few related earnings with other creative ideas like KKR, but maybe if you can just talk about what you view as maybe the pipeline for doing more acquisitions to enhance to -- grow the FRE inorganically and how important is private wealth management within that thought process?\nRobert Lewin: Sure. Brian. It's Rob I'll take that. So when we evaluate anything for our balance sheet, the first measure that we're going to look at always is going to be what drives the highest and best ROE over a long period of time. Now given how we're situated, I think with our brand and our track record and our access to distribution, there's a lot of inorganic asset management activity where we think we can help make those businesses better. Maybe they can help make us better. And ultimately that's, what's going to drive the highest ROE. And that's what you saw. I think, in the acquisition we closed last week. That's what you saw with our partnership with Global Atlantic, and we've got multi different examples of that over the years. And so we've got a team that's very much focused on how we can really leverage the core competencies we have here at KKR to be able to continue drive ROE and we think a lot of times that's going to lend itself to incremental FRE as well, but that's not necessarily going to be the primary driver here of any transaction. But you're certainly seeing that as it relates to the things that we've done, inorganically over the last number of years. The last point on inorganic growth while we're going to be focused on it. And it's something that we think is a real opportunity here, long term, it was referenced earlier in the call that we had a couple of targets we had put out there four plus dollars of FRE. seven plus dollars of TDE that was on an in -- that was on a organic basis and so anything that we would do from an inorganic perspective on the FRE side should certainly be accretive to that.\nCraig Larson: Yeah. The only thing I would add Brian, is I think the point we're trying to get across as well, we'll continue to remain active looking at inorganic opportunities and that's something we'll keep you updated on, but if you just look back, I think what we're trying to say is that the balance sheet has allowed us to pursue those with minimal equity issuance while also buying back 10% of our outstanding shares since 2015. And if you think about it, Marshall Waste, Franklin Square, Global Atlantic, what we talked about with core, not the J-REIT that's over $200 billion of AUM that was bought with minimal equity dilution and using the balance sheet as that strategic weapon. And a lot of the things that we've done that I listed have been done during periods of time where there's some dislocation or some volatility.\nBrian Bedell: That's great color. Thank you very much.\nCraig Larson: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Arnold [ph] with BNP Paribas. Please proceed with your question.\nUnidentifiedAnalyst: Oh yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick follow up on the on the M&A question. I'm just wondering if you could comment a bit more generally about corporate M&A in the market in general, given what you're saying about certain pockets of the market being more congested on the fundraising side, and also maybe a more challenging market for GP IPOs. Generally, are you seeing a bigger pipeline of potential deals at the industry level?\nRobert Lewin: Hey, Arnold, it's Rob. We weren't able to hear all of that question. I think is relates to corporate M&A and the pipeline we're seeing. Certainly a lot of activity across the GP space and I think we get to take a look at quite a bit of it, but inorganic activity in our space, particularly inorganic activity, that requires integration is hard. And so while we'll look at a lot and there's quite a bit that crosses our desk and the pipeline is full, I think the likelihood of any one of these deals happening is still, relatively low and so we've been fortunate that we've been able to do some large things over the years. We would anticipate being able to do that in the future especially given that the size of the M&A pipeline line, but it's also not a need to do for us either. I think we're in a fortunate position where we've got a lot of avenues to organically really grow our business, but if we can find something where we can use our balance sheet to complement what we're doing and drive additional growth, we're certainly going to look at that.\nScott Nuttall: Yeah. Arnold, this is Scott. The only thing I would add, if it's corporate M&A from a third party capital investing for our funds standpoint, as Craig mentioned that deployment's been active, the pipelines are busy and there are public private dialogues happening. So it's not as much fun to be a public company right now and so that's part of the, the pipeline that we're seeing build up. In terms of, for the firm itself, dialogue continues, it's been active and I think in an environment like this probably makes people think it, maybe it's not such a bad idea that to be part of a larger firm that has a lot of different ways to win and raise capital and invest. So we're active on both fronts.\nUnidentifiedAnalyst: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Rufus Hone with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nRufus Hone: Great, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to come back to your comments around the balance sheet and I hear you on the differentiation and the optionality it offers, but it seems like many investors haven't given you full credit for the balance sheet yet. So would you consider capping the size of the balance sheet at some point or pursuing other strategic options? If the market doesn't give you credit for your balance sheet over the long term? Thank you.\nCraig Larson: Yeah Rufus. Thanks for the question. I think the first thing to consider as you think about our balance sheet strategy is that it's very much an aligned strategy. KKR employees are the largest group of shareholders in the firm on an almost 30% of KKR. So we start from a very aligned perspective and as we sit here today, we see more opportunities to leverage the broader platform and ecosystem of KKR to drive ROE with that capital inside of KKR. And so long as that continues and we're able to drive additional ROE on that capital base for the benefit of all shareholders, then, you're going to see a consistency strategy. To the extent that that changes over time, where we're not seeing that attractive level of return, then obviously we might have a different strategy, but certainly as we sit here today, we are highly convicted in the way that we're operating the opportunities we see and the long-term accretion that we're able to create for all shareholders by virtue of the capital base that we have.\nRobert Lewin: Yeah. The only thing I'd add Rufus is if you think about the job we have get to think about how do we double the stock price as quickly as possible? How do we double our market cap as quickly and thoughtfully as possible given the risks we're taking? And the reason that we built the model that we have is that we believe with the combination of third party capital plus our own capital invested alongside, we can create that next $50 billion and then, the next a $100 billion of market cap after that with greater line of sight and more confidence. So no, the answer to the question is, no, we're not planning to cap it but, over time, if the market doesn't certainly appreciate the model of the way that we do, we have lots of different things that we can do to express our view on that. We've been buying back stock, we've been making acquisitions and converting balance sheet into fee-related earnings. There's lots of different things that we can do strategically with that balance sheet, but that's really where it's coming from. How do we get the market cap from $50 billion $200 billion and so forth,\nRufus Hone: Understood. And as a quick follow up, any thoughts around shifting the compensation mix between FRE and carry rates to a greater extent? Thank you.\nRobert Lewin: No, is the short answer Rufus. I think we feel good about the compensation structure that we put in place now a little bit more than a year ago. I think it's working really well for our firm making sure we've got alignment in the right place between our employees, our shareholders, and our limited partners and we think that balance is about right for us right now.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Kotowski: Yeah, good morning. I like Craig's formulation of the state of the union overview. And I wonder if we could have something similar on your approach to energy invest because, you have had four different energy or natural resource dedicated funds. None of them are investing and obviously fossil fuels has been just a terrible place to be for most of the last decade and people were wondering whether it would ever be an investible sector again. Now there's obviously a big capital need there, but at the same time, you've kind of got to navigate your ESG commitments and I guess I'm wondering, if you can explain the rules of the road as you see them between investing in fossil fuels versus new energy transition and how you plant to thread that needle.\nCraig Larson: Sure. Chris, great question. Why don't I start, it's Craig. So look at a high level, we're committed to investing in the energy transition and the shift to clean energy. So reflecting this, we invest in a diverse range of energy sources. So let's touch first on renewables. So think, global clean energy developers and operators, we've been increasingly active in this space and you've seen that across really a number of strategies, including areas for us like infrastructure well, as our impact business. Now alongside of that is conventional energy interactivity here is really being done through a permanent capital vehicle that we own a teen's percentage of that's called Crescent Energy. And we think Crescent can become a real leader in developing best in class ESG programs in addition to creating significant equity value. We receive management fees that increase over time as Crescent scales its business. It can send a fee eligible based on the total return of the equity and from a business standpoint, Crescent has low leverage. It's free cash flow positive, has an excellent team in place. And it is operating in an area that we think there's real M&A opportunities. So, that's our overall approach. Hopefully that gives you a better sense.\nChris Kotowski: Yeah. And just I was curious of about the idea of like a traditional fossil fuel dedicated fund. Is that an idea the market that who's placed has come and gone, or\u2026\nCraig Larson: I think it and maybe this is a -- this gets perhaps into a little bit of a history lesson around Crescent, honestly, Chris. So, in 2020, we traded in an entity that was called Independence Energy and through that, we had combined our energy income and growth fund some energy investments from the balance sheet, co-investment assets and those were contributed together with investments from an insurance client and that formed Independence Energy. And then what you saw five or six months ago, it was in December of 2021 was we merged that entity with a public ENT company to form Crescent. So Crescent is a $2.6 billion market cap company. Again, we own a teens percentage, but what really Crescent is, is the next step and it's the next evolution of those dedicated of funds for us. So that's really the -- that's how our views and our focus is really, we expect will be through Crescent.\nRobert Lewin: Yeah, there's no plans Chris, for a traditional fossil fuels fund. We haven't actually invested in conventional oil and gas in our private equity fund since 2018. Don't have any plans to really -- the work we're doing is through Crescent on the more conventional side and focused on improving the ESG footprint of every investment that they make and the team is doing a great job around that. And then as Craig mentioned, we're doing a lot in renewables across infrastructure, asset-based finance through GA and otherwise. So those are some of the areas of focus right now.\nChris Kotowski: Okay. Thank you. That's it for me.\nCraig Larson: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is on the line of Finian O'Shea with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions.\nFinian O'Shea: Hi, good morning. Mostly asked and answered for me as well. But if you haven't updated us on today's call on the private wealth progress, do you have any highlights for upcoming product rollout type ideas or progress in relationships on across the retail channels?\nCraig Larson: So Finian again, we actually feel great about the progress we've made. Rome wasn't built in a day and how we're positioned against this opportunity. Nothing to announce right at the moment as it relates to incremental products. But again, over time, we expect to have democratized products across all of our asset classes and we're investing in all of the areas that we think it takes to be successful in this channel. Reflecting that point of view, we've said a couple of quarters ago that we think new capital raised from individuals is going to be a third to half of new capital race for us as a firm in the medium term and no change in that outlook or point of view for us. It's just a really exciting opportunity that when we look at our brand, our long term track record, the ability that we have to innovate and product design and the relationships we have, we just think we're really position against this enormous market.\nFinian O'Shea: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our final question comes into the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Please just see with your questions.\nRobert Lee: Thanks so much, and thanks so much for your patience this morning with all the questions. So just had one last quick one. Many of peers have either acquired or has started to build organically, a secondaries or solutions capabilities if you will. Can you just remind us of, your interest in that business segment, which is I think not a place you've traditionally you've been focused on, but it seems to be a hot sector for across the industry and for many peers.\nCraig Larson: Yeah. Hey Rob. It is certainly a sector, we continue to look at. It is not a need to do type of acquisition for us. But if we find a platform that we've got conviction can be a top three player that we can help make them better, they can help make us better and valuation makes sense. It certainly could be something that we could pursue in the future and so, yeah, we've got, as I mentioned earlier, we've got a team that looks across different inorganic opportunities of the firm as we line up different potential sub-sectors of the asset management space. Clearly the addressable market and the secondary space is quite large. But from our perspective, it's got to work for us. And it's got to be something that we've got a lot of conviction is going to fit in well within our firm which in part is going to require it to be a top three player. And so we'll continue to keep you updated of course on our progress and our thinking but that's where we are right now.\nRobert Lee: Okay, great. Fair enough. Thanks for your patience this morning.\nCraig Larson: Thank you. Our pleasure. Thanks\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'll now hand the call back to management for closing remarks.\nCraig Larson: Thank you, our everybody for your time and patience this morning and your interest in KKR. We look forward to following up with many of you directly and if not, we look forward to giving you our next update in 90 days or so. Thanks again.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Scott Nuttall",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob. It's been a dynamic three months since our last call and there's certainly more information to process and uncertainty to navigate. While environments like this are anxiety creating for most, it is exactly times like this, when the strength of our culture and business model becomes more apparent. Our connected firm and culture is excellent at making sure information travels and opportunities find the right pools of capital. With valuations down and costs of capital up, more companies need solutions that are not readily apparent and our clients want more information. The result is the investments we make during times like these have the potential for higher returns and our clients develop an even better understanding of what makes us special. Said another way, when dislocation occurs, you get a real sense for culture and investment acumen, and we feel incredibly well-positioned for this environment. We have record dry powder. We have clients that trust us. We have multiple growing businesses globally. We have sustained our connected culture and we feel ready for what's next. I'm sure we'll talk more to today about the macro and what all this means, but regardless of speculation about near term rates, inflation and the economy, we remain focused on executing our strategy and confident we will achieve the five-year plan we shared with you in November. With that, we're happy to take your questions. Great. Thanks for the question, Alex. It's Scott. Good morning. We've heard some of the same comments you have regarding the environment. You're right. We're not really being impacted by this dynamic, but let me give you a little bit of color on what we're seeing and why that's the case. It is true. We are hearing from some LPs that they're seeing GPs come back to the market faster than expected and is a bit of a crowding effect. This is particularly true from our seats around the more traditional and institutional investors. So think some of the public pension funds and some sovereign wealth, but importantly, it's the traditional investors in private equity proper. We're not hearing that about other alternative asset classes. We're also not hearing that from newer investors in the alternative asset class broadly defined including PE. So from our vantage point, we raised $26 billion in the first quarter, $132 billion in the last 12 months and as a reminder, we raise almost all of our flagship private equity funds over the last couple of years. So it's a bit over $40 billion for that fund cycle. So any private equity market crowding is just not impacting what we're doing today. If you look at where we're raising money this year, most of the dollars we're raising is around real estate, infrastructure and credit, where we have a lot of investor interest. If anything, we're seeing that interest go up as inflation and rates rise. So we're really not experiencing that crowding dynamic for multiple reason and that's before you even get to the increased interest from private wealth and insurance company and all the new entrants that we've talked about in prior quarters. So we continue to feel great about how we're positioned. We're not changing our plans for the year. And in terms of your question about what do we see, kind of down the road that could impact us, there's nothing negative. We're kind of feeling a little bit like right now, real assets and credit where you want to be and we're lined up well against that. Hey, Michael it's Scott. Let me just add a couple things. As you know, we have taken this thematic approach the last several years. One of the things that we have been focused on besides some of the very specific themes we've discussed in the past is we knew at some point inflation would show up. So we've been quite focused on investing in businesses all around the world that have real pricing power. And that's part of the reason I think you've seen the portfolio perform well, and in terms of your question about how we're helping our portfolio companies, in addition to the very specific procurement programs and other things that we do to kind of be able to use our scale thoughtfully, we're making sure that they have access to the information that we have, that the information is traveling. They can see what we're seeing across the markets and I think that's helped them get ahead of what you know is kind of happening in some of these supply chains. And the portfolio is performing well. Our stats through last year revenues and EBITDA in a lot of parts of what we're doing up 20%, 30%, we continue to see very strong trends in the first quarter, despite the macro backdrop. Yeah, of course. All good questions. Thanks Mike. So, there's obviously a lot of pros and cons across our business as it relates to a rising rate environment. But on balance, we feel like we're relatively pretty well positioned. You reference that we've got a very sizable credit business. Most of our leverage credit AUM is floating rate in nature. Most of our private credit AUM is also floating rate in nature. And so as interest rates go up, our returns will go up. And as you know, most of our fun products, our hurdles are fixed. So the likelihood of earning additional incentives goes up as well. On the whole, as we look at Global Atlantic and there's some puts and takes, we think a rising rate environment over time is largely a net positive to Global Atlantic and what you can see certainly is rising rates impacting the fixed income book you referenced, but our assets and liabilities are very well matched at Global Atlantic and so as interest rates rise, the value of your liabilities effectively offset the degradation and value in your assets, in a rising rate environment. I think the other important point to note across KKR and I reference this in our prepared remarks, think about our own liability structure. We've set ourselves up a 20-year duration capital that's all fixed in nature at less than a 3% after-tax cost of debt. And then I think the last thing that we think about at KKR in this kind of a rising rate environment, increased volatility in the markets, potential for multiples to come down is we sit on $115 billion of dry powder across the firm. That's a record number for us and really allows us, I think, to be on our front foot as it relates to investing through this period of time. Thank you. Yeah. The only color I'd add Brian is historically, if you look back when we've shared kind of a view as to where we might end up, we've had a tendency to outperform. Our intention is to continue that record. Yeah, it's a good question. I'd say it's still very much weighted towards our traditional private equity products, our regional private equity products today, but you are starting to see a climb in our unrealized carried interest in infrastructure real estate in particular. And as we think about mix and as we look forward to what that can become over time, we certainly see a much higher percentage of our realized carried interests coming from areas like infrastructure and real estate and parts of our credit business. Sure. It's Rob. So what we've announced is at current exchange rates, I think close to $14-ish billion of incremental AUM, that's all perpetual capital to managed REITs in the Japan market, we see a lot of opportunity to grow that franchise in Japan. We see a real opportunity to leverage that team and their strength in the Japan markets for the benefit of both our core plus franchise in Japan, as well as our opportunistic franchise in the region. So we believe we should be able to raise more capital from those strategies as a result of this transaction. And lastly, we're setting up our capital markets business to make sure that we're able to support the franchise locally in Japan, as they pursue acquisitions on quite a regular or basis, as well as refinancings. In terms of the economic implications, what we set is that our expectation is on a synergized basis. We should be able to deliver around a $100 million of incremental FRE from that platform in 2023. It's been strong and they've done a couple things, I think really well. One, they launched the second REIT, which has had a good market following trading at a really nice level relative to book and their organic flows have been strong as well. So this is a business that was started not all that long ago by me to BC [ph] and UBS together. And so really it's been their entire growth has been organic in nature. No, that's a one quarter view based on what we have line of sight on today. So that would be all Q2. Thanks Craig. Maybe I'll start and Craig will chip in here along the way. In terms of just state of the union to our AsiaPac business, we've talked about this in prior calls. We have every expectation that over time, our AsiaPac business will be as big as our US business and we're investing behind that deal and I think the acquisition of the Japanese REIT manager is very much consistent with that overall theme. Just to put some numbers around it. I think at the end of 2019, we had about $20 billion of AUM in AsiaPac. Two plus years forward proforma for the acquisition, we're close to $55 billion. So almost a tripling of our AUM in a short period of time. I think we've got a lot of competitive advantages in the region and we've got a real opportunity to take advantage of that head start, we have the access, we have to talent really across the region to be able to drive further growth. In terms of the strategic merits of the acquisition, honestly, that piece of it was a really short conversation. We want to be able to double down on our lead in Asia. We've got ambitions to really be able to scale a real estate business, both in AsiaPac and in Japan, the second largest real estate market in the world and globally. We want access to more perpetual capital at the firm, as well as different avenues to be able to reach private wealth investors. And so this acquisition, really was something from a strategic perspective, made a ton of sense as we were evaluating it. Craig, you want to hit on... We can, yeah, Yeah. Arnold, this is Scott. The only thing I would add, if it's corporate M&A from a third party capital investing for our funds standpoint, as Craig mentioned that deployment's been active, the pipelines are busy and there are public private dialogues happening. So it's not as much fun to be a public company right now and so that's part of the, the pipeline that we're seeing build up. In terms of, for the firm itself, dialogue continues, it's been active and I think in an environment like this probably makes people think it, maybe it's not such a bad idea that to be part of a larger firm that has a lot of different ways to win and raise capital and invest. So we're active on both fronts."

            "name": "Robert Lewin",
            "content": "Thanks a lot, Craig. I'll try and quickly step through our quarterly financials. Our management fees continue to scale at a really rapid pace, increasing by 46% in the LTM period to $2.3 billion and reaching $625 million just for the quarter alone. Our management fee growth this quarter was really driven by the fundraising activity that Craig ran through. Of note, Europe VI entered its investment period in the quarter and we had approximately $20 million of catch-up fees from the final closes of Americas XIII and Infra IV. Our capital raising success alongside our investment activity brought fee paying AUN to $371 billion, which is up 29% year-on-year. Our net transaction and monitoring fees were $306 million for the quarter, driven primarily by our capital markets franchise, which earned $255 million, almost $1 billion for the LTM period. The quarter's transactions consistent with past trends were diversified across clients, strategies as well as geographies. Our operating expenses totaled $126 million for the quarter. As discussed on previous calls, we would continue to expect modest increases here as we expand our footprint, invest in marketing and technology, and hopefully have our employees back out on the road and traveling. When you pull it all together, our fee-related earnings this quarter increased to $605 million, that's up 66% compared to just a year ago. Moving down our income statement, our realized carried interest totaled $580 million in the quarter while realized investment income came in at $349 million. In any environment, we think these are very solid results. However, when you layer on the volatility in Q1, we were quite pleased in our ability to achieve this outcome and very much reflects the breadth and scale of our firm today. Turning to our insurance segment, we had a very solid quarter generating $116 million of operating earnings. In aggregate, our after tax distributable earnings were $969 million for the first quarter or a $1.10 per share. I now want to turn to our balance sheet for a moment. During periods of market volatility, we'll hear from some who are concerned that the balance sheet increases our risk profile. That's not our perspective. It's actually quite the opposite. So we thought it'd be worthwhile explaining what we believe to be true. That having a balance sheet, especially one with the attributes of ours is a meaningful differentiator and a real positive during periods of market dislocation. Let's begin with the liability side of our balance sheet, which we think is pretty unique and a real source of differentiation. We are very fortunate to have access to long-dated and low cost liabilities. The average maturity of our recourse debt outstanding, including our recent Yen issuance is approximately 20 years with a weighted average coupon of about 3.5% and a 100% of that coupon is fixed. So we have minimal duration risk, no exposure to margin calls, our after-tax cost of debt is less than 3% and we have no risk around rising interest rates. In terms of the asset side of our balance sheet, as you'd expect, we have a very deep commitment to asset allocation risk, which has helped deliver exceptional results for our shareholders. Over the last one, three and five years, our annual returns have been 15%, 20% and 16% respectively. And as we go a layer deeper around KKR's investment portfolio, one of the key strategic decisions we made a number of years ago was the launch of core private equity business. It's a great example of how we used our balance sheet to help create what we believe is today, the largest business of its kind and an important contributor to our management fees and fee-related earnings, as well as representing the largest allocation we have on the balance sheet today. Core private equity is a long duration strategy. We expect to hold these investments for 10 to 50 plus years and believe they carry a more modest risk return profile compared to traditional private equity. We're looking for mid-to-high teens gross IRRs that we can compound for north of a decade. These are businesses we believe have strong secular tailwinds with defensible market positions, solid cash flow dynamics and as a result, benefit from a more stable earnings profile. And with equity and fixed income indices, our 5% plus in the quarter, a key reason our balance sheet portfolio was flat in Q1 was the 3% appreciation in our core portfolio. This portfolio is performing extremely well, and we believe has many of the right attributes to outperform if we go through a period of volatility and real inflation, including having real pricing power. Today, core private equity accounts for 30% of our balance sheet investments or $5.5 billion. Now, we entered core private equity, not only because we thought it would be a stable long-term compounder for our balance sheet, but also because it's highly synergistic with our overall business model. We were confident that we had the ability to become a global leader in core PE asset management, and that our capital markets business would be able to support these investments over time as they access both the debt and equity capital markets. So from a standing start five years ago, we've put together this incredible global portfolio, which now number over 15 companies and growing, and with $32 billion of AUM that is third party capital together with balance sheet capital, we believe we have the largest core PE asset management business in the world and a return since inception have been very strong with a gross IRR of 26%, which gives us the confidence that we'll be able to continue to scale the franchise. And alongside the management fees, we'll earn over the duration of these long data investments, we are also entitled to an annual allocation of carried interest from our clients, which we earn every Q1. For 2021 performance alone, we generated approximately $250 million of carry, which is reflected in Q1 results. So the opportunity for performance-related revenue can be a very significant one-over time with continued compounding, deployment and performance. Moreover, our core portfolio companies have generated approximately 10% of capital markets fees over the last couple of years and as the portfolio grows, we'd expect transaction activity to grow alongside it. So to recap, we have created an exposure on our balance sheet that has performed extremely well and has more stable return characteristics. And we have been able to meaningfully augment our asset level return by becoming the leading asset manager in the base and therefore creating a combination of incremental management fees and carry as well as capital markets revenues. Given the increased scale and diversification of our balance sheet portfolio, we have decided to enhance our disclosure. In our 10-Q beginning this quarter, we will provide the 20 largest balance sheet positions with their cost and fair value, instead of just our five largest investments. We think this will enhance transparency and with 13 of the top 20 positions, as of March 31st being core private equity investments, it will help highlight the performance of this portfolio going forward. Now, turning back to our broader balance sheet strategy and the benefits it provides in periods of dislocation. We think this is the type of environment where our connected and collaborative business model excels. This was particularly evident in the first half of 2020, where I think we really outperformed. Having access to this additional source of capital when the market goes risk off is hugely valuable and we would bet all investment firms would love this of liquidity in markets like these. And finally, there's obviously a huge advantage of this capital base as we pursue strategic acquisitions. The best example of that, there's really no way that we would've been able to pursue Global Atlantic in early 2020 when capital markets were severely dislocated without the benefit of our capital base. And as Craig mentioned, we recently announced a highly strategic acquisition of a Japanese REIT manager, where we funded the entirety of the $1.8 billion purchase price without issuing any equity. We understand the value of that limited dilution to all shareholders, especially right now, given our current trading price. Between these two transactions alone, we expect to generate well north of $300 million of fee-related earnings next year with most coming from perpetual capital. And we required relatively little equity dilution to be able to achieve that. So w0e're using our balance sheet to generate really high ROEs while at the same time, creating additional FRE. And while supporting all this business building and inorganic activity, we've used the balance sheet to buy back our own stock. Since 2015, we have used $2.2 billion to repurchase or retire, 85 million shares at a weighted average price of $25.50. So hopefully that helps provide additional context around the balance sheet, including some examples of its strategic value and how that can enhance overall economic outcomes across different market environments. With that, let me hand it off to Scott. Hey, Mike, it's Rob. Thanks for the question. So, as we're looking across our portfolio today, obviously like others, we're seeing a stickier inflation environment. There's three things that we're watching quite a bit. One is labor availability and wage inflation. We're certainly seeing that across our portfolio on a global basis. In, particularly in the US, we're focused on housing short supply there due to underbuilding over the last 15 years, especially as millennials now are moving their way into prime home ownership years. And then the last thing that I think you know is creating the stickiness is just an under-spend on CapEx related to energy supply, which is going to continue put pressure on pricing there. Now, the one thing that we're definitely seeing on the other side of this across our portfolios is an easing around supply chain. And so as we look at 2022, our expectation on inflation is we're going to be in the 7% to 8% range. We do see that moderating into 2023. There's a lot of work that we're doing across our portfolio right now to share best practices. Obviously a lot of work for years has gone into interest rate hedging, and that continues given a potential increase here in rates going forward. But you would've heard us on these calls and in other forums for a long period of time talking about these potential inflationary trends. We feel really good about how we've set up the broader portfolio. As you look at the underlying revenue and earnings growth across our portfolio, it's continues to be exceptionally strong and we feel really good with how we've positioned the overall portfolio going forward. Yeah. Hey Glen, it's Rob I'll start off here. So last quarter what we talked about on this call was that we felt like in normal functioning markets, our capital markets is a plus or minus $200 million a quarter type of revenue business. Now in Q4 of last year and Q1 of this year, we were on the plus side of that. Probably a couple things in Q1 this year that we were expecting in Q2 that probably got pulled forward a bit, but I think what's more important is that not mistaken and I think you reference this in your question, not mistaken the quarter-to-quarter variability in our income with the durability of our franchise, as well as its growth prospects. And what you've seen, I think over the last number of years is both, highly durable pipeline to potentially generate fees, a broadening of transactioning transactions and just loss of growth areas and those growth areas are going to come from continuing to follow KKR's loan growth. I referenced core private equity a little bit earlier, but there's a number of different opportunities like that across the firm and obviously we believe we're going to continue to be able to take a lot of share given our business model and our access to talent with third party clients as well. And so as we think about that business and the future, we're very excited to continue to invest behind that and we see a lot of growth over the next number of years. Hey, Bill. It's Rob. Let me follow up on your question around returns and monetization. You referenced our Q1 returns in private equity. Just want to put that into context for a bit. We were up 46% in 2021 in PE. And so we gave back about five points in Q1, but over the last 15 months, our PE portfolios still up on 40%. And as you think about that decline, quarter on quarter, the down five points, we actually had a position at 12/31 that was marked at about 24 times multiple of money that traded down about 40% in the quarter, still marked at 14 times multiple of money, still a fantastic investment for us at 3/31 and represented a good chunk of that decline. In terms of the impact around monetization, we feel great about our monetization pipeline, right now, certainly relative to where we are from overall volatility in the markets and so you saw a very healthy Q1 monetization revenue number and as we head into Q2, you're based on transactions that have happened, or that we have line of sight to either through signed deals and LOIs or equivalent, we already have line of sight to $600 plus million of revenue that we feel good about. And I think this represents a couple things. One, just the overall breadth of KKR's portfolio today, global nature, different products, and two, that underlying strength of our portfolio that we've talked about. Now like all quarters, there's definitely some risk in some of these deals happening, but at the same time, given the strength of the pipeline, I referenced there's some upside to these numbers as well. And just in terms of character of revenue, assuming that we're able to achieve these numbers, I'd say about ballpark 75%, that revenue would come from realized performance revenue and then the balance would come from realized investment income. Hopefully that helps provide a bit of color there Bill. Yeah. Hey Bill, it's Rob. So we talked a bit about this last call. I'd say really no new update from us. What we're focused on with Global Atlantics focused on is continuing to have a really close and transparent relationship with its regulators. We know that the regulatory community continues to gather information and industry feedback, and we want to make sure that Global Atlantic are part of that. Beyond that, there's not a ton that we can comment on other to say that we really don't anticipate many changes to the business model of trying to thoughtfully invest behind the long-term promises that we've made to policy holders. And so, we feel again overall very constructive around the Global Atlantic relationship with its regulators and are focused on continuing that type of transparency in the future. It's Rob. Thanks a lot for the question. Listen, we don't spend honestly a ton of time thinking about, FRE near-term target is not how we manage our business. And so I think what you're less likely to get from us is a continual update around where we see FRE going in the short term. But what I would tell you is that we will update you hopefully very continually on how we see our business trending. And hopefully what you've heard from us is the level of excitement we have across our firm today. We have so much more momentum today than we had even six or 12 months ago. You look at many of the big product raises we've had over the last six or 12 months, we've well exceeded the fundraising targets that we had for those. We're likely to have Scott mentioned close to 30 products in the market over the course of the next 12 months, many of which are poised to scale in areas like infrastructure, real estate and floating rate credit, areas where we're seeing real secular growth. Obviously Global Atlantics market positioning and where they're sitting from a growth perspective is much better than when we underwrote that transaction two years ago. And a lot of momentum across our capital markets business as I referenced. So our expectation is for really robust near-term and long-term FRE growth. And hopefully that helps give you a little bit of color with that, providing continual updates around FRE targets. Sure. Brian. It's Rob I'll take that. So when we evaluate anything for our balance sheet, the first measure that we're going to look at always is going to be what drives the highest and best ROE over a long period of time. Now given how we're situated, I think with our brand and our track record and our access to distribution, there's a lot of inorganic asset management activity where we think we can help make those businesses better. Maybe they can help make us better. And ultimately that's, what's going to drive the highest ROE. And that's what you saw. I think, in the acquisition we closed last week. That's what you saw with our partnership with Global Atlantic, and we've got multi different examples of that over the years. And so we've got a team that's very much focused on how we can really leverage the core competencies we have here at KKR to be able to continue drive ROE and we think a lot of times that's going to lend itself to incremental FRE as well, but that's not necessarily going to be the primary driver here of any transaction. But you're certainly seeing that as it relates to the things that we've done, inorganically over the last number of years. The last point on inorganic growth while we're going to be focused on it. And it's something that we think is a real opportunity here, long term, it was referenced earlier in the call that we had a couple of targets we had put out there four plus dollars of FRE. seven plus dollars of TDE that was on an in -- that was on a organic basis and so anything that we would do from an inorganic perspective on the FRE side should certainly be accretive to that. Hey, Arnold, it's Rob. We weren't able to hear all of that question. I think is relates to corporate M&A and the pipeline we're seeing. Certainly a lot of activity across the GP space and I think we get to take a look at quite a bit of it, but inorganic activity in our space, particularly inorganic activity, that requires integration is hard. And so while we'll look at a lot and there's quite a bit that crosses our desk and the pipeline is full, I think the likelihood of any one of these deals happening is still, relatively low and so we've been fortunate that we've been able to do some large things over the years. We would anticipate being able to do that in the future especially given that the size of the M&A pipeline line, but it's also not a need to do for us either. I think we're in a fortunate position where we've got a lot of avenues to organically really grow our business, but if we can find something where we can use our balance sheet to complement what we're doing and drive additional growth, we're certainly going to look at that. Yeah. The only thing I'd add Rufus is if you think about the job we have get to think about how do we double the stock price as quickly as possible? How do we double our market cap as quickly and thoughtfully as possible given the risks we're taking? And the reason that we built the model that we have is that we believe with the combination of third party capital plus our own capital invested alongside, we can create that next $50 billion and then, the next a $100 billion of market cap after that with greater line of sight and more confidence. So no, the answer to the question is, no, we're not planning to cap it but, over time, if the market doesn't certainly appreciate the model of the way that we do, we have lots of different things that we can do to express our view on that. We've been buying back stock, we've been making acquisitions and converting balance sheet into fee-related earnings. There's lots of different things that we can do strategically with that balance sheet, but that's really where it's coming from. How do we get the market cap from $50 billion $200 billion and so forth, No, is the short answer Rufus. I think we feel good about the compensation structure that we put in place now a little bit more than a year ago. I think it's working really well for our firm making sure we've got alignment in the right place between our employees, our shareholders, and our limited partners and we think that balance is about right for us right now. Yeah, there's no plans Chris, for a traditional fossil fuels fund. We haven't actually invested in conventional oil and gas in our private equity fund since 2018. Don't have any plans to really -- the work we're doing is through Crescent on the more conventional side and focused on improving the ESG footprint of every investment that they make and the team is doing a great job around that. And then as Craig mentioned, we're doing a lot in renewables across infrastructure, asset-based finance through GA and otherwise. So those are some of the areas of focus right now."

During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the management's prepared remarks, the conference will be opened for questions [Operator Instructions]. Please note this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Craig Larson, Partner, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.\nCraig Larson: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. This morning, as usual, I'm joined by Rob Lewin, our Chief Financial Officer; and Scott Nuttall, our co-Chief Executive Officer. We'd like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, which is available on the Investor Center section at kkr.com. And as a reminder, we report our segment numbers on an adjusted share basis. This call will contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to our earnings release as well as our SEC filings for cautionary factors about these statements. And as a reminder, our earnings release in our financial reporting for Q4 is consistent with past quarters beginning in Q1 of 2024, our earnings release will reflect the segment and financial metric changes we announced on November the 29th. Turning now to our numbers for the quarter, we're pleased to be reporting strong fourth quarter results with fee-related earnings per share of $0.76. This is a record figure for KKR up 21% from Q3 2023 as well as Q4 of 2022. After tax distributable earnings came in at $1 per share. New capital raised in the quarter was $31 billion, which is also particularly strong. So overall, a really solid quarter for us. I'll begin this morning by walking through our financials in a little more detail. So management fees in the quarter are 785 million. That's up 3.4% compared to just last quarter, with growth across all of our business lines. And comparing full year '23 to 2022, management fees grew 14%. We reported double-digit percentage annual growth in our management fees for several consecutive years now. Net transaction and monitoring fees were 264 million in the quarter. Capital markets transaction fees in particular were quite strong in Q4 with 225 million in revenue that was driven by an increase in investment activity and financing transactions at several of our PE and core PE portfolio companies. So in total, fee-related revenues for the quarter were 1.1 billion, up 17% on a year-over-year basis compared to Q4 of 2022. Turning to expenses. Fee-related compensation, as usual was at the midpoint of our guided range at 22.5 a fee-related revenues for the quarter as well as for the year. Other operating expenses were 156 million. So in total, fee-related earnings were 675 million or $0.76 per share. As I mentioned just a moment ago, this was a record FRE quarter for us. And this growth really highlights in our view the continued strength as well as the diversification that you're seeing across the firm. Our FRE margin in the quarter came in at 63% and on a per share basis FRE was $2.68 for the year. Turning now to realization activity. For the quarter, we generated 411 million a realized performance income. This was driven by multiple successful sales across our traditional private equity and core businesses, with realized incentive fees driven by Marshall Wace in the fourth quarter. Realized investment income in the quarter was 147 million. So together monetizations were 558 million. In total asset management operating earnings were 970 million. Moving to our insurance segment, performance continued to be strong in the quarter with 231 million of pre tax earnings that's up 10% quarter-over-quarter. This was the result of stronger net inflows across both the institutional and individual channels, as well as variable investment income from the sale of a solar developer that generated 16 million of insurance segment pre tax operating earnings. So in total, after tax PE was 888 million or $1 per share. In comparison with the prior quarter, that figure was up 14%. Next, turning to investment performance, you can see this on page seven of the earnings release. The private equity portfolio appreciated 3% in the quarter and 16% in the year. In real assets, the opportunistic real estate portfolio was down one in the quarter and down two for the year. Infrastructure was up 5% in the quarter and up 18% for the year. So very strong broad performance across our infrastructure platforms. And in credit, the leverage credit composite was up three and the alternative credit composite was up 2%. And over the year performance year was up 14% and 10% respectively. And finally, consistent with our historical practice, we are intending to increase our annual dividend from $0.66 to $0.70 per share, which we anticipate will go into effect alongside first quarter 2024 earnings. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Rob.\nRob Lewin: Thanks a lot, Craig. And good morning, everyone. First looking at our key operating metrics. New capital raised totaled 31 billion for the quarter. These results are quite strong and encouraging for us as we head into 2024. Credit and liquid strategies made up about two thirds of the capital we raised this quarter. As our business has grown with Global Atlantic as a significant partner. GA in particular had record inflows in the quarter, both overall and specifically from the individual channel. So activity here continues to be very strong. Block activity at GA is also active. As you know the MetLife block closed in the quarter and the Manulife block transactions is expected to close sometime in the first half of 2024. And similar to prior blocks, GA continues to be very capital efficient here, contributing approximately 25% of the equity in both transactions with 75% of the capital coming from IV vehicles and additional CO investors. So 75% from third parties where we can earn management fees and have the opportunity for performance income as well. Over the past year, new capital raised totaled right around 70 billion. And looking post 12/31, we just announced the final closing in Asia Infrastructure 2 at approximately 6.4 billion over 65% larger than the previous fund. Of note, more than half of the capital came from new investors to the Asia Infrastructure platform. With this successful fundraise, we are clearly the largest infrastructure fund in the region, enhancing our Asia positioning more broadly. And as we look out over the next 12 months and into 2025, a number of our flagship funds will be raising capital as well. So we continue to expect an acceleration our fundraising from here. Turning to capital invested, we deployed 16 billion in the quarter and 44 billion for the year. Capital invested was really diversified across private equity, real assets and credit and liquid strategies in the year, as U.S. private equity and core private equity deployment rebounded in the quarter. Of particular note, we made investments in three big private transactions in Q4. And with almost 100 billion of uncalled capital, we continue to be well positioned for the deployment opportunities that are ahead. I wanted to briefly shift now to a reflection on our progress through the course of 2023. Our assets under management now total 553 billion that's up 10% compared to the end of 2022. With sizable capital raised in the past year, fee paying AUM now stands at almost 450 billion. Given our consistent growth in fee paying AUM, management fees increased 14% in 2023, with line of sight of future growth from approximately 40 billion of committed capital that becomes fee paying asset invested or when it enters its investment period. And that's at a weighted average rate of just over 90 basis points. And while realized performance and investment income was more muted in 2023, given the environment, our forward visibility has increased meaningfully year-over-year. Total embedded gains were 12.3 billion at year end that reflects embedded gains on our balance sheet plus gross unrealized carried interest. This was up almost 40% compared to Q4 of 2022. The opportunity for future investing revenue remains robust. And strategically, we made a lot of progress in 2023. As you likely know, we announced 40 initiatives towards the end of November. As an update, on January 2, we closed on our acquisition of the remaining stake in Global Atlantic for approximately 2.6 billion in cash. We believe this acquisition will create more value for policyholders and shareholders and are excited to unlock future potential together. Concurrent with the closing of GA, we have created a new strategic holding segment, which you will see in our Q1 2024 earnings release. Here the segment operating earnings will be driven by cash dividends from our core PE portfolio. We also revised their compensation ratios, which similarly will be reflected in our Q1 financials, delivering more FRE to our shareholders, and driving even more alignment between our compensation model and the outcomes of our clients. Combining these aspects, we will be introducing a new reporting framework that will better highlight our business model. This will include a new financial metric, total operating earnings, which represents our more recurring forms of income. Prior to our next earnings call, we will provide recap financials to help you further understand the various key metrics. As a reminder, we do expect these announcements to be accretive to all of our per share metrics. And together with the competence and current visibility we have, it is what allowed us to increase our 2026 FRE per share target to $4.50 plus cents per share. In 2023, we generate $2.68 per share of FRE. So our expectation is for a lot of growth from here. Given these four announcements paired with the existing growth engines we have, we believe that we are well set up to drive meaningful scale. The opportunities we have across asset management, insurance and strategic holdings are multi-fold. Turning first to our asset management business. There remains a lot of upside here with multiple drivers of growth. We have a lot of younger strategies that are just beginning to scale. We started 25 or so investing businesses through the past decade alone, and many are now starting to inflect. We are an asset classes and geographies with massive end markets, Asia, infrastructure, including climate and credit are all great examples. And as a reminder, we only want to be competing in areas with large addressable markets and where we have conviction that we can be a top three player. We are in the early days of tapping into the private wealth end market. We've had early success in our case theory suite of products with the tremendous amount of opportunity that is still in front of us. With these growth avenues, along with our strong track record count, and the trust that we've built with our clients, we feel that we could double our asset management business from here. And that's without starting anything new. Second, we have a meaningful opportunity in insurance with our partnership with Global Atlantic. Insurance is a very powerful contributor to our business. GA has already created a lot of value, going from 72 billion of assets under management at our announcement of the initial transaction in July of 2020 to over 170 billion of assets under management today, including the pending Manulife block deal. We have a strong opportunity to unlock even more value together in investing, product development, global expansion, private wealth distribution and capital markets. And we are still in the very early stages of our partnership. And finally, number three, strategic holdings, where our opportunity is highly differentiated. This segment leverages all of our people, capabilities and our collaborative culture. As a result, we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on what we believe is a huge addressable market. And that's in addition to the current visibility we already have to drive net dividends in this segment of $300-plus million by 2026 and $600-plus million by 2028. In summary, we are incredibly well positioned as a firm. And we really don't think there are many companies in our industry or others that have the type of visibility that we have for long-term growth. We have a high level of confidence that we can meaningfully grow all 3 of our business segments; asset management, insurance and strategic holdings. With that, we are excited to announce we are going to host an Investor Day in New York on April 10. Given the November strategic announcements and all of the opportunities across our firm, we thought it would be timely for you to hear directly from our senior leaders. We will provide additional detail in the coming months, and hope that you will join our broader team as we discuss our outlook and these opportunities. With that, Scott, Craig and I are happy to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will be from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nCraig Siegenthaler: We were looking for an update on funding raising for your 3 largest flagships. So we have global in for 5, with 4 that's already 60% invested. It's higher when you look at the committed. In Asia, 5 and North America 14, which are both over 40% now. So how should we think about the timing of these fundraises given the commitment levels and AUM targets given the size of prior funds, they're all large funds. And more importantly, how should we think about the FRE ramp from these new funds less step-downs from the last exit?\nCraig Larson: Good morning, Craig, it's Craig, why don't I start on that. First, look, one of the things that runs mind as it relates to the trajectory of new capital raised, and you would have heard this in the prepared remarks from Rob, relates to the topic exactly as it relates to our flagship strategies. So when you look at the largest fund complexes within our firm, so Americas, Europe, Asia PE, Core PE infrastructure, less than $1 billion of the capital that we raised last year, we raised $70 billion in total, less than $1 billion of that came from those strategies. And if you look over '22 and '23, we raised round numbers, $150 billion of new capital and around $6 billion came from those flagships. And so as we think about '24 and '25, we think that that's going to look different. And so we are actively fundraising for our infrastructure strategy and do expect to launch fundraising for our Americas private equity strategy later in the year, with Asia likely a 2025 initiative for us. On the deployment numbers, you mentioned, those numbers are always a little understated. I remember, if we have platform investments, et cetera, that capital is going to be spoken for, or if there happens to be capital drawn under the line, that's going to be paid back inside of 180 days, again, that capital will be additive. So those deployment numbers always look a little more understated relative to how we think of that positioning. And then I think there's a couple of other points here. The next one would relate to scaling. We mentioned in our press release that we had the final closes on our Next-Gen Tech 3 and Impact strategies. We had nice scaling in those strategies compared to their prior vintages. Again, Rob talked about the good news as it relates to Asia infrastructure for us. We do expect scaling in our wealth strategies alongside of that. And then finally, we feel like we have a lot of momentum in Global Atlantic, both in the individual as well as the institutional channels. So I think the opportunities that we see for new capital raised and, in turn, management fee growth is really an attractive part of our positioning with the flagship certainly being an important part of that.\nRob Lewin: Good morning, Craig. It's Rob. I'll pick up as it relates to your question on FRE. When you look at some of these big flagships that will be in the market and their predecessor funds, they don't have big step-downs in fee rates as they transition to post-investment period. In addition to that, when you think about the runoff, a lot of the runoff from investment is probably going to come from 2 funds prior and 3 funds prior, those funds close out. But maybe kicking it up a level, if you think about where we are today and where we're going, and I hit this in the prepared remarks, we're at $2.68 of FRE per share. And we've guided 3 years from now, we have an expectation of being at $4.50-plus per share. And so in order to get there, our expectation is we're going to have a lot of management fee growth and the flagships, on a net basis, will be a part of that story.\nScott Nuttall: Yes. The only thing I would add, Craig, is I think our overall view on fundraising is quite optimistic. I mean, Craig Larson mentioned it, but the $150 billion we raised for 4% of that have come from flagships is a pretty low number speaks to how we've been scaling the diversification of the firm. And as you know, a number of our strategies are kind of in this nice part of the inflection curve Funds II, III, IV, where we can see a significant amount of growth. So you're absolutely right to point out the flagships are coming back at what we think is going to be a really good time. But we also have 22 of our 30 strategies that are coming to market in the next 12 to 18 months, we put in that younger category. Fund I, II, III, open-ended these newer strategies. And you can see it. Asia-Infra, up 66%, tech growth was up 30%. Our impact fund doubled even in the environment that we saw over the last couple of years. Yet, on top of that, private wealth, GA, Asia speaks to the optimism that we see kind of regardless of what's happening with the backdrop.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nAlex Blostein: I was hoping you could start with just building on your prior comments around expansion in the wealth channel. You mentioned you're seeing quite a bit of success early days, only a couple of quarters in some of these platforms. So maybe a little bit about what products you expect to be out in the market with over the course of this year, how many platforms you're on, et cetera. But also, I guess more importantly, I believe in the past your targets for 2026 and FRE MD really did not include a whole lot of conception from these initiatives. So maybe just kind of confirm that and what do you think those initiatives could ultimately contribute over time?\nCraig Larson: Hey, Alex, it's Craig. Why don't I start, thanks for that. And just stepping back and level setting for everyone. So as of 12/31, around $75 billion of our assets under management are from individuals. And that number does not include policyholders of Global Atlantic. So you could argue that, that $75 billion, if anything is understated as it relates to the presence and the activities we have with individuals broadly. Now most of that $75 billion are from high net worth and ultra-high net worth individuals as well as family offices that have invested in our funds and strategies. And in terms of our fundraising in total, a double-digit percentage of our new capital raised historically has typically gone from individuals. So it's been a healthy part of that fundraising activity. Now back to your question, most specifically, most recently, we've introduced what we call our K Series suite of products. And so these are funds and strategies that are really designed and tailored specifically for wealth investors. So K Infra and [KEF] [ph] are the U.S. and non-U.S. vehicles focused on infrastructure. K Prime and K Pec are the U.S. and non-U.S. vehicles focused on private equity. We launched both private equity and infrastructure only midway through 2023. And with those products in real estate and credit on top of that, as well as our private BDC soon to be launched of that $75 billion of wealth, around $6.5 billion of that is from these K Series suite of products. Now a year ago, that was $2.4 billion. So we're in the early days, but we feel really good about the progress from here. And as we look at some of the underlying statistics, that's particularly true as it relates to infrastructure and private equity, which are newer asset classes for more mass affluent investors. As we've mentioned historically, we're raising about $500 million a month as we look at the K Series suite. And so it feels like reception and interest in our momentum continues to feel really good. And to your point, we do expect to see an acceleration in the number of platforms in the first half of '24. So it's great progress. But I think to us, even the more interesting part is really that long-term secular dynamic because mass affluent individual investors historically have not had an easy way to access these types of products and strategies. And so over the coming years, if we're correct and you start to see allocations go from the low single digits to the mid-single digits, that literally is trillions of dollars that have the potential to move to alternative products. And when we think of how we're positioned given our brand, our track record, the investments that we've made in distribution and marketing, our ability to product-innovate, we feel really well positioned to be a winner in the space over the long term.\nRob Lewin: Alex, just as it relates to your question on our 2026 targets. Historically, we haven't included much of anything as it relates to private wealth. As we look forward, given some of the early success that Craig just went through, we do see some contribution coming over the next few years across the number of different investing businesses that we have. And Craig just hit on it at the end, the real opportunity we see as we do long-term financial modeling is really in that post-2026 area, between 2026, '28, as we continue to ramp, that's where you're going to start to see a real inflection and much more material contribution to our P&L.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.\nGlenn Schorr: So the question relates to the banks, and I see 2-way activity. I see right now, I see a little bit more banks coming back into the leveraged loan space, and you see some movement and them getting into providing some services in private credit. Yet at the same time, we know capital requirements are going up in private credit world and more asset-backed opportunities are coming your way. So I just wonder if you could talk a little bit about that dynamic and what specifically you're doing on the asset-backed side to position for what we all think is a lot of growth ahead. Thanks.\nCraig Larson: So Glenn, why don't I start. And thanks for asking, because these are really important secular drivers really as it relates to both businesses. So as a reminder as of year-end, we had around $90 billion of private credit AUM, almost 50 of that was in asset-based finance and $38 billion in direct lending. So these are big businesses for us. I think probably larger than someone might expect in the framework of KKR. And you touched on two things. I think first, as it relates to direct lending and overall activity, we are seeing a lot more activity in the leveraged loan, in the high-yield market and CLO issuance feels like it's picking up. We actually look at all of that as really good for our businesses. And as it relates, now a lot of that has been refinancing related, so it's been less new dollars in. But as it relates to new deals, we think that's going to be helpful for mid-market M&A. And if the private credit markets end up having a lower market share but of a bigger pie. We think that dynamic is one that can still work really well in the framework of our firm. And in terms of private credit, I think there are lots of advantages that are going to lead to people to continue to use that market. The point on ABF is a really, really important one, and it relates to the dynamics that you're talking about. So I think as banks pull back from many types of lending and divest noncore loan portfolios, our opportunity set, we think, is just going to continue to expand. And you've actually seen this in recent announcements from us. So two weeks ago, we announced an accounts receivable financing for our barbecue business. I remember you actually sent me an e-mail on this. As I know you were hoping that could lead to nice little trinkets at our next Investor Day. In December, we announced a partnership with BMO focused on a $7 billion portfolio of RV loans. In October, Goldman announced the sale of the GreenSky platform to a handful of buyers of which we were part of that consortium. And in August and September, we announced the acquisition of a portfolio of prime auto loans from a regional bank in the Southeast. So I think you're seeing lots of opportunities to firms like ours to participate in asset-based finance in a way that you didn't see 5 years ago, and it's a really important tailwind as we think about the growth and opportunities that we see ahead.\nScott Nuttall: Yes. The only thing I would add, Glenn, is we see a lot written about the direct lending market, rightly so, it's become a very large and important market. I think Craig is right. M&A volumes have been down. Private credits had a larger share of a smaller amount of volume. And so as the banks come back, our expectation is you'll see M&A volume pick up, and there'll still be plenty for the private credit market to participate in. But this ABF business, I don't think is that well understood yet, whereas the direct lending market is probably roughly $1.5 trillion, the ABS market is probably closer to $5 trillion, on its way to $7 trillion. And it is kind of my view, becoming an asset class for institutional investors to understand a little bit. Like 10, 12 years ago, infrastructure and direct lending were very new concepts for most investors. We're having more dialogue on asset-based finance, seeing more investors start to create an allocation or a sub-allocation on private credit. It's obviously incredibly synergistic with what we're building at Global Atlantic, and we're seeing interest from third-party insurers as well. And I do think there's a significant amount of growth ahead for that business. We have 20 or so origination platforms around asset-based finance so far, and I'd expect that number to continue to go up. I would guess in April when we're together for the Investor Day, we'll go deeper on that topic.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Bill Katz with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nBill Katz: So maybe just flipping over to the insurance platform and just sort of adjusting for the solar gain in the quarter. I mean how we should be thinking about the ROE for the platform given sort of, two parts, one, and now you have 100% of the platform. And two, if interest rates were to go lower, is there enough growth in the business to offset any kind of degradation in net spreads? Thank you.\nRob Lewin: Hey, Bill, all great questions. Thank you. First thing, I guess we look at Q4 and we look at 2023, a very strong performance from the Global Atlantic business. Management team has done a great job, and it's a big reason why we're excited to own 100% of the business. You are right that in Q4, as well as through 2023, that the P&L did have some tailwinds, some variable investment income on a gross basis, about $35 million in Q4. At the beginning of the year, we're at about 20% of our book on a net basis exposed to floating rate. Team did a good job making that adjustment, and so got the benefit of rising rates through much of '23. We ended the year at about 16%. And so as we think about interest rates going down in 2024, we're conscious of that. In Q4, too, specifically, we made a modest adjustment to our comp. So effectively had over-accrued a little bit through the course of Q1, Q2 and Q3. So all things that positively impacted the quarter and all things front of mind as it relates to how we plan for 2024. So as we look at Q4, not necessarily replicable in the near term. But as you said, we have so many levers to be able to grow the GA franchise that our expectation even in a reducing rate environment is that GA is going to continue to perform. As it relates to ROE targets, we continue to think the right level to model the business at that 14% to 15% pretax ROE. The team has done a nice job being able to beat that and beat that by a healthy margin over the past couple of years. But we are going into an environment here that could be lower interest rates and put a little bit of pressure on the P&L.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Brian McKenna with JMP. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Mckenna: So just a question on the capital markets business. I'm curious, how did activity trend throughout the fourth quarter? I'm assuming November and December were better months just as broader markets rallied quite a bit into year-end and then has this momentum carried into the new year? And I'm just trying to get a sense of the jumping off point for capital markets activity levels to start 2024.\nRob Lewin: Yes. Great. Thanks for the question. Obviously, we're really pleased with the performance of our capital markets business in Q4 and really for all of 2023. If you look at Q4 specifically, great quarter did benefit maybe from a bit of deferrals, some fees that could have been that ended up in Q4. You're right, as the markets picked up in November and December, that definitely helped as well. But I think the more important point on our capital markets business, really, if you look at 2022 and 2023, through much of both of those years, debt capital markets, equity capital markets were largely shut. And our business still was able to generate, on average, close to $600 million of annual revenue in both of those years. So we're quite proud of the resilience of the business model, the durability of the business model. So it wasn't that long ago in a very healthy market environments, our capital markets business was generating roughly $400 million a year. And as you also point out, we've got a business that can generate really outsized outcomes when the markets come back. It wasn't that long ago, 2021, where our capital markets business in very healthy markets generated $840 million of revenue. Now despite the strong Q4, we're not back to those healthy levels of capital markets deployments. It's still relatively muted across the space. Leverage finance market feels better, but the CLO market is continuing to get healthy. IPO markets, secondary markets, they continue to trend in an upward way, but not back anywhere close to where we were in 2021. Now as we think about pipelines going into 2024, we're quite constructive. As it relates to Q1, still very early in the quarter to give you a read. But our pipeline as we're going into the year just across the firm from deployment, the engagement we're having with our third-party clients, we're expecting a constructive 2024.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Finian O'Shea with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nFinian O'Shea: Going back to ABF, a lot of color you provided there. Recently in a presentation, you outlined the ABF origination growth in recent years, seeing if you can touch on the potential for improvement into 2024. And then what that can mean for the credit fee rate and potentially the capital markets opportunity. Thank you.\nCraig Larson: Finian, it's Craig, why don't I start there. So we noted in that presentation that if you look 2018 to 2020, so before the GA acquisition, average annual asset origination was in that $9 billion a year. And if you look post acquisition, we've averaged $25 billion. Now that is not just ABF, that includes direct lending, that includes mortgage loans, et cetera. So I think as we look how we're positioned in growth in activity from here, we think the opportunity for that is one that's going to be able to expand as it relates from an ABF standpoint, both the insurance relationships that we have in addition to the capital that we have, that's more opportunistic in nature. So I think again, that outlook for us is one, as we've continued to grow and expand, that we're very positive on and could be a real growth engine within the credit business broadly.\nScott Nuttall: Yes. The only thing I would add, Fin, is that you're right to ask about the KCM opportunity. As a reminder, when we spoke at the end of November, we talked about all the different positive opportunities we had to unlock more value with GA, including across the rest of the firm from an investing standpoint, creating new product, private wealth distribution, Ivy, which is our third-party fund strategy, and then global in particular, Asia. And as part of that list, we did talk about the capital markets opportunity and we do think that, that can be quite meaningful for us. So think of it as, in effect using the model we've already built with KCM, but more across this ABF platform. We really haven't gotten to that yet. And when we had 37% ownership from third parties, it was a little bit more challenged to get after that. We think over time, that could be a significant opportunity, call it, in the hundreds of millions of dollars if we can get that right. It's going to take time. We'll keep you posted on it, but we do think that is the next big legged growth across all things structured finance, structured credit, asset-based finance for KCM.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Please proceed with your question.\nPatrick Davitt: Questions on margin. The FRE margin came in much better than consensus. So firstly, is that mostly a function of the much better capital markets results? And secondly, if so, if this continues into 2024, as you suggest, should we expect a similar incremental positive operating leverage impact as that line item recovers? Thank you.\nRob Lewin: Hey, Patrick. For quite some time, and we've guided that we feel like we've got a business model that could operate in the low 60s from an FRE margin perspective, which drove the FRE margin beat in the quarter is a combination of a few things: healthy management, fee growth, clearly very strong capital markets quarter for us. And then also some operating expense leverage as well. As we move into 2024, with our already announced shift in how we're going to form our compensation pool at ATR and reducing the compensation load against our fee-related revenue, our expectation is, going forward, we're going to be sustainably able to operate in the mid-60% FRE margin zip code as a firm. And I think I said this last call or the call before, I don't think that mid-60% level is a cap for us given the business model that we're employing. We're trying to scale things that we've already started here. And if we're right and are able to execute on that, we're going to be able to drive revenue growth, fee revenue growth, at a level that's well in excess of expense growth over the next several years. So I do think we should be able to, absent a really draconian type of market environment, operate at that mid-60% FRE margin quarter in, quarter out, with the potential to be able to drive that up over time, assuming we're able to execute as a management team like we think we can.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Chubak: So two-parter for me just on the PE fundraising outlook. The closings for the next-gen tech fund, the third Global Impact Fund, certainly encouraging. Meaningful step-ups versus the prior vintages. Does that momentum increase or inform your confidence for the upcoming PE flagship fund raise? Or are these simply too niche and sector specific to offer any sort of read across? And when do you expect to go to market with the funds given the significant amount of deployment capacity that you still have to work through?\nCraig Larson: Hey. It's Craig, why don't I start. Look, I think, again, as it relates to the deployment capacity, the numbers are going to be understated given platforms or platform investments we've made, et cetera. So I don't think the dynamic is, one, as it relates to deployment, I think in particular as we look at our pipelines which are building and actually expect across the industry to see deployment increase in '24 as it relates to '23. And I think as it relates to your first question in terms of overall tone, look, I think as a starting point. We've seen a nice increase in public markets. We've seen broad markets improve since mid-October, to say the least. High yield and fees are up, LSD's up. And I think in addition to that, we've all seen the increase in the capital markets. And so I think given that backdrop as it relates to fundraising and tone, I think like if anything, on balance, it feels like clients are more front-footed. And again, it's tough to draw broad conclusions from one-month of activity, and we'll see how things continue to play out from here. But given our track records, the performance that we've had, in particular, in a business for us, like Americas private equity over a long, long period of time, I think we feel very good about the opportunities that we see as we embark upon fundraising for that strategy.\nScott Nuttall: Steven, it's Scott. To your question about read across. I don't think it's a stretch to say that it does inform our broader perspective. Much of the funds that you mentioned were raised at a period of time where the capital markets were nearly as robust. And what we've seen is that investors are re-upping the funds where they've seen strong performance. Also, the color from the dialogue we're having is, I think, even more mature programs out there understand these are going to be very good vintage years and don't want to miss out. I think in the past, if you go back to the financial crisis, there are some institutions that pulled back and then had regret. And so I think there's an understanding of that in the market. And that's on the more mature programs, which I would say the minority of the people that we talk to. If you think about how the industry has expanded across sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, family offices, obviously, we talked about the private wealth channel, we're optimistic. Some part are based on those discussions and in large part based on the great work our team has been doing in terms of keeping the investment performance very strong.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Bedell: Maybe just to focus back on capital markets and maybe more of the longer-term view. So if you think about it from more of a structural basis in terms of your current dry powder, but also the deployment pipeline over the next few years from your flagship fundraising cycle, and then you mentioned the ABF opportunity as well over the long term. So as we think about that and building out to 2026, not to put a number on it, but is it fair to assume you could easily be well over $1 billion in capital markets fees by then even without a particularly robust capital markets environment? And in terms of your $4.50 per share cost target, should we be thinking of maybe a more robust environment as you're driving the plus in that equation as opposed to the baseline of $4.50?\nRob Lewin: Hi, Brian. It's Rob. I'll start off. So we really like our business model and our approach to market with our capital markets business and I think that's a big reason why there's a lot of upside. And the way we face the market really is with one team that represents our private credit pools of capital, where we're one of the largest providers in the world. Our capital markets expertise, it's that same team when they're facing a client, that can well across our liquid credit business, which is one of the biggest liquid credit businesses in the world. And so we combined 3 very large aspects of our business, and we think that's a real benefit to our clients. And there's not a lot of firms out there that can match what we do from a coordination perspective. I like our ability to go compete for talent in the capital market space. We've been able to recruit and retain, over the past number of years, some really talented people at what they do. And especially as we've expanded in product and geography that's a big part of our story and I can see more of that. You referenced what types of upside we have. I think if you look back to 2021, of course, we had a buoyant capital markets at the time. But KKR does a lot more as a firm today, both from a product perspective, deployment perspective and geographically than we did then. We think we're going to continue to be able to take share with third-party clients. And Scott just touched on the opportunity to coordinate with Global Atlantic and the opportunity that, that can create on the ABF side. And so no specific numbers -- excuse me, on the ABF side of KCM. Those specific numbers of course, as it relates to 2026, but we think this is a growth-oriented business and we think in a really good capital markets environment, we're going to be able to grow off of that $840 million revenue number that we put up in 2021.\nScott Nuttall: Brian, it's Scott. Look, I think we'll go deeper on this in April when we're together. But the way we think about it, if you look back 5 years, it's really not very representative of what KCM is today and where it's going to be, to your point. So we've been globalizing the business across more of what KKR is doing around the world. We've been penetrating more of our own strategies and efforts. So for example, if you go back several years, infrastructure wasn't a very big part of the Capital Markets business, now it's a very large part of that business. And that informs our perspective on the ABF opportunity, candidly, the real estate opportunity over time. And then on top of that, our portfolio is larger. So there's more refinancing. There's more exits to do in the public markets. And as our deployment goes up in our experience and our dry powder goes up, so do our capital markets opportunities. Because we can speak for larger transactions, we need to bring partners alongside, there's just more for us to do. So all of that speaks to the growth opportunity, which is why I think you're seeing this baseline, even in a pretty anemic capital market overall, continue to increase. And I think you'll continue to see that into the future as we execute on all of those.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Benjamin Budish with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nBenjamin Budish: I just wanted to check, I think you didn't mention in the prepared remarks, but can you share any color on your line of sight towards realization and related revenues into Q1? It sounds like on the capital market side, things are looking pretty strong. But just wondering on the realization side, anything you can share to date.\nRob Lewin: We have a pretty healthy pipeline as we're coming into 2024 from a monetization factor. But what I'd say is timing is a little bit less certain given some regulatory approvals that are required around some of these monetizations. But taken together, we have somewhere around $500 million of very high visibility, monetization-related revenue. But we currently don't expect all that to hit in Q1. Obviously, still a couple of months to go in the quarter as well. And as usual, at the end of Q1. We'll provide our standard press release that gives you more detail around the monetization related revenue for the quarter. Maybe while we're on the topic of monetization, one other thing that I think is worth calling out given the growth across a number of our businesses and also the strategic announcements that we made in November, including moving our comp down on fees and up on carry, this is just a much smaller part of our business than it used to be at KKR. It's part of the reason why you'll see us introduce this new metric in Q1, total operating earnings. Our expectation going forward is north of 70% of our earnings is going to come from total operating earnings. So of course, monetization-related revenue is going to be a big part of where we're going as a firm, it's just a lot smaller on a relative basis than it used to be.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Mike Brown with KBW. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Brown: Great. I just wanted to ask on infrastructure. So strong performance there in the quarter. Can you maybe just expand on some of the key drivers behind that 5% performance in the quarter? And then if we look forward, how do you expect investor demand for this asset class to evolve and as allocations grow, where are the dollars kind of shifting from? And then, specifically, on the Asia side, what's kind of making the strategy there so attractive to LPs? If you could maybe just touch on some of the deployment opportunities.\nCraig Larson: Why don't I begin -- Mike thanks for the question. Why don't I begin first, just as it relates to the overall framework of the infrastructure platform because, you're right, we've seen wonderful growth. So if we look back 3 years ago, AUM was $17 billion. And at 12/31, we were at about $60 billion. So we've gone from $17 billion to $60 billion, all organic. And that, as we're -- again, our infrastructure strategy is a front-burner topic for us as it relates to fundraising. We're also fundraising for a climate strategy. And we also have the wealth products that we've also launched midway through last year that we expect to continue to build in scale. So I think the growth has been really attractive and a lot of momentum. But a lot more for us to do, which is exciting. I think as it relates to Asia, and why don't I touch on that for a moment, it's again interesting to see the statistics there because I think what you're seeing there reflects the growth as well as the diversification you're seeing across the platform. So at the end of 2019, we are looking at these stats over the weekend, we had about $21 billion of AUM in Asia. At the end of '21, we were up to $42 billion and at the end of '23, we're at $65 billion. And so again, if you kind of step back at the end of 2019, we had $21 billion of AUM, almost 90% of that was in private equity. At the end of '23, we're at $65 billion and 51% of that is in private equity. So you've seen meaningful growth for us in the region as well as meaningful diversification across the footprint. And I think just as it relates to broad investment performance, I think it's something that the team is really proud of and we all love to see, obviously, because you've seen strong, consistent results. Across the flagships in particular, we're seeking mid-teens gross low-teens net returns with a 4% to 6% target annualized yield. Infra I and II, our mature funds with performance that exceeds those targets. In Infra III and IV, both earlier in their value creation but are tracking very nicely. I think our most recent fund is actually ahead of I, II and III when you look at the returns in that fund relative to when we made that first investment. So I think the team has been wonderfully disciplined as it relates to the investments we've made. We talk a lot about thematic approaches renewables, digital infrastructure, data centers, fiber networks, all great examples of large critical growing markets where we think we can bring differentiated resources to bear. So again, a lot of progress but a lot of opportunity ahead for us at the same time.\nScott Nuttall: Hey, Mike. It's Scott. Just I think in terms of your question about performance in the quarter, it was broad-based. There's nothing that we use to specifically. The portfolio has been assembled incredibly thoughtfully, as Craig mentioned, and is performing very nicely. And as expected, ahead of expectations. In terms of your question about investor demand where it's shifting from, I mean, for the most part, we've seen people creating allocation to infrastructure over the last several years. It hasn't really been a shift out of other parts of alternatives to some extent, where we've seen alternative allocations to increase, it's to be able to accommodate an infrastructure allocation. And I think a lot of that is investors have focused on the fact you've got a real asset that is mission critical, has an attractive yield. And the way we do it is to have to have that contractual yield and it is inflation protected, so it's also viewed as an inflation hedge. And I think as people have done the work on the space, you've started to see more and more dollars flow into it. So largely speaking, and none of these comments are universal, but largely speaking, it's been an and as opposed to an or. And I think on Asia, Craig hit it. I mean our Asia Infra business has gone from a standing start to $10 billion of AUM in 4 years. We have a great team on the ground. They're leveraging our Pan-Asia presence across our 9 offices. And as you know, we run the firm as one firm, so everybody helps each other. I think that's really allowed us to scale very rapidly in that market. There's a significant amount of capital required to develop infrastructure all across Asia in those themes that Craig just walked you through. And candidly, on the margin, there's less competition in Asia, because fewer firms have built the platform that we've built. So I think large opportunity, fewer competitors, firm well integrated.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Cyprys: Just wanted to ask about insurance. I was hoping you might be able to talk about the opportunity to expand the organic insurance origination, how much you expect to do annually there. Maybe talk about some of the opportunities around getting on more platforms, how meaningful could that be at this point. And if interest rates were to come down, what sort of impact might that have for customer demand and origination volumes. Maybe you could also speak to some of the pipelines from new blocks, which you guys have been quite active with.\nRob Lewin: Thanks for the question, Mike. Why don't I start? So over the last few years, our individual business is done, on average, around $10 billion of production. And you're right, you've seen a step-up across the industry, given, I think, higher rates, but I don't think that tells the full story. I think what we're seeing is a real trend towards retirement products. It's probably somewhat agnostic to where interest rates are. And as we think about Global Atlantic and how we're situated specifically in the individual markets, I think there's a lot of share that we continue to take there, getting ramped up on some new platforms, as you suggested. Also historically, Global Atlantic hasn't been as active in the more longer duration fixed annuity market, the 7- to 10-year product. We think there's some market share gains that we can have there. And we do have an expectation that we could take the individual business over time from $10 billion of production to $15 billion to $20 billion of production. Then on the institutional side of our business, there's two components of it. It's not just the block business where we've had a lot of success over the last couple of quarters. Clearly, with MetLife closing in Q4, the Manulife block closing in the first half of the year and a really strong pipeline of opportunity, both domestically and especially internationally. But there's a couple of other aspects of our institutional business that we're really excited about. We've become a real leader in flow reinsurance in the marketplace. Again, that's both domestic and international. And to date, we have very little market share in the pension risk transfer market, where we think the capabilities of our team will really resonate in that market as well. So it's an opportunity for us to take share in what is a large and growing end market. And so when we take it together, it's what gives us the confidence that you would have heard in our November call, really working as one firm to be able to accelerate the growth of the Global Atlantic platform over the next several years. Now an important part of that growth, and I referenced in our prepared remarks, relates to our ability to also be able to access third-party capital. And so our Ivy funds and strategies is a big part of where we're going as an organization. We've got a lot of momentum there. As I mentioned earlier, 75% of the capital required in the two block deals that we've got in flight right now, the MetLife one that just closed and Manulife is going to be funded by third parties, by outside investors. And we think that combination of GA balance sheet capital and third-party investors is really what the optimal structure looks like, especially for the institutional side of our business going forward.\nOperator: The next question is a follow-up from the line of Bill Katz of TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nBill Katz: I just want to circle back to capital management for a moment. Certainly appreciate you just raised the dividend by 6%. But if I start doing the math and look out to $4.50 of earnings power, and Rob, to your point, that more and more of your business is going to be more recurring in nature, and then just sort of think about sort of low single-digit type of dividend hikes that's been sort of more recent past, your dividend payout ratio is going to drop pretty dramatically and then the yield on the stock is going to be relatively negligible. How are you thinking about cap return? I know there was a big discussion point at the November update. It's a rich man's issue, I presume. But how do we think about maybe priorities from here capital return versus deployment strategically?\nCraig Larson: Sure. Thanks, Bill. So why don't I start on the dividend policy and then just, I think, more importantly, talk about our overall approach to capital allocation, which is of equal importance. So on dividend policy, we really like our policy a lot. We started with a fixed dividend of $0.50 annually when we converted to a C Corp 5 years ago. And every year, we have increased that dividend. And we believe we've got the visibility going forward to have consistent and stable growth to our dividend. And so we like our dividend policy. Now a big reason why we have the dividend policy that we have is because we see so much opportunity to be able to invest back into KKR's business for growth. And you've heard us talk about our capital allocation policy for some time in a very consistent way. And I don't think there's anything more important from the capital allocation policy than being consistent. And our approach is to optimize for recurring and growth-oriented earnings per share. And we've talked about 4 core areas, strategic areas of deployment from our excess free cash flow back into our business. And those are going to come in insurance, core private equity, strategic M&A and share buybacks. And so I think we feel very fortunate that because of the business model we have, the brand we have, the access to capital we have and distribution, that we've got the opportunity to be able to invest back into our business at high levels of ROE that are going to drive really recurring and growth-oriented earnings per share over a long period of time for our investors. So that's our focus. We feel really good about our approach to capital allocation. I think it's a real core competency of our management team and think that that's what's going to drive the highest amount of ultimate shareholder accretion for a long period of time. And of course, it's very much a highly aligned decision since the management team of KKR own 25-plus percent of the stock.\nOperator: We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. And I'll turn the call over to Craig Larson for closing remarks.\nCraig Larson: Rob, thanks for your help. And thank you, everyone, for joining this call. We know that with our announcements that we made in late November, earnings today and with Investor Day on the horizon on April 10, we're asking everyone to spend a healthy amount of time on all things KKR. Just want to thank everybody in advance for investing the time. Look forward again in particular to the deep dive on April 10. And if you have any questions following this call, please, of course, reach out to us directly. Thank you so much.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rob Lewin",
            "content": "Thanks a lot, Craig. And good morning, everyone. First looking at our key operating metrics. New capital raised totaled 31 billion for the quarter. These results are quite strong and encouraging for us as we head into 2024. Credit and liquid strategies made up about two thirds of the capital we raised this quarter. As our business has grown with Global Atlantic as a significant partner. GA in particular had record inflows in the quarter, both overall and specifically from the individual channel. So activity here continues to be very strong. Block activity at GA is also active. As you know the MetLife block closed in the quarter and the Manulife block transactions is expected to close sometime in the first half of 2024. And similar to prior blocks, GA continues to be very capital efficient here, contributing approximately 25% of the equity in both transactions with 75% of the capital coming from IV vehicles and additional CO investors. So 75% from third parties where we can earn management fees and have the opportunity for performance income as well. Over the past year, new capital raised totaled right around 70 billion. And looking post 12/31, we just announced the final closing in Asia Infrastructure 2 at approximately 6.4 billion over 65% larger than the previous fund. Of note, more than half of the capital came from new investors to the Asia Infrastructure platform. With this successful fundraise, we are clearly the largest infrastructure fund in the region, enhancing our Asia positioning more broadly. And as we look out over the next 12 months and into 2025, a number of our flagship funds will be raising capital as well. So we continue to expect an acceleration our fundraising from here. Turning to capital invested, we deployed 16 billion in the quarter and 44 billion for the year. Capital invested was really diversified across private equity, real assets and credit and liquid strategies in the year, as U.S. private equity and core private equity deployment rebounded in the quarter. Of particular note, we made investments in three big private transactions in Q4. And with almost 100 billion of uncalled capital, we continue to be well positioned for the deployment opportunities that are ahead. I wanted to briefly shift now to a reflection on our progress through the course of 2023. Our assets under management now total 553 billion that's up 10% compared to the end of 2022. With sizable capital raised in the past year, fee paying AUM now stands at almost 450 billion. Given our consistent growth in fee paying AUM, management fees increased 14% in 2023, with line of sight of future growth from approximately 40 billion of committed capital that becomes fee paying asset invested or when it enters its investment period. And that's at a weighted average rate of just over 90 basis points. And while realized performance and investment income was more muted in 2023, given the environment, our forward visibility has increased meaningfully year-over-year. Total embedded gains were 12.3 billion at year end that reflects embedded gains on our balance sheet plus gross unrealized carried interest. This was up almost 40% compared to Q4 of 2022. The opportunity for future investing revenue remains robust. And strategically, we made a lot of progress in 2023. As you likely know, we announced 40 initiatives towards the end of November. As an update, on January 2, we closed on our acquisition of the remaining stake in Global Atlantic for approximately 2.6 billion in cash. We believe this acquisition will create more value for policyholders and shareholders and are excited to unlock future potential together. Concurrent with the closing of GA, we have created a new strategic holding segment, which you will see in our Q1 2024 earnings release. Here the segment operating earnings will be driven by cash dividends from our core PE portfolio. We also revised their compensation ratios, which similarly will be reflected in our Q1 financials, delivering more FRE to our shareholders, and driving even more alignment between our compensation model and the outcomes of our clients. Combining these aspects, we will be introducing a new reporting framework that will better highlight our business model. This will include a new financial metric, total operating earnings, which represents our more recurring forms of income. Prior to our next earnings call, we will provide recap financials to help you further understand the various key metrics. As a reminder, we do expect these announcements to be accretive to all of our per share metrics. And together with the competence and current visibility we have, it is what allowed us to increase our 2026 FRE per share target to $4.50 plus cents per share. In 2023, we generate $2.68 per share of FRE. So our expectation is for a lot of growth from here. Given these four announcements paired with the existing growth engines we have, we believe that we are well set up to drive meaningful scale. The opportunities we have across asset management, insurance and strategic holdings are multi-fold. Turning first to our asset management business. There remains a lot of upside here with multiple drivers of growth. We have a lot of younger strategies that are just beginning to scale. We started 25 or so investing businesses through the past decade alone, and many are now starting to inflect. We are an asset classes and geographies with massive end markets, Asia, infrastructure, including climate and credit are all great examples. And as a reminder, we only want to be competing in areas with large addressable markets and where we have conviction that we can be a top three player. We are in the early days of tapping into the private wealth end market. We've had early success in our case theory suite of products with the tremendous amount of opportunity that is still in front of us. With these growth avenues, along with our strong track record count, and the trust that we've built with our clients, we feel that we could double our asset management business from here. And that's without starting anything new. Second, we have a meaningful opportunity in insurance with our partnership with Global Atlantic. Insurance is a very powerful contributor to our business. GA has already created a lot of value, going from 72 billion of assets under management at our announcement of the initial transaction in July of 2020 to over 170 billion of assets under management today, including the pending Manulife block deal. We have a strong opportunity to unlock even more value together in investing, product development, global expansion, private wealth distribution and capital markets. And we are still in the very early stages of our partnership. And finally, number three, strategic holdings, where our opportunity is highly differentiated. This segment leverages all of our people, capabilities and our collaborative culture. As a result, we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on what we believe is a huge addressable market. And that's in addition to the current visibility we already have to drive net dividends in this segment of $300-plus million by 2026 and $600-plus million by 2028. In summary, we are incredibly well positioned as a firm. And we really don't think there are many companies in our industry or others that have the type of visibility that we have for long-term growth. We have a high level of confidence that we can meaningfully grow all 3 of our business segments; asset management, insurance and strategic holdings. With that, we are excited to announce we are going to host an Investor Day in New York on April 10. Given the November strategic announcements and all of the opportunities across our firm, we thought it would be timely for you to hear directly from our senior leaders. We will provide additional detail in the coming months, and hope that you will join our broader team as we discuss our outlook and these opportunities. With that, Scott, Craig and I are happy to take your questions. Good morning, Craig. It's Rob. I'll pick up as it relates to your question on FRE. When you look at some of these big flagships that will be in the market and their predecessor funds, they don't have big step-downs in fee rates as they transition to post-investment period. In addition to that, when you think about the runoff, a lot of the runoff from investment is probably going to come from 2 funds prior and 3 funds prior, those funds close out. But maybe kicking it up a level, if you think about where we are today and where we're going, and I hit this in the prepared remarks, we're at $2.68 of FRE per share. And we've guided 3 years from now, we have an expectation of being at $4.50-plus per share. And so in order to get there, our expectation is we're going to have a lot of management fee growth and the flagships, on a net basis, will be a part of that story. Alex, just as it relates to your question on our 2026 targets. Historically, we haven't included much of anything as it relates to private wealth. As we look forward, given some of the early success that Craig just went through, we do see some contribution coming over the next few years across the number of different investing businesses that we have. And Craig just hit on it at the end, the real opportunity we see as we do long-term financial modeling is really in that post-2026 area, between 2026, '28, as we continue to ramp, that's where you're going to start to see a real inflection and much more material contribution to our P&L. Hey, Bill, all great questions. Thank you. First thing, I guess we look at Q4 and we look at 2023, a very strong performance from the Global Atlantic business. Management team has done a great job, and it's a big reason why we're excited to own 100% of the business. You are right that in Q4, as well as through 2023, that the P&L did have some tailwinds, some variable investment income on a gross basis, about $35 million in Q4. At the beginning of the year, we're at about 20% of our book on a net basis exposed to floating rate. Team did a good job making that adjustment, and so got the benefit of rising rates through much of '23. We ended the year at about 16%. And so as we think about interest rates going down in 2024, we're conscious of that. In Q4, too, specifically, we made a modest adjustment to our comp. So effectively had over-accrued a little bit through the course of Q1, Q2 and Q3. So all things that positively impacted the quarter and all things front of mind as it relates to how we plan for 2024. So as we look at Q4, not necessarily replicable in the near term. But as you said, we have so many levers to be able to grow the GA franchise that our expectation even in a reducing rate environment is that GA is going to continue to perform. As it relates to ROE targets, we continue to think the right level to model the business at that 14% to 15% pretax ROE. The team has done a nice job being able to beat that and beat that by a healthy margin over the past couple of years. But we are going into an environment here that could be lower interest rates and put a little bit of pressure on the P&L. Yes. Great. Thanks for the question. Obviously, we're really pleased with the performance of our capital markets business in Q4 and really for all of 2023. If you look at Q4 specifically, great quarter did benefit maybe from a bit of deferrals, some fees that could have been that ended up in Q4. You're right, as the markets picked up in November and December, that definitely helped as well. But I think the more important point on our capital markets business, really, if you look at 2022 and 2023, through much of both of those years, debt capital markets, equity capital markets were largely shut. And our business still was able to generate, on average, close to $600 million of annual revenue in both of those years. So we're quite proud of the resilience of the business model, the durability of the business model. So it wasn't that long ago in a very healthy market environments, our capital markets business was generating roughly $400 million a year. And as you also point out, we've got a business that can generate really outsized outcomes when the markets come back. It wasn't that long ago, 2021, where our capital markets business in very healthy markets generated $840 million of revenue. Now despite the strong Q4, we're not back to those healthy levels of capital markets deployments. It's still relatively muted across the space. Leverage finance market feels better, but the CLO market is continuing to get healthy. IPO markets, secondary markets, they continue to trend in an upward way, but not back anywhere close to where we were in 2021. Now as we think about pipelines going into 2024, we're quite constructive. As it relates to Q1, still very early in the quarter to give you a read. But our pipeline as we're going into the year just across the firm from deployment, the engagement we're having with our third-party clients, we're expecting a constructive 2024. Hey, Patrick. For quite some time, and we've guided that we feel like we've got a business model that could operate in the low 60s from an FRE margin perspective, which drove the FRE margin beat in the quarter is a combination of a few things: healthy management, fee growth, clearly very strong capital markets quarter for us. And then also some operating expense leverage as well. As we move into 2024, with our already announced shift in how we're going to form our compensation pool at ATR and reducing the compensation load against our fee-related revenue, our expectation is, going forward, we're going to be sustainably able to operate in the mid-60% FRE margin zip code as a firm. And I think I said this last call or the call before, I don't think that mid-60% level is a cap for us given the business model that we're employing. We're trying to scale things that we've already started here. And if we're right and are able to execute on that, we're going to be able to drive revenue growth, fee revenue growth, at a level that's well in excess of expense growth over the next several years. So I do think we should be able to, absent a really draconian type of market environment, operate at that mid-60% FRE margin quarter in, quarter out, with the potential to be able to drive that up over time, assuming we're able to execute as a management team like we think we can. Hi, Brian. It's Rob. I'll start off. So we really like our business model and our approach to market with our capital markets business and I think that's a big reason why there's a lot of upside. And the way we face the market really is with one team that represents our private credit pools of capital, where we're one of the largest providers in the world. Our capital markets expertise, it's that same team when they're facing a client, that can well across our liquid credit business, which is one of the biggest liquid credit businesses in the world. And so we combined 3 very large aspects of our business, and we think that's a real benefit to our clients. And there's not a lot of firms out there that can match what we do from a coordination perspective. I like our ability to go compete for talent in the capital market space. We've been able to recruit and retain, over the past number of years, some really talented people at what they do. And especially as we've expanded in product and geography that's a big part of our story and I can see more of that. You referenced what types of upside we have. I think if you look back to 2021, of course, we had a buoyant capital markets at the time. But KKR does a lot more as a firm today, both from a product perspective, deployment perspective and geographically than we did then. We think we're going to continue to be able to take share with third-party clients. And Scott just touched on the opportunity to coordinate with Global Atlantic and the opportunity that, that can create on the ABF side. And so no specific numbers -- excuse me, on the ABF side of KCM. Those specific numbers of course, as it relates to 2026, but we think this is a growth-oriented business and we think in a really good capital markets environment, we're going to be able to grow off of that $840 million revenue number that we put up in 2021. We have a pretty healthy pipeline as we're coming into 2024 from a monetization factor. But what I'd say is timing is a little bit less certain given some regulatory approvals that are required around some of these monetizations. But taken together, we have somewhere around $500 million of very high visibility, monetization-related revenue. But we currently don't expect all that to hit in Q1. Obviously, still a couple of months to go in the quarter as well. And as usual, at the end of Q1. We'll provide our standard press release that gives you more detail around the monetization related revenue for the quarter. Maybe while we're on the topic of monetization, one other thing that I think is worth calling out given the growth across a number of our businesses and also the strategic announcements that we made in November, including moving our comp down on fees and up on carry, this is just a much smaller part of our business than it used to be at KKR. It's part of the reason why you'll see us introduce this new metric in Q1, total operating earnings. Our expectation going forward is north of 70% of our earnings is going to come from total operating earnings. So of course, monetization-related revenue is going to be a big part of where we're going as a firm, it's just a lot smaller on a relative basis than it used to be. Thanks for the question, Mike. Why don't I start? So over the last few years, our individual business is done, on average, around $10 billion of production. And you're right, you've seen a step-up across the industry, given, I think, higher rates, but I don't think that tells the full story. I think what we're seeing is a real trend towards retirement products. It's probably somewhat agnostic to where interest rates are. And as we think about Global Atlantic and how we're situated specifically in the individual markets, I think there's a lot of share that we continue to take there, getting ramped up on some new platforms, as you suggested. Also historically, Global Atlantic hasn't been as active in the more longer duration fixed annuity market, the 7- to 10-year product. We think there's some market share gains that we can have there. And we do have an expectation that we could take the individual business over time from $10 billion of production to $15 billion to $20 billion of production. Then on the institutional side of our business, there's two components of it. It's not just the block business where we've had a lot of success over the last couple of quarters. Clearly, with MetLife closing in Q4, the Manulife block closing in the first half of the year and a really strong pipeline of opportunity, both domestically and especially internationally. But there's a couple of other aspects of our institutional business that we're really excited about. We've become a real leader in flow reinsurance in the marketplace. Again, that's both domestic and international. And to date, we have very little market share in the pension risk transfer market, where we think the capabilities of our team will really resonate in that market as well. So it's an opportunity for us to take share in what is a large and growing end market. And so when we take it together, it's what gives us the confidence that you would have heard in our November call, really working as one firm to be able to accelerate the growth of the Global Atlantic platform over the next several years. Now an important part of that growth, and I referenced in our prepared remarks, relates to our ability to also be able to access third-party capital. And so our Ivy funds and strategies is a big part of where we're going as an organization. We've got a lot of momentum there. As I mentioned earlier, 75% of the capital required in the two block deals that we've got in flight right now, the MetLife one that just closed and Manulife is going to be funded by third parties, by outside investors. And we think that combination of GA balance sheet capital and third-party investors is really what the optimal structure looks like, especially for the institutional side of our business going forward."

            "name": "Scott Nuttall",
            "content": "Yes. The only thing I would add, Craig, is I think our overall view on fundraising is quite optimistic. I mean, Craig Larson mentioned it, but the $150 billion we raised for 4% of that have come from flagships is a pretty low number speaks to how we've been scaling the diversification of the firm. And as you know, a number of our strategies are kind of in this nice part of the inflection curve Funds II, III, IV, where we can see a significant amount of growth. So you're absolutely right to point out the flagships are coming back at what we think is going to be a really good time. But we also have 22 of our 30 strategies that are coming to market in the next 12 to 18 months, we put in that younger category. Fund I, II, III, open-ended these newer strategies. And you can see it. Asia-Infra, up 66%, tech growth was up 30%. Our impact fund doubled even in the environment that we saw over the last couple of years. Yet, on top of that, private wealth, GA, Asia speaks to the optimism that we see kind of regardless of what's happening with the backdrop. Yes. The only thing I would add, Glenn, is we see a lot written about the direct lending market, rightly so, it's become a very large and important market. I think Craig is right. M&A volumes have been down. Private credits had a larger share of a smaller amount of volume. And so as the banks come back, our expectation is you'll see M&A volume pick up, and there'll still be plenty for the private credit market to participate in. But this ABF business, I don't think is that well understood yet, whereas the direct lending market is probably roughly $1.5 trillion, the ABS market is probably closer to $5 trillion, on its way to $7 trillion. And it is kind of my view, becoming an asset class for institutional investors to understand a little bit. Like 10, 12 years ago, infrastructure and direct lending were very new concepts for most investors. We're having more dialogue on asset-based finance, seeing more investors start to create an allocation or a sub-allocation on private credit. It's obviously incredibly synergistic with what we're building at Global Atlantic, and we're seeing interest from third-party insurers as well. And I do think there's a significant amount of growth ahead for that business. We have 20 or so origination platforms around asset-based finance so far, and I'd expect that number to continue to go up. I would guess in April when we're together for the Investor Day, we'll go deeper on that topic. Yes. The only thing I would add, Fin, is that you're right to ask about the KCM opportunity. As a reminder, when we spoke at the end of November, we talked about all the different positive opportunities we had to unlock more value with GA, including across the rest of the firm from an investing standpoint, creating new product, private wealth distribution, Ivy, which is our third-party fund strategy, and then global in particular, Asia. And as part of that list, we did talk about the capital markets opportunity and we do think that, that can be quite meaningful for us. So think of it as, in effect using the model we've already built with KCM, but more across this ABF platform. We really haven't gotten to that yet. And when we had 37% ownership from third parties, it was a little bit more challenged to get after that. We think over time, that could be a significant opportunity, call it, in the hundreds of millions of dollars if we can get that right. It's going to take time. We'll keep you posted on it, but we do think that is the next big legged growth across all things structured finance, structured credit, asset-based finance for KCM. Steven, it's Scott. To your question about read across. I don't think it's a stretch to say that it does inform our broader perspective. Much of the funds that you mentioned were raised at a period of time where the capital markets were nearly as robust. And what we've seen is that investors are re-upping the funds where they've seen strong performance. Also, the color from the dialogue we're having is, I think, even more mature programs out there understand these are going to be very good vintage years and don't want to miss out. I think in the past, if you go back to the financial crisis, there are some institutions that pulled back and then had regret. And so I think there's an understanding of that in the market. And that's on the more mature programs, which I would say the minority of the people that we talk to. If you think about how the industry has expanded across sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, family offices, obviously, we talked about the private wealth channel, we're optimistic. Some part are based on those discussions and in large part based on the great work our team has been doing in terms of keeping the investment performance very strong. Brian, it's Scott. Look, I think we'll go deeper on this in April when we're together. But the way we think about it, if you look back 5 years, it's really not very representative of what KCM is today and where it's going to be, to your point. So we've been globalizing the business across more of what KKR is doing around the world. We've been penetrating more of our own strategies and efforts. So for example, if you go back several years, infrastructure wasn't a very big part of the Capital Markets business, now it's a very large part of that business. And that informs our perspective on the ABF opportunity, candidly, the real estate opportunity over time. And then on top of that, our portfolio is larger. So there's more refinancing. There's more exits to do in the public markets. And as our deployment goes up in our experience and our dry powder goes up, so do our capital markets opportunities. Because we can speak for larger transactions, we need to bring partners alongside, there's just more for us to do. So all of that speaks to the growth opportunity, which is why I think you're seeing this baseline, even in a pretty anemic capital market overall, continue to increase. And I think you'll continue to see that into the future as we execute on all of those. Hey, Mike. It's Scott. Just I think in terms of your question about performance in the quarter, it was broad-based. There's nothing that we use to specifically. The portfolio has been assembled incredibly thoughtfully, as Craig mentioned, and is performing very nicely. And as expected, ahead of expectations. In terms of your question about investor demand where it's shifting from, I mean, for the most part, we've seen people creating allocation to infrastructure over the last several years. It hasn't really been a shift out of other parts of alternatives to some extent, where we've seen alternative allocations to increase, it's to be able to accommodate an infrastructure allocation. And I think a lot of that is investors have focused on the fact you've got a real asset that is mission critical, has an attractive yield. And the way we do it is to have to have that contractual yield and it is inflation protected, so it's also viewed as an inflation hedge. And I think as people have done the work on the space, you've started to see more and more dollars flow into it. So largely speaking, and none of these comments are universal, but largely speaking, it's been an and as opposed to an or. And I think on Asia, Craig hit it. I mean our Asia Infra business has gone from a standing start to $10 billion of AUM in 4 years. We have a great team on the ground. They're leveraging our Pan-Asia presence across our 9 offices. And as you know, we run the firm as one firm, so everybody helps each other. I think that's really allowed us to scale very rapidly in that market. There's a significant amount of capital required to develop infrastructure all across Asia in those themes that Craig just walked you through. And candidly, on the margin, there's less competition in Asia, because fewer firms have built the platform that we've built. So I think large opportunity, fewer competitors, firm well integrated."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to KKR's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following management's prepared remarks, the conference will be opened for questions [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder this conference is being recorded. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.\nCraig Larson: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2023 earnings call. This morning, as usual, I'm joined by Rob Lewin, our Chief Financial Officer; and Scott Nuttall, our co-Chief Executive Officer. We'd like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, which is available on the Investor Center section at kkr.com. And as a reminder, we report our segment numbers on an adjusted share basis. This call will contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to our earnings release as well as our SEC filings for cautionary factors about these statements. So to begin, I'm going to walk through the quarter's financial results before Rob discusses our key operating metrics.  Turning to our results for the quarter, we're pleased to be reporting fee-related earnings per share of $0.63, and after tax distributable earnings of $0.88 per share. Management fees in the quarter came in at $759 million. This was up 13%, compared to Q3 of 2022, and up 16% over the trailing 12 months. Real assets management fees have been a bright spot for us, increasing 6% compared to last quarter, and 25% over the last 12 months, driven by growth across several infrastructure and real estate strategies.  Net transaction and monitoring fees were $124 million in the quarter, $100 million of which came from our capital markets business. Fee-related compensation was right at the midpoint of our guided range at 22.5% of fee-related revenues. Other operating expenses were $142 million. This expense figure is actually a little lower compared to both last quarter as well as Q3 of 2022. Here you're really seeing us continue to invest for growth, while maintaining our discipline at the same time.  So putting this together, fee-related earnings came in at $558 million or the $0.63 per share figure I mentioned a moment ago. In Q3, our FRE margin was 61.7%. We've talked consistently about our FRE margin being in this low-60s areas, and we've delivered on this. This is the 12th consecutive quarter where that margin has been at or above the 60% level. And we continue to feel very good about this migrating up from here into the mid-60s.  Realized performance income was $329 million and realized investment income generated $231 million. Both realized performance and investment income together were up over 2x from last quarter as exit activity increased in both our private equity as well as our U.S. real estate businesses. Realized performance investment income compensation ratios were again both right at the midpoint in the quarter. So in total, our asset management operating earnings were $869 million.  Global Atlantic again had a very strong quarter with our insurance segment generating $210 million of pre-tax earnings. To spend a moment on GA, on the institutional front. GA's blocked reinsurance transaction with MetLife remains on track to close in Q4 2023. We disclosed this transaction on last quarter's call. We expect our AUM to increase by approximately $13 billion upon closing and looking farther ahead GA's pipeline and level of dialogue on future block activity remains healthy. And in terms of GA's individual business, GA experienced an increase in activity in Q3. So overall business momentum within this channel continues to feel very good as well.  Global Atlantic AUM pro forma for the MetLife block now totals $158 million. This is up from $72 billion or over two times since the announcement of our acquisition in July of 2020. In our view, this really demonstrates the strength of GA franchise, the power of the KKR, GA partnership, as well as the high level of execution we've seen since the onset. So back to our P&L, in aggregate after tax distributable earnings totaled $780 million, or $0.88 per share.  Next, just turning to page 7 of our earnings release, you see investment performance summarized for the quarter as well as the trailing 12-month periods. Looking at the figures on the page for the third quarter, our performance metrics broadly compare very favorably relative to public indices, which were mixed in the quarter. The traditional private equity portfolio was up 5% in the quarter, and over the 12 months is up 12%. And looking to add our inception to-date blended IRR for our most recent flagship funds, that figure continues to stay strong at 23%.  In real assets, the real estate portfolio was up 1% for the quarter and down 9% over the last 12 months. Importantly, underlying NOI growth has remained strong across our portfolios. So the decline you see over the trailing 12 months reflects the change in interest rates as well as cap rate assumptions. Infrastructure was up 3% in the quarter and is up 14% over the last 12 months, as this asset class has continued to be resilient for us.  In credit, the leveraged and alternative composites were both up 3% in the quarter, and 14% and 9%, respectively over the last 12 months. And turning for a moment to page 25, our core private equity portfolio has performed. Today, we're the largest manager of core PE capital with $35 billion of AUM, which includes third party capital alongside of our balance sheet. And as you can see on the page, the fair value of investments we've made off the balance sheet at 9/30 was $6.5 billion.  As a reminder, core PE is a long duration investment strategy. We expect to hold these investments for 10 to 15 plus years. These investments generally have lower leverage over their hold periods compared to traditional PE and are more cash generative. The portfolio this at this point is global, spans a wide range of industries. So we've continued to see strong growth in the portfolio that in our view is more stable and less cyclical in nature, which has really helped during periods of dislocation, such as the early stages of COVID, as well as over the last 12 to 18 months.  We got into this asset class, and have really treated it as a strategic growth avenue for us since we started. Because it's an area where we firmly believe that our business model, including our industry depth, geographic breadth, collaborative culture, and ability to drive business building all set us up very well to be the best global player in the asset class. We're big believers in the earnings power this strategy can create, and we continue to think about how to unlock that potential.  And with that summary, I'll turn the call over to Rob.\nRobert Lewin: Thanks a lot, Craig. I thought it'd be helpful this morning to go through what we are experiencing across the firm day-to-day. Despite what has been a dynamic operating environment, we find ourselves with a significant amount of momentum, especially across our key strategic growth areas. We are seeing a noticeable uptick in our pipelines around fundraising, deployment and monetizations. And I'll take you through each today.  Turning first to fundraising. This quarter, we raised $14 billion, bringing the past 12 months to $54 billion. While the fundraising environment has been tough, we feel as though we're positioned very differently than a number of our peers. None of the $54 billion that we have raised over the LTM period has come from our flagship strategies, which are due to begin fundraising in the next year or so.  Global Atlantic continues to have a lot of success in this rate environment and remains incredibly well positioned. Across our private wealth strategies, while still early, our momentum is strong. And our conviction around the size of the addressable market, and our ability to take share continue to grow. And in the framework of KKR this is really all upside for us from here. Finally, many of our younger strategies continue to scale.  Looking at the quarter in a bit more detail, first our K series suite of products. As a reminder, these primarily serve the private wealth and market globally, providing individuals with access to alternative investments that have traditionally have not been accessible to non institutional clients. We now have vehicles for all four of our major asset classes; private equity, infrastructure, real estate and credit. And we continue to be added to more private wealth platforms as these vehicles ramp. Two years ago, we were on approximately 10 platforms. And today that number is closer to 40 across the suite of products that we manage, with more to come.  Looking at our private equity and infra wealth product specifically, they are now raising approximately $500 million a month. So really strong start for us, especially relative to our expectations, only reinforcing our confidence in the scale and impact of the long term opportunity here. Second, we raised $1 billion of capital in credit and liquid strategies in the quarter, and we were particularly active in private credit. As a reminder, private credit is comprised of our direct lending, and our asset-based finance businesses where AUM has scaled significantly.  Today, in total, private credit AUM is $83 billion. That's up roughly three times from $25 billion just three years ago. In direct lending, where we have $36 billion of assets under management, you're seeing us raise capital in a variety of forms. In the quarter, we raised capital for our U.S. focused strategy in traditional fund format. And through evergreen structures in both the U.S. as well as in Europe. We're seeing more interest in these perpetual vehicles, as the asset classes become more mature, and a more permanent part of institutions' allocations.  And we're at the outset of fundraising for our private VDC and continue to raise capital in our separately managed accounts. In asset-based finance, we're continuing to build on our leadership position here. ABF is now close to $50 billion of AUM as of 9/30. We are raising capital in a variety of forms, including closed end and open ended fund structures, in both our high grade and opportunistic ABS strategies. There'll be more to come here in future quarters, as interest in both direct lending and ABF remains very high. This all really builds on the back of strong performance within our leverage credit business, with many of our investment strategies ranking at the top of their respective peer categories.  As an example, our investment returns in both our opportunistic leverage credit strategy, and our multi-asset credit strategy rank in the top one percentile against their peer universes since their inception in 2008.  And the third area on fundraising I wanted to address for some of the more recent announcements that happened post 9/30. We held the final close in Next Generation Technology 3 at approximately $3 billion. That represents an over 30% increase to its predecessor fund. Global Impact Fund 2 is our growth equity platform, investing behind proven companies that delivers scalable commercial solutions to global problems, also held its final close post-quarter end, totaling $2.8 billion, which is over twice the size of its predecessor fund. And Asia Infrastructure 2, we have already raised $6.1 billion of capital here, making it the largest dedicated infra fund in the region, and up from the $3.8 billion predecessor fund. And we have not yet held the final close.  This is another sizable platform that we have added to our infrastructure franchise, and I think further cements our leadership position in Asia more broadly. These three funds in aggregate have increased from $7 billion across their prior vintages to approximately $12 billion of total capital today. This is all very high margin AUM for us, and in strategies that are still relatively young for KKR.  As we look to 2024 and 2025, we expect fundraising at KKR will accelerate relative to the last 12 months. We have 30 plus strategies in or coming to market, including a number of flagships such as global infrastructure, America's Private Equity and Asia Private Equity, with the opportunity for continued scaling in our private wealth products alongside the traditional fund format.  We are also launching a new climate investing strategy. We have recruited a really talented and experienced team, which is now fully integrated into a broader infrastructure platform, giving us confidence that we can become a real leader and a skilled player in the space.  Moving next to deployment, we continue to be very constructive on risk reward here across a number of our asset classes. We have about $100 billion of dry powder available to deploy. And we've seen an uptick in announced investment activity since June. However, only a small portion of that closed in the 90 days ended September 30. We do expect an increase in investment activity in Q4, given our pipelines here. This dynamic should help the invested capital figures in addition to our capital markets revenues in Q4.  And finally our monetization activity has continued to pick up. In the quarter our realized performance and investment income totaled $560 million. Activity in the quarter came from a wide variety of strategies and products. And as we look into the fourth quarter, standing here today, we currently have visibility on $400-plus million of monetization related revenue.  One of the realizations in Q4 is from our investment in KOKUSAI ELECTRIC. KOKUSAI is a Japan-based manufacturer of semiconductor production equipment. We invested in the business back in December of 2017 through our Asia private equity platform. It is one of the three carve-out transactions where we've collaborated with the Hitachi Group. You've heard us talk about Japanese carve-outs as a key investment team, a number of times on these calls. Given our operational skills together with our relationships in the region, we feel particularly well positioned to pursue these investments. This is just the latest example for us.  At the end of October, KOKUSAI was listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in the largest IPO in Japan since 2018, and the largest ever private equity backed IDM. The stock has performed well since pricing, trading up approximately 35%. And based on last week's closing price, our total investment is now marked at over 15 times multiple money on a gross basis. We continue to own 40% of the company. In addition to the positive outcome for our Asia private equity investors, the IPO also helps our branding across everything that we do in Japan, and likely as a result also creates more opportunity as we distribute K series products in this market.  Turning to the firm as a whole, we still have $11-plus billion of embedded gains between our investments and carried interest. So the future around monetization-related revenue remains robust. This is compared to $9 billion of embedded gains at the beginning of the year. So we're up roughly 25% in and what has been a volatile environment, while at the same time having monetized the healthy amount of that embedded gain since 12/31.  As you can hear, we continue to be really excited as a management team about our growth and our evolution. We've been executing on our plan of building a very high growth and high margin asset management business, which benefits from, and is accelerated by what we are doing across insurance and core private equity.  With that Scott, Craig and I are happy to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And the first question is can the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question?\nCraig Siegenthaler: Hey, good morning, Scott, Rob. I hope everyone's doing well. \nScott Nuttall: Good morning, Craig. \nCraig Siegenthaler: So two weeks ago, the press was reporting that at KKR entered into a relationship with two of the mega online brokers to sell some of your retail vehicles. Now this approach is different than the wirehouses, which are mainly selling your products like KREST, to high net worth investors. And so I believe this is mainly focused on the massive flow, and so I was wondering if you could provide an update on one, this strategy and what you're looking to accomplish.\nScott Nuttall: Craig, you want to kick off? \nCraig Larson : Sure. Hey, Craig. Why don't I start off? I think the main takeaway from what you're mentioning is the focus we have on broadening the funnel at the top end. And we're going to be focused on the wirehouses. Here in the U.S., we're going to be focused on independent broker dealers. We're going to be focused on broad private wealth internationally. And the products that we've created are ones that are going to be designed and tailored for those markets, different markets geographically, and again, with a focus on broadening the funnel as much as we can.  One of the topics we've been particularly focused on was making sure that we could appeal not only to the qualified purchaser market but the accredited investor market. Again, accredited investor market is eight or nine times the size of the qualified purchaser market. So again, that's just one example of a focus for us as is again, just one wanting to broaden that funnel at the top end as much as we can.\nRobert Lewin : Yeah the only thing I'd add Craig, I think it's just part of the strategy. Our approach is really quite broad based. It's global. It's multi-channel all around the world. So what got picked up was just one element of that in the U.S.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi, thanks very much. Let's focus on, I guess GA a little bit. I heard your comments about potential for more blocks ahead. In the quarter the cost of insurance went up a little bit more than the net investment income. I'm curious on your thoughts on how a higher for longer environment A, plays into that dynamic and B, plays into your distribution mix. And whether or not you saw much impact from the DOL rules that have been floated out there? Thanks very much.\nScott Nuttall: Yeah, Glenn, thanks a lot for the question. I take a step back, and we're seeing a lot of momentum across really, all aspects of GA right now. Year-over-year bases are operating and comes up close to 30% in the business. We're seeing success distributing through the individual channel, through the institutional channel, while of course, we've seen cost of insurance tick up over the past 12 months, given where crediting rates are and products I think you've also seen a commensurate step up in net investment income as well.  And if you look quarter-over-quarter, our net investment income margin ticked up a little bit north of where cost of insurance was. And so net-net we came in about 15 basis points higher on return on asset basis in GA.  So we're feeling like the team is executing across all aspects of their business right now. You mentioned the DOL rules. I'm glad you brought that up. A punch line from our perspective is based on the draft regs that we have seen. We don't expect this to have a material impact on our business going forward. In many ways, the draft regs are similar to what came out in 2016. So I think the industry is well prepared for that, GA is well prepared for that. 90%-plus of our distribution today is through the bank and broker dealer channel. We feel to this channel that's most prepared to be able to deal with wherever the regulations come out.  But I think it's important to note that fundamentally we support what the regulator here is trying to accomplish. They want to make sure that consumers get the value they're paying for when they buy an investment product. And I think that's good for everybody in the space. So punch line, no material issues. And we continue to work very closely with the GA team to continue the momentum there.\nOperator: Next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Pleased proceed with your question.\nSteven Chubak: Hi, good morning, Scott. Good morning, Rob. \nScott Nuttall: Good morning. \nRobert Lewin : Good morning. \nSteven Chubak: So wanted to start off with a question on capital markets where activity continues to be subdued. But as we think about what the business could generate in a more normalized environment, the growth in your PE real asset AUM versus the average level in '19, so pre COVID baseline suggests normalized capital markets fees could be about 160% higher than 2019 levels. So closer to about a $1.2 billion fee bogey. And I was hoping you could frame what your view is on normalized capital markets activity, what that might look like, and is the increase in AUM the right lens for assessing the potential upside here? \nRobert Lewin : Great, thanks a lot for the question. So a couple things on our capital markets business, and maybe I'll just start with this year and then frame how we think about the go forward. So as you look at really 2022 and 2023, we've been a really tough operating environment for much of that period of time. IPO markets have been largely shut, secondary markets have been close to shut. The leveraged finance market has been up and down. But certainly more down than up. And we're really proud of how that business has protected revenue in that down market. If you look, we were mid-$500 million (phon) in terms of revenue last year, while year-to-date, we're averaging about $110 million $120 million a quarter in that range.  We do feel good about where our pipeline suggests our revenue should be in Q4. And so feel like the team has done a great job being able to protect revenue in a down market. Now. Mike, I think you raised an important question around more normalized environment. If you look at 2021, we generated $840 million of revenue in our capital markets business. And as you suggest, we're doing more things today as a firm than we did in 2021. And I think we've got an opportunity to greater share with a third party component of our capital markets franchise. So we look at a more normalized environment.  We feel like that plus or minus $200 million a quarter is very achievable but to us that's not the top end. We're building out a platform that we think over time can have real growth off that number.  In terms of forward-looking indicators. AUM could be one, but I think it's really the scale and breadth of what we're doing across the firm or maybe more the breadth of what we're doing across the firm, as opposed to necessarily the scale. It's our ability to take share in the third party part of our business where we think we've got some real competitive differentiators versus the marketplace. I think those are more what the indicators are to watch for growth than necessarily what the AUM is for the firm. But thanks for the question.  It's a part of our business that we feel really good about right now, the experience of the past 21 months relative to what it could have been or what it would have been in past cycles that really speaks to what our team has built over the past 10 plus years.\nScott Nuttall: Yeah, thanks for the question, Stephen. There's no doubt the baseline for the capital markets business has gone up materially over the last few years. I think AUM is one metric you could look to. You could also look to deployment. And frankly, you could also to some extent look to monetization, as the capital markets business often participates in particularly our public market exits. So I'd probably look at those few things. As Rob said in the prepared remarks, we're seeing activity pick up in the fourth quarter across those areas. So we'd expect that to flow through to the capital markets business as well.\nOperator: Our next question's from the line of Alex Borstein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nAlexander Blostein: Hey, good morning, everybody. Thanks for the question as well. I was hoping we could talk for a couple of minutes around the interplay between your deployment comments in the coming quarter and the quarters ahead. And the flagship fundraising cycle, especially as it relates to some of the bigger funds like the Global Infra in North America and Asia. So the North American and Asia, particular still seems to have lots of dry powder. So maybe help us frame what kind of deployment outlook you're seeing for those strategies, and how that informs your view on when you can come back to the market with the next impetus? Thanks,\nCraig Larson: Hey, Alex. It's Craig, thanks for the question. So a couple of thoughts here. First, when you look at the fun table in the back of our press release, the numbers you see on an invested basis will, if anything, be understated, as if we have dollars that are committed to an investment, those dollars actually won't show up in that table until those dollars are actually called and invested. So I think as you look at where we are in terms of the status of those funds, fraught [ph] and invested in committed basis, we're actually farther along than you might think that just by looking at those -- at that table on a face value.  And in terms of broad timing, nothing to announce specifically here. But we do expect over '24 and '25, that we will be active in both of those and that activity will supplement infrastructure for us, which is a front burner topic, as well as climate and on those last few we expect we'll be able to give some updates on those in the first half of next year. So again, just feels like our fundraising team is going to continue to be very active.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Please proceed with your question. \nPatrick Davitt: Hey, good morning, everyone. So I appreciate the strong trends at Global Atlantic you highlighted. But the May deck they put out suggested some fairly significant offsetting outflows there. So understanding you have $13 billion coming in, in 4Q But could you also give a little more specifics on how the regular way retail flows versus lapses and other outflow items have been tracking at Global Atlantic? Thank you. \nRobert Lewin : Yes, Patrick. Thanks. Thanks a lot for the question. As we look forward in our business, really, the way I think about it, is in regular way organic part of our business, in the individual side, as we look at '24 that could be in that $10 billion to $15 billion range of organic flows. The institutional part of our business, again, more in that organic flow basis, probably in that plus or minus $10 billion range. And the outflows call it in the mid-teens. And so on a net basis, organically, we feel like GA should have, call it $5 billion to $10 billion of organic growth next year. Now you layer on top of that block activity as an example of the MetLife Block, which is all incremental and upside to that.  As we look at our pipeline on the block side, it feels as good today, as it has since we started our ownership of Global Atlantic. We're seeing some very specific deals out there where we can really partner with close relationships and be able to come up with win-win solutions for both us and our clients and partners in that space.  And so that's really how I would think about Global Atlantic and its ability to grow over the coming 12 months, both organically and then on the block side. We continue to see real momentum there, offset, of course, as you noted, by regular way withdrawals.\nScott Nuttall: Yes. The only thing I would add Patrick, because I wouldn't get too focused on any shorter period of time, since the deal was announced in 2020 GA's assets have gone from $72 billion to now pro forma for MetLife, $158 billion. So we've meaningfully exceeded all of our expectations in terms of net growth and we expect to see very consistent trends going forward.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Brian McKenna with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Mckenna: Great, thanks. So you've recently announced a partnership with a life science investment firm. So could you talk about this investment a little bit, what the broader opportunity is within life sciences, how this partnership tellers growth in this part of the market? And then how it plays into the longer-term healthcare strategy at KKR?\nRobert Lewin : Yes. Thanks for the question, Brian. I'll start. And so I think as you know, we've got a $4 plus billion healthcare growth strategy at the firm. We've got a big private equity focused on the healthcare space and our investment in Katalio [ph], which is really a leading life science investment firm at the more earlier stage, is a real partnership that we think can help make their business better, and then also make our business better from an origination perspective. And we think we'll get a very nice return on our capital based on their business growth and the ability to help originate flow for both our healthcare growth strategy as well as potentially our private equity strategy, maybe strategies across our credit business, a big reason why we did that transaction.\nScott Nuttall: Yes. The only thing I would add, Brian is, we started our health care growth strategy a handful of years ago. That has exceeded our expectations to date. There's really two areas where we've been focused on leading from the standpoint of just newer business creation more recently. One is climate, which the guys mentioned, and the other is this life sciences space where we think there could be a meaningful opportunity for us over time. Katalio and that partnership is just part of that effort.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Ben Budish with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nBenjamin Budish: Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking the question. I want to ask about Global Atlantic. There was some press earlier, I think, last month about the possibility that KKR might have to buy back the ownership stakes from some of the old Goldman Sachs Asset Management clients. I was wondering if you could speak to that. Is there any truth to it, and if not, could you at least remind us of how that arrangement works and what we should think about or expect going forward? Thank you.\nRobert Lewin : Yes. Thanks for asking that question. I'm glad you asked it because I know when that article came out, Craig Larson and his team got a lot of inbounds and questions. And since the shareholder agreement is not public, there is only so much color that him and his team are able to provide. To be very clear, KKR has got no contractual obligation to buy out the minority shareholders at Global Atlantic. What we do have is an obligation in the future to the extent that they want to seek liquidity to help them in that process, which of course, we'd be happy to do.  So no obligation on our part in any way. But of course, that option remains open to us in the future as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Bedell: Great, thanks. Good morning, folks. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just to focus on the FRE margin comment. I think, Craig, you started off with that in your prepared remarks, the migration up to the mid-60s from the low 60s. Can you just talk a little bit about the timing around that? And is it mostly a scale-based improvement? And so therefore, does that require the flagship fundraising cycles to come in? And then I guess, just strategically, how you think about that in terms of -- versus investing in growth initiatives? And I think the big one I'm thinking about is the wealth distribution, particularly if you're having good traction there. Is that something that you're sort of happy to spend into to grow that, and maybe delay the improvements in the mid-60s?\nRobert Lewin : Yes. Brian, thanks for the question. I'll start. So I think we can do both is the short answer. I think we can invest into the firm for growth like we've been doing and expand our margins. No timetable as at least today to when we think we can achieve that mid-60 sustainable FRE margin. But I can tell you sitting here today, I have more confidence than I ever have in our ability to be able to achieve that over time.  I also -- I don't think that's the cap for us. As we look at the business that we're building across our asset management platform, I think there's opportunity over the long term to expand margins north of that mid-60% level. But one step at a time. We've got, again, a lot of conviction that we're going to be able to achieve that on a more sustainable basis, and we'll give you updates, of course, on our progress.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Mike Brown with KBW. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Brown : Great, I want to ask on the 2026 targets. Clearly, the growth from your next flagship fund raising campaign and the margin comments you just made Rob will put you on a visible path to that 2026 FRE target, but can you maybe help me unpack the key drivers to the doubling of DE.  So I assume -- if I assume GA can maybe grow at like a low teens growth rate and maybe correct me if I'm wrong, but if I use that assumption and then I assume --it seems to imply, I guess, a meaningful ramp in the performance fees. Is that the right way to think about the building blocks? And then what kind of gives you confidence that you'll get to that performance fee contribution piece since that's somewhat out of your control? Thank you.\nRobert Lewin : Great. Thanks for the question, Mike. So I think it's really multiple different factors. I think it's FRE growth, as you stated, and we can unpack that a little bit. And we definitely see further opportunities to grow and expand what we're doing with Global Atlantic to increase our earnings contribution from there. And then it's our $11 billion plus of embedded gains that sit on our balance sheet today. And that gives us a great deal of comfort in terms of our forward-looking earnings power. So it's a combination of those three things working together that ultimately gives us confidence in our numbers. And we said it last call, and I'll reiterate this call, we feel more comfortable today than we did when we initiated that guidance, I think, two years ago now in our ability to achieve our numbers. And I think that's saying quite a bit because if you think about what's happened at least in our space since we initiated that guidance two years ago, we've had very tough overall operating conditions. Tough fundraising market, tough overall monetization, volatile marks across the board, but we're sitting here now telling you two years in that we feel, even in spite of that, more confident than ever in our ability to achieve our targets.\nScott Nuttall: Yes. Let me pick up, Mike and I appreciate you asking the question about '26. Inside the firm, it just feels really optimistic, candidly. We've got a lot of different ways to grow. As Rob and Craig mentioned, we've been raising a lot of capital, but our flagship fundraises have not been in those numbers and those are coming. We have a lot of younger and scaling strategies, and I'm not sure it's fully appreciated just how young the firm is. But if you look at the last 12 months, nearly 80% of the money we've raised has been from strategies less than five years old. If you look at the next 12 to 18 months, there's roughly 30 different strategies we will be in the market with, 22 of those are Fund 1, 2 or 3 or equivalent. So we're quite young, and we've been able to scale through the cycle. And as we gain more traction and find our way at that inflection part of the curve, we see a lot of upside as these businesses start to get closer to top three in everything we're doing. Private Wealth is newer for us. So we have a lot of upside ahead of us. GA, we talked about. Asia has significant growth opportunities as well. So the reason you're hearing the optimism is probably 5 to 10 years ago, we were talking about all these businesses that we started that would take 10 plus years to get to scale. And a lot of that is just starting to happen in this period of time, which is why despite the operating environment, we're still quite optimistic.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Cyprys: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask on private credit with the new bank capital rules. Just curious how you see that opportunity set, potentially unfolding. Any particular areas you view as most attractive coming out of the banks versus less attractive for KKR? And are there any steps you guys need to take at this point in order to capture that? Any gaps you need to fill in? And then just a housekeeping question for Rob, just on the deployment and realizations off the balance sheet in the quarter. Thank you.\nRobert Lewin : Why don't I start with the deployment and realization and Craig will take up on some of the private credit related questions. So Mike this quarter, we're roughly $300 million of deployment and $300 million monetization of our balance sheet. Say, on the deployment side, it's pretty broad-based across our platform on the monetization side, maybe a little bit heavier weighting towards real assets.\nCraig Larson : And Mike, it's Craig. Just in terms of on the bank topic. Look, I think our team remains very active as it relates to finding opportunities with the banks. You would have seen a press release in Q3 focused on the acquisition of a portfolio from a regional bank through our ABF platform, and that activity will continue. When you take a step back and look at our platform, excuse me, we're over $80 billion of private credit AUM, $47 million in asset based finance and $36 million in direct lending. And if you think of asset-based finance for a moment, it's a $5 trillion market opportunity, and there are real secular tailwinds at play here. And in our view, against this really enormous opportunity, you've got a lack of scale capital. At the same time, as you know, many traditional providers are even further retrenching. So it's an area that I think we would highlight we just think we're really well positioned to continue to drive real long-term growth here.\nScott Nuttall: Yes. Mike, and you asked if there's any gaps. There's nothing that I would point to in terms of a gap. We've got a big organic build opportunity here.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Kotowski: Yes. Good morning. I guess I wonder if you could spend a minute or two talking about your approach to the real estate businesses, both in the United States and globally. I mean your latest flagship fund in the United States has been mostly invested already. And on the one hand, I guess it just doesn't feel like we are anywhere near the end of the cycle in office or in the -- concerns about the impact of rising rates. But on the other hand, every commercial bank in the world is trying to reduce their exposure to real estate.  So this is usually the kind of environment where private equity sponsors can thrive. So what's your general view on real estate? Is it still time to be cautious and defensive or is this the time to lean in?\nCraig Larson : Yes. Why don't I start with the platform overall, and then I'm sure Scott will add on as it relates to opportunities and the tone of the team and the environment. Just to level set, we're $65 billion of AUM today with a very good balance between real estate equity and real estate credit. So we have round numbers, $30 billion in equity, $35 billion in credit. We have opportunistic strategies across the U.S., Europe, Asia. In the U.S., we have a core plus vehicle that's now expanded into Europe. We have half dozen or so credit vehicles. So it's a global business across multiple strategies, fully integrated that can create solutions up and down the capital structure across equity and debt in the U.S., Europe and Asia. And that's how we're situated against the opportunity. Now your point on the current environment is one that's really interesting because we think in the go forward looking over the coming 12, 24 months, we're very constructive on those opportunities. I think, as it relates to a couple of those. I think, first, look there is a wave of maturities and capital needs that are coming, and this is not U.S. office.  These are assets that are in very strong performing sectors. I think excellent assets but excellent assets with very levered capital structures. And this is going to take some time to work through, but this is an example of an opportunity that we're very actively talking about with our limited partners as we see and think through opportunities ahead in terms of our opportunistic pools of capital.  And the second I'd mention again would be real estate credit. So the dislocations that in our view, are creating really interesting opportunities. You have high base rates, spreads have widened meaningfully for new credit originations, terms have tightened. And so today's CRE loans have lower LTVs, better interest coverage, higher interest rates with more lender-friendly covenant and structures. So if you were to look back two plus years ago, at those subordinated tranches, pricing would have moved up from the low to single mid digits two years ago to low double digits today. And again, in our view, taking less risk with more LCVs and better terms. So I think as we think of how we're situated, we're very constructive and think we're in a position to be forward-leaning. I'll let you pick it up from there.\nScott Nuttall: Sure. Thanks for the question, Chris. Look we started our real estate platform, probably 10 to 12 years ago, somewhere in there, call it, 2011, '12, Chris. And we've been building that business over a period of time where obviously, rates were dropping. We are seeing a significant move in cap rates in one direction. I think our team has been incredibly thoughtful about how they built the business. It's been very thematically focused, perhaps our most thematic investing business across the firm. As a result, very careful about where they were deploying capital as a result. We don't really have much U.S. office exposure. That's just one example. But we've been building across opportunistic equity, to your point about the fund table, core plus real estate, and we have a very large real estate credit business. So in terms of kind of where we stand, we're continuing to raise capital. I think the real estate credit opportunity is showing up, to Craig's point, before the opportunity gets really interesting. But we think that will be even more interesting with time. And so we are continuing to raise capital, deploying selectively all around the world and getting ready for things to get even more attractive as we head into the next several quarters. And one of the ways we've been able to grow this business is through Global Atlantic, which we expect to continue to be the case. So we're really optimistic about what this business can be. And I think you're right. It's periods of time like this where you can grow significantly especially if we continue to see valuations under pressure.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Brian McKenna with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Mckenna: Thanks for the follow-up. Just two quick items for Rob, interest income and dividend line kicked up in the quarter. What drove this? And is the $120 million quarterly run rate level a good starting point moving forward? And how the $400 million plus of monetization slated for the fourth quarter how much of that is tied to Marshall Wace?\nRobert Lewin : Yes. Great. Thanks for the question. Some of the interest in dividends is just honestly, a function of rates coming up and where beneficiaries at on our cash balances and some of our floating rate exposure on the balance sheet. As it relates to $400-plus million, I would say, call it, 80% of that is more carried interest and 20% of that would be balance sheet income and our incentive fee from Marshall Wace in the quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. And I'll turn the floor back to Craig Larson for closing remarks.\nCraig Larson : Rob, first, thank you for your help. Thank you, everybody for your interest in KKR. We know this is a very busy earnings period for everybody. If you have any additional questions, please follow-up with us directly. Otherwise, we'll speak with everybody in 90 days. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Scott Nuttall",
            "content": "Good morning, Craig. Craig, you want to kick off? Yeah, Glenn, thanks a lot for the question. I take a step back, and we're seeing a lot of momentum across really, all aspects of GA right now. Year-over-year bases are operating and comes up close to 30% in the business. We're seeing success distributing through the individual channel, through the institutional channel, while of course, we've seen cost of insurance tick up over the past 12 months, given where crediting rates are and products I think you've also seen a commensurate step up in net investment income as well.  And if you look quarter-over-quarter, our net investment income margin ticked up a little bit north of where cost of insurance was. And so net-net we came in about 15 basis points higher on return on asset basis in GA.  So we're feeling like the team is executing across all aspects of their business right now. You mentioned the DOL rules. I'm glad you brought that up. A punch line from our perspective is based on the draft regs that we have seen. We don't expect this to have a material impact on our business going forward. In many ways, the draft regs are similar to what came out in 2016. So I think the industry is well prepared for that, GA is well prepared for that. 90%-plus of our distribution today is through the bank and broker dealer channel. We feel to this channel that's most prepared to be able to deal with wherever the regulations come out.  But I think it's important to note that fundamentally we support what the regulator here is trying to accomplish. They want to make sure that consumers get the value they're paying for when they buy an investment product. And I think that's good for everybody in the space. So punch line, no material issues. And we continue to work very closely with the GA team to continue the momentum there. Good morning. Yeah, thanks for the question, Stephen. There's no doubt the baseline for the capital markets business has gone up materially over the last few years. I think AUM is one metric you could look to. You could also look to deployment. And frankly, you could also to some extent look to monetization, as the capital markets business often participates in particularly our public market exits. So I'd probably look at those few things. As Rob said in the prepared remarks, we're seeing activity pick up in the fourth quarter across those areas. So we'd expect that to flow through to the capital markets business as well. Yes. The only thing I would add Patrick, because I wouldn't get too focused on any shorter period of time, since the deal was announced in 2020 GA's assets have gone from $72 billion to now pro forma for MetLife, $158 billion. So we've meaningfully exceeded all of our expectations in terms of net growth and we expect to see very consistent trends going forward. Yes. The only thing I would add, Brian is, we started our health care growth strategy a handful of years ago. That has exceeded our expectations to date. There's really two areas where we've been focused on leading from the standpoint of just newer business creation more recently. One is climate, which the guys mentioned, and the other is this life sciences space where we think there could be a meaningful opportunity for us over time. Katalio and that partnership is just part of that effort. Yes. Let me pick up, Mike and I appreciate you asking the question about '26. Inside the firm, it just feels really optimistic, candidly. We've got a lot of different ways to grow. As Rob and Craig mentioned, we've been raising a lot of capital, but our flagship fundraises have not been in those numbers and those are coming. We have a lot of younger and scaling strategies, and I'm not sure it's fully appreciated just how young the firm is. But if you look at the last 12 months, nearly 80% of the money we've raised has been from strategies less than five years old. If you look at the next 12 to 18 months, there's roughly 30 different strategies we will be in the market with, 22 of those are Fund 1, 2 or 3 or equivalent. So we're quite young, and we've been able to scale through the cycle. And as we gain more traction and find our way at that inflection part of the curve, we see a lot of upside as these businesses start to get closer to top three in everything we're doing. Private Wealth is newer for us. So we have a lot of upside ahead of us. GA, we talked about. Asia has significant growth opportunities as well. So the reason you're hearing the optimism is probably 5 to 10 years ago, we were talking about all these businesses that we started that would take 10 plus years to get to scale. And a lot of that is just starting to happen in this period of time, which is why despite the operating environment, we're still quite optimistic. Yes. Mike, and you asked if there's any gaps. There's nothing that I would point to in terms of a gap. We've got a big organic build opportunity here. Sure. Thanks for the question, Chris. Look we started our real estate platform, probably 10 to 12 years ago, somewhere in there, call it, 2011, '12, Chris. And we've been building that business over a period of time where obviously, rates were dropping. We are seeing a significant move in cap rates in one direction. I think our team has been incredibly thoughtful about how they built the business. It's been very thematically focused, perhaps our most thematic investing business across the firm. As a result, very careful about where they were deploying capital as a result. We don't really have much U.S. office exposure. That's just one example. But we've been building across opportunistic equity, to your point about the fund table, core plus real estate, and we have a very large real estate credit business. So in terms of kind of where we stand, we're continuing to raise capital. I think the real estate credit opportunity is showing up, to Craig's point, before the opportunity gets really interesting. But we think that will be even more interesting with time. And so we are continuing to raise capital, deploying selectively all around the world and getting ready for things to get even more attractive as we head into the next several quarters. And one of the ways we've been able to grow this business is through Global Atlantic, which we expect to continue to be the case. So we're really optimistic about what this business can be. And I think you're right. It's periods of time like this where you can grow significantly especially if we continue to see valuations under pressure."

            "name": "Robert Lewin",
            "content": "Thanks a lot, Craig. I thought it'd be helpful this morning to go through what we are experiencing across the firm day-to-day. Despite what has been a dynamic operating environment, we find ourselves with a significant amount of momentum, especially across our key strategic growth areas. We are seeing a noticeable uptick in our pipelines around fundraising, deployment and monetizations. And I'll take you through each today.  Turning first to fundraising. This quarter, we raised $14 billion, bringing the past 12 months to $54 billion. While the fundraising environment has been tough, we feel as though we're positioned very differently than a number of our peers. None of the $54 billion that we have raised over the LTM period has come from our flagship strategies, which are due to begin fundraising in the next year or so.  Global Atlantic continues to have a lot of success in this rate environment and remains incredibly well positioned. Across our private wealth strategies, while still early, our momentum is strong. And our conviction around the size of the addressable market, and our ability to take share continue to grow. And in the framework of KKR this is really all upside for us from here. Finally, many of our younger strategies continue to scale.  Looking at the quarter in a bit more detail, first our K series suite of products. As a reminder, these primarily serve the private wealth and market globally, providing individuals with access to alternative investments that have traditionally have not been accessible to non institutional clients. We now have vehicles for all four of our major asset classes; private equity, infrastructure, real estate and credit. And we continue to be added to more private wealth platforms as these vehicles ramp. Two years ago, we were on approximately 10 platforms. And today that number is closer to 40 across the suite of products that we manage, with more to come.  Looking at our private equity and infra wealth product specifically, they are now raising approximately $500 million a month. So really strong start for us, especially relative to our expectations, only reinforcing our confidence in the scale and impact of the long term opportunity here. Second, we raised $1 billion of capital in credit and liquid strategies in the quarter, and we were particularly active in private credit. As a reminder, private credit is comprised of our direct lending, and our asset-based finance businesses where AUM has scaled significantly.  Today, in total, private credit AUM is $83 billion. That's up roughly three times from $25 billion just three years ago. In direct lending, where we have $36 billion of assets under management, you're seeing us raise capital in a variety of forms. In the quarter, we raised capital for our U.S. focused strategy in traditional fund format. And through evergreen structures in both the U.S. as well as in Europe. We're seeing more interest in these perpetual vehicles, as the asset classes become more mature, and a more permanent part of institutions' allocations.  And we're at the outset of fundraising for our private VDC and continue to raise capital in our separately managed accounts. In asset-based finance, we're continuing to build on our leadership position here. ABF is now close to $50 billion of AUM as of 9/30. We are raising capital in a variety of forms, including closed end and open ended fund structures, in both our high grade and opportunistic ABS strategies. There'll be more to come here in future quarters, as interest in both direct lending and ABF remains very high. This all really builds on the back of strong performance within our leverage credit business, with many of our investment strategies ranking at the top of their respective peer categories.  As an example, our investment returns in both our opportunistic leverage credit strategy, and our multi-asset credit strategy rank in the top one percentile against their peer universes since their inception in 2008.  And the third area on fundraising I wanted to address for some of the more recent announcements that happened post 9/30. We held the final close in Next Generation Technology 3 at approximately $3 billion. That represents an over 30% increase to its predecessor fund. Global Impact Fund 2 is our growth equity platform, investing behind proven companies that delivers scalable commercial solutions to global problems, also held its final close post-quarter end, totaling $2.8 billion, which is over twice the size of its predecessor fund. And Asia Infrastructure 2, we have already raised $6.1 billion of capital here, making it the largest dedicated infra fund in the region, and up from the $3.8 billion predecessor fund. And we have not yet held the final close.  This is another sizable platform that we have added to our infrastructure franchise, and I think further cements our leadership position in Asia more broadly. These three funds in aggregate have increased from $7 billion across their prior vintages to approximately $12 billion of total capital today. This is all very high margin AUM for us, and in strategies that are still relatively young for KKR.  As we look to 2024 and 2025, we expect fundraising at KKR will accelerate relative to the last 12 months. We have 30 plus strategies in or coming to market, including a number of flagships such as global infrastructure, America's Private Equity and Asia Private Equity, with the opportunity for continued scaling in our private wealth products alongside the traditional fund format.  We are also launching a new climate investing strategy. We have recruited a really talented and experienced team, which is now fully integrated into a broader infrastructure platform, giving us confidence that we can become a real leader and a skilled player in the space.  Moving next to deployment, we continue to be very constructive on risk reward here across a number of our asset classes. We have about $100 billion of dry powder available to deploy. And we've seen an uptick in announced investment activity since June. However, only a small portion of that closed in the 90 days ended September 30. We do expect an increase in investment activity in Q4, given our pipelines here. This dynamic should help the invested capital figures in addition to our capital markets revenues in Q4.  And finally our monetization activity has continued to pick up. In the quarter our realized performance and investment income totaled $560 million. Activity in the quarter came from a wide variety of strategies and products. And as we look into the fourth quarter, standing here today, we currently have visibility on $400-plus million of monetization related revenue.  One of the realizations in Q4 is from our investment in KOKUSAI ELECTRIC. KOKUSAI is a Japan-based manufacturer of semiconductor production equipment. We invested in the business back in December of 2017 through our Asia private equity platform. It is one of the three carve-out transactions where we've collaborated with the Hitachi Group. You've heard us talk about Japanese carve-outs as a key investment team, a number of times on these calls. Given our operational skills together with our relationships in the region, we feel particularly well positioned to pursue these investments. This is just the latest example for us.  At the end of October, KOKUSAI was listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in the largest IPO in Japan since 2018, and the largest ever private equity backed IDM. The stock has performed well since pricing, trading up approximately 35%. And based on last week's closing price, our total investment is now marked at over 15 times multiple money on a gross basis. We continue to own 40% of the company. In addition to the positive outcome for our Asia private equity investors, the IPO also helps our branding across everything that we do in Japan, and likely as a result also creates more opportunity as we distribute K series products in this market.  Turning to the firm as a whole, we still have $11-plus billion of embedded gains between our investments and carried interest. So the future around monetization-related revenue remains robust. This is compared to $9 billion of embedded gains at the beginning of the year. So we're up roughly 25% in and what has been a volatile environment, while at the same time having monetized the healthy amount of that embedded gain since 12/31.  As you can hear, we continue to be really excited as a management team about our growth and our evolution. We've been executing on our plan of building a very high growth and high margin asset management business, which benefits from, and is accelerated by what we are doing across insurance and core private equity.  With that Scott, Craig and I are happy to take your questions. Yeah the only thing I'd add Craig, I think it's just part of the strategy. Our approach is really quite broad based. It's global. It's multi-channel all around the world. So what got picked up was just one element of that in the U.S. Good morning. Great, thanks a lot for the question. So a couple things on our capital markets business, and maybe I'll just start with this year and then frame how we think about the go forward. So as you look at really 2022 and 2023, we've been a really tough operating environment for much of that period of time. IPO markets have been largely shut, secondary markets have been close to shut. The leveraged finance market has been up and down. But certainly more down than up. And we're really proud of how that business has protected revenue in that down market. If you look, we were mid-$500 million (phon) in terms of revenue last year, while year-to-date, we're averaging about $110 million $120 million a quarter in that range.  We do feel good about where our pipeline suggests our revenue should be in Q4. And so feel like the team has done a great job being able to protect revenue in a down market. Now. Mike, I think you raised an important question around more normalized environment. If you look at 2021, we generated $840 million of revenue in our capital markets business. And as you suggest, we're doing more things today as a firm than we did in 2021. And I think we've got an opportunity to greater share with a third party component of our capital markets franchise. So we look at a more normalized environment.  We feel like that plus or minus $200 million a quarter is very achievable but to us that's not the top end. We're building out a platform that we think over time can have real growth off that number.  In terms of forward-looking indicators. AUM could be one, but I think it's really the scale and breadth of what we're doing across the firm or maybe more the breadth of what we're doing across the firm, as opposed to necessarily the scale. It's our ability to take share in the third party part of our business where we think we've got some real competitive differentiators versus the marketplace. I think those are more what the indicators are to watch for growth than necessarily what the AUM is for the firm. But thanks for the question.  It's a part of our business that we feel really good about right now, the experience of the past 21 months relative to what it could have been or what it would have been in past cycles that really speaks to what our team has built over the past 10 plus years. Yes, Patrick. Thanks. Thanks a lot for the question. As we look forward in our business, really, the way I think about it, is in regular way organic part of our business, in the individual side, as we look at '24 that could be in that $10 billion to $15 billion range of organic flows. The institutional part of our business, again, more in that organic flow basis, probably in that plus or minus $10 billion range. And the outflows call it in the mid-teens. And so on a net basis, organically, we feel like GA should have, call it $5 billion to $10 billion of organic growth next year. Now you layer on top of that block activity as an example of the MetLife Block, which is all incremental and upside to that.  As we look at our pipeline on the block side, it feels as good today, as it has since we started our ownership of Global Atlantic. We're seeing some very specific deals out there where we can really partner with close relationships and be able to come up with win-win solutions for both us and our clients and partners in that space.  And so that's really how I would think about Global Atlantic and its ability to grow over the coming 12 months, both organically and then on the block side. We continue to see real momentum there, offset, of course, as you noted, by regular way withdrawals. Yes. Thanks for the question, Brian. I'll start. And so I think as you know, we've got a $4 plus billion healthcare growth strategy at the firm. We've got a big private equity focused on the healthcare space and our investment in Katalio [ph], which is really a leading life science investment firm at the more earlier stage, is a real partnership that we think can help make their business better, and then also make our business better from an origination perspective. And we think we'll get a very nice return on our capital based on their business growth and the ability to help originate flow for both our healthcare growth strategy as well as potentially our private equity strategy, maybe strategies across our credit business, a big reason why we did that transaction. Yes. Thanks for asking that question. I'm glad you asked it because I know when that article came out, Craig Larson and his team got a lot of inbounds and questions. And since the shareholder agreement is not public, there is only so much color that him and his team are able to provide. To be very clear, KKR has got no contractual obligation to buy out the minority shareholders at Global Atlantic. What we do have is an obligation in the future to the extent that they want to seek liquidity to help them in that process, which of course, we'd be happy to do.  So no obligation on our part in any way. But of course, that option remains open to us in the future as well. Yes. Brian, thanks for the question. I'll start. So I think we can do both is the short answer. I think we can invest into the firm for growth like we've been doing and expand our margins. No timetable as at least today to when we think we can achieve that mid-60 sustainable FRE margin. But I can tell you sitting here today, I have more confidence than I ever have in our ability to be able to achieve that over time.  I also -- I don't think that's the cap for us. As we look at the business that we're building across our asset management platform, I think there's opportunity over the long term to expand margins north of that mid-60% level. But one step at a time. We've got, again, a lot of conviction that we're going to be able to achieve that on a more sustainable basis, and we'll give you updates, of course, on our progress. Great. Thanks for the question, Mike. So I think it's really multiple different factors. I think it's FRE growth, as you stated, and we can unpack that a little bit. And we definitely see further opportunities to grow and expand what we're doing with Global Atlantic to increase our earnings contribution from there. And then it's our $11 billion plus of embedded gains that sit on our balance sheet today. And that gives us a great deal of comfort in terms of our forward-looking earnings power. So it's a combination of those three things working together that ultimately gives us confidence in our numbers. And we said it last call, and I'll reiterate this call, we feel more comfortable today than we did when we initiated that guidance, I think, two years ago now in our ability to achieve our numbers. And I think that's saying quite a bit because if you think about what's happened at least in our space since we initiated that guidance two years ago, we've had very tough overall operating conditions. Tough fundraising market, tough overall monetization, volatile marks across the board, but we're sitting here now telling you two years in that we feel, even in spite of that, more confident than ever in our ability to achieve our targets. Why don't I start with the deployment and realization and Craig will take up on some of the private credit related questions. So Mike this quarter, we're roughly $300 million of deployment and $300 million monetization of our balance sheet. Say, on the deployment side, it's pretty broad-based across our platform on the monetization side, maybe a little bit heavier weighting towards real assets. Yes. Great. Thanks for the question. Some of the interest in dividends is just honestly, a function of rates coming up and where beneficiaries at on our cash balances and some of our floating rate exposure on the balance sheet. As it relates to $400-plus million, I would say, call it, 80% of that is more carried interest and 20% of that would be balance sheet income and our incentive fee from Marshall Wace in the quarter."

During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following management's prepared remarks, the conference will be opened for questions. [Operator Instructions] I\u2019ll now hand the call over to Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.\nCraig Larson: Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2023 earnings call. As usual, I'm joined by Rob Lewin, our Chief Financial Officer; and Scott Nuttall, our co-Chief Executive Officer. We'd like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, which is available on the Investor Center section at kkr.com. And as a reminder, we report our segment numbers on an adjusted share basis. This call will contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to our earnings release and our SEC filings for cautionary factors about these statements. Turning now to the quarter. We're pleased to be reporting fee-related earnings per share of $0.67 and after tax distributable earnings of $0.73 per share. I'm going to begin by walking through the financials. Management fees in the quarter came in at $749 million; net transaction and monitoring fees were $190 million in Q2, with capital markets generating $150 million of revenues. Capital markets activity was most pronounced in our infrastructure business, which contributed approximately 45% of revenues in the quarter. And along with core private equity, these two strategies generated over 60% of capital markets transaction fees in the quarter, reflecting the continued diversification of the business. So, in total, fee-related revenues were $967 million. This was up 7% from last quarter, and it's up 25% year-over-year. Fee-related compensation was right at the midpoint of our guided range at 22.5% of fee-related revenues and other operating expenses were $147 million. Putting this together, fee-related earnings came in at $602 million or $0.67 per share with an FRE margin of 62%, which continues to be best-in-class looking across our industry. And for the quarter, FRE improved 10% from last quarter and on a year-over-year basis, so this is compared to the second quarter of 2022, FRE is up 31%. Moving to realized performance income. Realization activity, as we discussed last quarter, was more muted against the slower transaction environment. So, for the quarter, we generated $149 million of realized performance income, while realized investment income came in at $115 million. In total, our asset management operating earnings were $752 million. Our Insurance segment generated $170 million of pretax earnings in the quarter as Global Atlantic continues to operate at a high level. As a reminder, we expect pretax ROE to be in that 14% to 15% range, so performance this quarter was just above the top end of that range. In aggregate, this resulted in after-tax distributable earnings of $653 million or the $0.73 per share figure that I mentioned a minute ago. Next, moving to investment performance. The traditional private equity portfolio was up 5% in the quarter and over the last 12 months appreciated 2%. Importantly here, inception to date, IRRs for our blended flagship funds, so that's Americas XII, Europe V and Asia IV remains strong at 22%, which is meaningfully ahead of the corresponding 9% figure for the MSCI world. In real assets, the real estate portfolio was flat for the quarter and down 11% over the last 12 months. Our portfolio continues to be heavily weighted towards those assets and themes where you're seeing strong fundamentals and cash flow growth. So, think industrial assets, data centers, rental housing, student housing, and self-storage. However, as cap rates have increased over the last 12 months, that more than offset the underlying NOI growth and that's what's leading to the decline you've seen over the LTM period. Infrastructure was up 2% in the quarter and up 10% over the last 12 months, reflecting the strength of the portfolio really on a global basis. And with higher interest rates, we've strategically leaned into more inflation protected assets. And in credit, the leveraged in alternative composites were up 3% and 2%, respectively for the quarter and 12% and 5%, respectively over the last 12 months. Moving next to capital metrics. We raised $13 billion in the quarter. Fundraising activity was actually quite diverse, driven by our middle market private equity strategy. Our case series suite of products focused on private wealth, which Rob is going to touch further on in a moment. Our core infrastructure strategy and real estate across all geographies, and this is in addition to inflows from Global Atlantic as well as capital raised for our Ivy reinsurance sidecar fund, which held its final close in the quarter. With that, our assets under management increased to $519 billion and fee paying AUM to $420 billion. And finally, we've continued to deploy capital. In the quarter, we invested approximately $10 billion, pretty evenly spread across private equity, real assets and credit. Deployment within private equity was largely driven by core PE, while real estate deployment was most focused on credit in the U.S. as well as equity investments in Asia. And in our credit business, deployment was relatively diversified across asset-based finance and direct lending. Now, before turning it over to Rob, we want to spend a minute or two on our work to create and protect value through sustainability, which we detailed in our 12th annual sustainability report that we published in June and is also available on our website. Now, one of the areas where we've shown real leadership is our work around broad-based employee ownership in our portfolio companies and billing off of the CHI overhead doors and Minnesota rubber and plastics examples discussed previously, we've another case study in RBmedia. RBmedia is one of the largest audiobook publishers in the world, and in connection with our investment, we introduced a broad equity ownership program across the company. And by partnering with the workforce and through all of their great work, wonderful things have happened, including a 22% CAGR in its core publishing business EBITDA over the life of our investment. So, we announced the sale of RBmedia in late July, and this will be a very successful outcome for its employees. All RBmedia colleagues will earn significant cash payouts with non-management employees receiving a 100% of annual income on average, and the most tenured employees receiving two years of their annual income. This outcome can be a financial game changer for people, and it's driving real value. Over these three recent exits, we've averaged approximately a 6x multiple of costs on behalf of our clients. So, at this point we've introduced broad-based employee ownership programs at over 35 companies and we've touched over 60,000 employees. And we expect these numbers to continue to grow from here and hope and expect we'll have more stories like RBmedia to share with you in the quarters and years ahead. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob.\nRobert Lewin: Great. Thanks a lot, Craig. The operating backdrop has begun to improve and as Craig just ran through, our model continues to deliver consistent results. With that, let's shift the focus of the conversation to the future. Our model, growth trajectory, and culture are differentiated within our industry. I thought it would be beneficial to go through three of the foundational building blocks that have driven much of our differentiation and will importantly be a key driver of KKR's future earnings quality and growth. We have taken very deliberate steps to build a business that benefits from several different growth engines, providing both greater earnings stability and significant long-term earnings power. Number one, we've built a business that has meaningfully increased the durability and recurring nature of our revenues, and we expect that trend to continue. Page four of the earnings release highlights this point very well. On the left hand side of the page, you see that over just the past two and a half years, we have doubled our management fees, our most recurrent revenue stream from $1.4 billion in 2020 to $2.9 billion over the last 12 months, and fee-related earnings in turn have also increased meaningfully from $1.3 billion in 2020 to approximately $2.3 billion over the prior 12 months. Alongside this growth, the quality of these earnings has significantly improved as we've become much more diversified by strategy and by geography. In addition, the form of our capital base has also evolved, with our perpetual capital increasing from $22 billion at the end of 2020 to $200 billion today. Our perpetual capital now accounts for roughly 50% of our fee paying AUM relative to approximately 10% at the end of 2020. We will continue this focus of increasing both our recurring revenue and profitability, as well as diversifying the form of our fundraising and capital base. The second building block are the multiple identifiable growth avenues at across our business. We have discussed a number of these drivers over the last couple of earnings calls, but today I'm going to focus on just two areas that have been more notable in the quarter. Insurance and private wealth. Global Atlantic has continued to be a fantastic acquisition for us. Looking at the past few months, we've highlight two very important initiatives. In May GA announced a reinsurance agreement with MetLife funded by GA's balance sheet, our Ivy platform and co-investors. With this transaction, AUM will increase by $13 billion upon closing, and the transaction will be beneficial, both management fees as well as insurance operating earnings. And in June, KKR and GA together formed a strategic partnership with Japan Post Insurance. This partnership allows us to pursue additional growth opportunities through our collaboration with a key player in the Japanese insurance market. And as part of this, Japan Post committed meaningfully to Ivy II, which as Craig mentioned, held its final close in the quarter. Overall, GA is continue to demonstrate significant momentum with $144 billion of AUM as of Q2. This has doubled since we announced the acquisition in 2020, a further proof point of our acquisition and a demonstration of how the alignment we've created can drive real success. A specific area where GA has really helped accelerate the growth of one of our businesses is private credit. Today, we manage $78 billion in private credit with $45 billion of that in asset-based finance. We are a leader in the ABF space, encompassing both our high grade and higher yielding strategies. And with recent regional bank retrenchment, the already five plus trillion ABF addressable market has even more structural tailwinds for us, as those seeking capital look to KKR as a real solutions provider with scale. The multi-year relationship announced in the quarter with PayPal is just one recent example. And now turning to private wealth. We've touched on this topic a number of times given the market opportunity alongside the significant investments we have made in order to launch and distribute a number of new products. In Q2, we started fundraising for two new private wealth strategies focused on private equity and infrastructure. The launch of these products was a critical step in addressing the massive private wealth end market and introducing on a global scale products that traditionally have not been accessible to non-institutional clients. We're off to a really good start here. In total, including capital that has raised in Q2 and so far in Q3, we've raised $1.9 billion across these two strategies. While we are still in the very early days, these initial results are ahead of our expectations. We have also launched in just a handful of platforms so far, and we would expect that to increase over the coming quarters. In our credit business, we look forward to the launch of a new private BBC later this year. In addition to direct lending, the strategy incorporates a specific allocation to asset-based finance, which we think will be viewed as a real differentiator. So, at this point, we have a full suite of private wealth solutions strategically aligned with our four key investment verticals across the firm. Our focus here remains very much long-term oriented, ensuring that we are a real winner in the space over the next five to 10-plus years. Our conviction around success is high and is driven by a number of factors, including our brand, investment track record, our significantly expanded distribution and marketing teams, and our scale to be able to invest into the opportunity set. And importantly, each one of our core products across PE, infra, real estate and credit have aspects that are unique and a real testament to the innovation capabilities of our team. Now turning to building block number three. We continue to achieve substantial growth in our earnings power because of both an increase in our fee paying AUM and capital deployment. We currently have $10 billion of embedded gains that sit on our balance sheet. That's the fair value of our carry and investment portfolio relative to the underlying cost, that's up from $3.7 billion just a few years ago. This provides a real lens into our ability to create meaningful revenue outcomes in the future. And over the next few years, with continued investment performance and further capital deployment, that number is biased to increase, even as we expect to monetize more as the environment hopefully becomes more constructive. A reminder for how we think about earnings power. Distributable earnings is largely a cash metric. So, in times like these, when we sell less through the monetization environment, we are underearning that intrinsic earnings power and embedded gains are only one piece of that equation. Our expectation here is for continued scaling of our more recurring revenue businesses as well. Just looking at management fees alone, without raising another dollar, we currently have $38 billion of AUM with a weighted average management fee rate of almost a 100 basis points, that is not yet turned on. This capital once activated, would directly flow into management fees and be additive to earnings, but is not reflected today in our FRE or after tax DE. We also have $100 billion of dry powder, 96% of which is carry eligible. When we invest that capital, it creates the potential for more embedded gains and therefore revenue over time. These are the main reasons why we are so constructive around the potential for further significant and sustainable growth in our earnings per share over time. We have never been more confident around our model and our prospects, which is one of the reasons that you saw us buyback some stock in the quarter. Since the end of Q1, we have brought back or canceled approximately 6 million shares at an average price per share of less than $50 share. Repurchases have historically been and will continue to be an important driver of value creation for our shareholders. As a reminder, since we initiated our buyback program in 2015, we have bought back or canceled approximately 92 million shares at an average price per share of just over $27. This represents more than 10% of KKR shares outstanding today and almost 15% of our free float.  And with our recent acquisition such as KJRM, our Japanese REIT Manager and Global Atlantic, we have completed almost $5 billion of purchase price M&A with limited share issuance. We remain as a management team, the largest owners of stock, and are highly aligned with shareholders in our focus on equity value creation. So, to summarize, our earnings growth will continue to be supported by more stable forms of income, including our diversified high-quality and growing management fee business underpinned by our $200 billion of perpetual capital. Number two, we have several differentiated growth avenues, including insurance and private wealth amongst many others. And finally, our embedded gains and more broadly our earnings power is expected to continue to increase. These compounding pieces are why we continue to feel more confident than ever in our 2026 targets of $4-plus of FRE and $7-plus of after tax De per share. With that, Scott, Craig and I are happy to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Good morning, everyone. Hope you're all doing well. My focus is on the next fundraising cycle. When do you expect to have the first close for global infrastructure investors V? And do you believe this will be your first of the flagship fundraise?\nCraig Larson: Hey, Craig. It's Craig. Why don't I start? Thanks for the question. I think as we look forward, we continue to see a really active amount of funds and strategies that we expect to be in the market with. We talked historically about having 30-plus strategies in the market over the coming 12 to 18 months. I think if anything, that number probably would've increased relative to what we would've talked about six or 12 -- three or six months ago. So, I think the level of activity and the number of strategies remains at a high level. We don't have any guidance or specificity as it relates specifically to our infrastructure strategy. But I think when you look at the back of the tables and you look at invested and committed capital relative to the size of the fund, I think fair to assume that that's something that is becoming a front of mind topic for us, but nothing to announce specifically as it relates to individual timings, let alone closings at this point.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you, Craig.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nAlexander Blostein: Hi. Good morning, everybody. Rob, I wanted to go back to some of the points you made at the end of your prepared remarks around the buyback and just capital management. Definitely nice to see a little bit of a pickup and repurchases here. Just curious that whether we are at a point now where you feel like the balance sheet has enough sort of scale to recycle capital for what you guys need. And the buybacks could become a bigger part of the story going forward where M&A aside, we could actually expect the total share count to start to decline in absolute terms. Thanks.\nRobert Lewin: Yeah. Great. Good morning Alex, and thanks a lot for the question. So, taking a step back just more broadly as it relates to capital allocation, the most important thing for us, and you've heard me say this and us as a management team say this before, most important thing is to have a consistent approach. And ours is one that I think is really maniacally focused on driving ROE and the highest per share earnings that we can with the lowest per unit of risk. And we talked about four strategic areas of deployment that we think can accomplish that. And so that's core private equity investing, continuing to invest across the insurance space. You mentioned strategic M&A. And the fourth one is share buybacks. And we think a real core competency of our management team is being able to move that marginal dollar of liquidity around to the highest return opportunity. And the thing that's going to drive the most earnings per share over time. And maybe the final point here is we're highly aligned in that decision-making process. As you know, KKR management owns close to 30% of KKR stock. And so, back to your specific question on share buybacks, as you mentioned, I noted on the prepared remarks, we've bought back over 90 million shares that represent almost 15% of our free float since we initiated our buyback program seven, eight years ago and just over $27 per share. So, we really like the body of work that's been accomplished over a long period of time.  And so, all to say share buybacks going to continue to be a very important part of our go-forward capital framework and capital allocation policy. But we're going to continue to look at other ways of driving growth in earnings per share over time as well, including in areas like core private equity insurance and M&A. Hope that's an helpful overview.\nScott Nuttall: The only thing I'd add, Alex, if you look at what we've been doing the last several years, as you know, we've deployed several billion dollars to M&A, that's been quite additive to our fee paying AUM, our FRE, our TDE. So, to Rob's point, we look at it holistically, look at the relative trade-offs. It's less about needing to invest in the business to start new strategies or seed new businesses. It's more about what's going to give us that highest marginal return on capital, as Rob mentioned.\nAlexander Blostein: Got it. Okay. All makes sense. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi. Thank you. So, I'm curious to get a little more color on KPAC. I know it's early. I know it was on one platform in a short period of time in a slow PE backdrop, but you raised a couple hundred million. So, I'm curious what you learned from that one platform in that short period of time. Maybe the timing of the other platform ads. And then sidebar question, is this structure able to be included in 401 Ks if and when we get there? Thanks so much.\nCraig Larson: Hey, Glen. It's Craig. Why don't I start? Look, I think -- let's take a step back for a moment, and I know that you all know all of this very well, but I think when we look at this opportunity, it's a real long-term secular opportunity that we had ahead -- that we have ahead of us. So, individual investors have not had an easy way to access the Alt space historically. I think that is certainly true as it relates to private equity most specifically. And so, if individual investors have 1% of their assets invested in Alts today, and that goes to 5% over the next several years, that's $8 trillion to $10 trillion of additional capital that has the potential to flow into alternative products.  And as it relates to a number of the points that Rob mentioned in terms of the strength of our brand, relationships that we have, the track record that we bring, all the investments we've made in terms of distribution, all of these things are super positive. And then you layer on top of that, the products creation and creativity that we think that we've brought to a number of these products. So, on our last earnings call, we'd noted that we had launched our PE vehicle as you'd indicated outside of the U.S. It closed on chest over, $400 million with distribution expected increase and infrastructure also soon to be accepting capital. And so, 90 days later, here we are with $1.9 billion raised across both PE and infrastructure, which is great. So, it's ahead of our expectations.  I think in terms of lessons learned, I guess I point to three. One, brand again is super important. I think, number two, again, I'd emphasize the product creation point, starting with KREST and as you then see that expansion. And then finally, I think that we have the ability to leverage the relationships that we've earned through KREST as we continue to expand into new distribution channels in private equity and infrastructure. So, hopefully that gives you a sense on that.\nRobert Lewin: And Glen, just a quick follow up on the 401 K point, no plans in the immediate future as it relates to that. I do think it's worth noting though that KPAC is structured in a way that can be distributed through to the accredited investor and not just qualified purchasers. It's one of those points of innovation that I highlighted in our prepared remarks.\nGlenn Schorr: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ben Budish with Barclays. Please receive your question.\nBenjamin Budish: Hey, good morning and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the performance in the insurance business. It sounds like a lot of things kind of firing well over there. But just when we look at the reported ROE, which is still ahead of your target, it looks like the decline from Q4 to Q1 to Q2 was a bit steeper than we would've expected. So, just curious if there's any other color you can share there in terms of the kind of sequential growth in cost of insurance and G&A versus the investment income and how we should think about those various pieces going forward. Thanks.\nRobert Lewin: Yeah. Great. Thanks a lot for the question. As you noted, GA continues to perform at a really high level, and in Q2 was ahead of our target returns for GA at a 15%-plus, pretax ROE. In terms of the operating earnings in the quarter and why you saw that quarter-on-quarter decline, that you referenced, really a function of a strategic decision at the GA level to position our book in more liquid securities at the beginning of Q2, more cash, more liquid fixed income. If you think back to early part of Q2, we were still in that regional bank crisis timeframe and I think we made the right decision to reposition the book at that point in time, gave up a little bit of ROE in the quarter, as you noted, but I think the right decision for the business.\nBenjamin Budish: Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks Rob.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Brian McKenna with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian McKenna: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So, core private equity continues to be a great story, fair value now totals over $6 billion with about $3 billion in gains on the balance sheet, and it's generated a 20% return. It also looks like core private equity AUMs total of $34 billion today. So, could you talk about demand for this product specifically from third parties? And then, is there a way to think about the absolute level of third-party fundraising for the strategy over time?\nCraig Larson: Hey, Brian. It's Craig. Why don't I start? First, thanks for all of the detail and noticing core PE again, it's one of the reasons we'd added that page in our press release focused on the asset class and the strategy. So, a lot of innovation in our firm happens when we can't find a home for great investments, and that's what happens with core private equity. It's a long duration strategy where we expect to hold investments in compound value for 10 to 15 years, but the risk reward is fundamentally different than our relative to our opportunistic PE funds. And so, at this point, we put together what we think is a really great portfolio of companies diversified across the world. As you noted, since inception returns have been very positive. That $34 billion of AUM was $12 billion three years ago. That's all organic growth. And I think, another point just as it relates to this in our model, because you're right, we've got the $6.2 billion of fair value relative to the $3 billion of cost. So with shareholders, we're participating in the economics, both in terms of the management fees and performance fees on the third-party piece, the compounding you see on the balance sheet. And then on top of that, we'd expect capital markets revenues to continue to grow alongside. Capital markets revenues in the quarter were between $25 million and $30 million. So, we've got a number of ways to win. I think from an LP standpoint, the types of LPs who find this asset class most interesting are those -- I think probably larger plans with longer dated liabilities and are interested in the matching aspect related to the asset class. So, I think that the opportunity for us to continue to grow both the third-party piece as well as on the balance sheet is one we're going to be talking about, have an opportunity to talk about for a long period of time.\nScott Nuttall: Hey, Brian. It's Scott. Just a couple incremental thoughts for you. One is a younger part of the private equity asset class, so to some extent there is a bit of an education still happening. As you noted, we do have a significant amount of AUM. We have a lot of dry powder as we sit here today. But we've been out talking to investors around the world about why we like it so much and how aligned we are, and we're having some really good conversations. In addition to the larger plans that Craig referenced, and those may be focused on 10, 15, 20-year compounding, we're also seeing interest from large scale family offices that tend to think that like we do in terms of the power of long-term compounding, probably a greater appreciation for reinvestment risk. And as the portfolio continues to mature and we spend the dry powder, we have, we'll be back to market before too long. I'd be happy to share more color then.\nBrian McKenna: Great. Thank you guys.\nCraig Larson: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Mike Brown with KBW. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Brown: Hey, good morning, everyone. I just wanted to ask on the capital markets environment, clearly there's been some green shoots recently and just wanted to get your take on how that could translate into a broader recovery and just get your thoughts on maybe the next six to 12 months. And then, I know it's early in the quarter, but any quick color on the monetization out of quarter to date or expectations for the full quarter?\nRobert Lewin: Sure. Thanks a lot for the question, Mike. If you look our capital markets business year-to-date, we've generated $250 million of revenue. And if you look back over the past four quarters, we've averaged $110 million to $115 million of revenue. And so, we're really proud of that performance and environment where the capital markets put that in equity we're largely shut for most of that period of time. So, I feel like we've built a business model that is quite durable in tough operating conditions. In terms of the back half of the year, you've noticed some green shoots and we've certainly seen some signs of life in the leverage finance market, a little bit in the IPO market, maybe the secondary market follows. I think it's a little early to call that we're out of it, but we do really think that we're positioned in an environment where the capital markets come back to generate really outsized outcomes. Hopefully that environment really persists and we can generate those types of outcomes for our shareholders in 2024 and beyond. Like I remind you that in 2021, our capital markets business in a really up market generated $850 million of revenue. So, I feel like we've built this model that protects in the downside, but really offers the opportunity for outsized -- outcomes when the markets are open. And I think we are doing much more as a firm today than we did in 2021. So, I think the opportunity is greater as we go forward here with that business.\nMichael Brown: [Indiscernible]\nRobert Lewin: Yeah. Thank you. And then, on your question on the monetization side, it's a bit of an odd quarter for us. We've got a couple of pretty meaningful monetizations that sit on the bubble between Q3 and Q4. So, instead of providing just a Q3 number in isolation, what I can let you know is that we have at least $350 million of visibility around monetization related revenue over the second half of the year. As usual, as we get to the end of this quarter, we'll provide that specific press release, which details our performance through the quarter. And so, what we're seeing a bit of an uptick here for sure. I think consistent with the overall tone and what we're all feeling is a bit more of a constructive environment. I'd still say that we're in the part of the cycle where we are underearning our intrinsic earnings power. So, hopefully more to come here, but a little bit of upside relative to where we've been.\nScott Nuttall: Hey, Mike. It's Scott. Just maybe a little bit more color from me. And away from just the capital market specificity of your question, I just speak to overall firm activity. As Rob said, it's far too early to declare a return to normalcy, but there's no doubt that over the last several weeks, it feels like the markets are thawing a bit. The new deal pipeline and activity is up. Some monetization discussions are up. If that continues and if the public markets continue to perform, then we'd expect carry through to the fundraising environment over the next few quarters. But all that could reverse again with bad news. We've seen a couple headaches from this market, but overall there's no doubt that activity is up and the tone's improved. And it'll be interesting to see if this carries through post Labor Day.\nMichael Brown: Great color. Thank you.\nCraig Larson: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Arnaud Giblat with BNP. Please proceed your question.\nArnaud Giblat: Yeah. Good morning. I was just wondering -- wanting to come back on your development of your wealth strategies. I was wondering if you could focus in a bit more on the development of your retail strategy globally. Have you had any meaningful conversations with new distributors in Europe and in Asia? I'm just wanted -- wanting to get a bit more color there. Thank you.\nCraig Larson: Thanks for the question. I think, the answer is yes, distribution continues to expand. If you think of this as a funnel, I think from our standpoint, the funnel continues to grow at the very top end and that's global. So, as we talk about, for instance, private equity and infrastructure, those are vehicles where we specifically had created vehicles focused on individual markets in the U.S. and outside of the U.S., that opportunity again is, is one that's global and we're pursuing along those lines. So, nothing specific in terms of number of platforms today versus a year ago or anything along those lines. But I think the broader point again is just when we look at the opportunity we have ahead of us, trillions of opportunity of dollars that can move over into the Alts and we think we're really well-positioned to take a healthy piece of that.\nScott Nuttall: Hey, Arnaud. It's Scott. I'm just a little bit color from my standpoint as Jim and I have been traveling around the world, we're definitely spending time with other distribution partners. As a reminder, 18 of our 23 offices at KKR are outside the United States. And maybe behind your question, we agree with the sentiment that this is not just a U.S. opportunity in private wealth. We very much look at it as a global one and have built teams in Europe and Asia and are developing partnerships in both places in addition to the U.S.\nArnaud Giblat: Great. Thank you.\nCraig Larson: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Hope you are doing well. The question beyond the deployment versus monetization backdrop. So, the monetizations were actually running a little bit more ahead of our forecast than the deployment has been the last couple quarters. And just wanted to get your sense of if we are in a better market environment, you say soft landing or no landing, does that create more monetization opportunities over the next few quarters relative to deployment, or are you still seeing the deployment backdrop as attractive here? And then maybe if you can comment on a couple areas within that, particularly like infrastructure, and then I guess even within credit.\nCraig Larson: Hey, Brian. It's Craig. Why don't I start and then Rob will pick up as it relates to the monetization piece, I think specifically. So, a couple of observations. If you think, and let's start with private equity and real assets and then as you note we'll switch to credit, but I think over the last 18 months, a lot of the primary markets have effectively been shut. The IPO market's been pretty much shut over this period of time. The syndicated debt markets have been dislocated for the majority of that period, and capital has been quite precious. There's no question. Now those from a deployment standpoint, those are all things that are good for us. And so that's why I think on a number of these calls, you've heard us actually be quite constructive on risk reward. I think as it relates to private equity and real assets, we're value focused. We're looking for those opportunities where we can bring our operational resources to bear and where those can really move the needle. We love corporate carve outs. We've also been very active on pursuing public's private at this point. We've announced or closed on 14 take private transactions since the beginning of 2022. The most recent of those, you probably would've seen some articles this morning. So, I think that's been an area for us where we've been as active as anybody. I think as it relates to credit, and again, this is a big business for us. We've detailed in our press release, you see it on page 11, the composition of that overall amount of AUM $227 billion, of that we have $80 billion in private credit, really broken into those two pieces. Asset-based finance, real secular drivers as Rob had mentioned in his prepared remarks. And I think in direct lending, we remain very constructive on the risk reward, but you've seen overall transaction volumes be pretty modest within direct lending. So, I'd think of that asset class as one that has been taking a greater share, but of a smaller piece of the pie. But on overall risk reward, we remain very constructive on regular way direct lending at the same time.\nRobert Lewin: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Brian. And I think you could separate a little bit deployment and monetization. As Craig went through, there's a lot going on in the deployment side, and we've done our best as a firm to really be focused on linear deployment of the dry powder in our strategies. Of course, when the capital markets are open, it makes deployment a little bit easier, but there is no doubt when the capital markets are open and the overall level of volatility comes down for some period of time that it's going to open up real drivers to be able to generate monetization related revenue. I mentioned on the call, we've got $10 billion on our balance sheet today of effective embedded gains between carried interest and our balance sheet investments. So, we're very well-positioned to be able to take advantage of the market opening. And again, we hope that some of the green shoots we've seen here persist post Labor day, and that presents some really good opportunities for us to deliver outsized outcomes in 2024 and beyond.\nScott Nuttall: Hey, Brian. It\u2019s Scott. I'd say -- I would expect both deployment and monetizations to increase if the capital markets open up. As a reminder, we've got $100 billion of dry powder, and so that's great news from a deployment standpoint. When markets are shut, it's harder to get deals done. We've been more active, especially recently, but there's no doubt if the capital markets open, there'll be more -- overall M&A activity, which will accrue to our benefit, and you'll also see more monetizations and that'll run across asset classes, including to your question infrastructure.\nBrian Bedell: That's great. That's great color. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Finian O\u2019Shea with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nFinian O\u2019Shea: Hi, everyone. Good morning. Another question on wealth. For the non-traded BDC you mentioned, are you going accredited only or does the feeder structure solve for that? And relatedly, what do you think that means for the potential for eventual monthly flows compared to what your peers are doing? Thank you.\nCraig Larson: Hey, Finian. It\u2019s Craig. Why don't I start? And again, I think the product creation part is an important component as it relates to this. So, across all four as it relates to real estate, private equity, infrastructure, as well as the private BDC. We're focused on having the opportunity to launch those vehicles and fundraise across both of those markets. So, the entire case suite is again allowing us to look to raise capital both through accredited investors and not just through qualified purchasers. And that's meaningful in our view. Like -- I think the accredited investor market is multiples the size of the qualified purchasers market. So, again, that pie or the top of that funnel is one that is in our view very broad and helps just increase that long-term opportunity that we see.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Cyprys: Hey, good morning. I was hoping you could spend a moment just on infrastructure, which is a real differentiator for KKR. So, just how are you thinking about driving the next leg of growth for infrastructure? What sort of steps might you take over the next couple years, and how are you expanding your capacity to deploy capital into infrastructure? And then just a housekeeping question for Rob, just on how much was invested and deployed off the balance sheet in the quarter?\nCraig Larson: Hey, Mike. It's Craig. Why don't I start on infra? So, again, thank you for asking about. So two and a half years ago at our 21 Investor day, it was April of 21, we walked through infra as a case study for us is really how we look to build platforms over the long-term. And it begins with strong performance of the flagship strategy. And then that really is what allows you to earn the right to both scale those flagships and innovate into new adjacencies. And so today, our infrastructure platform is built out with four distinct segments. We have our global Infra Fund series, Asia Infra, diversified core, and then most recently, the infrastructure vehicles customized for private wealth investors. And so, to give you a sense of how that's grown, AUM at that Investor Day was $17 billion. At June 30, we were at $54 billion, so that's $17 billion to $54 billion. All organic. The growth in innovation hasn't stopped. Again, I think we're in the earliest of days as it relates to infrastructure and private wealth. It's an asset class that we think lends itself very nicely in this marketplace. And look, the renewables space is an area where we also think we can do more. So more to come here over time. And as it relates to deployment, logically, as you've seen the increase in our footprint, you've seen the step function increase in overall deployment stats for us. So, infra deployment in 2019 was a little over two -- was a little over $2 billion. It was $2.1 billion. 2020 is $2.2 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've invested $12 billion in the asset class. So -- and again, as you would've seen in -- as Robert touched on capital markets, there are flow through opportunities for us at the same point in time. So more to come, but it continues to feel like we're wonderfully well positioned.\nRobert Lewin: And then, Mike, very quickly, your second part of your question, in the quarter we deployed approximately $850 million off the balance sheet. A good chunk of that -- most of it is a core private equity. And then our realizations were a little under $250 million on the quarter.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thanks.\nCraig Larson: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Rufus Hone with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nRufus Hone: Hey, good morning. Thanks very much. Maybe if you could spend a minute giving an update on your Asia business. You've now owned the KJRM business for a little over a year. It'd be great to hear more about how that acquisition's performing and whether you see any more opportunities to consolidate your position in the region inorganically, and also what the near-term outlook is for fundraising. Thanks very much.\nRobert Lewin: Great. Rufus, thanks a lot for the question. Asia remains a core part of our growth story at KKR, and we've talked about this in the past for a number of reasons. We feel really good that our Asia business one day will be as big as our U.S. business. So, we've got a great competitive position in the marketplace, plus private equity and infrastructure, both of which are the largest in the region in terms of fund sizes. We've got real growing businesses across real estate, as well as credit as well. In terms of the KJRM acquisition, that's off to a great start. And from a strategic standpoint, really doing what we wanted it to accomplish, which is to generate very consistent returns for their existing investor base, which translates into a very predictable management fees for us at KKR. But much more importantly, in terms of what it does for the rest of our opportunistic strategy and core plus strategy in the Japan market, just markedly changed our approach to what we're able to do in Japan. And really in terms of one of our big growth engines within Asia is the Japanese market. And our competitive position there is in particular really strong and KJRM really helps cement that.\nScott Nuttall: Hey, Rufus. It's Scott. I'd say to your question on would we do more M&A in the region and consolidate in that way. We'd be open to it. We're always looking. So, definitely open-minded.  The only other thing I would add is Global Atlantic is also now growing with partnerships in Asia. Something that we've been able to do now that we're together. We announced Block with AXA in Hong Kong. We, of course, announced the Japan Post Partnership this past quarter. We've announced some flow partnerships in Singapore is just one more example. And there's other discussions along those lines. Some are between organic and inorganic, but we do see opportunities to expand our insurance efforts in Asia as well.\nRufus Hone: Thank you.\nCraig Larson: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next questions from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nAlexander Blostein: Hi. Thank you guys for taking the follow-up. Appreciate it. I wanted to touch on your credit business, specifically asset-backed finance. It's a place where you spend a little bit more time just communicating to the street of sort of how big it's gotten over the years, and you've got a number of origination platforms that are supporting it. So, as you think about raising capital for those type of strategies outside of Global Atlantic, so whether it's third-party insurance companies or maybe other institution LPs, what does that look like over the next couple of years? And maybe just remind us what the fee rates are? I'm assuming it's a -- generally a lower fee rate, like separate account type of business, but curious to get more. Thanks.\nCraig Larson: Why don't I start, Alex? So, first glad that you asked about, again, back to the detail we provided on page 11. So, we've got $227 billion of AUM in credit and liquid strategies. A key component of that is the $80 billion in private credit. Two big pieces here, the $45 billion in asset-based finance alongside of the $33 billion of direct lending. These are big businesses for us. And so, back to your question, ABF is a massive end market, $5-plus trillion. You have high barriers to entry in our view -- a lack of scale capital against this end market. And we have, and we continue to see it, many traditional providers leaving the market and in our view creating a void. And so, we're finding attractive risk reward, would say that's true in terms of the high grade ABF strategy, which to date has been led really in partnership with everything that Global Atlantic has doing. And that's been increase opportunities for us to continue to be more relevant to the broad insurance landscape, as well as within our traditional asset-based finance strategy where we have funds and separately managed accounts focused on a mid-teens gross IRR opportunity. Those would be the strategies for instance that had pursued the PayPal transaction.  And so, deployment has been healthy. I think over the trailing 12 months, it's been about $11 million for us. So, it's been a place where we've been active. And in addition to the PayPal partnership that we announced in June, the team does continue to be active on the regional front. I think our most recent portfolio acquisition here close about two weeks ago. And in terms of fee rates, we haven't really gone into detail in terms of the separation between the high grade and the asset-based finance strategy. But fair to say that commensurate with that risk return that you're correct. The high grade would be a different area as it relates to blended fee rate relative to the asset-based finance fund itself.\nScott Nuttall: Yeah. Alex, it\u2019s Scott. Just maybe a little bit more color on the types of capital raising. This is going to be a bunch of different formats, so you're not going to see a large flagship fund would be my guess. But we do have an ABF fund. We have our BDCs. We have leveraged separate accounts. We have unleveraged separate accounts. We have a high grade ABF strategy, which also tends to be in separate account format, and there's other things that we're working on. So, it all aggregates up to the $45 billion or so that Craig mentioned. I say you're right, the initial interest over the last several years has been from a number of different places. But if there's a thematic to it, if insurance, we now manage roughly $200 billion for insurance companies, 140, 150, give or take from GA, the rest from third parties. And we have 150 insurance companies that invest with us on a third-party basis. But also increasingly we're seeing interest from institutions. This asset class reminds me a little bit of infrastructure 10-plus years ago. There's a lot of education. In the early days, growing market, not a lot of people understood what it was. We are finding that there's increased interest in it as the focus on private credit has continued to broaden and go global. So, we're optimistic.\nAlexander Blostein: Perfect. Thanks for all that.\nCraig Larson: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'll hand the call back to Craig Larson for closing remarks.\nEnd of Q&A:\nCraig Larson: Rob, thank you for your help and thank you everybody for your continued interest in KKR. Please feel free, of course, to follow up with me or the IR team post this call. Otherwise, we look forward to speaking to everybody in 90 days or so. Thank you so much.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.",

            "name": "Scott Nuttall",
            "content": "The only thing I'd add, Alex, if you look at what we've been doing the last several years, as you know, we've deployed several billion dollars to M&A, that's been quite additive to our fee paying AUM, our FRE, our TDE. So, to Rob's point, we look at it holistically, look at the relative trade-offs. It's less about needing to invest in the business to start new strategies or seed new businesses. It's more about what's going to give us that highest marginal return on capital, as Rob mentioned. Hey, Brian. It's Scott. Just a couple incremental thoughts for you. One is a younger part of the private equity asset class, so to some extent there is a bit of an education still happening. As you noted, we do have a significant amount of AUM. We have a lot of dry powder as we sit here today. But we've been out talking to investors around the world about why we like it so much and how aligned we are, and we're having some really good conversations. In addition to the larger plans that Craig referenced, and those may be focused on 10, 15, 20-year compounding, we're also seeing interest from large scale family offices that tend to think that like we do in terms of the power of long-term compounding, probably a greater appreciation for reinvestment risk. And as the portfolio continues to mature and we spend the dry powder, we have, we'll be back to market before too long. I'd be happy to share more color then. Hey, Mike. It's Scott. Just maybe a little bit more color from me. And away from just the capital market specificity of your question, I just speak to overall firm activity. As Rob said, it's far too early to declare a return to normalcy, but there's no doubt that over the last several weeks, it feels like the markets are thawing a bit. The new deal pipeline and activity is up. Some monetization discussions are up. If that continues and if the public markets continue to perform, then we'd expect carry through to the fundraising environment over the next few quarters. But all that could reverse again with bad news. We've seen a couple headaches from this market, but overall there's no doubt that activity is up and the tone's improved. And it'll be interesting to see if this carries through post Labor Day. Hey, Arnaud. It's Scott. I'm just a little bit color from my standpoint as Jim and I have been traveling around the world, we're definitely spending time with other distribution partners. As a reminder, 18 of our 23 offices at KKR are outside the United States. And maybe behind your question, we agree with the sentiment that this is not just a U.S. opportunity in private wealth. We very much look at it as a global one and have built teams in Europe and Asia and are developing partnerships in both places in addition to the U.S. Hey, Brian. It's Scott. I'd say -- I would expect both deployment and monetizations to increase if the capital markets open up. As a reminder, we've got $100 billion of dry powder, and so that's great news from a deployment standpoint. When markets are shut, it's harder to get deals done. We've been more active, especially recently, but there's no doubt if the capital markets open, there'll be more -- overall M&A activity, which will accrue to our benefit, and you'll also see more monetizations and that'll run across asset classes, including to your question infrastructure. Hey, Rufus. It's Scott. I'd say to your question on would we do more M&A in the region and consolidate in that way. We'd be open to it. We're always looking. So, definitely open-minded.  The only other thing I would add is Global Atlantic is also now growing with partnerships in Asia. Something that we've been able to do now that we're together. We announced Block with AXA in Hong Kong. We, of course, announced the Japan Post Partnership this past quarter. We've announced some flow partnerships in Singapore is just one more example. And there's other discussions along those lines. Some are between organic and inorganic, but we do see opportunities to expand our insurance efforts in Asia as well. Yeah. Alex, it's Scott. Just maybe a little bit more color on the types of capital raising. This is going to be a bunch of different formats, so you're not going to see a large flagship fund would be my guess. But we do have an ABF fund. We have our BDCs. We have leveraged separate accounts. We have unleveraged separate accounts. We have a high grade ABF strategy, which also tends to be in separate account format, and there's other things that we're working on.

            "name": "Robert Lewin",
            "content": "Great. Thanks a lot, Craig. The operating backdrop has begun to improve and as Craig just ran through, our model continues to deliver consistent results. With that, let's shift the focus of the conversation to the future. Our model, growth trajectory, and culture are differentiated within our industry. I thought it would be beneficial to go through three of the foundational building blocks that have driven much of our differentiation and will importantly be a key driver of KKR's future earnings quality and growth. We have taken very deliberate steps to build a business that benefits from several different growth engines, providing both greater earnings stability and significant long-term earnings power. Number one, we've built a business that has meaningfully increased the durability and recurring nature of our revenues, and we expect that trend to continue. Page four of the earnings release highlights this point very well. On the left hand side of the page, you see that over just the past two and a half years, we have doubled our management fees, our most recurrent revenue stream from $1.4 billion in 2020 to $2.9 billion over the last 12 months, and fee-related earnings in turn have also increased meaningfully from $1.3 billion in 2020 to approximately $2.3 billion over the prior 12 months. Alongside this growth, the quality of these earnings has significantly improved as we've become much more diversified by strategy and by geography. In addition, the form of our capital base has also evolved, with our perpetual capital increasing from $22 billion at the end of 2020 to $200 billion today. Our perpetual capital now accounts for roughly 50% of our fee paying AUM relative to approximately 10% at the end of 2020. We will continue this focus of increasing both our recurring revenue and profitability, as well as diversifying the form of our fundraising and capital base. The second building block are the multiple identifiable growth avenues at across our business. We have discussed a number of these drivers over the last couple of earnings calls, but today I'm going to focus on just two areas that have been more notable in the quarter. Insurance and private wealth. Global Atlantic has continued to be a fantastic acquisition for us. Looking at the past few months, we've highlight two very important initiatives. In May GA announced a reinsurance agreement with MetLife funded by GA's balance sheet, our Ivy platform and co-investors. With this transaction, AUM will increase by $13 billion upon closing, and the transaction will be beneficial, both management fees as well as insurance operating earnings. And in June, KKR and GA together formed a strategic partnership with Japan Post Insurance. This partnership allows us to pursue additional growth opportunities through our collaboration with a key player in the Japanese insurance market. And as part of this, Japan Post committed meaningfully to Ivy II, which as Craig mentioned, held its final close in the quarter. Overall, GA is continue to demonstrate significant momentum with $144 billion of AUM as of Q2. This has doubled since we announced the acquisition in 2020, a further proof point of our acquisition and a demonstration of how the alignment we've created can drive real success. A specific area where GA has really helped accelerate the growth of one of our businesses is private credit. Today, we manage $78 billion in private credit with $45 billion of that in asset-based finance. We are a leader in the ABF space, encompassing both our high grade and higher yielding strategies. And with recent regional bank retrenchment, the already five plus trillion ABF addressable market has even more structural tailwinds for us, as those seeking capital look to KKR as a real solutions provider with scale. The multi-year relationship announced in the quarter with PayPal is just one recent example. And now turning to private wealth. We've touched on this topic a number of times given the market opportunity alongside the significant investments we have made in order to launch and distribute a number of new products. In Q2, we started fundraising for two new private wealth strategies focused on private equity and infrastructure. The launch of these products was a critical step in addressing the massive private wealth end market and introducing on a global scale products that traditionally have not been accessible to non-institutional clients. We're off to a really good start here. In total, including capital that has raised in Q2 and so far in Q3, we've raised $1.9 billion across these two strategies. While we are still in the very early days, these initial results are ahead of our expectations. We have also launched in just a handful of platforms so far, and we would expect that to increase over the coming quarters. In our credit business, we look forward to the launch of a new private BBC later this year. In addition to direct lending, the strategy incorporates a specific allocation to asset-based finance, which we think will be viewed as a real differentiator. So, at this point, we have a full suite of private wealth solutions strategically aligned with our four key investment verticals across the firm. Our focus here remains very much long-term oriented, ensuring that we are a real winner in the space over the next five to 10-plus years. Our conviction around success is high and is driven by a number of factors, including our brand, investment track record, our significantly expanded distribution and marketing teams, and our scale to be able to invest into the opportunity set. And importantly, each one of our core products across PE, infra, real estate and credit have aspects that are unique and a real testament to the innovation capabilities of our team. Now turning to building block number three. We continue to achieve substantial growth in our earnings power because of both an increase in our fee paying AUM and capital deployment. We currently have $10 billion of embedded gains that sit on our balance sheet. That's the fair value of our carry and investment portfolio relative to the underlying cost, that's up from $3.7 billion just a few years ago. This provides a real lens into our ability to create meaningful revenue outcomes in the future. And over the next few years, with continued investment performance and further capital deployment, that number is biased to increase, even as we expect to monetize more as the environment hopefully becomes more constructive. A reminder for how we think about earnings power. Distributable earnings is largely a cash metric. So, in times like these, when we sell less through the monetization environment, we are underearning that intrinsic earnings power and embedded gains are only one piece of that equation. Our expectation here is for continued scaling of our more recurring revenue businesses as well. Just looking at management fees alone, without raising another dollar, we currently have $38 billion of AUM with a weighted average management fee rate of almost a 100 basis points, that is not yet turned on. This capital once activated, would directly flow into management fees and be additive to earnings, but is not reflected today in our FRE or after tax DE. We also have $100 billion of dry powder, 96% of which is carry eligible. When we invest that capital, it creates the potential for more embedded gains and therefore revenue over time. These are the main reasons why we are so constructive around the potential for further significant and sustainable growth in our earnings per share over time. We have never been more confident around our model and our prospects, which is one of the reasons that you saw us buyback some stock in the quarter. Since the end of Q1, we have brought back or canceled approximately 6 million shares at an average price per share of less than $50 share. Repurchases have historically been and will continue to be an important driver of value creation for our shareholders. As a reminder, since we initiated our buyback program in 2015, we have bought back or canceled approximately 92 million shares at an average price per share of just over $27. This represents more than 10% of KKR shares outstanding today and almost 15% of our free float.  And with our recent acquisition such as KJRM, our Japanese REIT Manager and Global Atlantic, we have completed almost $5 billion of purchase price M&A with limited share issuance. We remain as a management team, the largest owners of stock, and are highly aligned with shareholders in our focus on equity value creation. So, to summarize, our earnings growth will continue to be supported by more stable forms of income, including our diversified high-quality and growing management fee business underpinned by our $200 billion of perpetual capital. Number two, we have several differentiated growth avenues, including insurance and private wealth amongst many others. And finally, our embedded gains and more broadly our earnings power is expected to continue to increase. These compounding pieces are why we continue to feel more confident than ever in our 2026 targets of $4-plus of FRE and $7-plus of after tax De per share. With that, Scott, Craig and I are happy to take your questions. Yeah. Great. Good morning Alex, and thanks a lot for the question. So, taking a step back just more broadly as it relates to capital allocation, the most important thing for us, and you've heard me say this and us as a management team say this before, most important thing is to have a consistent approach. And ours is one that I think is really maniacally focused on driving ROE and the highest per share earnings that we can with the lowest per unit of risk. And we talked about four strategic areas of deployment that we think can accomplish that. And so that's core private equity investing, continuing to invest across the insurance space. You mentioned strategic M&A. And the fourth one is share buybacks. And we think a real core competency of our management team is being able to move that marginal dollar of liquidity around to the highest return opportunity. And the thing that's going to drive the most earnings per share over time. And maybe the final point here is we're highly aligned in that decision-making process. As you know, KKR management owns close to 30% of KKR stock. And so, back to your specific question on share buybacks, as you mentioned, I noted on the prepared remarks, we've bought back over 90 million shares that represent almost 15% of our free float since we initiated our buyback program seven, eight years ago and just over $27 per share. So, we really like the body of work that's been accomplished over a long period of time.  And so, all to say share buybacks going to continue to be a very important part of our go-forward capital framework and capital allocation policy. But we're going to continue to look at other ways of driving growth in earnings per share over time as well, including in areas like core private equity insurance and M&A. Hope that's an helpful overview. And Glen, just a quick follow up on the 401 K point, no plans in the immediate future as it relates to that. I do think it's worth noting though that KPAC is structured in a way that can be distributed through to the accredited investor and not just qualified purchasers. It's one of those points of innovation that I highlighted in our prepared remarks. Yeah. Great. Thanks a lot for the question. As you noted, GA continues to perform at a really high level, and in Q2 was ahead of our target returns for GA at a 15%-plus, pretax ROE. In terms of the operating earnings in the quarter and why you saw that quarter-on-quarter decline, that you referenced, really a function of a strategic decision at the GA level to position our book in more liquid securities at the beginning of Q2, more cash, more liquid fixed income. If you think back to early part of Q2, we were still in that regional bank crisis timeframe and I think we made the right decision to reposition the book at that point in time, gave up a little bit of ROE in the quarter, as you noted, but I think the right decision for the business. Sure. Thanks a lot for the question, Mike. If you look our capital markets business year-to-date, we've generated $250 million of revenue. And if you look back over the past four quarters, we've averaged $110 million to $115 million of revenue. And so, we're really proud of that performance and environment where the capital markets put that in equity we're largely shut for most of that period of time. So, I feel like we've built a business model that is quite durable in tough operating conditions. In terms of the back half of the year, you've noticed some green shoots and we've certainly seen some signs of life in the leverage finance market, a little bit in the IPO market, maybe the secondary market follows. I think it's a little early to call that we're out of it, but we do really think that we're positioned in an environment where the capital markets come back to generate really outsized outcomes. Hopefully that environment really persists and we can generate those types of outcomes for our shareholders in 2024 and beyond. Like I remind you that in 2021, our capital markets business in a really up market generated $850 million of revenue. So, I feel like we've built this model that protects in the downside, but really offers the opportunity for outsized -- outcomes when the markets are open. And I think we are doing much more as a firm today than we did in 2021. So, I think the opportunity is greater as we go forward here with that business. Yeah. Thank you. And then, on your question on the monetization side, it's a bit of an odd quarter for us. We've got a couple of pretty meaningful monetizations that sit on the bubble between Q3 and Q4. So, instead of providing just a Q3 number in isolation, what I can let you know is that we have at least $350 million of visibility around monetization related revenue over the second half of the year. As usual, as we get to the end of this quarter, we'll provide that specific press release, which details our performance through the quarter. And so, what we're seeing a bit of an uptick here for sure. I think consistent with the overall tone and what we're all feeling is a bit more of a constructive environment. I'd still say that we're in the part of the cycle where we are underearning our intrinsic earnings power. So, hopefully more to come here, but a little bit of upside relative to where we've been. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Brian. And I think you could separate a little bit deployment and monetization. As Craig went through, there's a lot going on in the deployment side, and we've done our best as a firm to really be focused on linear deployment of the dry powder in our strategies. Of course, when the capital markets are open, it makes deployment a little bit easier, but there is no doubt when the capital markets are open and the overall level of volatility comes down for some period of time that it's going to open up real drivers to be able to generate monetization related revenue. I mentioned on the call, we've got $10 billion on our balance sheet today of effective embedded gains between carried interest and our balance sheet investments. So, we're very well-positioned to be able to take advantage of the market opening. And again, we hope that some of the green shoots we've seen here persist post Labor day, and that presents some really good opportunities for us to deliver outsized outcomes in 2024 and beyond. And then, Mike, very quickly, your second part of your question, in the quarter we deployed approximately $850 million off the balance sheet. A good chunk of that -- most of it is a core private equity. And then our realizations were a little under $250 million on the quarter. Great. Rufus, thanks a lot for the question. Asia remains a core part of our growth story at KKR, and we've talked about this in the past for a number of reasons. We feel really good that our Asia business one day will be as big as our U.S. business. So, we've got a great competitive position in the marketplace, plus private equity and infrastructure, both of which are the largest in the region in terms of fund sizes. We've got real growing businesses across real estate, as well as credit as well. In terms of the KJRM acquisition, that's off to a great start. And from a strategic standpoint, really doing what we wanted it to accomplish, which is to generate very consistent returns for their existing investor base, which translates into a very predictable management fees for us at KKR. But much more importantly, in terms of what it does for the rest of our opportunistic strategy and core plus strategy in the Japan market, just markedly changed our approach to what we're able to do in Japan. And really in terms of one of our big growth engines within Asia is the Japanese market. And our competitive position there is in particular really strong and KJRM really helps cement that."

During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following management's prepared remarks, the conference will be opened for questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I\u2019ll now hand the call over to Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.\nCraig Larson: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2023 earnings call. As usual, for the call, I'm joined by Scott Nuttall, our co-Chief Executive Officer; and Rob Lewin, our Chief Financial Officer. We'd like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, which is available on the Investor Center section at kkr.com. And as a reminder, we report our segment numbers on an adjusted share basis. This call will contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to our earnings release and our SEC filings for cautionary factors about these statements. This quarter, fee-related earnings per share came in at $0.62, and after-tax distributable earnings came in at $0.81 per share. I'm going to begin the call by walking through the details for the quarter before turning things over to Rob. So, beginning with management fees. Management fee growth continues to be a real bright spot for us. In Q1, management fees were $738 million. That's up 18% year-over-year, and looking over the last 12 months, management fees are up 23%. Looking a little deeper, over the last 12 months, management fees in private equity and credit both increased 18%, while in real assets, management fees are up 40%. Net transaction and monitoring fees were $142 million for the quarter, $102 million of which came from our Capital Markets business. Our fee-related compensation margin was at the midpoint for the quarter at 22.5% and other operating expenses were $150 million. So, putting that together, fee-related earnings were $549 million for the quarter or $0.62 per share, which I mentioned a moment ago, and that's with an FRE margin of 61%. This is now the 10th consecutive quarter where you've seen our FRE margin at or above that 60% level. Walking further down the income statement. Realized performance income totaled $175 million, driven by our traditional and core private equity businesses, and realized investment income was $198 million for the quarter, driven by activity in growth equity. Both realized performance and investment income compensation margins were at their midpoints for the quarter. Our asset management operating earnings were $778 million, and our insurance segment generated $205 million of pretax operating earnings, which I'll spend another minute on shortly. So in aggregate, this resulted in after-tax distributable earnings of $719 million or $0.81 per share. Now turning to investment performance. The traditional private equity business was up 2% for the quarter, and over the last 12 months, was down 9%. Importantly here, inception-to-date IRRs for our blended flagship funds, so Americas XII, Europe V and Asia IV remained strong at 22%, which is meaningfully ahead of the corresponding 7% figure for the MSCI World. In real assets, the real estate portfolio was down 3% in Q1. While we are all seeing a difficult market for a handful of areas within real estate, our portfolio continues to be heavily weighted towards those assets and themes where you're seeing strong fundamentals and cash flow growth. So, think industrial assets, data centers, rental housing, student housing and storage. However, as cap rates increased in the quarter, that more than offset NOI growth, leading to the modest decline in the portfolio for the quarter. Infrastructure was up 7% in the quarter. This performance reflects the strength of our infrastructure portfolio on a global basis. And with higher interest rates, we've strategically leaned into more inflation-protected assets. On the leveraged credit side, the portfolio was up 4% in the quarter, outperforming its index, while the alternative credit portfolio was up 2%. And for the balance sheet, investment performance was flat in Q1. Now, in addition, we have two new updates that can be seen through the earnings release. First, I briefly mentioned our insurance results this quarter. Turning back to this topic, we expect you saw the recast financials we posted last week on our website and also filed through an 8-K. These changes reflected two things. First, per FASB guidance and as required for all SEC filers, we implemented the accounting principles of LDTI within KKR's insurance segment to reflect the new accounting standards for long-duration contracts such as life insurance and annuities. Overall, the impact here on our segment financials are quite modest. There was a $1 million positive impact to 2021 pretax insurance segment operating earnings and a $74 million positive impact to 2022 pretax insurance segment operating earnings. And in terms of 12/31 book value, there is an increase of $480 million. And second, to conform to other alternative asset management companies and enhance comparability, we're reporting our insurance segment operating earnings on a pretax, not an after-tax basis. So, as you look at Page 3 of the earnings release, income taxes attributable to KKR's asset management and our insurance segment are now captured within that single line item titled Income Taxes on operating earnings. The 8-K referenced a moment ago recast our financials reflecting all of these changes for 2021 as well as on a quarterly basis for 2022 to help everyone look at our results on a comparable basis. And the second change within our press release you'll see on page 25. We\u2019ve included additional disclosure on our core private equity strategy. With $34 billion of AUM, we believe we have the largest core PE asset management business in the world. And core PE remains the largest allocation we have on our balance sheet, so we thought the additional disclosure and context would be helpful for investors this quarter as well as in quarters to come. As a reminder, this is a long-duration investment strategy for us where we expect to hold investments for 10- to 15-plus years and believe these investments carry a more modest risk return profile compared to traditional PE. And as you can see on the page, our core PE balance sheet investments have increased steadily from $1.4 billion in 2018 to over $5.7 billion of fair value today. The $5.7 billion of fair value compares to the $2.7 billion of costs or 2.1 multiple of cost currently, a strong return over approximately five years. In total, core comprises approximately 32% of total balance sheet investments and consists of 19 companies across multiple industries and geographies. And with a little over 20% of total PE capital invested in the last 12 months into core PE, we remain very active in the space. And one final note. Consistent with historical practice, we increased our dividend to $0.165 per share per quarter or $0.66 on an annualized basis. This is now the fourth consecutive year we've increased our dividend since we changed our corporate structure. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Rob.\nRob Lewin: Thanks a lot, Craig. The past few months have certainly continued to be dynamic on the macro front. However, different backdrops do create opportunities, especially for firms like ours that have substantial locked-up capital, a significant amount of dry powder and a global and highly coordinated investment team with expertise that spans multiple different asset classes. I thought it would be helpful this morning to go through what we are experiencing day-to-day across the firm. Let's start with fundraising. We raised $12 billion of capital in the quarter. In private equity, activity this quarter included the final close on European Fund VI at $8 billion, which is approximately 20% larger than its predecessor. It's a really great outcome in what is the most challenged part of the fundraising market and now gives us $40 billion of committed capital in total, looking at our active traditional PE funds across Asia, North America and Europe. We believe this is the largest active capital base for traditional private equity by a wide margin. In credit and liquid strategies, we raised almost $9 billion in Q1, which is just about what we raised on average per quarter in 2022. In total, though, the $12 billion of new capital raised is a little bit on the lighter side for us. Scott is going to follow up with a little more color on the fundraising environment in a few minutes. Now against this backdrop, we still do feel incredibly fortunate for a few reasons. First, since 2020, we've raised approximately $60 billion of capital for our traditional private equity and core private equity franchises. Given all the flagships raised over this period, 2023 was never going to be an outsized fundraising year for us. So, our focus in private equity is on investing the capital that we have previously raised. And we have almost as dry powder as we've ever had as a firm to invest into the dislocated environment. Now, to be clear, we are still in the market fundraising for 30-plus strategies, largely in real assets and credit over the next 12 to 18 months, and our fundraising teams remain highly engaged with our clients. Second, we continue to make progress against our strategic priorities. As an example, we've talked to private wealth and democratized products several times on these calls. And we are pleased that since our last earnings call, our democratized private equity vehicle outside the U.S. raised over $400 million on just one platform at its first close, which will show up in our Q2 results. It's a great start for us, and we hope to build on this momentum with the wire houses as the domestic vehicle comes on line in the second half of the year. And in terms of our democratized infrastructure strategy, our U.S. vehicle is expecting a first close over the summer, while its international counterpart is right on its heels with a first close expected soon thereafter. We are really excited about both of these strategies. And while we're in the earlier days, we're pleased with initial reception and enthusiasm. The launch of these products is a critical step in addressing the huge private wealth end market and bringing products that traditionally have largely not been accessible to non-institutional clients on a global scale. And third, on the insurance front, momentum really does continue at Global Atlantic. AUM at GA has almost doubled since we announced the acquisition in July 2020 from $72 billion to $142 billion today. And since the transaction closed in early 2021, our share of book value has increased from $2.9 billion to $4.4 billion. In terms of Q1, financial performance continued to run ahead of our expectations and capital raising remains robust. While GA did not announce any block transactions in Q1, our pipeline here of compelling opportunities remains quite strong, and we would expect greater activity over time. Turning now to deployment. We have $106 billion of dry powder, which is close to a record figure for us and feel really excited about the investing environment that we are currently in, so we remain incredibly well positioned to build the portfolio for the future. And looking what our teams have done more recently, we continue to be pretty creative of putting that capital to work. In European Private Equity, we announced the acquisition of FGS Global, a leading strategic communications advisory firm. This is the latest example of the team's focus on proprietary opportunities where we can provide long-term capital and a global network of resources to help an entrepreneurial, world-class management team that we've known and worked with for over a decade. In infrastructure, we closed on the acquisition of Vantage Towers in partnership with Vodafone. Vantage is our latest take-private transaction. We have announced or closed on 10 take-privates since the beginning of 2022. An investment largely from our diversified core Infra Fund, Vantage is the second largest telecom tower company in Europe. And in our credit business, we are very constructive on the risk reward we're seeing today in the market. As the syndicated loan markets have remained choppy, new issue volumes are down over 50% year-to-date. Companies looking for debt capital continue to increasingly look to the private credit markets where base rates are up, spreads are wider and lender protections are more significant. We believe that we are in the best direct lending environment that we have seen for the past 10-plus years. Now with interesting deployment, which largely comes from higher volatility does come a more challenged monetization environment. The environment here continues to be quiet and our expectation is that it will remain soft for much of 2023. However, as we've discussed in prior calls, our business model has multiple advantages. And one of them is that 90-plus percent of our capital is locked up for the long term or is perpetual in nature. So, we are not core sellers, and we won't look to aggressively monetize our portfolio unless it's into a window that maximizes outcomes for our investors. Even with the volatility and markdowns we have appropriately taken over the last 12 to 15 months, we maintain over $9 billion of embedded gains on our balance sheet. So, if we never made another investment and created no additional value or returns, we are positioned to generate $9-plus billion of monetization-related revenue. The key message you're hearing from us today is that we remain highly confident in our portfolio, and we'll optimize the monetization outcome when it is most advantageous to our investors. So to summarize, while the past several months have presented a more challenging operating environment, it has not changed our long-term outlook. We continue to have more conviction in our ability to meet our goals: FRE of $4-plus per share and after-tax DE of $7-plus per share by 2026 than we did when we first issued that guidance in late 2021. In our teaching materials posted at the beginning of this year, we introduced six very significant drivers of value creation for KKR. These areas, real assets, Asia Pacific, core private equity, private wealth, insurance as well as the opportunities afforded to us through our balance sheet continue to position us for substantial growth, and that is why we have the confidence that we do in our long-term fundamentals. With that, let me hand it off to Scott.\nScott Nuttall: Thank you, Rob, and thank you, everybody, for joining our call today. I thought today, I'd talk about what we're seeing near term and how we're feeling longer term. Near term, the market volatility is doing three things: it's causing some institutional asset allocators to be more cautious and delay decisions; it's making us want to sell less of our portfolio; and it's creating some very attractive investment opportunities for us. On the fundraising front, we are seeing some investors pause as they get their bearings. This is, in particular, true in some U.S. and European institutions. It has not been the case in other areas. Until this changes, it will likely slow down capital formation in the near term for some of our efforts. We don't expect this to have a big impact on the firm for a couple of reasons. First, as Rob noted, we are not in the market with our flagship PE funds this year. We expect those to come back to market in 2024 and 2025. Frankly, we're fortunate with that timing. We have been actively raising capital, however, for our non-private equity businesses. To put some numbers to this, new capital raised over the last 12 months totaled $67 billion. $63 billion or 95% of that number was raised in strategies outside of traditional private equity funds. Given the growth in scaling across our credit and real asset platforms, we are meaningfully more diversified across strategies than someone less familiar with KKR would likely expect. Second, we are seeing the benefit of increased diversification across our distribution channels and are less reliant on any 1 type of investor than we used to be. As background, a handful of years ago, we sold almost exclusively to institutions. Today, we sell to institutions, insurance and private wealth. Taking those in turn, while some institutions are pulling back or delaying a bit, others like sovereign wealth funds are not, and we are having a number of productive dialogues globally, in particular around private credit and real assets. Our insurance efforts are also scaling meaningfully. You heard the $142 billion number from Global Atlantic. If you include the $56 billion we have from third-party insurers, we now manage nearly $200 billion for insurance companies globally. That number is up nearly 50% from two years ago. Also, as Rob referenced, we are now live with our democratized PE and infrastructure strategies. Our democratized real estate product has been raising capital since mid-2021 and is adding more platforms. And we have another private credit vehicle for the wealth channel in the pipeline for later this year. So, we will have all four of our major asset classes in democratized format available globally and being added to multiple new platforms over the course of the next several quarters. Candidly, we don't yet know what all this will yield. But we do know it will be upside for us relative to what we've been doing to date. And we know that the private wealth opportunity is significant for the firm. So, we are diversifying KKR not just in how we invest but in how we access capital. And we see all this lining up really well for us over the next couple of years as we expect to be back in the market with our flagship funds at a more hospitable time, which will coincide with us continuing to scale our insurance efforts, which are proving countercyclical and benefiting from a higher rate environment, at which point, we will also be more mature in private wealth with our products on multiple platforms in multiple geographies, all while our recently expanded sales force, up from 100 to 280 people in the last couple of years, is hitting their stride. So, despite the near-term fundraising environment, we feel good about the progress we're making and now have multiple ways to win with more momentum coming. So, that all bodes well. On the monetization front, we will likely sell less in an environment like this, but we are seeing the value of the portfolio continue to grow so this is really just a timing question. And on the investing front, the great news is times like these tend to generate some of our best investments. We expect the next couple of years to be strong vintage years for returns across asset classes. So we expect our earnings down the road to be higher as we monetize the investments we're making in this environment. Putting this all together, while the near term may feel harder to interpret and the next couple of quarters may stay bumpy in markets, we actually feel great about how we are building the firm and executing our plan. Now, switching to the longer term. Last quarter, I referenced the market volatility and suggested it's important to separate the signal from the noise and that we remain focused on what we can control. That continues to be the case. The market noise has not changed our bottom line. We feel even more convicted in hitting the FRE and after-tax DE targets we shared with you. Let me explain why. In January, we shared how the earnings power of the firm has evolved. We are in a fundamentally different place than we were even a few years ago. Because we report DE largely on a cash basis, there will be times we are over-earning that earnings power and times we are under-earning. In times like this, when we are selling less, we are under-earning. But we look at how that earnings power is trending and our progress has been significant. Our ability to create forward-looking financial outcomes is well ahead of where we were just a few years ago. The capital we're raising is increasing the amount of dry powder we have, already a near record $106 billion. And we have a lot of management fee growth visibility with $37 billion of committed capital where fees turn on when the capital is invested. Our carry-bearing invested capital, up 3 times over the last five or so years, is continuing to scale with a great investing environment in front of us as we deploy our dry powder. And our embedded gains continue to increase, from $2 billion to $9 billion over the last three years. Putting all this together and stepping back, our run rate earnings power has doubled over the last three years at KKR. That's a metric we think matters, especially when the noise is loud. So, thank you for taking the time to understand our business. And hopefully, it's clear why we are so optimistic about the path and growth ahead. With that, we're happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs\nAlex Blostein Sachs: Maybe we could start with some of the dynamics you're seeing in private credit. And specifically, I was hoping we can zone in on direct lending. So, Scott, you suggested that's an area where you continue to see opportunities and the environment remains, obviously, quite interesting there. Can you help maybe unpack like sort of the sizing of that business for you guys outside of the BDC? And ultimately, how much of third-party capital outside of GA you have in there and the opportunity to really scale that where you could bring in third-party assets into the franchise? Thanks.\nScott Nuttall: Sounds good. Thanks for the question, Alex. Craig, why don't you kick off and then I'll jump on?\nCraig Larson: Yes, sure. So look, I think in terms of the industry, just to start there, Alex, and some of the dynamics we're seeing, I think mid-market private equity firms which really are a lot of the driver of the deployment you see here do have a lot of dry powder. And so you're seeing more of these firms, more mid-market borrowers generally who want to use the private debt markets. So we expect the private debt markets broadly in direct lending specifically to continue to grow and take share. And I think in terms of KKR, you should expect to see us grow here in a number of ways. First, in a traditional institutional format. So we're fundraising for our U.S. and European direct lending strategy. Second, we have our BDC, as you mentioned. And we think there'll be opportunities over time to introduce additional vehicles focused on the private wealth opportunity. And finally, Global Atlantic is also active here. So I think in summary, direct lending, it's a core part of our credit business, lots of ways for us to grow. We think that can be in the institutional private wealth, insurance businesses across multiple forms of capital, traditional funds, separately managed accounts, perpetual capital, and that's both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. So again, the backdrop for us just feels really constructive with lots of opportunities going out.\nScott Nuttall: Yes. Just a couple of thoughts I'd add, Alex. First off, if you think about our overall private credit and our corporate credit business, it's roughly $75 billion or so of assets. If you include real estate credit, which is a very large business for us, that adds another roughly $30 billion to $35 billion. So, we're $110 billion, give or take of total between the two. And that is, to your question, really fed across a number of different vehicles, we've got Global Atlantic, we've got our BDC and other permanent vehicles, we have funds, we have separate accounts and we're raising capital across all of those. And we continue to see, to Craig's point, a real opportunity to continue to scale those businesses, especially in this environment where the traditional banks are pulling back. But I would highlight a few things. Direct lending gets a lot of attention. The senior secured opportunity is definitely there. Spreads are wider, protections are greater. We think this is going to be a great vintage period, and we're finding real interest from investors around the world in that seniority plus yield off a higher base rate. So, we think that interest will continue. The other thing that doesn't get as much attention is our asset-based finance business, which is also a very large opportunity for us, a very large business. That is roughly a $4 trillion to $5 trillion end market in terms of opportunity, on its way to $7 trillion. This is -- think of it as a series of different hard assets and consumer assets that the banks use to finance that they're pulling back from. We have a number of platforms that we've created to go after that space, again accessed across all different types of vehicles I mentioned. And then real estate -- real estate credit, you can imagine what that market looks like over the next several years, it's going to be a big opportunity for us to scale there as well, and we're already one of the largest players. So big opportunity for growth as we think about how do we double our $200 billion-plus in credit globally again from here.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research.\nPatrick Davitt: You mentioned holding on to some things longer and pausing realizations, and last week, a competitor gave a pretty big guide down on PE realization expectations for the year, basically saying they didn't expect a big uptick until 2024. So, do you agree with this view? And I guess, more specifically looking at your pipeline and conversations, still think there's a path to posting meaningful pickup in the second half? Thank you.\nRob Lewin: Patrick, thanks for the question. I think -- and I provided this in the prepared remarks, we're seeing a pretty quiet monetization outlook out there right now. That's what we're seeing in our current pipeline. And our expectation is probably going to remain that way for the duration of the year. Now I think there's a few separate points to hit on here for KKR specifically. I think the most important point, and I mentioned this earlier, is that 90-plus percent of our capital at KKR is either perpetual or locked up for eight-plus years from inception. In terms of our carry-eligible AUM, I'd bet that number is probably closer to 100%. And so, we are generally not forced sellers into the marketplace. Number two, while the near term here could be pretty slow, there are a number of factors that really contribute to our confidence in being able to generate very meaningful step-ups in monetization-related revenue in the future when the environment improves. Number one, it's the health of our existing portfolio. It's really strong. I don't think that we can overstate that point enough. We feel really good that we got the macro right coming into this period of time, and we'll exit it in a stronger position competitively as a result. Number two is really the scaling and diversification of our capital deployment over the last 5 years that's going to generate the carry and balance sheet gains in the future. Scott hit on this in his prepared remarks, but our carry-eligible AUM is up 3 times versus the last vintage, which is generating today's carry. And number three, it's our dry powder, $106 billion, almost a record number for us, and 95-plus-percent of that $106 billion is carry-eligible. And so really the question here around the trade-offs between monetizing investments today versus in the future was one of the key reasons why we included that earnings power framework that we did in our teaching materials from January. It's that metric, I think, that really speaks to the go-forward opportunity for us and why we remain so constructive on the longer-term ability to generate real monetization outcomes and ultimately $7-plus per share of TDE by 2026.\nScott Nuttall: Yes. The only thing I'd add, Patrick, a couple of things. One, this is obviously going to be heavily market-dependent. I think Rob hit on it. We've gone from $2 billion to $9 billion of unrealized gains in the last three years. So that's the number that we track. That's why we shared that with this. So, this is just a matter of when do we choose that we want to monetize some of those gains on the margin, especially in U.S. and Europe. We're probably going to choose to wait. But keep in mind, one of the things we benefit from is a more global portfolio than most. Asia, in particular, has some different market dynamics going on right now. I think that will help on the margin. But the bigger picture message you should take is the $4-plus of FRE that we shared and the $7-plus of TDE per share a few years out, we still feel great about that. So I wouldn't get too worried about what we say in the next couple of quarters. I'd focus more on that earnings power and where do we expect to end up. My personal perspective is I would expect those numbers will go up relative to down based on what we're going through now.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Brian McKenna with JMP Securities.\nBrian McKenna: So I had a question on your infrastructure business. Fund IV has about $10 billion of uncalled commitments. So how should we think about the quarterly pace of deployment here for the remainder of the year? And then do you have any initial expectations around the size and timing of Fund V?\nCraig Larson: Brian, it's Craig. Why don't I start? First, on deployment, one of the things that is interesting and you've picked up on this is the real scaling you've seen over time in deployment. So in 2019, infra deployment was $2.1 billion. In 2020, it was $2.2 billion. And over the trailing 12 months, we've invested $14 billion across the infrastructure platform. Activity is very high. This remains among the busiest teams and the framework of our firm and it's global. And returns, again, as you would have seen the snapshot from page 7, have continued to be, we think, strong and differentiated. So I think the activity level continues to be high. We haven't announced anything as it relates to timing of future fundraising, et cetera. But I think if we continue to execute the way that we have, there'll be continued opportunities for us. And then 1 other point here is, again, innovation is not -- is going to continue in the framework of the firm. And I think you're seeing that real time in terms of what we talked about in the prepared remarks on democratized infrastructure as an avenue that also will continue to help us both from a deployment and honestly from a fundraising standpoint as well.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Mike Brown with KBW.\nMike Brown: So in the quarter, concerns related to the fixed annuity surrenders really picked up in March as the liquidity stress really led the market. In GA, what did you guys see in terms of the fixed annuity surrenders in the quarter and what have you seen thus far in the second quarter? And then if you just take the other side, what are you guys seeing on the organic growth side? How has that performance been in the first quarter, specifically towards the tail end and then into the second quarter?\nRob Lewin: Yes, Mike, it's Rob. Thanks a lot for the question. Punchline is no surprises as it relates to surrenders. They remain in line with management's expectation on initial underwriting. So we feel good about that. That has continued into the second quarter as well into April. As it relates to the opportunity from here, clearly, the opportunity, we think, on the retail side of the business, given where interest rates are and where annuity is price -- annuities are priced today remains a really robust 1 that our team is very focused on. We have a very strong market share there. And I mentioned this earlier through the prepared remarks, but the institutional side of our business has a real healthy pipeline right now. And so be a little bit lumpier in nature but we feel good with what we're seeing there and some of the risk reward that exists in that part of the market as well.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.\nBrian Bedell: Maybe just on capital deployment. How are you thinking about the pace? And I guess in the context of monetization slowing down, clearly, the market is slower and you don't want to be monetizing in this environment. And heard you loud and clear, you're eager, of course, to deploy in this environment with valuations being good. But to what extent will any kind of slowdown in the market will prevent you from doing that? And how important can your own internal capital markets business be in sort of narrowing that gap versus, say, using other means of deploying capital? And then if I could just weave in, just the $37 billion of committed capital that comes into fee-paying AUM, just your expectations of timing on that.\nCraig Larson: Brian, it's Craig. Why don't I start and then Rob can pick up on the $37 billion number? So just a couple of observations, I guess, in terms of deployment. Look, first, over the last 18 months, we've seen a lot of dislocation and valuations have come down pretty meaningfully. And a lot of the primary markets have either been shut, thinking of the IPO market or the syndicated debt markets, again, as an example, which aren't fully healed. So capital at the moment is precious, but all of those things from a deployment standpoint, we look at, I think, are very good things for us. And as Rob pointed out in our prepared remarks, with our fundraising success heading into this period, we're really well positioned when you put those 2 things together. Now I think in this backdrop, look, we're going to be value focused. We're going to look for those opportunities where our operational resources and focus can really move the needle. We love corporate carve-outs. We've been active in pursuing public to private, so I think that's an example of where you're seeing probably as much activity from us as anybody within the industry. And so we're going to continue to be opportunistic across that -- across those parts of the opportunity set. And I think finally, the other thing you're seeing because it's interesting is the balance you're seeing across the firm. Real diversification, real balance. Over the trailing 12 months, traditional private equity deployment was $11 billion. Real estate was $10 billion and infrastructure, again, as I mentioned a moment ago, was $14 billion. So you're seeing a real balance in that level of investment activity. And I think it's also just worth highlighting and it's kind of related to the first, but the growth you've seen also in terms of real asset deployment with the growth in our infrastructure and real estate platforms, you've seen a big step-up in overall deployment, and that is also true within the credit business. So in 2019, deployment in credit was $10 billion, 2020 was $10.3 billion, trailing 12 months, it was $17 billion. And then I think as it relates to capital markets, you're bringing up a very fair point just as it relates to the strength of the team and what having 70 people can do for us as we're trying to put capital structures together and look to finance those deployment opportunities. And to date, despite all of the disruption, we've not had a situation where we haven't been able to finance an opportunity that we wanted to pursue. And I think the strength of the team and the breadth that we have in terms of the global capital markets franchise has a critical part in that.\nScott Nuttall: Yes, Brian, it's Scott. Just a couple of things I'd add. One, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, I think it's going to be a great couple of vintage years we're walking into here. So if you first start with equity, which is probably the focus of your question, there's a couple of things that go on. Buyers and sellers need to find common ground. It usually takes about 12 months for that to happen as the markets adjust. We seem to be countering that. We're starting to work to the other side of that. Obviously, the bank failure has created a little bit of a pause in some discussions, but we are pretty active on a number of different fronts. So we think that will not be something that holds us up for much longer. I think the financing markets, to Craig's good point, capital markets and to your question, has been a secret weapon for us and has allowed us to get some deals done. We've done a couple of deals where we've spoken for 100% equity and then the private credit market shows up and put the financing in place. So we're not letting the financing markets hold us back in TE or in infrastructure. In fact, it's kind of creating some opportunities where maybe it's tougher for our competition that don't have the same capability sets and the same capital markets team. And then as I mentioned before, on the credit side, it's just more flow and more opportunity across both corporate and real estate credit for us.\nRob Lewin: And Brian, just a quick follow-up on the $37 billion of capital, no firm guidance there, but our -- a decent rule of thumb would be 3 to 4 years until that shows up in fee-paying AUM. As a reminder, that capital comes in at close to 100 basis points on a weighted average fee basis.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprys: As you guys have continued to grow out your insurance relationships, can you talk about how you have expanded your investment capabilities there, where you see room to further scale some of those capabilities maybe in real estate credit? And maybe you could talk about some of the initiatives there. And then what white space opportunities remain at this point where you could broaden out the investment capability set there?\nScott Nuttall: Michael, it's Scott. Really good question. I would say there's no doubt that broadening our insurance relationships, both with Global Atlantic and with third parties, has allowed us to meaningfully scale some parts of the firm. In particular, I would say, all things private credit, direct lending, asset-based finance that I mentioned before, maybe part of the firm that had the biggest impact was across real estate credit. I think the year before, we did the Global Atlantic transaction, a real estate credit team originated something like $2 billion of loans, and the first year after, it was somewhere in like $12 billion or $13 billion. So it's allowed us to meaningfully scale our presence, both from an origination standpoint and also allow us, I think, to do an even better job for the third-party insurers because now we are operating just like them through the regulatory environment that they're living with as an operator as opposed to just an agent. And I think there's opportunities to grow in all of those spaces. These are very large end markets. As you know, our strategy and everything we do is only be in businesses where we are or can get to top 3 in that space, and we feel great across all of those fronts. It also gives us an opportunity to look more globally as we're looking at, in particular, for Global Atlantic blocks across Asia or Europe and adding insurance clients outside the U.S., I'd say our client base is heavier in the U.S. today, but we are building relationships outside the U.S. as well. And that gives us an opportunity to expand, just like we did in the U.S., our origination footprint across all those areas, we can do it outside the U.S., too. And we're starting to do that now across both Europe and Asia across those asset classes. So it's been a big positive for us on a number of different fronts, and it kind of bolted us to top 3 across a number of those different businesses much faster. In terms of kind of white space, to the second part of your question, more broadly, I think there are a number of different things that we could point to. The biggest impact on the firm, however, is just going to be scaling everything that we started. We see an opportunity to double and triple several of the businesses that we're in. As you know, a lot of the businesses we've started in the last -- started in the last handful of years. Over 50% of the firm is not yet scaled in our definition. Over 50% of the money we raised last year is in strategies less than 5 years old. So the biggest impact is going to be scaling what we started. But there are some other areas. I'd point to energy transition and climate is something that we could point to. I'd point of life sciences as another big area that over time could be meaningful for us in terms of coming attractions.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. And if I could just sneak in a housekeeping question for Rob, just on the investment deployment off the balance sheet.\nScott Nuttall: We would have been disappointed if you didn't ask that one, Michael. You're very consistent.\nRob Lewin: Mike, we were at $500 million of deployment in the quarter and realization is about $150 million.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Arnaud Giblat with BNP Paribas.\nArnaud Giblat: I'd like to follow up on the deployment in credit. It's been detected by yourself and most of your peers as a significant opportunity to take market share from the banks. Yet when we look at Q1 data here, the promise in credit is quite soft. I was just wondering if you -- what sort of dynamics to work out for us to see really deploy and pick up here?\nCraig Larson: Yes, it's Craig. Why don't I start? Look, I think it's -- the first quarter, as I think we'll all remember, March, in particular, was a really disruptive period. We've had 2 bank failures since the beginning of March. Just a tremendous amount of volatility. And all of that -- those dynamics are not going to be helpful from a financing market standpoint, from a deal standpoint, as Scott had mentioned a moment or 2 ago. So I wouldn't read too much into the industry, honestly, in terms of these trailing 90 days. A lot of that activity in private credit does end up being financial sponsor-driven in the framework of new transactions. And we think over time, as you have refinancing opportunities as the market strengthens and as you have that M&A activity from mid-market sponsors pick up, that you'll see deployment in turn, pick up. As I think the overall share is 1 where you're continuing to see a growth in share in private credit broadly. So again, I wouldn't look to read too much into the trailing 90 days.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Benjamin Budish with Barclays.\nBenjamin Budish: I kind of wanted to revisit, Scott, some of your comments about fundraising. Just thinking about sort of the more excess caution across the LT base. Could you maybe characterize that a little bit? Is it sort of denominator effect issues? Or is it sort of a broad skittishness that's sort of just delaying all decision-making? And then kind of in the context of the 30 funds you've got coming to market, how much of that is expected to start raising in the back half of the year? Just maybe help us think through the sort of risk that some of that gets pushed further into 2024.\nScott Nuttall: Thanks, Ben. Look, in terms of the LP dynamics, it really depends on what product area you're talking about, what kind of investor you're talking about. So I'd say where there has been perhaps a bit more caution on the margin has been around U.S. and European pensions. And some of that is definitely a denominator effect as they're trying to get their bearings heading into this year. And some of them are over their alternatives allocation and trying to sort out how much of the budget do they want to spend and how quickly. But that is just that particular segment, and it tends to be more equity-focused as opposed to credit and real estate credit-focused in terms of those dynamics. But when you kind of go broader than that, you got the sovereign wealth funds, we're not feeling that dynamic at all, whether it's Asia or the Middle East, they seem to have a good amount of capital and are looking to put it to work across different asset classes and geographies. Insurance companies, despite the higher base rate, we continue to see a significant amount of interest in what we're doing. And you heard the comments that we're now a couple of hundred billion near enough that we're managing for insurance companies. It's been quite good for their businesses in terms of -- especially on the life and annuity side. And so we're getting the benefit of that growth. The family offices are actually a bit contrarian in this environment and reviewing this, which we agree with, is a great period to put money to work. So we're actually finding family offices leading in. And you can -- you know what we said about private wealth, that's all new. So this is the first time some of these spaces have had access to things like private equity and infrastructure. And so we'll see what all that yields but this is a new dynamic for us. So I wouldn't over-index to just the U.S. and European pensions. And I would say the footnote even on that score, I think some of them have learned from the post-GFC period, where maybe some invested less coming out of the financial crisis than they might have hoped. And so as opposed to turning off, we're finding maybe they're reducing the amount they're committing in this environment but not turning it off. The bigger point I would make is that if you think more broadly across everything that we're doing across private equity, infrastructure, real estate and credit, there is a significant amount of investor dialogue, both institutions and individuals. So I wouldn't take too much caution from the comments. Just on the margin, we are hearing this from some people. And I think the bank crisis in March probably fed that a bit, but there's also acknowledgment from a number of the people that we're talking to, but they don't want to underinvest or undercommit because I think there's an understanding the next couple of years are going to be a really good investment period. And as your question on the 30 investment strategies, I think most of those will be in the market over the course of the next 12 months, including the back half of this year.\nCraig Larson: And the only thing I'd add, Alex, to that last point, Ben, just again, I think the part of the market where we've seen the most headlines and where you're probably seeing the most congestion is in traditional private equity. Again, as we mentioned, we've had a final close on our Europe VI fund, 20% larger than its predecessor, great outcome. Probably worth noting that almost 25% of the LPs in that fund are new investors. They're now new clients of KKR. So we've talked for a long time on these calls of our focus on growing the LP base and the success that we're having there. But more importantly, following on that, again, as we've mentioned, we are now -- we're not going to be in the market with a flagship PE fund this year, and we don't expect to be back in the market until '24 or '25. And we feel fortunate with that timing. And instead, it allows us to focus on deploying that capital. So I think perhaps the traditional PE space might be the 1 place where you might hear people delaying or having the greatest impact on seeing those fundraises be elongated. And we're really fortunate in that we have no activity for the back half of this year.\nScott Nuttall: Maybe just one other macro comment I'd make, Ben, is if you think about this. If you step back and think about our firm, so 15 years ago, we managed about $50 billion of capital; 10 years ago at less than $100 billion; 5 years ago less than $200 billion. We're now in excess of $500 billion. And what we tend to find coming out of periods of time like this, we've got a bit of a market dislocation and the question around economic cycles is investors tend to look back and say what performed when the markets were difficult. And what we found is, over time, alternatives has tended to perform quite well. And usually, what happens coming out of an environment like this is they increase their allocation to alts. Our expectation is that the same thing will happen here. That will be a nice wind at our back as we kind of head into the next several years and launch the flagship funds that Craig was referencing. And then you've got on top of that, the compounding benefit of private wealth. So the reason you hear the optimism in our voices is over the next several years, we actually think we're going to look back on this period of time, I feel like this has been quite helpful and helps fuel the next leg of growth for the industry and for the firm.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Bill Katz with Credit Suisse.\nMichael Kelly: This is Michael Kelly on for Bill. You've seen a nice uptrend in the non-GA-related credit fee rate over the last 4 quarters with a nice step-up in 1Q. Was there anything to call out in the fee rate this quarter? And then how should we think about the trend in that moving forward from here?\nRob Lewin: Thanks, Michael. Nothing specifically to call out. It's a little bit of a mix issue that we're benefiting from. You'd see that uptick, but nothing specifically other than a little bit of mix of product.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Finian O'Shea with Wells Fargo.\nFinian O\u2019Shea: Just sort of a follow-up to the last question on the higher fee rate. Is there an ability to rotate sort of the back book into more direct origination now that longer-term yields have come back down? And if so, how would you size that runway or opportunity for, say, optimizing the GA book?\nRob Lewin: And yes, just to clarify for -- just to separate those 2, that question was related to Global Atlantic. When we first purchased Global Atlantic, we spent a lot of time working with the team to make sure that we were very thoughtful around how we rotated the book from GA-sourced assets to KKR-sourced assets. We weren't in a rush. We continue not to be in a rush and that's happened methodically over time. And as a result, you've seen our blended fee rate step up in a pretty balanced way over the last couple of years. Today, our blended fee rate at GA when you cut through all the math is roughly 30 basis points. I think there's some opportunity over time to continue to rotate the book. We'll continue to do that in the most thoughtful way. We can in conjunction with the GA investment team. But I wouldn't expect any market changes from the trajectory that we've had over the last couple of years.\nOperator: The next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.\nAlex Blostein: Maybe just like zooming out for a second. I was hoping to get your latest perspective on capital management in light of kind of where we are in the cycle. Yourself and, obviously, many of your peers are going through a bit of an earnings lull, but you outlined multiple times now that the firm continues to be really well positioned. You guys have a significant amount of embedded earnings power as you've outlined. So why not lean into the share count shrinkage a little bit more here to take advantage of significantly higher earnings power down the road?\nRob Lewin: Yes. Thanks, Alex. It's a good question, the right question. I'll start with just a broader framework around capital allocation. You probably heard me say this a couple of times before. The most important thing that we can do as a management team is to have a consistent approach. Our approach is very much ROE-based. And ultimately, when we're allocating capital, the question that we are always looking to answer is what is going to drive the best risk-adjusted outcome on a per share basis. There's no more important question than that. And we think, as a management team, moving our marginal dollar of liquidity around to the highest ROE opportunity is a real core competency. Now specifically on the question of share buyback, if you take a look at our body of work, we've had our buyback authorization now in place for several years. We've repurchased or retired 85-plus million shares. That's almost 10% of our shares outstanding. It's well north of 10% of our public float. The average price of which we've bought back or retired those shares by $25 a share. So we really like our body of work. And on top of that, at the same time, if you look back over the past couple of years, whether that's -- excuse me, whether that's KKRM or Global Atlantic, we've completed almost $5 billion of purchase price-related M&A, and we haven't had to issue that many shares to be able to do that -- do those transactions but mostly cash funded. And so when you take a step back, we don't look at share buyback in sort of 1 discrete bucket. We look at capital allocation as a whole. Now all to say, we do expect share buybacks to be a big part of our toolkit on a go-forward basis, and we're going to evaluate them the same way we evaluate all capital allocation. But yes, as we think over the next number of quarters and years, you're going to continue to see us lean into our share count when it makes sense. From a liquidity standpoint, when it makes sense from an opportunity relative to other opportunity sets out there and then obviously where our share price is at. So thanks for the question. Hopefully, that's helpful color in how we, as a management team, value using our marginal dollars of liquidity.\nOperator: Our final question is from the line of Finian O'Shea with Wells Fargo.\nFinian O\u2019Shea: Can you touch on the outlook for capital market transaction fees? I think those looked a little strong in the context of the softer environment. Was a lot of this perhaps a one-off? Or has the development of your platform there started to show through and maybe we can expect stable to improving levels throughout the year?\nRob Lewin: Yes. We're really proud of how durable our Capital Markets business has been in what has been a really tough capital markets environment. Obviously, equity markets largely shut. Leveraged finance markets have been largely shut for some period of time. And if you look at our average quarterly revenue over the past four quarters, it's been a little bit north of $100 million per quarter. And so I think it's important to think about that in context of our Capital Markets franchise. 7-plus years ago is probably a $200 million a year business in good markets. 5-plus years ago is probably a $400 million year in good markets type business. And today, our LTM revenue is a little bit north of that $400 million number in a really tough environment. And so no guidance as it relates to forward-looking quarters, but we do look at the performance that the team has been able to generate in a really tough market and feel really great about how we're positioned and do know that when we do come out of this period of time, when markets open back up, we, as a management team, have every expectation that we're going to be talking about a Capital Markets business 3, 5 years from now that's well in excess of the size that it is today for a number of reasons, just how we're positioned competitively, our access to talent. We see a lot of talent potentially coming out of, traditional source of capital markets institutions where we could take advantage of that. And then as KKR expands what we do, that's a real opportunity for our Capital Markets business.\nFinian O\u2019Shea: That's very helpful. And one final, if I may. Any color or line of sight on second quarter monetizations?\nRob Lewin: Great. Thanks for that question. It's plus or minus around $125 million of forward look that we have, again, in context of the $9-plus billion of embedded gains on our balance sheet.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. And I'll hand the floor back to Craig Larson for closing remarks.\nCraig Larson: Rob, thank you for your help, and thank you everyone for your interest in KKR. We look forward to speaking again post our Q2 results. And if you have any questions in the interim, please, of course, follow up with us directly. Thank you once again.\nOperator: Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rob Lewin",
            "content": "Thanks a lot, Craig. The past few months have certainly continued to be dynamic on the macro front. However, different backdrops do create opportunities, especially for firms like ours that have substantial locked-up capital, a significant amount of dry powder and a global and highly coordinated investment team with expertise that spans multiple different asset classes. I thought it would be helpful this morning to go through what we are experiencing day-to-day across the firm. Let's start with fundraising. We raised $12 billion of capital in the quarter. In private equity, activity this quarter included the final close on European Fund VI at $8 billion, which is approximately 20% larger than its predecessor. It's a really great outcome in what is the most challenged part of the fundraising market and now gives us $40 billion of committed capital in total, looking at our active traditional PE funds across Asia, North America and Europe. We believe this is the largest active capital base for traditional private equity by a wide margin. In credit and liquid strategies, we raised almost $9 billion in Q1, which is just about what we raised on average per quarter in 2022. In total, though, the $12 billion of new capital raised is a little bit on the lighter side for us. Scott is going to follow up with a little more color on the fundraising environment in a few minutes. Now against this backdrop, we still do feel incredibly fortunate for a few reasons. First, since 2020, we've raised approximately $60 billion of capital for our traditional private equity and core private equity franchises. Given all the flagships raised over this period, 2023 was never going to be an outsized fundraising year for us. So, our focus in private equity is on investing the capital that we have previously raised. And we have almost as dry powder as we've ever had as a firm to invest into the dislocated environment. Now, to be clear, we are still in the market fundraising for 30-plus strategies, largely in real assets and credit over the next 12 to 18 months, and our fundraising teams remain highly engaged with our clients. Second, we continue to make progress against our strategic priorities. As an example, we've talked to private wealth and democratized products several times on these calls. And we are pleased that since our last earnings call, our democratized private equity vehicle outside the U.S. raised over $400 million on just one platform at its first close, which will show up in our Q2 results. It's a great start for us, and we hope to build on this momentum with the wire houses as the domestic vehicle comes on line in the second half of the year. And in terms of our democratized infrastructure strategy, our U.S. vehicle is expecting a first close over the summer, while its international counterpart is right on its heels with a first close expected soon thereafter. We are really excited about both of these strategies. And while we're in the earlier days, we're pleased with initial reception and enthusiasm. The launch of these products is a critical step in addressing the huge private wealth end market and bringing products that traditionally have largely not been accessible to non-institutional clients on a global scale. And third, on the insurance front, momentum really does continue at Global Atlantic. AUM at GA has almost doubled since we announced the acquisition in July 2020 from $72 billion to $142 billion today. And since the transaction closed in early 2021, our share of book value has increased from $2.9 billion to $4.4 billion. In terms of Q1, financial performance continued to run ahead of our expectations and capital raising remains robust. While GA did not announce any block transactions in Q1, our pipeline here of compelling opportunities remains quite strong, and we would expect greater activity over time. Turning now to deployment. We have $106 billion of dry powder, which is close to a record figure for us and feel really excited about the investing environment that we are currently in, so we remain incredibly well positioned to build the portfolio for the future. And looking what our teams have done more recently, we continue to be pretty creative of putting that capital to work. In European Private Equity, we announced the acquisition of FGS Global, a leading strategic communications advisory firm. This is the latest example of the team's focus on proprietary opportunities where we can provide long-term capital and a global network of resources to help an entrepreneurial, world-class management team that we've known and worked with for over a decade. In infrastructure, we closed on the acquisition of Vantage Towers in partnership with Vodafone. Vantage is our latest take-private transaction. We have announced or closed on 10 take-privates since the beginning of 2022. An investment largely from our diversified core Infra Fund, Vantage is the second largest telecom tower company in Europe. And in our credit business, we are very constructive on the risk reward we're seeing today in the market. As the syndicated loan markets have remained choppy, new issue volumes are down over 50% year-to-date. Companies looking for debt capital continue to increasingly look to the private credit markets where base rates are up, spreads are wider and lender protections are more significant. We believe that we are in the best direct lending environment that we have seen for the past 10-plus years. Now with interesting deployment, which largely comes from higher volatility does come a more challenged monetization environment. The environment here continues to be quiet and our expectation is that it will remain soft for much of 2023. However, as we've discussed in prior calls, our business model has multiple advantages. And one of them is that 90-plus percent of our capital is locked up for the long term or is perpetual in nature. So, we are not core sellers, and we won't look to aggressively monetize our portfolio unless it's into a window that maximizes outcomes for our investors. Even with the volatility and markdowns we have appropriately taken over the last 12 to 15 months, we maintain over $9 billion of embedded gains on our balance sheet. So, if we never made another investment and created no additional value or returns, we are positioned to generate $9-plus billion of monetization-related revenue. The key message you're hearing from us today is that we remain highly confident in our portfolio, and we'll optimize the monetization outcome when it is most advantageous to our investors. So to summarize, while the past several months have presented a more challenging operating environment, it has not changed our long-term outlook. We continue to have more conviction in our ability to meet our goals: FRE of $4-plus per share and after-tax DE of $7-plus per share by 2026 than we did when we first issued that guidance in late 2021. In our teaching materials posted at the beginning of this year, we introduced six very significant drivers of value creation for KKR. These areas, real assets, Asia Pacific, core private equity, private wealth, insurance as well as the opportunities afforded to us through our balance sheet continue to position us for substantial growth, and that is why we have the confidence that we do in our long-term fundamentals. With that, let me hand it off to Scott. Patrick, thanks for the question. I think -- and I provided this in the prepared remarks, we're seeing a pretty quiet monetization outlook out there right now. That's what we're seeing in our current pipeline. And our expectation is probably going to remain that way for the duration of the year. Now I think there's a few separate points to hit on here for KKR specifically. I think the most important point, and I mentioned this earlier, is that 90-plus percent of our capital at KKR is either perpetual or locked up for eight-plus years from inception. In terms of our carry-eligible AUM, I'd bet that number is probably closer to 100%. And so, we are generally not forced sellers into the marketplace. Number two, while the near term here could be pretty slow, there are a number of factors that really contribute to our confidence in being able to generate very meaningful step-ups in monetization-related revenue in the future when the environment improves. Number one, it's the health of our existing portfolio. It's really strong. I don't think that we can overstate that point enough. We feel really good that we got the macro right coming into this period of time, and we'll exit it in a stronger position competitively as a result. Number two is really the scaling and diversification of our capital deployment over the last 5 years that's going to generate the carry and balance sheet gains in the future. Scott hit on this in his prepared remarks, but our carry-eligible AUM is up 3 times versus the last vintage, which is generating today's carry. And number three, it's our dry powder, $106 billion, almost a record number for us, and 95-plus-percent of that $106 billion is carry-eligible. And so really the question here around the trade-offs between monetizing investments today versus in the future was one of the key reasons why we included that earnings power framework that we did in our teaching materials from January. It's that metric, I think, that really speaks to the go-forward opportunity for us and why we remain so constructive on the longer-term ability to generate real monetization outcomes and ultimately $7-plus per share of TDE by 2026. Yes, Mike, it's Rob. Thanks a lot for the question. Punchline is no surprises as it relates to surrenders. They remain in line with management's expectation on initial underwriting. So we feel good about that. That has continued into the second quarter as well into April. As it relates to the opportunity from here, clearly, the opportunity, we think, on the retail side of the business, given where interest rates are and where annuity is price -- annuities are priced today remains a really robust 1 that our team is very focused on. We have a very strong market share there. And I mentioned this earlier through the prepared remarks, but the institutional side of our business has a real healthy pipeline right now. And so be a little bit lumpier in nature but we feel good with what we're seeing there and some of the risk reward that exists in that part of the market as well. And Brian, just a quick follow-up on the $37 billion of capital, no firm guidance there, but our -- a decent rule of thumb would be 3 to 4 years until that shows up in fee-paying AUM. As a reminder, that capital comes in at close to 100 basis points on a weighted average fee basis. Mike, we were at $500 million of deployment in the quarter and realization is about $150 million. Thanks, Michael. Nothing specifically to call out. It's a little bit of a mix issue that we're benefiting from. You'd see that uptick, but nothing specifically other than a little bit of mix of product. And yes, just to clarify for -- just to separate those 2, that question was related to Global Atlantic. When we first purchased Global Atlantic, we spent a lot of time working with the team to make sure that we were very thoughtful around how we rotated the book from GA-sourced assets to KKR-sourced assets.

We'll continue to do that in the most thoughtful way. We can in conjunction with the GA investment team.

But yes, as we think over the next number of quarters and years, you're going to continue to see us lean into our share count when it makes sense. From a liquidity standpoint, when it makes sense from an opportunity relative to other opportunity sets out there and then obviously where our share price is at. So thanks for the question. Hopefully, that's helpful color in how we, as a management team, value using our marginal dollars of liquidity. Yes. We're really proud of how durable our Capital Markets business has been in what has been a really tough capital markets environment. Obviously, equity markets largely shut. Leveraged finance markets have been largely shut for some period of time. And if you look at our average quarterly revenue over the past four quarters, it's been a little bit north of $100 million per quarter. And so I think it's important to think about that in context of our Capital Markets franchise. 7-plus years ago is probably a $200 million a year business in good markets. 5-plus years ago is probably a $400 million year in good markets type business. And today, our LTM revenue is a little bit north of that $400 million number in a really tough environment. And so no guidance as it relates to forward-looking quarters, but we do look at the performance that the team has been able to generate in a really tough market and feel really great about how we're positioned and do know that when we do come out of this period of time, when markets open back up, we, as a management team, have every expectation that we're going to be talking about a Capital Markets business 3, 5 years from now that's well in excess of the size that it is today for a number of reasons, just how we're positioned competitively, our access to talent.

And then as KKR expands what we do, that's a real opportunity for our Capital Markets business. Great. Thanks for that question. It's plus or minus around $125 million of forward look that we have, again, in context of the $9-plus billion of embedded gains on our balance sheet."

            "name": "Scott Nuttall",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob, and thank you, everybody, for joining our call today. I thought today, I'd talk about what we're seeing near term and how we're feeling longer term. Near term, the market volatility is doing three things: it's causing some institutional asset allocators to be more cautious and delay decisions; it's making us want to sell less of our portfolio; and it's creating some very attractive investment opportunities for us. On the fundraising front, we are seeing some investors pause as they get their bearings. This is, in particular, true in some U.S. and European institutions. It has not been the case in other areas. Until this changes, it will likely slow down capital formation in the near term for some of our efforts. We don't expect this to have a big impact on the firm for a couple of reasons. First, as Rob noted, we are not in the market with our flagship PE funds this year. We expect those to come back to market in 2024 and 2025. Frankly, we're fortunate with that timing. We have been actively raising capital, however, for our non-private equity businesses. To put some numbers to this, new capital raised over the last 12 months totaled $67 billion. $63 billion or 95% of that number was raised in strategies outside of traditional private equity funds. Given the growth in scaling across our credit and real asset platforms, we are meaningfully more diversified across strategies than someone less familiar with KKR would likely expect. Second, we are seeing the benefit of increased diversification across our distribution channels and are less reliant on any 1 type of investor than we used to be. As background, a handful of years ago, we sold almost exclusively to institutions. Today, we sell to institutions, insurance and private wealth. Taking those in turn, while some institutions are pulling back or delaying a bit, others like sovereign wealth funds are not, and we are having a number of productive dialogues globally, in particular around private credit and real assets. Our insurance efforts are also scaling meaningfully. You heard the $142 billion number from Global Atlantic. If you include the $56 billion we have from third-party insurers, we now manage nearly $200 billion for insurance companies globally. That number is up nearly 50% from two years ago. Also, as Rob referenced, we are now live with our democratized PE and infrastructure strategies. Our democratized real estate product has been raising capital since mid-2021 and is adding more platforms. And we have another private credit vehicle for the wealth channel in the pipeline for later this year. So, we will have all four of our major asset classes in democratized format available globally and being added to multiple new platforms over the course of the next several quarters. Candidly, we don't yet know what all this will yield. But we do know it will be upside for us relative to what we've been doing to date. And we know that the private wealth opportunity is significant for the firm. So, we are diversifying KKR not just in how we invest but in how we access capital. And we see all this lining up really well for us over the next couple of years as we expect to be back in the market with our flagship funds at a more hospitable time, which will coincide with us continuing to scale our insurance efforts, which are proving countercyclical and benefiting from a higher rate environment, at which point, we will also be more mature in private wealth with our products on multiple platforms in multiple geographies, all while our recently expanded sales force, up from 100 to 280 people in the last couple of years, is hitting their stride. So, despite the near-term fundraising environment, we feel good about the progress we're making and now have multiple ways to win with more momentum coming. So, that all bodes well. On the monetization front, we will likely sell less in an environment like this, but we are seeing the value of the portfolio continue to grow so this is really just a timing question. And on the investing front, the great news is times like these tend to generate some of our best investments. We expect the next couple of years to be strong vintage years for returns across asset classes. So we expect our earnings down the road to be higher as we monetize the investments we're making in this environment. Putting this all together, while the near term may feel harder to interpret and the next couple of quarters may stay bumpy in markets, we actually feel great about how we are building the firm and executing our plan. Now, switching to the longer term. Last quarter, I referenced the market volatility and suggested it's important to separate the signal from the noise and that we remain focused on what we can control. That continues to be the case. The market noise has not changed our bottom line. We feel even more convicted in hitting the FRE and after-tax DE targets we shared with you. Let me explain why. In January, we shared how the earnings power of the firm has evolved. We are in a fundamentally different place than we were even a few years ago. Because we report DE largely on a cash basis, there will be times we are over-earning that earnings power and times we are under-earning. In times like this, when we are selling less, we are under-earning. But we look at how that earnings power is trending and our progress has been significant. Our ability to create forward-looking financial outcomes is well ahead of where we were just a few years ago. The capital we're raising is increasing the amount of dry powder we have, already a near record $106 billion. And we have a lot of management fee growth visibility with $37 billion of committed capital where fees turn on when the capital is invested. Our carry-bearing invested capital, up 3 times over the last five or so years, is continuing to scale with a great investing environment in front of us as we deploy our dry powder. And our embedded gains continue to increase, from $2 billion to $9 billion over the last three years. Putting all this together and stepping back, our run rate earnings power has doubled over the last three years at KKR. That's a metric we think matters, especially when the noise is loud. So, thank you for taking the time to understand our business. And hopefully, it's clear why we are so optimistic about the path and growth ahead. With that, we're happy to take your questions. Sounds good. Thanks for the question, Alex. Craig, why don't you kick off and then I'll jump on? Yes. Just a couple of thoughts I'd add, Alex. First off, if you think about our overall private credit and our corporate credit business, it's roughly $75 billion or so of assets. If you include real estate credit, which is a very large business for us, that adds another roughly $30 billion to $35 billion. So, we're $110 billion, give or take of total between the two. And that is, to your question, really fed across a number of different vehicles, we've got Global Atlantic, we've got our BDC and other permanent vehicles, we have funds, we have separate accounts and we're raising capital across all of those. And we continue to see, to Craig's point, a real opportunity to continue to scale those businesses, especially in this environment where the traditional banks are pulling back. But I would highlight a few things. Direct lending gets a lot of attention. The senior secured opportunity is definitely there. Spreads are wider, protections are greater. We think this is going to be a great vintage period, and we're finding real interest from investors around the world in that seniority plus yield off a higher base rate. So, we think that interest will continue. The other thing that doesn't get as much attention is our asset-based finance business, which is also a very large opportunity for us, a very large business. That is roughly a $4 trillion to $5 trillion end market in terms of opportunity, on its way to $7 trillion. This is -- think of it as a series of different hard assets and consumer assets that the banks use to finance that they're pulling back from. We have a number of platforms that we've created to go after that space, again accessed across all different types of vehicles I mentioned. And then real estate -- real estate credit, you can imagine what that market looks like over the next several years, it's going to be a big opportunity for us to scale there as well, and we're already one of the largest players. So big opportunity for growth as we think about how do we double our $200 billion-plus in credit globally again from here. Yes. The only thing I'd add, Patrick, a couple of things. One, this is obviously going to be heavily market-dependent. I think Rob hit on it. We've gone from $2 billion to $9 billion of unrealized gains in the last three years. So that's the number that we track. That's why we shared that with this. So, this is just a matter of when do we choose that we want to monetize some of those gains on the margin, especially in U.S. and Europe. We're probably going to choose to wait. But keep in mind, one of the things we benefit from is a more global portfolio than most. Asia, in particular, has some different market dynamics going on right now. I think that will help on the margin. But the bigger picture message you should take is the $4-plus of FRE that we shared and the $7-plus of TDE per share a few years out, we still feel great about that. So I wouldn't get too worried about what we say in the next couple of quarters. I'd focus more on that earnings power and where do we expect to end up. My personal perspective is I would expect those numbers will go up relative to down based on what we're going through now. Yes, Brian, it's Scott. Just a couple of things I'd add. One, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, I think it's going to be a great couple of vintage years we're walking into here. So if you first start with equity, which is probably the focus of your question, there's a couple of things that go on. Buyers and sellers need to find common ground. It usually takes about 12 months for that to happen as the markets adjust. We seem to be countering that. We're starting to work to the other side of that. Obviously, the bank failure has created a little bit of a pause in some discussions, but we are pretty active on a number of different fronts. So we think that will not be something that holds us up for much longer. I think the financing markets, to Craig's good point, capital markets and to your question, has been a secret weapon for us and has allowed us to get some deals done. We've done a couple of deals where we've spoken for 100% equity and then the private credit market shows up and put the financing in place. So we're not letting the financing markets hold us back in TE or in infrastructure. In fact, it's kind of creating some opportunities where maybe it's tougher for our competition that don't have the same capability sets and the same capital markets team. And then as I mentioned before, on the credit side, it's just more flow and more opportunity across both corporate and real estate credit for us. Michael, it's Scott. Really good question. I would say there's no doubt that broadening our insurance relationships, both with Global Atlantic and with third parties, has allowed us to meaningfully scale some parts of the firm. In particular, I would say, all things private credit, direct lending, asset-based finance that I mentioned before, maybe part of the firm that had the biggest impact was across real estate credit. I think the year before, we did the Global Atlantic transaction, a real estate credit team originated something like $2 billion of loans, and the first year after, it was somewhere in like $12 billion or $13 billion. So it's allowed us to meaningfully scale our presence, both from an origination standpoint and also allow us, I think, to do an even better job for the third-party insurers because now we are operating just like them through the regulatory environment that they're living with as an operator as opposed to just an agent. And I think there's opportunities to grow in all of those spaces. These are very large end markets. As you know, our strategy and everything we do is only be in businesses where we are or can get to top 3 in that space, and we feel great across all of those fronts. It also gives us an opportunity to look more globally as we're looking at, in particular, for Global Atlantic blocks across Asia or Europe and adding insurance clients outside the U.S., I'd say our client base is heavier in the U.S. today, but we are building relationships outside the U.S. as well. And that gives us an opportunity to expand, just like we did in the U.S., our origination footprint across all those areas, we can do it outside the U.S., too. And we're starting to do that now across both Europe and Asia across those asset classes. So it's been a big positive for us on a number of different fronts, and it kind of bolted us to top 3 across a number of those different businesses much faster. In terms of kind of white space, to the second part of your question, more broadly, I think there are a number of different things that we could point to. The biggest impact on the firm, however, is just going to be scaling everything that we started. We see an opportunity to double and triple several of the businesses that we're in. As you know, a lot of the businesses we've started in the last -- started in the last handful of years. Over 50% of the firm is not yet scaled in our definition. Over 50% of the money we raised last year is in strategies less than 5 years old. So the biggest impact is going to be scaling what we started. But there are some other areas. I'd point to energy transition and climate is something that we could point to. I'd point of life sciences as another big area that over time could be meaningful for us in terms of coming attractions. We would have been disappointed if you didn't ask that one, Michael. You're very consistent. Thanks, Ben. Look, in terms of the LP dynamics, it really depends on what product area you're talking about, what kind of investor you're talking about. So I'd say where there has been perhaps a bit more caution on the margin has been around U.S. and European pensions. And some of that is definitely a denominator effect as they're trying to get their bearings heading into this year. And some of them are over their alternatives allocation and trying to sort out how much of the budget do they want to spend and how quickly. But that is just that particular segment, and it tends to be more equity-focused as opposed to credit and real estate credit-focused in terms of those dynamics. But when you kind of go broader than that, you got the sovereign wealth funds, we're not feeling that dynamic at all, whether it's Asia or the Middle East, they seem to have a good amount of capital and are looking to put it to work across different asset classes and geographies. Insurance companies, despite the higher base rate, we continue to see a significant amount of interest in what we're doing. And you heard the comments that we're now a couple of hundred billion near enough that we're managing for insurance companies. It's been quite good for their businesses in terms of -- especially on the life and annuity side. And so we're getting the benefit of that growth. The family offices are actually a bit contrarian in this environment and reviewing this, which we agree with, is a great period to put money to work. So we're actually finding family offices leading in. And you can -- you know what we said about private wealth, that's all new. So this is the first time some of these spaces have had access to things like private equity and infrastructure. And so we'll see what all that yields but this is a new dynamic for us. So I wouldn't over-index to just the U.S. and European pensions. And I would say the footnote even on that score, I think some of them have learned from the post-GFC period, where maybe some invested less coming out of the financial crisis than they might have hoped. And so as opposed to turning off, we're finding maybe they're reducing the amount they're committing in this environment but not turning it off. The bigger point I would make is that if you think more broadly across everything that we're doing across private equity, infrastructure, real estate and credit, there is a significant amount of investor dialogue, both institutions and individuals. So I wouldn't take too much caution from the comments. Just on the margin, we are hearing this from some people. And I think the bank crisis in March probably fed that a bit, but there's also acknowledgment from a number of the people that we're talking to, but they don't want to underinvest or undercommit because I think there's an understanding the next couple of years are going to be a really good investment period. And as your question on the 30 investment strategies, I think most of those will be in the market over the course of the next 12 months, including the back half of this year. Maybe just one other macro comment I'd make, Ben, is if you think about this. If you step back and think about our firm, so 15 years ago, we managed about $50 billion of capital; 10 years ago at less than $100 billion; 5 years ago less than $200 billion. We're now in excess of $500 billion. And what we tend to find coming out of periods of time like this, we've got a bit of a market dislocation and the question around economic cycles is investors tend to look back and say what performed when the markets were difficult. And what we found is, over time, alternatives has tended to perform quite well. And usually, what happens coming out of an environment like this is they increase their allocation to alts. Our expectation is that the same thing will happen here. That will be a nice wind at our back as we kind of head into the next several years and launch the flagship funds that Craig was referencing. And then you've got on top of that, the compounding benefit of private wealth. So the reason you hear the optimism in our voices is over the next several years, we actually think we're going to look back on this period of time, I feel like this has been quite helpful and helps fuel the next leg of growth for the industry and for the firm."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to KKR's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following management's prepared remarks, the conference will be opened for questions [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now hand the call over to Craig Larson, Partner and Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.\nCraig Larson: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2024 earnings call. This morning, as usual, I'm joined by Rob Lewin, our Chief Financial Officer; and Scott Nuttall, our Co-Chief Executive Officer. We would like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, which is available on the Investor Center section at kkr.com. And as a reminder, we report our segment numbers on an adjusted share basis. This call will contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to our earnings release as well as our SEC filings for cautionary factors about these statements. So to begin this quarter, we thought we would highlight three things. First, as you would have already seen through our earnings release, we had a strong Q3. Fee-related earnings for the quarter eclipsed $1 billion for the first time. And on a per share basis, the $1.12 of FRE per share is 32% ahead of the results we reported just last quarter, which was up until today a record figure for KKR. And ANI per share of $1.38 is the second highest quarterly figure we've reported in our history, up over 50% compared to Q3 of last year. So impressive growth and delivery in a quarter where the pace of exit activity across our industry is still accelerating. Second, you're seeing tangible signs of momentum across our operating metrics. Investment performance continues to be a bright spot as we perform on behalf of our clients and reflecting this performance, our gross unrealized carried interest balance increased 11% from just last quarter and has increased 42% compared to 1-year ago. On the heels of strong investment performance, we raised $87 billion of new capital year-to-date. This is more than double the amount we raised over the first 9 months of 2023, and we remain at an early stage of our current fundraising super cycle, at the same time that we're seeing continued progress in scaling across our wealth initiatives. And deployment year-to-date totaled $61 billion, also more than double the investment activity reported over the first 9 months of 2023. And third, you're seeing tangible signs of how KKR and our business model in our view can deliver differentiated financial results for all of us as shareholders. Total operating earnings. Remember, this is our fee-related earnings together with our Insurance segment as well as the net dividends from strategic holdings. We're $1.47 per share in Q3. These are our more durable businesses. So looking at this differently, total operating earnings and more durable and recurring pieces of our business, comprised over 80% of our pre-tax earnings as a firm for Q3, as well as on a year-to-date and a trailing 12-month basis. And thinking through the profile and trajectory of total operating earnings, remember that we expect the net dividends from strategic holdings to increase materially over the coming years. We believe strategic holdings will be a truly unique driver of future financial performance for KKR for years to come. And finally, also highlighting our business model and how we work together, the results we reported in the third quarter in our capital markets business are noteworthy with $424 million of capital markets revenues in the quarter, driven by the increased investment activity that I mentioned a moment ago. So with that as an introduction, let me walk through our segment income statement in more detail. Management fees in the quarter were $893 million, representing an increase of 5% since Q2, and 18% year-over-year. Again, 18% growth in management fees year-over-year. This increase was driven by fees turning on in the quarter for our flagship infrastructure fund, the final close of Ascendant, and fees from Global Climate, as well as continued success within our private wealth vehicles. Total transaction and monitoring fees totaled $467 million. This includes the $424 million of capital markets fees mentioned a moment ago, a record figure for us as a public company. Fee-related performance revenues in the quarter were $57 million. This quarter was the first quarter our onshore K-Series infra vehicle earned its annual incentive fee and as you'll recall our offshore vehicle earned its annual incentive fee for the first time last quarter in Q2. So with good performance, we expect this cadence to continue annually for both our onshore and offshore vehicles. In aggregate, fee-related revenues were $1.4 billion. This is up over 50% compared to the third quarter of 2023. Fee-related compensation, as usual, was right at the midpoint of our guided range, which as a reminder is 17.5%. Other operating expenses came in at $168 million. As we noted earlier this year, we would expect this line item to increase modestly over time. As an example, we do expect placement fees to increase as fundraising continues to ramp. So putting this all together, FRE was just over $1 billion for the quarter, or $1.12 per share with an FRE margin of 71% and FRE per share is up 78% compared to Q3 of '23. Insurance operating earnings were $308 million for the quarter. The run rate here is still at that $250 million level, plus or minus, as we discussed on last quarter's call as the results this quarter benefited from approximately $50 million of earnings that came primarily from GA's annual actuarial assumption review. Strategic holdings operating earnings were $7 million in Q3 and we expect a similar level in Q4. These figures compared to the $62 million of net dividends reported for the first half of 2024, which were ahead of our expectations. And as we've discussed, the trajectory of these earnings won't be linear in these early days. And more importantly, we continue to see consistent growth across the underlying businesses and are tracking nicely towards our expected $300 plus million of net dividends by '26 and $600 plus million by 2028. And as context for the portfolio as a whole, KKR's share of the 12-month revenue and EBITDA generated by these 18 businesses was $3.6 billion and approximately $900 million, respectively. And year-over-year, we saw 14% like-for-like growth in revenue and 11% growth in EBITDA. The portfolio has scaled and continues to grow nicely and importantly again remains on track to deliver meaningful net dividends in the years ahead. So in aggregate, total operating earnings were $1.47 per share, a record quarter, and 25% ahead of last quarter and represented 81% of segment earnings. Moving on to investing earnings within our Asset Management segment, realized performance income was $392 million and realized investment income was $152 million, and we had $88 million of net realized investment income within our Strategic Holding segment. So in total, investing earnings after compensation were $318 million. After interest expense and taxes, adjusted net income was $1.2 billion, or $1.38 per share, up 57% on a year-over-year basis from the third quarter of last year. Now finally turning to investment performance in Page 10 of the earnings release. The traditional private equity portfolio appreciated 5% in the quarter and 17% in the last 12 months. Opportunistic real estate was up 2 in the quarter and up 3 in the LTM. Infrastructure continues to perform well, up 6% in Q3 and 18% in the LTM. And in credit, the leveraged credit composite was up 2 and the alternative credit composite was up 3 in the third quarter. And performance here over the last 12 months was up 11% and up 12%, respectively. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Rob.\nRob Lewin: Thanks, Craig, and thank you all for joining our call this morning. Last quarter, we highlighted that we were seeing significantly greater market activity and momentum across the firm. Those trends were clearly seen in the results that Craig just ran through. In a lot of ways, this was a quarter where the numbers speak for themselves. So I thought that I would focus on a few of the key drivers looking forward; deployment, monetization, fundraising, as well as our unique business model. Starting first with deployment, we have seen a meaningful acceleration in activity. And if you take a step back, we have built scaled global businesses to invest behind many of the mega themes that are driving global growth. We discussed this at Investor Day earlier this year, but I will highlight three particularly significant areas this morning. Number one is infrastructure. We know that the need for infrastructure investment is massive. Our footprint here positions us incredibly well. Our global infra business has now scaled to $77 billion of AUM. Remember we were just $13 billion 5 years ago, and all of that growth has been organic. We are particularly well-positioned across all themes digital infrastructure, and we are seeing this theme play out globally. There are really three pillars of activity here. The first is mobile infrastructure, so think of the tower industry. Second is fixed line infrastructure, fiber-to-the-home. And third are themes in the Cloud AI storage and data center space. Our footprint in data centers is particularly large. To give you a sense, we currently own four platforms operating across the U.S., Europe, and Asia. And looking on a 100% own basis, because we don't own a 100% of all of them, the total enterprise value of those platforms and their contracted and highly visible pipeline is over $150 billion. The second theme that I wanted to highlight this morning is credit. The credit markets that we participate in is a $40 trillion plus market and we are seeing the benefits of a scaled global platform with $240 billion plus of AUM. Our asset-based finance team, as an example, continues to be particularly active. In total, AUM across our ABF platform exceeds $65 billion. That's up 40% versus last year. And we have a real leadership position across an area that has significant market tailwinds. And finally, Asia remains one of the most dynamic parts of the world. We've had a meaningful presence in the region for close to two decades and are by far the leading alternatives platform on the ground today with nearly $70 billion of AUM. We are incredibly well-positioned to generate significant scale and value for our enterprise over the next decade plus. We are particularly excited about the opportunities in Japan across multiple asset classes. Japan is a market where today we have real leadership. We opened our first office in the country in 2006, so almost two decades ago. Together with KJRM, we have over 200 people in Tokyo, helping us source and originate investment opportunities up and down the capital structure. Global Atlantic has now closed on two reinsurance transactions within the last 12 months. And in aggregate, we have $25 billion of AUM across all of our strategies in Japan. Taken together, our footprint provides us with a lot of confidence around competing in the local markets and further scaling from here. Turning next to monetizations. We've seen an uptick here given readily accessible debt markets, the improved tone across global equity markets, and increased M&A volumes. To give you a sense of this, the total gross proceeds from monetization activity in our private equity and real assets businesses year-to-date have been approximately $13 billion. That is up over 60% from the same time last year. And as we look ahead, presuming the market backdrop remains constructive, we expect you'll see a further acceleration of activity across the industry. And against this backdrop, we feel very well-positioned. One of the areas that we watch closely as a management team is the maturity of our portfolios. Today we are in a very good position, which reflects our discipline, we think, around investment pacing and linear deployment. First, we have a number of public positions with meaningful embedded gains. As of quarter end, six of our sizable positions were trading between 4x and over 30x cost. Just looking at our private equity portfolio overall, over 60% of fair value is marked at 1.5x cost or greater, with approximately 30% marked at 2x cost or greater. In addition, our real assets businesses are currently under-earning as our portfolios continue to mature. In total, our gross unrealized carried interest stands at $7.9 billion at quarter end. That's up 40% year-on-year. And looking more broadly, if you include our balance sheet investments, so as a reminder, this does not include core private equity. The total embedded gains are $10.9 billion, which is also up 40% year-on-year. When you factor in that we have been monetizing at a healthy pace relative to the industry, this stat really does speak to the strength of our investment performance as well as the health of our global portfolio. And I think all of this really positions us well to generate future investing earnings. Turning next to new capital raised. This totaled $24 billion for the quarter, bringing us to over $85 billion year-to-date. In the quarter, nearly half of this activity was driven by credit, as our business has grown alongside the capabilities of Global Atlantic. Two additional topics of note here. First, our K-Series vehicle saw strong fundraising, with over $2 billion of new capital raised in Q3, driven by our private equity and our infrastructure strategies. And looking at K-Series across all four investing verticals, we are now at $14 billion of AUM. That's up from $5 billion a year ago. We're continuing to launch our products and new platforms and are still ramping on those that we've been added to already. We remain really encouraged by our progress to date with a tremendous amount of opportunity still in front of us. And second, over time we have talked about long-dated multi-asset class strategic partnerships that have recycling provisions. Given the breadth as well as the connectivity across our firm, we are uniquely positioned to create these types of partnerships. This quarter, rather, we closed on a $3 billion real asset strategic partnership with a large sovereign wealth fund, which we expect will positively impact both our infrastructure and real estate platforms for two plus decades. Before I conclude, I did want to spend a few minutes on a couple of elements of our model that I think are really unique and also operating at a very high-level. First on Global Atlantic, on the last couple of earnings calls we talked about GA operating with elevated levels of liquidity after the large block transactions closed at the end of last year as well as early this year. We have seen increased coordination and investment activity across several of our asset classes, including now infrastructure, real estate and credit. We remain encouraged by the quality of the deal flow that we were able to match up against some of the very long-dated liabilities that we have taken on. And the second area I wanted to touch on was that you really saw the power of our business model this quarter with our capital markets business producing record revenues of $424 million. This reflected activity across infrastructure, traditional private equity and credit, as well as existing portfolio company opportunistic financings and third-party transactions. While the quarter did benefit from a few sizable fee events as well as timing, around 100 different transactions contributed to the outcome this quarter, which demonstrates the breadth and diversification of our business. Now, we don't think $400 plus million is the new quarterly run rate for our capital markets business, but this quarter really illustrates the degree to which our model is built to capture very significant economics. We have built this part of our business very deliberately, and being able to achieve these types of outcomes is not a surprise. Just to close out, our management team remains incredibly excited about the potential of our firm and our ability to inflect up in a recovering deal and exit environment. And as we look to the rest of the year, we will continue to stay just as focused on scaling our businesses and taking full advantage of the unique capabilities that our model presents. With that, Scott, Craig and I are happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Good morning, Rob, Craig. Hope everyone's doing well. My question is on the infrastructure business. So, very strong returns, best performing business over the last 12 months and also in the quarter. And infra also contributed to about 50% of your capital market transaction fees which were also at record level. So these are really big numbers for infra where return targets and size are both smaller than P. So two questions here. Big picture, what's driving the outside performance, and is it sustainable into 2025? I know there is at least one large lumpy item in the capital market transaction fee line going.\nCraig Larson: Hi, Craig. Thank you for the comments. Why don't I start? Rob, I'll let you pick up on the capital markets piece at the end. Look, in terms of the franchise as a whole, I thought Raj [ph], and again, thank you for the kind introduction. I think Raj did a great job reviewing our infra business and the opportunities we see at our Investor Day just a little over 3 months ago. And I guess maybe 5 months ago at this point. And I think as we look how the business is situated, we've got a series of very distinct market segments. We've got the global infra series, Asia infra, diversified core. We now have the infra vehicles customized for private wealth investors. And that's even with climate as another strategy that's adjacent where there's lots of opportunity. And Rob mentioned a couple of statistics that really are super impressive. 5 years ago AUM was $15 billion, as of 9/30 we're at $77 billion, all organic. And so I think what you're seeing here is a business that continues to grow in scale. We do think there are scale advantages as it relates to the business and the formation and the outlook from here. The performance has been one that's very strong. You're going to have, again, puts and takes in any individual quarter. I think when you look at individual -- when you look at performance over the trailing 12-month basis and you look back historically, you've seen this dynamic where you've seen consistent performance over time. And, of course, performance is really going to be the key driver of outcomes here. And I think when you look at our Infra 1 and our Infra 2 fund series, those are very mature funds for us. You've seen a very consistent series of results and I think you're seeing that same pattern of performance as Funds 3 and 4 then mature and you're seeing just performance progress from the time that those investment periods first began.\nRob Lewin: Craig, I'll pick up on just the capital markets question real quick. Obviously, a really strong quarter for us in capital markets. I did mention that we had a couple or few chunkier transactions, which is really to be expected in quarters of high levels of deployment and activity. But I also note that we had over 100 different transactions contribute to the quarter, and I really do think it shows the diversification and breadth of the business model. And you mentioned it, a big quarter as it relates to infrastructure, but obviously we have lots of other parts of our business that contribute a great deal to our capital markets business over time, whether that's private equity, traditional core private equity aspects of credit, what we're building across Global Atlantic, our geographic breadth, so lots of different ways for us to positively impact the P&L.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please proceed.\nGlenn Schorr: Thank you. I'm curious if we could talk a little bit about Asset-Based Finance. I know it's a very active quarter. You mentioned the 45% or so growth to $65 billion, but I was looking for a little more color of where do those assets sit, which product strategies, and then where are you sourcing the assets from? What's coming from your direct origination channels? Where are you growing platforms versus forming some partnerships? Just a little more behind the scenes would be great. Thanks.\nCraig Larson: Hey, Glenn, its Craig, why don't I start? Scott may have a couple of things to add at the end, but you're correct. That part of our business has been super active. So, as you heard from Rob, $66 billion of AUM, up 40% over the last 12 months. And the great thing about having a business of that scale is we can be relevant at a whole bunch of different levels of risk reward. So insurance activity, when we look at Global Atlantic together with our other insurance clients, so this is really investment grade, really single A-rated credit. If you look at our origination here, this is both on [indiscernible] committed basis. Origination was $22 billion year-to-date. So on a run rate basis, we're at a $30 billion annual pace, more than double our pace of activity in 2023. And on the platforms, I'm glad you mentioned, across KKR as a whole. Look, we have 35 platforms, including real estate, helping generate differentiated origination for us. 7,000 people waking up every day, looking to help source proprietary origination. It's a real advantage for us. And then on top of that activity, you've got flow, you've got partnership, you've got big corporate deals. And so I think you've seen a number of transactions involving our team with a lot of really big brands in finance. PayPal, Discover would be examples that come to mind. So it just feels like there's a lot of momentum behind the business and honestly a lot more for us to do at the same time.\nScott Nuttall: Hey Glenn, it's Scott. Thanks for the question. In terms of where it sits, that part of your question, a variety of places. So we have funds, separate accounts, obviously Global Atlantic. These are great assets for the GA balance sheet and third-party insurers. And we've also been able to create structures that allow us to deliver this on an investment-grade basis and a non-investment-grade basis, depending on what the underlying client wants. And I think Craig did a great job summarizing. The only other thing I would point out, this is a very large market. It's about $5 trillion on its way to $7 trillion. So a significant opportunity for growth ahead. So $65 billion is just the start.\nGlenn Schorr: Thank you for all that.\nCraig Larson: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nAlexander Blostein: Hey, everybody. Good morning. I wanted to ask a question on the Real Assets segment, but maybe a little bit more broadly. Really strong fundraising momentum there, and I know there's been a lot of focus in global infra, but this quarter it seemed to be pretty broad based. You talked about climate and real estate in the prepared remarks in the press release. How are you thinking about sizing these other flagships, so climate, North America real estate, and it also looks like you're pretty far along in European and Asia real estate, APAC infra. So maybe a little bit more holistically, how are you thinking about fundraising outside of the mega kind of flagship infra fund [ph] there? And then specifically within real estate, what are you hearing from clients on the ground as far as demand for that product goes? Thanks.\nCraig Larson: Alex, why don't I start? It's been really great within Real Assets since we split out that business line a couple of years ago to see the development of both of those businesses. Infra at this point is approaching $80 billion. Real estate is at $80 billion. I'm pretty equally split between real estate equity and real estate credit. And in terms of the opportunities for us to continue to grow, build and scale, honestly, it's one of the things that we love talking about in how we think about how we're situated. If you go back again to some of the things you've heard us talk about over time, over 80% of our strategies and our view are yet at scale. And so if you think of real estate, in particular, we've got over a dozen independent vehicles that are growing, building, scaling and just creates a tremendous amount of opportunity. And I think on the investment side and dialogue from LPs, I think one of the most encouraging signs, if anything, relates to operating trends over the course of this year, it does feel as though, again, you would have heard this in the market, but it does feel like valuations knock on wood bottomed a year ago or so. You've seen us vote with our wallets, if you will, like investment activity over the last 12 months in real estate has increased significantly for us. To give you a stat within real estate, year-to-date total deployment is approaching $12 billion. The first 9 months of 2023, we were at about 5. And I think when we think of that investment activity and the progress we've seen operationally, we feel really good about that decision to lean in. So lots of momentum, lots of opportunities for us looking forward.\nScott Nuttall: Hey, Alex, it's Scott. Just on your question, so I would say just higher level, the infrastructure and real estate credit, along with private credit and areas like ABF, we've continued to see a lot of activity and interest from a fundraising standpoint. Allocations have been created, commitments are being made. I would put climate in that category. It's a younger strategy, but I put it in that same category. So don't have a target to give you today, but obviously the investment need is significant. And we think that can be a really large-scale business for us over the time. Real estate equity, as we talked about last quarter, the perspective has been evolving in the markets. Our view is that the real estate markets bottomed in the last half of last year. Part of the reason that we've leaned in so much this year, and you heard stats from Craig, is our view that the bottom was behind us. And I think that perspective is starting to be shared by others. So we are hearing sentiment shift on real estate equity. I think with rates starting to come down, you're going to hear more of that. So we've been leaning in, and I think there's beginning to be a perspective that this is a good time to invest. And over time, you'll see that show up in our Americas, Europe and Asia funds, we believe. But sentiment is definitely turning, and it may take a little bit of time for the capital to start to show up, but we feel like we're in a good spot today and we have those strategies in the market.\nAlexander Blostein: All right. Thanks so much.\nCraig Larson: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with TD Cowen. Please proceed.\nBill Katz: Thank you very much. Good morning, everybody. I appreciate you taking the question. Maybe just to look at the wealth management opportunity a little bit which is scaling very nicely and appreciate you gave a little bit of snippets in the prepared commentary. I wonder if we could unpack that a little bit further and maybe just talk about where you're seeing the best traction, which vertical? You mentioned that you're sort of getting onto more platforms, a few new ones yet coming. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about where you are in sort of the arc of those, if you will. And then I was wondering now with 3 months closer to get updated a little bit on any sort of early stage opportunities or fund design with Capital Group. Thank you.\nCraig Larson: Hey, Bill, it's Craig. Why don't I start? First just stepping back for a moment for everybody. So as of September 30, we have around $75 billion of AUM from individuals. And that does not include policyholders at GA. So if anything, that $75 billion is probably understated when you think about the breadth of our presence and the activity that we have. And the majority of that has been capital from high net worth, ultra high net worth individuals over time who have been investing in our funds. And over time, that capital from individuals has been a low double-digit percentage of new capital raised for us. And then most recently, as you noted, we've introduced our K-Series suite of products. We've got products currently that are being marketed across the four investing verticals for us, private equity, infrastructure, real estate and credit. They're all in different stages of their evolution. $14 billion today, $5 billion a year ago. It just continues to feel like we've got lots of great momentum. We think -- we look at the market share statistics in terms of capital raised year-to-date, feel great about our position, albeit with a lot of wood to chop from here. I think recognizing -- I think in particular, we felt real strength in private equity as well as infrastructure. And I'd say that it is both with those asset classes and that is international as well as domestic. So when you look within those two vehicles, AUM is probably a 60-40 split between the U.S. and outside the U.S. That feels like a really healthy balance to us. So I think when we look at that opportunity, it's multiple asset classes and its global. I think the other -- just the other point to highlight, we have launched those vehicles ahead of the fundraising that we've launched for our private BDC. So I think when you look in the industry, you've seen a lot of capital that has been raised in the private credit opportunity and private BDCs. That is one of the pieces that I think we're going to, in particular, see lots more growth and momentum and opportunity for us as we continue to see growth across a number of platforms, a handful of larger ones which are in the very near-term. And then, Scott, I don't know if you have anything to add on Capital Group.\nScott Nuttall: No, I think first off on the wealth management topic, I think there's a lot of different parts of our firm, Bill, that we've got a lot of growth ahead and the potential is far greater than what's showing up in the numbers. And I think Craig covered it well, but we are getting onto a number of different platforms every quarter. We've now launched in all four product areas. But the full run rate is not in the numbers yet. So we think you're going to continue to see gaining momentum across everything we're doing in wealth. You're also seeing this across a bunch of different parts of the firm, including the real asset space. We talked about capital raising and infrastructure, but these businesses, in terms of what's showing up in the P&L, the carry, the investment earnings, they're not showing up yet, but they're going to show up. And so I think we've got a lot of different parts of the firm that we see embedded growth. There's latent earnings that will continue to show up and latent AUM that will continue to show up as we continue to scale here. On Capital Group, we shared earlier this year that we're going to start with two credit vehicles together. That's very much on track. We are also spending time on product design across the other product verticals and alternatives. And so you'll hear more about that in future quarters.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Brian McKenna with Citizens JMP. Please proceed.\nBrian McKenna: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So, it was great to see the nice step up in accrued performance income during the quarter. I'm assuming a lot of this was driven by strong investment performance, but were there any funds that flipped into carry during the quarter or any newer strategies that are starting to contribute more meaningfully to the accrual? And then with respect to the $3 billion of asset management, embedded gains on the balance sheet, how should we think about just the timing of monetizing this over time?\nRob Lewin: Hey, Brian, it's Rob. Thanks for the question. What you saw in the quarter in the 7.9 of accrued carry, I'd say that that is much more broad-based performance, where you're really starting to see us inflect up. It comes from our real assets portfolio in particular, infrastructure of course, if you look at our flagship infrastructure funds, we went from 1 to 3 to 7 to 17 plus. And so as we scaled and performed, you're going to see that accrued carry build and then importantly now you're starting to see that realized carry start to flow through the P&L as well. As it relates to the balance sheet embedded gains, listen, I think that's going to be a function of the monetization environment. And when you're going to see that flow through the P&L right now, we are seeing more opportunities to be able to create access for our portfolio companies, which is where largely most of that embedded gain on the balance sheet sits. And so, I would say if the environment remains constructive over the course of 2025, we would expect to be able to generate some more material balance sheet related realizations through the next 12 months.\nBrian McKenna: Okay.\nScott Nuttall: The only thing I would add, Brian, is just for -- and thanks for the question. From a higher altitude comment standpoint, as we've talked about in the past, including at the Investor Day, it takes about 10 to 15 years to scale AUM in our business. You've got to get to Fund 3, Fund 4. As you know, we used to have 5 or 6 strategies at KKR. I was looking at our fundraising sheet last week. We have 57 line items this year, just to give you a sense. So it's 10 to 15 years to get to scale. And then it's oftentimes 5 to 10 years after you get to scale that you start to see carry and investing earnings show up at scale. And remember, we went from that 6 line items to 57 since the end of the financial crisis. So as you think about the momentum we have behind us, to Rob's point, and just what's coming, the 1 billion to 3 billion to 7 billion to 17 billion as an example in infrastructure, that's not really in our earnings yet from a carry standpoint. We have that happening in a lot of different places across the firm, which is part of the reason you hear such confidence in our voices.\nBrian McKenna: Got it. Thanks guys and congrats on another great quarter.\nRob Lewin: Thanks a lot, Brian.\nCraig Larson: Thanks, Brian.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please proceed.\nSteven Chubak: Hi. Good morning.\nCraig Larson: Good morning.\nScott Nuttall: Good morning.\nSteven Chubak: So I wanted to ask a follow-up question just on the fundraising outlook. If we benchmark fundraising trends year-to-date versus the target $300 billion that you outlined at Investor Day, you've already fundraised $85 billion, tracking ahead of goal despite a limited contribution from flagships. And just given the constructive [indiscernible] on this call, improving momentum, both institutional and retail, just was hoping to get a bit of a mark-to-market on whether that target feels conservative given some of the tailwinds that you're seeing. I recognize it's supposed to be a multi-year target, but any perspective you can offer just given some of the strength and the recent fundraising momentum would be helpful.\nCraig Larson: Hey, Steven, why don't I start and Scott or Rob, I'm sure, may have another couple of thoughts. I think first in terms of the 300 plus, I think you're correct. Look, we feel great about the momentum that we have in the execution you've seen today. We don't have a new number for you today, but I think if anything, our confidence level on the 300 plus, just given everything that we've done, if anything, just would have increased. Now I think in terms of some of the statistics, because you're right, it is worth spending a moment just on the implications from a flagship standpoint, because we've -- in the last couple of years, that activity has been pretty modest. So just for a little bit of background, when we refer to our flagships, these are really our largest fund complexes across KKR. So I think Americas PE, Asia, Europe PE, core private equity and global infra and over 2020 and 2021, over $60 billion of new capital raised came from our flagships. It was almost 40% of our fundraising. And those numbers more recently have been quite modest. So in 2022 and 2023, we raised $150 billion, but only 6 came from the flagships. Again 6 versus that 60. And so now over the LTM, you're starting to see some progress. $118 billion in total, 11 coming from the flagships. So a nice start, but as we think about the balance of '24 and '25, just given continued activity across Infra, as well as our Americas and Asia PE strategies, we just think that activity has the opportunity to be meaningful and incremental to what you've seen from us. And so when you think about us as a whole, we've got flagship opportunities, we've got continued scaling in an institutional fundraising, as you would have heard. Again, back to 80% of our strategy is not yet at scale. And then on top of that, we've got the continued scaling and the opportunities we have in wealth, both through K-Series and Capital Group. And that's a long time -- and that\u2019s alongside the opportunities we have at Global Atlantic and Global Atlantic Sidecars, for that matter. So there's just a -- there's a lot for us to do. It feels like we have a lot of momentum. And, again, thanks for the question.\nScott Nuttall: Yes, the only thing I'd add, Steven, is we do feel quite positive. We really like our setup. Not surprisingly, you're really good at math. So I would just -- I would lean even more into the plus.\nSteven Chubak: Well said.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Please proceed.\nPatrick Davitt: Hey, good morning, everyone.\nCraig Larson: Good morning.\nPatrick Davitt: I'm going to be Debbie Downer and ask an election question. We usually take the view that elections don't matter much either way, but one looming big change that could come this time is clearly tariffs on markets appear to be pricing that in to some extent. So aside from inflation and rate impacts, do you have any initial thoughts on how the existing portfolio could be negatively or even positively impacted by tariffs and or a trade war? Thank you.\nCraig Larson: Yes, Patrick, I'm not going to surprise you. We spend most of our team time here focusing on things that we can control. That's not one of them. But at the same time, we also do have a team here that's focused on scenario planning across multiple different areas, whether that's the existing portfolio or new portfolio. As you said I think there's going to be some pluses and minuses depending on the geography of our portfolio companies. The sectors they're in, what their cost base are made of. There's all kinds of different inputs and so we're watching it closely. I think it's fair to say that our teams are ready to react and we're also ready to react to the extent that we end up in an environment with a little bit more volatility. We've got a lot of dry powder to be able to invest into that.\nScott Nuttall: Yes, the only thing I'd add is this isn't a new effort here. We've been focused on this for the last several years. So as we've been constructing portfolios, we've been doing it with the mindset that this could happen over time.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Mike Brown with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.\nMichael Brown: Hi. Good morning, Scott, Rob, and Craig.\nScott Nuttall: Good morning.\nMichael Brown: I wanted to ask on the fee rates, I guess, typically on the Real Assets and Private Equity segments. So in Real Assets, it looks like the fee rate ticked up and it sounds like that was probably driven by a turn on of fees from the Global Infra Fund. Could you just maybe quantify that impact or maybe help us understand the right run rate for the go-forward? And then in Private Equity, it looks like the fee rate came down a little bit. Anything to point to there? And then can you remind us, are those K-Series products, are they on fee holiday? And if so, when does that end?\nCraig Larson: So I'll try and take that a piece, maybe start with the last piece. Some of our K-Series products do have a bit of a fee holiday that's baked in depending on the product. And so that's a little bit of what you're seeing in Private Equity, but I think the Private Equity fee rates come down a couple of basis points over the past three quarters. The other thing to factor in is our core private equity strategy, is that scale that's going to come in at a little bit of a lower fee rate as well. Real Assets, to your point, what you're seeing in particular is the turning on of Infra 5 in the third quarter which would have contributed. But I would say, more importantly, Mike, the right way to evaluate these types of trends is over a longer period of time, because there's a lot that can happen intra-quarter. And overall, we feel really good about our aggregate fee rates and how they've stood up even with the introduction of a number of new products that come in naturally at a little bit of a lower fee rate.\nMichael Brown: Okay, great. Thank you for the color.\nCraig Larson: Thanks a lot, Mike.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks. Thanks for taking my question. Just going back to capital markets, obviously, a very strong improvement. Obviously, Telecom Italia helped with that. But as we look into the fourth quarter, not sure to what extend you can give any color on the potential and whether that could be another strong quarter. I know 4.24 is not the run rate, but it could rival the next best quarter, which was 320 million -- 321 million [ph]. And it discover something that could potentially close in 4Q and give you fees. And I think also just North America I think was more than half or around half of the fees this time, so over $200 million. I think it was up from about $130 million. So was there anything especially lumpy in North America that was contributing to the third quarter?\nRob Lewin: Yes, sure. Brian, thanks for the question. Obviously, a really great quarter for us. And there's a lot of reasons for us to feel really positive about our capital markets business. And you would have heard us say this in the past. This is not the type of business that is great to evaluate on a quarterly basis. Certainly, as a senior leadership team, as we evaluate performance, it's much more on an annual basis. And maybe, as we talk about the future, it's instructive a little bit to go back in history a bit on this business. If you look at our capital markets business in 2021, we generated roughly $850 million of revenue. Now obviously the capital markets were buoyant through that 12-month period of time, but it was a record fee number for our business. Now if you look at 2022 and 2023, when capital markets were largely shut across that 24-month period of time, our capital markets business still generated $600 million of revenue, plus or minus, in each of those 2 years. Now, we're actually more proud of that performance, because I really do think it shows the durability of the franchise. And as you look at 2024, the year start off a little bit slower. You had some catch-up on activity. It's in part the reason why you saw a spike that happened through the third quarter. But as we look at the year in aggregate, our expectation is that we're going to be up 50%-ish plus or minus, relative to 2022 and 2023. So it should be a new record year for us on the capital markets side, assuming no deals we expect to close in Q4 don't end up getting pushed. But we're really constructive around that 4-year trajectory and journey, and it really helps inform our views of the future, both around the durability of the franchise in down markets, but really our ability to inflect up, continue to grow as KKR does more, continue to grow geographically. We've talked about the very big opportunity that we see existing between GA and our capital markets, structured finance team is working in partnership together, and I really do think our third-party capital markets business is a unique model and very differentiated approach to the market that will continue to market share over time. So we're, as you can tell, really constructive on the business, but it's not really the type of business that I think is great to evaluate quarter in, quarter out.\nBrian Bedell: Fair enough. Thank you.\nRob Lewin: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nMichael Cyprys: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you could update us on your progress building out the climate strategy. Maybe you could talk about some of the steps you're taking to build that out, types of investments you're making in the portfolio, what sort of return targets you're looking at, and how do you sort of envision expanding this strategy over the next several years. It seems like there could be opportunities across asset classes and clearly across the globe. So just curious, your thoughts there, thank you.\nCraig Larson: Hey, Mike, it's Craig, why don't I start? Thanks for asking about. Look, there's a massive need for capital here. And so if the physical economy, excuse me, is going to align with the net zero pathway by 2050, like the capital needs are massive, $200 trillion, so think about that. That's $7 trillion annually of required investment for the next 25 plus years. And it's renewable certainly, but it extends far beyond that. It's energy, it's transportation, it's building, it's agriculture. And in our view, when you look at the capital that's been formed to date, it almost feels barbell. So on the one hand, you have lots of climate strategies that are dedicated to core power and renewables. So the very mature part of that framework, or climate technology, the very early stage. And so, in our view, there's a real sweet spot between these two extremes. And at the same point in time, it lends itself very well with our experience and the things that we've been doing as a firm in infrastructure, in particular, for 15 years now. So, it's become a front-burner topic for us. We're at $2.5 billion round numbers. We're continuing to fundraise. It's a very front-burner topic for our team, so more to come here over time, but we think this does have an opportunity to, yes, become an opportunity for us that can move the needle in the long-term in the framework of our program [ph].\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thanks.\nCraig Larson: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt with KBW. Please proceed.\nKyle Voigt: Hi. Good morning. Maybe just a question on GA. Just given some of the recent shifts in the macro environment and given timing dynamics with deploying the significant capital you've taken in over the past few quarters, I was wondering if you could provide an update on the glide [ph] path to getting back to the 14% to 15% pre-tax ROE target, and is 2026 still the right timing for that?\nRob Lewin: Hey, Kyle, thanks a lot for the question. At the most important level, which is how we're performing across the enterprise, how we're going out and sourcing low-cost simple liabilities at scale, how we're taking those liabilities and then putting them to work, we feel like we're operating at a really high-level. And so as we think about our ability to generate meaningful ROE and ultimately operating earnings for our shareholders, I know that we continue to be on a really great path. And the question as to how we operate and at what level of ROE is going to depend on a whole number of factors that we're watching, which including how quickly we grow and in what kind of way that we grow. Let's take our institutional business as an example. We've talked about the block business. We've been really active, have found some really exciting opportunities, as you know, Q4 and Q1 of this past year, but to work a material amount of capital. Now in those transactions, we underwrite IRRs to 12 to 18-month redeployment periods. So you're taking on the full cost of those liabilities, but not yet generating the full asset return for some period of time priced into the IRRs, which we think are really attractive but not going to come through operating earnings initially. So I think there's multiple different things that will impact your question, but you've followed us now for some time. I think you know that as a management team, we're always going to lean in around upfront investment for longer term gain. And so as we think about the long-term ROE for this business, undoubtedly, we continue to feel like 14% to 15% pre-tax, right level to model going forward. But at the same time, we don't have a specific timeline that's going to depend on these variables that we went through. But we do feel really great how our teams are working together, and no doubt it's been elevated since we bought 100% earlier this year.\nKyle Voigt: Thank you.\nScott Nuttall: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Ben Budish with Barclays. Please proceed.\nBenjamin Budish: Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could talk about the sale out of the core private equity portfolio. In the past, you've indicated that those were really businesses you wanted to own for a very long time and let their earnings compound. So could you talk about the circumstances that led to that sale? To what extent what might that be something that recurs? And then on the other hand, I think the comments for your longer term kind of dividend income expectation was predicated on -- I think the near-term it's predicated on the existing portfolio, but longer term you assume kind of more additions. So I guess kind of both sides, the circumstances of the recent sale, how you think about monetizing other assets and then how you think about kind of deploying capital and adding assets to that portfolio. Thank you.\nRob Lewin: Yes, great. Thanks a lot for the question. So we're always going to be focused on portfolio optimization, so it's possible that you could see some names come in and out of the portfolio over time. But the overall plan of long-term holds within our strategic holding segment is unchanged. As it relates to FiberCop specifically, this was a portfolio company that we actually owned in partnership with Telecom Italia. And so when we closed on our much broader transaction with Telecom Italia in July, we ended up cleaning up the capital structure and the legacy holding ended up getting cashed out. So that's why you see the monetization flow through in Q3 of this year. As it relates to our guidance, the $300 plus million of operating earnings by 2026, $600 plus million by 2028, and $1 billion plus by 2030, if anything, our conviction level as a management team and our ability to achieve those numbers has only gone up since we initially provided that guidance in the first last November and then updated at our Investor Day in April.\nBenjamin Budish: Okay, got it. Thank you very much.\nScott Nuttall: Thanks, Ben.\nRob Lewin: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please proceed.\nDaniel Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on both the capital markets and the GA opportunity. Just curious, given the strength you just posted in the third quarter, how much GA contributed or a percentage of that activity? And how much is obviously still on the come as you build and integrate that business more?\nRob Lewin: I think the very short answer, Dan, is it was a solid contributor in the quarter, but not all that material in the context of $420 plus million of revenue. That said, we've talked about believing that the opportunity in that line of business for us is in the hundreds of millions of dollars over time, and that perspective is unchanged.\nDaniel Fannon: Great. Thank you.\nRob Lewin: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question will come -- again from the line of Mike Brown with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.\nMichael Brown: Great. Thank you for taking my follow-up. I wanted to follow-up on the wealth channel discussion earlier in the call. I guess, China is getting more focused as the potential opportunity for private assets in the retirement or DC channel, and maybe perhaps the more near-term opportunity would actually be model portfolios. But I guess, understanding that's kind of all largely unknown today, but I'm interested to hear about what's that long-term opportunity for KKR? How important is it to be a first mover into 401ks? And is partnership integral for success here? I'm just kind of curious if, the partnership you have with Capital Group could actually give you a bit of a leg up here. Thank you.\nCraig Larson: Hi. Hey, Mike. It's Craig. Thanks for asking about it. Look, so the majority of new dollars going into 401k plans are going through target date [ph] funds. I believe that percentage is north of 60% and we've talked to some participants who've indicated that percentage is actually well north of 60%. And at the same time, you probably won't be surprised to hear that we think there's a lot of industrial logic to introducing alternative strategies into target date strategies as individuals invest behind their continued retirement. So we expect that's where you'll see alternative strategies first introduced. It's a massive market. It's one that we do view as being a really interesting long-term opportunity for KKR in the industry. And you're correct. Remember, we've got our partnership with Capital Group. We've got a big target date fund business. And don't forget about GA here. Annuities, we think, are also going to be very relevant within the framework of these pools over time as well. So look, it's a topic that has mind share at our firm. There's no question about that, but it's going to take some time. So I don't think you need to adjust your Q4 '24 fundraising numbers for us. But yes, over time we do think this is a driver that will feel very tangible in the framework of our firms as well as our industry.\nMichael Brown: Thank you, Craig.\nOperator: And the next question will come again from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Please proceed.\nPatrick Davitt: Thanks for the follow-up. A quick housekeeping item. Did you give the updated visible realization pipeline numbers, please?\nRob Lewin: Yes, of course, Patrick. So we've got a pretty good amount of visibility into Q4 right now. So call it plus or minus $500 million of monetization-related revenue. Again, that consists of revenue that has already happened or revenue that has signed up and we feel really confident will end up closing. Importantly, and this is a little bit different in Q4 of '24. If you look at that $500 million, approximately 60% of that will come through our P&L at the lower 10% to 20% compensation ratio. So the flow through to our P&L will be more significant in Q4 as a result of that dynamic. Obviously, we're also only a month into the quarter, and so hopefully the markets maintain the constructive posture and we're able to generate some additional monetization-related revenue through the remainder of '24.\nPatrick Davitt: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question will come from the line -- again will come again from the line of Bill Katz with TD Cowen. Please proceed.\nBill Katz: Great. Thanks very much for the extra question as well. Just thinking through your commentary on the capital markets opportunity, can you remind me just the split between how much of the revenues come from deployment as you continue to scale geographically across the segments versus exit activity? And given the 70% plus FRE margin, should we presume that that related revenue effectively drops to the bottom line. Thank you.\nRob Lewin: Bill, thanks for the question. We've put some charts up there and some past presentations around the correlation between deployment and our capital markets revenue. That's going to be the largest driver of our business. I would think about the regional expansion of capital markets, particularly in Asia, as upside for what we can create over time as well. Historically, the third-party part of our business has been roughly 20% of our revenue. In 2024, it's a little bit less than that. Really the result of the mid-market sponsor community being a little bit more quiet on the deployment side, but we do expect that to come back, and again, feel really good about our market share. On the topic of margins, this is an important one for us, clearly. What I've said historically is that we feel we could sustainably operate in that mid 60% FRE margin range, which is industry leading. But what I've also said is that's not a cap for us. And if we're able to go out and execute on our business plan, which we've got a lot of confidence we're going to be able to do, it's really all about scaling things that we've already started. And so we believe that we're going to be able to grow our revenue at a materially higher pace than our headcount or the operating complexity that's required to operate KKR. And so the output of that should be, if we're successful here, additional operating leverage and an expansion of what is already industry-leading FRE margins. And as you saw the spike in revenue in Q3, you would have seen that flow through.\nBill Katz: Thank you again.\nRob Lewin: Thank you.\nOperator: And the last question will come again from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks for taking my follow-up. Just a quick one on the monetization pipeline coming into 2025. We had an exchange this morning that was also saying the pipeline is very strong, but they did expect 1Q to be slow sort of seasonally. So just wondering if you're seeing that same situation for IPOs coming into '25, because I think you were talking about obviously the deployment momentum picking up, and then I guess maybe just the potential mix of the IPO market versus sales to other companies for monetization.\nRob Lewin: Sure. Maybe let's just talk broadly about the monetization environment, which we feel has really recovered through 2024. The backup here is pretty positive. You've had a period of really sustained strength in the leveraged finance market, which is to us as big a leading indicator as there is. Obviously fixed income spreads have come way in and the equity markets are as strong as they have been. The one area of the capital markets that has been a little bit more sluggish is the IPO market, but we do expect that to change over the coming quarters. I think just looking at our own portfolio, if you look back over the past 12 months, we've had four IPOs of size, and they include businesses in different sectors and different geographies, a growth-oriented business, some mature businesses that are slower growth. And it's just a very small data point, obviously, but all those IPOs are trading well above issued price, and on average they're trading close to 50% above their issued price, and as one of the probably largest equity issuers in the marketplace, that's, while a small data point, I think a helpful one as we think about what the IPO market could look like through 2025.\nScott Nuttall: The only thing I'd add, Brian, is we did see the deal market rebound in the first half, took probably the first 6 months to gain momentum to start to come back. So we're seeing, and there's a lot of discussion about the IPO market, which I think is highly relevant, but we're seeing that momentum continue. It's not just IPOs, but it's strategic M&A as well. But there's nothing that we're looking at today. We don't look at this by quarter per se. That would cause us to think there's an air pocket coming. As the guys referenced, the portfolios mature. It's been performing well. If anything, because a bunch of our industry did not sell things last year, there's a pent-up supply of exits coming.\nBrian Bedell: Yes. That's right. That's right. That's right. I anticipated. Great. Thank you so much.\nRob Lewin: Thank you.\nScott Nuttall: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back to Craig Larson for closing remarks.\nCraig Larson: I just would like to thank everybody for your continued interest in KKR. Please follow-up with us directly, of course, if you have any questions. Otherwise, look forward to chatting with everybody again in 90 days or so. Thanks so much.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect your lines. Enjoy the rest of your day.",

            "name": "Rob Lewin",
            "content": "Thanks, Craig, and thank you all for joining our call this morning. Last quarter, we highlighted that we were seeing significantly greater market activity and momentum across the firm. Those trends were clearly seen in the results that Craig just ran through. In a lot of ways, this was a quarter where the numbers speak for themselves. So I thought that I would focus on a few of the key drivers looking forward; deployment, monetization, fundraising, as well as our unique business model. Starting first with deployment, we have seen a meaningful acceleration in activity. And if you take a step back, we have built scaled global businesses to invest behind many of the mega themes that are driving global growth. We discussed this at Investor Day earlier this year, but I will highlight three particularly significant areas this morning. Number one is infrastructure. We know that the need for infrastructure investment is massive. Our footprint here positions us incredibly well. Our global infra business has now scaled to $77 billion of AUM. Remember we were just $13 billion 5 years ago, and all of that growth has been organic. We are particularly well-positioned across all themes digital infrastructure, and we are seeing this theme play out globally. There are really three pillars of activity here. The first is mobile infrastructure, so think of the tower industry. Second is fixed line infrastructure, fiber-to-the-home. And third are themes in the Cloud AI storage and data center space. Our footprint in data centers is particularly large. To give you a sense, we currently own four platforms operating across the U.S., Europe, and Asia. And looking on a 100% own basis, because we don't own a 100% of all of them, the total enterprise value of those platforms and their contracted and highly visible pipeline is over $150 billion. The second theme that I wanted to highlight this morning is credit. The credit markets that we participate in is a $40 trillion plus market and we are seeing the benefits of a scaled global platform with $240 billion plus of AUM. Our asset-based finance team, as an example, continues to be particularly active. In total, AUM across our ABF platform exceeds $65 billion. That's up 40% versus last year. And we have a real leadership position across an area that has significant market tailwinds. And finally, Asia remains one of the most dynamic parts of the world. We've had a meaningful presence in the region for close to two decades and are by far the leading alternatives platform on the ground today with nearly $70 billion of AUM. We are incredibly well-positioned to generate significant scale and value for our enterprise over the next decade plus. We are particularly excited about the opportunities in Japan across multiple asset classes. Japan is a market where today we have real leadership. We opened our first office in the country in 2006, so almost two decades ago. Together with KJRM, we have over 200 people in Tokyo, helping us source and originate investment opportunities up and down the capital structure. Global Atlantic has now closed on two reinsurance transactions within the last 12 months. And in aggregate, we have $25 billion of AUM across all of our strategies in Japan. Taken together, our footprint provides us with a lot of confidence around competing in the local markets and further scaling from here. Turning next to monetizations. We've seen an uptick here given readily accessible debt markets, the improved tone across global equity markets, and increased M&A volumes. To give you a sense of this, the total gross proceeds from monetization activity in our private equity and real assets businesses year-to-date have been approximately $13 billion. That is up over 60% from the same time last year. And as we look ahead, presuming the market backdrop remains constructive, we expect you'll see a further acceleration of activity across the industry. And against this backdrop, we feel very well-positioned. One of the areas that we watch closely as a management team is the maturity of our portfolios. Today we are in a very good position, which reflects our discipline, we think, around investment pacing and linear deployment. First, we have a number of public positions with meaningful embedded gains. As of quarter end, six of our sizable positions were trading between 4x and over 30x cost. Just looking at our private equity portfolio overall, over 60% of fair value is marked at 1.5x cost or greater, with approximately 30% marked at 2x cost or greater. In addition, our real assets businesses are currently under-earning as our portfolios continue to mature. In total, our gross unrealized carried interest stands at $7.9 billion at quarter end. That's up 40% year-on-year. And looking more broadly, if you include our balance sheet investments, so as a reminder, this does not include core private equity. The total embedded gains are $10.9 billion, which is also up 40% year-on-year. When you factor in that we have been monetizing at a healthy pace relative to the industry, this stat really does speak to the strength of our investment performance as well as the health of our global portfolio. And I think all of this really positions us well to generate future investing earnings. Turning next to new capital raised. This totaled $24 billion for the quarter, bringing us to over $85 billion year-to-date. In the quarter, nearly half of this activity was driven by credit, as our business has grown alongside the capabilities of Global Atlantic. Two additional topics of note here. First, our K-Series vehicle saw strong fundraising, with over $2 billion of new capital raised in Q3, driven by our private equity and our infrastructure strategies. And looking at K-Series across all four investing verticals, we are now at $14 billion of AUM. That's up from $5 billion a year ago. We're continuing to launch our products and new platforms and are still ramping on those that we've been added to already. We remain really encouraged by our progress to date with a tremendous amount of opportunity still in front of us. And second, over time we have talked about long-dated multi-asset class strategic partnerships that have recycling provisions. Given the breadth as well as the connectivity across our firm, we are uniquely positioned to create these types of partnerships. This quarter, rather, we closed on a $3 billion real asset strategic partnership with a large sovereign wealth fund, which we expect will positively impact both our infrastructure and real estate platforms for two plus decades. Before I conclude, I did want to spend a few minutes on a couple of elements of our model that I think are really unique and also operating at a very high-level. First on Global Atlantic, on the last couple of earnings calls we talked about GA operating with elevated levels of liquidity after the large block transactions closed at the end of last year as well as early this year. We have seen increased coordination and investment activity across several of our asset classes, including now infrastructure, real estate and credit. We remain encouraged by the quality of the deal flow that we were able to match up against some of the very long-dated liabilities that we have taken on. And the second area I wanted to touch on was that you really saw the power of our business model this quarter with our capital markets business producing record revenues of $424 million. This reflected activity across infrastructure, traditional private equity and credit, as well as existing portfolio company opportunistic financings and third-party transactions. While the quarter did benefit from a few sizable fee events as well as timing, around 100 different transactions contributed to the outcome this quarter, which demonstrates the breadth and diversification of our business. Now, we don't think $400 plus million is the new quarterly run rate for our capital markets business, but this quarter really illustrates the degree to which our model is built to capture very significant economics. We have built this part of our business very deliberately, and being able to achieve these types of outcomes is not a surprise. Just to close out, our management team remains incredibly excited about the potential of our firm and our ability to inflect up in a recovering deal and exit environment. And as we look to the rest of the year, we will continue to stay just as focused on scaling our businesses and taking full advantage of the unique capabilities that our model presents. With that, Scott, Craig and I are happy to take your questions. Craig, I'll pick up on just the capital markets question real quick. Obviously, a really strong quarter for us in capital markets. I did mention that we had a couple or few chunkier transactions, which is really to be expected in quarters of high levels of deployment and activity. But I also note that we had over 100 different transactions contribute to the quarter, and I really do think it shows the diversification and breadth of the business model. And you mentioned it, a big quarter as it relates to infrastructure, but obviously we have lots of other parts of our business that contribute a great deal to our capital markets business over time, whether that's private equity, traditional core private equity aspects of credit, what we're building across Global Atlantic, our geographic breadth, so lots of different ways for us to positively impact the P&L. Hey, Brian, it's Rob. Thanks for the question. What you saw in the quarter in the 7.9 of accrued carry, I'd say that that is much more broad-based performance, where you're really starting to see us inflect up. It comes from our real assets portfolio in particular, infrastructure of course, if you look at our flagship infrastructure funds, we went from 1 to 3 to 7 to 17 plus. And so as we scaled and performed, you're going to see that accrued carry build and then importantly now you're starting to see that realized carry start to flow through the P&L as well. As it relates to the balance sheet embedded gains, listen, I think that's going to be a function of the monetization environment. And when you're going to see that flow through the P&L right now, we are seeing more opportunities to be able to create access for our portfolio companies, which is where largely most of that embedded gain on the balance sheet sits. And so, I would say if the environment remains constructive over the course of 2025, we would expect to be able to generate some more material balance sheet related realizations through the next 12 months. Thanks a lot, Brian. Yes, sure. Brian, thanks for the question. Obviously, a really great quarter for us. And there's a lot of reasons for us to feel really positive about our capital markets business. And you would have heard us say this in the past. This is not the type of business that is great to evaluate on a quarterly basis. Certainly, as a senior leadership team, as we evaluate performance, it's much more on an annual basis. And maybe, as we talk about the future, it's instructive a little bit to go back in history a bit on this business. If you look at our capital markets business in 2021, we generated roughly $850 million of revenue. Now obviously the capital markets were buoyant through that 12-month period of time, but it was a record fee number for our business. Now if you look at 2022 and 2023, when capital markets were largely shut across that 24-month period of time, our capital markets business still generated $600 million of revenue, plus or minus, in each of those 2 years. Now, we're actually more proud of that performance, because I really do think it shows the durability of the franchise. And as you look at 2024, the year start off a little bit slower. You had some catch-up on activity. It's in part the reason why you saw a spike that happened through the third quarter. But as we look at the year in aggregate, our expectation is that we're going to be up 50%-ish plus or minus, relative to 2022 and 2023. So it should be a new record year for us on the capital markets side, assuming no deals we expect to close in Q4 don't end up getting pushed. But we're really constructive around that 4-year trajectory and journey, and it really helps inform our views of the future, both around the durability of the franchise in down markets, but really our ability to inflect up, continue to grow as KKR does more, continue to grow geographically. We've talked about the very big opportunity that we see existing between GA and our capital markets, structured finance team is working in partnership together, and I really do think our third-party capital markets business is a unique model and very differentiated approach to the market that will continue to market share over time. So we're, as you can tell, really constructive on the business, but it's not really the type of business that I think is great to evaluate quarter in, quarter out. Thank you. Hey, Kyle, thanks a lot for the question. At the most important level, which is how we're performing across the enterprise, how we're going out and sourcing low-cost simple liabilities at scale, how we're taking those liabilities and then putting them to work, we feel like we're operating at a really high-level. And so as we think about our ability to generate meaningful ROE and ultimately operating earnings for our shareholders, I know that we continue to be on a really great path. And the question as to how we operate and at what level of ROE is going to depend on a whole number of factors that we're watching, which including how quickly we grow and in what kind of way that we grow. Let's take our institutional business as an example. We've talked about the block business. We've been really active, have found some really exciting opportunities, as you know, Q4 and Q1 of this past year, but to work a material amount of capital. Now in those transactions, we underwrite IRRs to 12 to 18-month redeployment periods. So you're taking on the full cost of those liabilities, but not yet generating the full asset return for some period of time priced into the IRRs, which we think are really attractive but not going to come through operating earnings initially. So I think there's multiple different things that will impact your question, but you've followed us now for some time. I think you know that as a management team, we're always going to lean in around upfront investment for longer term gain. And so as we think about the long-term ROE for this business, undoubtedly, we continue to feel like 14% to 15% pre-tax, right level to model going forward. But at the same time, we don't have a specific timeline that's going to depend on these variables that we went through. But we do feel really great how our teams are working together, and no doubt it's been elevated since we bought 100% earlier this year. Yes, great. Thanks a lot for the question. So we're always going to be focused on portfolio optimization, so it's possible that you could see some names come in and out of the portfolio over time. But the overall plan of long-term holds within our strategic holding segment is unchanged. As it relates to FiberCop specifically, this was a portfolio company that we actually owned in partnership with Telecom Italia. And so when we closed on our much broader transaction with Telecom Italia in July, we ended up cleaning up the capital structure and the legacy holding ended up getting cashed out. So that's why you see the monetization flow through in Q3 of this year. As it relates to our guidance, the $300 plus million of operating earnings by 2026, $600 plus million by 2028, and $1 billion plus by 2030, if anything, our conviction level as a management team and our ability to achieve those numbers has only gone up since we initially provided that guidance in the first last November and then updated at our Investor Day in April. Thank you. I think the very short answer, Dan, is it was a solid contributor in the quarter, but not all that material in the context of $420 plus million of revenue. That said, we've talked about believing that the opportunity in that line of business for us is in the hundreds of millions of dollars over time, and that perspective is unchanged. Thank you. Yes, of course, Patrick. So we've got a pretty good amount of visibility into Q4 right now. So call it plus or minus $500 million of monetization-related revenue. Again, that consists of revenue that has already happened or revenue that has signed up and we feel really confident will end up closing. Importantly, and this is a little bit different in Q4 of '24. If you look at that $500 million, approximately 60% of that will come through our P&L at the lower 10% to 20% compensation ratio. So the flow through to our P&L will be more significant in Q4 as a result of that dynamic. Obviously, we're also only a month into the quarter, and so hopefully the markets maintain the constructive posture and we're able to generate some additional monetization-related revenue through the remainder of '24. Bill, thanks for the question. We've put some charts up there and some past presentations around the correlation between deployment and our capital markets revenue. That's going to be the largest driver of our business. I would think about the regional expansion of capital markets, particularly in Asia, as upside for what we can create over time as well. Historically, the third-party part of our business has been roughly 20% of our revenue. In 2024, it's a little bit less than that. Really the result of the mid-market sponsor community being a little bit more quiet on the deployment side, but we do expect that to come back, and again, feel really good about our market share. On the topic of margins, this is an important one for us, clearly. What I've said historically is that we feel we could sustainably operate in that mid 60% FRE margin range, which is industry leading. But what I've also said is that's not a cap for us. And if we're able to go out and execute on our business plan, which we've got a lot of confidence we're going to be able to do, it's really all about scaling things that we've already started. And so we believe that we're going to be able to grow our revenue at a materially higher pace than our headcount or the operating complexity that's required to operate KKR. And so the output of that should be, if we're successful here, additional operating leverage and an expansion of what is already industry-leading FRE margins. And as you saw the spike in revenue in Q3, you would have seen that flow through. Thank you. Sure. Maybe let's just talk broadly about the monetization environment, which we feel has really recovered through 2024. The backup here is pretty positive. You've had a period of really sustained strength in the leveraged finance market, which is to us as big a leading indicator as there is. Obviously fixed income spreads have come way in and the equity markets are as strong as they have been. The one area of the capital markets that has been a little bit more sluggish is the IPO market, but we do expect that to change over the coming quarters. I think just looking at our own portfolio, if you look back over the past 12 months, we've had four IPOs of size, and they include businesses in different sectors and different geographies, a growth-oriented business, some mature businesses that are slower growth. And it's just a very small data point, obviously, but all those IPOs are trading well above issued price, and on average they're trading close to 50% above their issued price, and as one of the probably largest equity issuers in the marketplace, that's, while a small data point, I think a helpful one as we think about what the IPO market could look like through 2025. Thank you."

            "name": "Scott Nuttall",
            "content": "Hey Glenn, it's Scott. Thanks for the question. In terms of where it sits, that part of your question, a variety of places. So we have funds, separate accounts, obviously Global Atlantic. These are great assets for the GA balance sheet and third-party insurers. And we've also been able to create structures that allow us to deliver this on an investment-grade basis and a non-investment-grade basis, depending on what the underlying client wants. And I think Craig did a great job summarizing. The only other thing I would point out, this is a very large market. It's about $5 trillion on its way to $7 trillion. So a significant opportunity for growth ahead. So $65 billion is just the start. Hey, Alex, it's Scott. Just on your question, so I would say just higher level, the infrastructure and real estate credit, along with private credit and areas like ABF, we've continued to see a lot of activity and interest from a fundraising standpoint. Allocations have been created, commitments are being made. I would put climate in that category. It's a younger strategy, but I put it in that same category. So don't have a target to give you today, but obviously the investment need is significant. And we think that can be a really large-scale business for us over the time. Real estate equity, as we talked about last quarter, the perspective has been evolving in the markets. Our view is that the real estate markets bottomed in the last half of last year. Part of the reason that we've leaned in so much this year, and you heard stats from Craig, is our view that the bottom was behind us. And I think that perspective is starting to be shared by others. So we are hearing sentiment shift on real estate equity. I think with rates starting to come down, you're going to hear more of that. So we've been leaning in, and I think there's beginning to be a perspective that this is a good time to invest. And over time, you'll see that show up in our Americas, Europe and Asia funds, we believe. But sentiment is definitely turning, and it may take a little bit of time for the capital to start to show up, but we feel like we're in a good spot today and we have those strategies in the market. No, I think first off on the wealth management topic, I think there's a lot of different parts of our firm, Bill, that we've got a lot of growth ahead and the potential is far greater than what's showing up in the numbers. And I think Craig covered it well, but we are getting onto a number of different platforms every quarter. We've now launched in all four product areas. But the full run rate is not in the numbers yet. So we think you're going to continue to see gaining momentum across everything we're doing in wealth. You're also seeing this across a bunch of different parts of the firm, including the real asset space. We talked about capital raising and infrastructure, but these businesses, in terms of what's showing up in the P&L, the carry, the investment earnings, they're not showing up yet, but they're going to show up. And so I think we've got a lot of different parts of the firm that we see embedded growth. There's latent earnings that will continue to show up and latent AUM that will continue to show up as we continue to scale here. On Capital Group, we shared earlier this year that we're going to start with two credit vehicles together. That's very much on track. We are also spending time on product design across the other product verticals and alternatives. And so you'll hear more about that in future quarters. The only thing I would add, Brian, is just for -- and thanks for the question. From a higher altitude comment standpoint, as we've talked about in the past, including at the Investor Day, it takes about 10 to 15 years to scale AUM in our business. You've got to get to Fund 3, Fund 4. As you know, we used to have 5 or 6 strategies at KKR. I was looking at our fundraising sheet last week. We have 57 line items this year, just to give you a sense. So it's 10 to 15 years to get to scale. And then it's oftentimes 5 to 10 years after you get to scale that you start to see carry and investing earnings show up at scale. And remember, we went from that 6 line items to 57 since the end of the financial crisis. So as you think about the momentum we have behind us, to Rob's point, and just what's coming, the 1 billion to 3 billion to 7 billion to 17 billion as an example in infrastructure, that's not really in our earnings yet from a carry standpoint. We have that happening in a lot of different places across the firm, which is part of the reason you hear such confidence in our voices. Good morning. Yes, the only thing I'd add, Steven, is we do feel quite positive. We really like our setup. Not surprisingly, you're really good at math. So I would just -- I would lean even more into the plus. Yes, the only thing I'd add is this isn't a new effort here. We've been focused on this for the last several years. So as we've been constructing portfolios, we've been doing it with the mindset that this could happen over time. Good morning. Thank you. Thanks, Ben. The only thing I'd add, Brian, is we did see the deal market rebound in the first half, took probably the first 6 months to gain momentum to start to come back. So we're seeing, and there's a lot of discussion about the IPO market, which I think is highly relevant, but we're seeing that momentum continue. It's not just IPOs, but it's strategic M&A as well. But there's nothing that we're looking at today. We don't look at this by quarter per se. That would cause us to think there's an air pocket coming. As the guys referenced, the portfolios mature. It's been performing well. If anything, because a bunch of our industry did not sell things last year, there's a pent-up supply of exits coming. Thank you."

During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following management's prepared remarks, the conference will be opened for questions [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now hand the call over to Craig Larson, Partner and Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.\nCraig Larson: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our second quarter 2024 earnings call. This morning, as usual, I'm joined by Rob Lewin, our Chief Financial Officer; and Scott Nuttall, our Co-Chief Executive Officer. We would like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, which is available on the Investor Center section at kkr.com. And as a reminder, we report our segment numbers on an adjusted share basis. This call will contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to our earnings release as well as our SEC filings for cautionary factors about these statements. So first beginning with our results for the second quarter, we are pleased to be reporting fee related earnings of $0.84 per share, the highest we reported in our history and 25% above the figures we reported one year ago. And adjusted net income of $1.09 per share is up approximately 50% compared to one year ago. Going into a little more detail, management fees in the quarter were $847 million. This is up 13% year-over-year, driven by the breadth of our fundraising activities alongside a pickup in deployment. Capital markets transaction fees were strong in the quarter at $192 million, mainly from activity in new and existing portfolio companies within private equity and infrastructure, as well as an overall improvement in both the debt and equity capital markets backdrops. Fee related performance revenues in the quarter were $37 million. This was the first quarter our offshore K-Series vehicles earned their annual incentive fee given their launches about a year ago. The fee related performance revenue figure includes our infrastructure vehicle while to be clear, our performance allocation on our private equity vehicle is reflected in our realized performance income line item that is below fee related earnings. Fee related compensation was right at the midpoint of our guided range, which as a reminder is 17.5%. Other operating expenses came in at $158 million. So in total, FRE was $755 million and our FRE margin came in at 68%. Insurance operating earnings were $253 million in Q2 and strategic holdings operating earnings were $41 million in the second quarter as we continued to track towards our expected $300 million plus of net dividends by 2026. Importantly, we're continuing to see consistent growth across the underlying businesses. KKR's share of these businesses as of the first quarter, so on a one quarter lag basis, LTM revenues were $3.6 billion and EBITDA was approximately $900 million or so, with 14% and 12% like-for-like growth in revenue and EBITDA year-over-year respectively. So altogether, total operating earnings were $1.17 per share. As a reminder, total operating earnings equals our fee related earnings together with insurance and strategic holdings operating earnings. This quarter, total operating earnings represents over 80% of pretax adjusted net income. So said differently, over 80% of our pretax earnings this quarter were driven by our more recurring revenue streams. Turning to investing earnings, realized performance income was $482 million and realized investment income was $139 million. This was driven by secondary and strategic sale activity across a number of asset classes, including private equity infrastructure, as well as across multiple geographies pointing to the maturity and the diversity of our business. So, in aggregate adjusted net income was $972 million, or the $1.09 per share figure I mentioned a moment ago. Moving to investment performance on Page 10 of our earnings release, the traditional private equity portfolio appreciated 4% in the quarter and 18% in the last 12 months. Opportunistic real estate was up 1 in the quarter and up 3 in the LTM. Infrastructure continues to perform well, up 3% in Q2 and up 17% LTM. And in credit, the leveraged credit composite was up 2, and the alternative credit composite was up 3 in Q2. And over the past 12 months, performance here was 12% for both strategies. And given this investment performance, our gross unrealized carried interest balance increased to $7.1 billion and that is up over 40% from Q2 of 2023. And finally, before turning over to Rob, we wanted to reflect for a moment on an exciting milestone as KKR entered the S&P 500 Index in June. We believe this is a strong reflection and endorsement of the firm's performance, our people and our culture, and we want to thank and recognize everyone at KKR for the creativity, innovation and focus that got us to where we are today and will continue to propel us going forward. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Rob.\nRob Lewin: Thanks a lot, Craig. Given the recent S&P 500 inclusion, we expect that there are many on the call listening for the first time. Welcome. We would encourage you to also take a look at our April Investor Day replay and presentation that is found on our website. We feel as good as ever to hit our 2026 guidance figures that we introduced in April. As a reminder, those include $300 billion plus of new capital raised over the course of 2024 through 2026 and in terms of our financial metrics by 2026, $4.50 plus cents per share of FRE, $7 plus per share of total operating earnings and between $7 and $8 of adjusted net income per share, which is after tax. So looking at the LTM figures that we reported this morning, our 2026 guidance implies a 20% annual growth rate, plus or minus across all three of these key financial metrics. Overall, our activity levels and the momentum across the firm feel very strong. We are continuing to see our management fees scale meaningfully with 13% year-over-year growth, and this is before our in-market flagship funds have turned on. We are also seeing continued real signs of the monetization backdrop improving as evidenced by our Q2 realized performance fees and investment income. Last quarter I mentioned that we had very healthy pipelines on the back of the improved environment as well as our diversified and performing portfolio. I will echo those same comments again this quarter.\nOneStream: Turning to strategic holdings, we've only reported this segment on a standalone basis for two quarters, but we remain confident in our ability to take the business to over $1 billion of operating earnings by 2030. Stepping back I don't think there are a lot of corporates giving seven-year guidance, so I think this really does speak to our confidence in both the durability and growth orientation of these cash flows. Now, turning to insurance, there are a lot of really positive developments this quarter, so I wanted to spend a bit of extra time taking you through a number of business building initiatives. In Q2, we saw record volume of inflows from Global Atlantic across annuity sales and flow reinsurance totaling over $8 billion in the quarter, compared to less than $3 billion just a year ago. And looking at the last four quarters in aggregate, total inflows including block activity have been over $50 billion. That's the highest point in any 12-month period in GA's history. On the earnings front, we continue to feel good about our ability to generate 14% to 15% pretax ROEs as the right long-term target. The ROE for Q2 came in below this range as a result of a couple of factors, but mostly a function of us leaning into the long-term opportunity at GA. The drivers for the quarter include elevated levels of liquidity from our big block reinsurance transactions, as well as the significant ramp up in quarterly volumes and some of the investments we are choosing to make that favor longer term ROEs, really at the expense of near-term ROEs. Overall, we continue to feel great about the long-term trajectory at GA and the opportunity for us to create significant value together. In particular, given that we are now six plus months into owning 100%, we thought we'd bring you through some tangible examples of how our closer collaboration across investments as well as capital markets are driving real business performance. First, in real estate, we recently closed on a $2 billion unlevered acquisition of a 5000 plus unit multifamily portfolio. Given the dearth of real estate, excuse me, of core real estate capital globally, we are seeing excellent risk return for the few very well capitalized buyers in the market of which we are one. We have conservatively priced this deal to an 8% unlevered return with significant upside potential, which we think is a really compelling risk adjusted return. But it's the type of deal that is going to put some pressure on our near-term ROEs for the benefit of longer term profitability. As an example, we expect the year one yield on this portfolio to be in the low 4% range, obviously less than where we are originating our liabilities today. But the combination of yields increasing over time and the expected appreciation of the asset make this a really interesting deal and one we're excited to pursue for the long-term. Now, there will naturally be a limit to how much of this type of investment that we want to make, but I think it's a really great example of our increased coordination between our real estate equity team and GA. We also have had a very positive development this quarter on the infrastructure side of our business. We announced an investment in Labrador Island Link, which is a transmission line that brings renewable energy to Eastern Canada. This is the first collaboration between Global Atlantic and KKR's infrastructure teams, who work together to structure the equity interest with significant downside protection. And finally, we wanted to take you through a brief case study from early Q3 that combines Global Atlantic, our credit teams, as well as our capital markets franchise. CyrusOne, a data center portfolio company of ours, has been growing rapidly with demand for hyperscale facilities continuing to increase driven by cloud and AI deployment. To support this growth, our capital markets team helped arrange an $8 billion facility of which we sole led the $3 billion institutional tranche that was anchored by Global Atlantic. Strategically, this represents a really exciting evolution in our playbook, where we generated a great outcome for a portfolio company, made a compelling credit investment, and were able to simultaneously drive capital markets fees. All of these examples would not have been possible without the interconnectivity across the firm and our model. We expect many more examples like this to come. Now before handing it off to Scott, I wanted to briefly touch on some of our operating metrics across the firm, where there continues to be very significant momentum. In the quarter we raised $32 billion of capital. This is the second most active fundraising quarter in our history. This is the second most active fundraising quarter in our history. Of particular note, we're very pleased with the initial reception of our global infrastructure V fund. Through July, approximately $10 billion of capital has been raised and in June we launched our Americas private equity flagship fundraise. So our fundraising super cycle is now well underway. Also, within private equity, our middle market strategy called Ascendant has already achieved its fundraising goal of $4 billion and we have not yet held its final close. It's a great outcome for a first time fund, obviously something that is adjacent and benefiting from our existing private equity team, and I think it really speaks to the receptivity of our investors to the quality of our team and our track record as we look to fundraise for our next flagship. Focusing for a moment specifically on private wealth, our K-Series vehicles in the quarter raised $2.8 billion of capital, 60% of which was driven by our private equity strategy. The K-Series suite has gained real momentum, but we are still in the earliest of days of what we view to be a really long-term strategic focus. As a reminder, we now have vehicles across our four key investing verticals. That's private equity, infrastructure, real estate, as well as credit, representing over $11 billion of AUM, and that's up from approximately $3 billion just a year ago. And looking beyond K-Series, we recently announced our exclusive strategic partnership with Capital Group, one of the largest global active asset managers. With $2.6 trillion of AUM and serving 67 million individual investors, Capital Group has built a leading client franchise with world class wealth distribution capabilities. By combining Capital Group's public market investing as well as distribution expertise with KKR's nearly 50-year track record in alternatives investing, we plan to introduce a series of hybrid public, private investment solutions that make the KKR platform available to a broader universe of investors. Importantly, the hybrid products are a step beyond what we are already doing with the K-Series and the accredited investor universe as they expand our reach to include the mass market. We're excited about the future of this collaboration, and we will share much more as we approach the product's expected launch in 2025. Turning to capital invested, we deployed $23 billion of capital in Q2. For the first half of 2024 we have now deployed $37 billion, which is almost double the first half of 2023. Real estate in particular had a strong deployment quarter across equity and credit. On the credit and liquid strategy side, direct lending continued to put capital to work as well as opportunities in high-grade ABF. Importantly, there remains a very healthy pipeline for deployment in the second half of 2024 as well. Overall, we remain very excited around the business momentum that we are seeing across the firm and how that can really translate into further P&L outcomes over the second half of the year. And with that, let me turn it over to Scott.\nScott Nuttall: Thank you Rob, and thank you everybody for joining our call today. Last month we held our annual meeting for our fund investors, followed by KKR's partners meeting. I thought while we were together today I would share some of the messages we shared in those sessions and some reflections from Joe and me on the first half of the year and our expectations for the second half. The main message we shared with our investors is that we are seeing significantly greater market activity since the beginning of the year. The macro inflation and rates backdrop has improved, markets are open and the deal market is back. To give you a sense, globally, year-to-date, leveraged credit issuance is up over 100%, IPOs are up nearly 15% and announced M&A is up approximately 25%. And given it typically takes a couple of quarters for the market to turn back on, these numbers understate the run rate activity we are feeling today. If this momentum continues, we believe you will see even more activity and announced deals and exits in the second half of the year. We are seeing this dynamic across our businesses. Deployment is up, monetizations are up, capital markets revenues are up, yield pipelines are up and visibility is high. Unless something happens to disrupt this momentum, we expect to see increased activity in the second half of this year relative to the first. What's also encouraging is that we believe this is a very attractive investment environment. Volatility and uncertainty are still with us. So far 2024 feels like it could be a sweet spot year where values are attractive and activity levels are high. This is in contrast to last year when values were attractive but transaction volumes were more muted as owners of mature assets didn't want to sell or finance them in a closed market. This year we not only have an open market, we have pent up supply of deals that didn't get done the last couple of years coming to market, so we are optimistic. A couple other things we shared in our June sessions, in private equity, while many in our industry over deployed in and around 2021, we did not. We have been applying the lessons we learned before and during the financial crisis and have been deploying in a linear fashion the last many years. As a result, we have strong returns, dry powder and a healthy portfolio. In credit we're seeing the benefits of a scaled $230 billion plus platform with significant opportunity across now a $40 trillion global credit space. Our private credit business is now over $100 billion and we continue to see attractive investing opportunities in asset based finance, Asia credit, opportunistic investing and junior debt amongst other areas. In infrastructure, the global opportunity is immense across our efforts in core, value add and climate. The capital need massively outstrips supply and we feel very well positioned. In real estate, the credit opportunity remains compelling with banks on the sidelines and the equity investment opportunity is very attractive. As a reminder, we started our real estate business in 2011. We don't have office and retail exposure of any consequence, so we have the ability to play offense in this environment and we believe we will take share over the next several years and will benefit from the current and coming dislocation. The real estate investment opportunity is highly compelling. We have closed or are under exclusive contract on over $10 billion of real estate equity deals since April 1 and have a full pipeline as some owners of real estate seek liquidity and sell their best assets. And in this environment, scale is trading at a discount. And we also introduced a fifth asset class to our investors in June, insurance. This is the ivy sidecar franchise that invests alongside the global Atlantic balance sheet in block and flow deals. This area has amongst the most compelling capital supply-demand imbalances we see across the firm. And speaking of GA, we're now roughly seven months since we became 100% owners. We've been focused on mining the untapped opportunities we shared with you last November when we announced the deal. As you heard, GA is growing rapidly and as we transition the business to 100% ownership, we're seeing the combined impact of simultaneous fast growth and investing in the business for the long-term. As we sit here today, we feel very optimistic about the opportunities to create value with GA at 100%, investing across more KKR asset classes, scaling KKR capital markets and structured assets, going global in particularly in Japan, and finding more ways to work together more broadly. Overall, the opportunity with GA is greater in our minds today than it was at the beginning of the year. So to keep it simple, the market is open, the firm is very active, our investment performance is particularly strong. We've never felt better about our team and we are well positioned to execute the plan we shared with you at our April Investor Day. With that, we're happy to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Good morning, everyone. My question is on GA's net investment income in your comments on long-term versus near-term ROEs. So given GA's investment portfolio yield that it's currently depressed because you have excess levels of liquidity that have yet to be deployed, how do you expect yields to improve as you fully deploy the excess liquidity and over what timeline?\nRob Lewin: Hey Craig, it's Rob. Thanks for the question. Why don't I start out and there's a couple of things going on, and maybe the shorter part of your answer is going to ultimately depend on what the growth is from here, but maybe let's talk a little bit about what we're seeing in the business. You referenced a lot of growth and just to put some numbers around that, if you look at the past nine months, we've taken on $50 billion of additional capital. That compares to $20 billion in the preceding nine months. And we're trying to be very thoughtful, as you can imagine, around deployment, as we're digesting that growth. We're also using new muscles inside of our firm as it relates to linking up our real estate equity team, our infrastructure team, our capital markets team and so there's a lot of really good work going on. And as a result, we've been operating at elevated levels of liquidity. And so just again, to put some numbers behind that, if you look at the end of the quarter, we had roughly $8 billion of cash. If you look a year ago, that number was closer to $4 billion and that doesn't even take into account a lot of the high-grade corporates that we have that are being weighted to be rotated into higher yielding assets. And I think the other point that I think is worth talking about, as we think about what the medium term net investment income can look like and ROE could look like, is really this point I was trying to get at in the prepared remarks around us actively making investments today that we believe will generate meaningful long-term ROE, but that's coming at the expense of shorter term ROE. It's that core real estate example that I mentioned where day one, we expect running yields to be roughly 4%. If you think about where we're originating liabilities today, that's north of 5% and so not only are those investments not accretive to our near-term P&L, they're actually dilutive. But for those who have followed us a while, been shareholders with us for a long time, I think they'll know that we're always going to make the decision to take some pain on short-term P&L for long-term earnings power. And so it's tough to then extrapolate from there exactly what that's going to mean to near-term ROEs and returns as a lot of that is a function of the growth that we expect. But as we look forward, we look at Q3 and Q4, our expectation is we'll have operating earnings that are in and around where we are in Q2. And as we think about how we ramp up into 2025, my expectation is we're probably based on the growth we see in front of us, we're probably operating at a level that's a little bit below our 14% to 15% long-term ROE range. But again, all in service for that long-term growth that we feel across the KKR platform and that we believe pretty strongly will benefit GA's long-term P&L.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you, Rob.\nRob Lewin: Thanks, Craig.\nScott Nuttall: Thanks, Craig.\nOperator: Next question, Bill Katz with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nBill Katz: Okay. Thank you very much. So many questions, but in so little time. Just in terms of volume, so you reiterated the $300 billion, you're certainly well on your way to that. You launched, you got the first close in on Global V, and V is great and you mentioned that you sort of now in the market for the North America fund. I was wondering if you could just sort of comment about what you're hearing from the LPs on demand across the asset classes? And then maybe tie that into Asia, when that might start to come into the market as well? Thank you.\nScott Nuttall: Hey, Bill, it's Scott. Thanks for the question. There are a couple things. One is just broader context for you. I know there tends to be a lot of focus on the flagship funds, but if you go back and think about what's been going on with the firm, even go back to the beginning of 2022, so call it the last two and a half years, we raised $214 billion. Only $14 billion of the 214 was in flagships. So happy to chat about the flagships, but we should also keep in mind the vast majority of the activity that we've been generating has been outside of that and to your point, we now have the flagships coming back as well. The overall tone in the fundraising market continues to improve. I think it kind of depends on where you are and what you're talking about. So let's just talk about asset classes. Infrastructure and private credit, we continued to see investors very interested and trying to catch-up to the allocations that they have made. So it continues to be quite a bit of activity in those asset classes. I would also include real estate credit in that area. It's kind of a similar theme to private corporate credit. Then you kind of move on into real estate equity, where I think the sentiment is shifting a bit right now. There has been more caution, no doubt. Our perspective is that the sentiment has bottomed in the last year. Valuations have bottomed in the first half of this year, and as you heard in the prepared remarks, we've been quite active deploying into real estate equity. I'd say the fundraising is going to lag that reality a little bit, but we're starting to have more conversations with investors that understand, although it may be perceived as a bit contrarian, this is a really good time to invest in real estate equity. And then in private equity activity is picking up. As you heard, monetizations are up and deployment is up. People are starting to get more money back, so those with more mature programs are starting to see some of that. I think you'll see more of that as we get into the latter half of the year. We have just launched our flagship U.S. private equity funds. There's not a lot to report as of yet. I'll let Craig give an update on our Ascendant strategy, which is a recent data point in a minute. But it feels to us like there's a decent chance the private equity fundraising environment has bottomed as well and you'll start to see sentiment shift to the positive. More broadly, as you know, private wealth, big opportunity for us all upside. Insurance companies we thought might pull back from us a little bit as rates went up, have not seen that, actually are seeing as much activity and momentum in insurance as we've seen in a while. And so we do think there's quite a bit of activity. Sorry for the long answer, but hopefully it gives you a sense that there's a variety of different things happening underneath the surface. And on private equity, Craig, why don't you just give the latest data point we have? It's not a big one, but it's at least indicative.\nCraig Larson: Sure. Hey Bill, thanks for the question. So, as you heard from Rob in our prepared remarks, we've made what we feel is some great progress on Ascendant. That's our middle market private equity strategy, first time vehicle for us. As of June 30, we're at $4.1 billion. We have a $4.6 billion hard cap there, and we're in a pretty advantageous spot at the moment. We're oversubscribed at that hard cap. And so to be clear, we are turning away clients that want to begin final diligence there. And for some of those clients, through final diligence, we're cutting back on allocations. So the backdrop is one that feels constructive there. Again, far too early to try to lead through those dynamics as it relates to North America $14 billion [ph], but again, thought that would also be a helpful data point.\nRob Lewin: And Bill, just one other thing from me, maybe two quick, because I know there's a lot of interest in the fundraising environment. We are continuing to see a couple of other themes. One is concentration of relationships. So we're finding more investors want to do more with fewer partners, and so we're continuing to see that trend accelerate. Also, I think there's increased recognition of what we've been talking about for the last decade, plus the power of portfolio construction, deployment, pacing and tools to add value. And you're going to see much higher dispersion of results, I think and we'll figure out who did a good job the last five years and we feel really well positioned in that context.\nBill Katz: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question, Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAlexander Blostein: Hey, good morning, everybody. Thank you for the question. So, I wanted to start with a question around the outlook for deployment. You mentioned it a number of times that the pipelines look pretty robust and you've announced a handful of deals as well. So when we think about private equity in particular, as you deploy this capital, how are you thinking about utilization of direct lending markets versus syndicated markets over the coming several quarters? And on the flip side, I guess, what does that mean for your own direct lending business as you're navigating this environment where syndicated bank loan market seems to be back in kind of full force? Thanks.\nCraig Larson: Alex, it's Craig. Why don't I start? So first, just as it relates to private equity, and you would have seen some of this in the page in our press release, we are have a very healthy backlog of traditional private equity investments. Feels like in the second half of the year, we're going to continue to see an acceleration of activity there, which is great to see. I think on your point on the syndicated versus the direct lending of private debt markets, it just provides optionality. When we think back, or when we all think back to a year ago in the syndicated debt markets were closed, I think we saw M&A volumes, honestly be pretty modest. And as Scott had mentioned, we were very constructive on risk reward. But with many of those financing markets effectively shut in the syndicated markets in particular, it just led to a reduced level of activity. So I think it's actually very helpful in terms of private equity deployment, honestly, in terms of private debt deployment and the outlook to have a very healthy syndicated debt market. But we'll be able to, from again, a PE standpoint, it gives us the flexibility to think through what we think the right solution is in the framework of that particular investment. So I think with a private debt hat on, you may see a smaller market share versus those environments where the syndicated debt markets are really volatile. But you'll see overall volumes be a lot higher.\nScott Nuttall: Yes, Alex, it's Scott. I think that's well said. We use both. It depends on the circumstance and the deal. The way I think about this is last year the deal volumes were so muted. It was quite a bit of focus on how large a share the private credit market had. This is one of these environments where it becomes clear that a smaller share of more pie can still be more pie. And so that's how I would think about it.\nOperator: Next question, Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Davitt: Hey, good morning, everyone. Could you give us an update on the K Series distribution rollout and to what extent you can give specifics on any large platforms coming online with certain products over the next few quarters. And then more broadly, any update or thoughts on plans to add new products to the suite? Thank you.\nCraig Larson: Patrick, it's Craig. Why don't I begin? And just to step back to level set for everyone, as of June 30, we had around $75 billion of assets under management from individuals, and that number does not include policyholders at Global Atlantic. So if anything, that would understate our presence as you think about the breadth of activities that we have. Now most of that capital is from high net worth and ultrahigh net worth individuals and family offices that are invested directly in our funds and strategies. And over time, we've tended to see teens percentage of our new capital raise come from individuals. So it's been a healthy part of our fundraising. Now, most recently, again is, I know you know wonderfully well, we've introduced our K Series suite of products. These are the funds and strategies that are designed and tailored specifically for that wealth market. So we have K-Infra and KIF for the U.S. and non-U.S. vehicles focused on infrastructure. Similarly, we have U.S. and non-U.S. vehicles focused on private equity, private BDCs also. And then we also have additional real estate and credit vehicles. And so of that $75 billion, around eleven are from these K-Series suite of products. And a year ago that was three. So we're in the early days, but we feel really good about our progress. And I think that's particularly true in infrastructure as well as in private equity, which are newer asset classes here. And it feels like we have an opportunity as a first mover. Now in terms of ramp and pace at the end of 2023, we mentioned that we were raising about $500 million a month. In Q1, we raised $1.8 billion, so we were at $600 million a month. Q2 we raised $2.8 billion, so $900 million a month or thereabouts. So it seems like reception and interests and momentum feels really good. We don't have a specific update in terms of number of platforms, but to be clear, we do expect the number of platforms where we're present to increase over the coming months and quarters. I think that's going to be particularly true in terms of the private BDC, which is the youngest of those, of those products for us. So it feels like great progress. And again, I wouldn't take the eye away from the prize like we do think the more interesting point here is really that long-term secular opportunity, mass affluent individual investors have not had an easy way to access alts over the coming years. We do expect an opportunity for trillions of dollars of assets to flow into these products. And given our brand, our track record, and the investments we've made in distribution and marketing, it just feels like we're really well positioned to continue to be a winner. And our strategic partnership with Capital Group, as we touched on in our prepared remarks, just increases this opportunity set. So hopefully that's helpful.\nScott Nuttall: Hey, Patrick, it's Scott. Just a couple of quick additions. The platform rollout is kind of at or slightly ahead of our expectations. And it takes a while once you get on a platform to have it really kick in and work and train the advisors and the sales team. So I'd say really pleased with the progress, but the kind of capital raising power isn't embedded yet in the numbers that Craig walked through. To your question on new products, we don't have anything new to announce on the K-Series front today, but in the prepared remarks, we did mention our Capital Group partnership. As a reminder there, we're creating hybrid product in partnership with Capital Group. We announced two credit products that we're going to launch in the first half of next year together. But to be clear, that is not the extent of the vision. We expect to roll out hybrid products across the other parts of the alternative space as well with our partner. So more to come on that over the next few quarters.\nOperator: Next question, Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Pease go ahead.\nDaniel Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. So I just wanted to build upon that on the Capital Group partnership. If you could maybe talk about the context and the background of how you came to choosing each other in terms of the partner. And then you just mentioned a couple of products next year and then kind of the longer term vision. So I think you've said previously that you're not looking to have a whole suite of products out there for the retail market, but so curious as how you're going to differentiate between the K Series and the Capital Group partnerships and what you think a more mature product lineup looks like?\nScott Nuttall: Thanks, Dan. I'll take a crack. How did it come together? A Capital Group called us and they had been thinking about how they wanted to participate in the alternative space. And if you go back to, I think, the original press release that our partner, Mike Gitlin did a really nice job laying out how they thought about it. Should they acquire something? Should they partner? Should they buy pieces of different businesses? And they decided that partnering was the best act. So, to be clear, they called us. We spent quite a bit of time together, got to know each other really well as firms and as people. And I think the reason this came together is the reason most things come together, just an extraordinary cultural fit. We thought about the world the same way, same focus on delivering value for all the clients counting on us and understanding, really who we work for. So that's how it came together. It was kind of a joint vision and shared values and how we see the world in terms of kind of where we're going and how this is different. So one simple way to think about it, let's just take the U.S. market. And the numbers are never precise, but to be close enough, with our K Series, we're targeting the accredited investor and the qualified purchaser. That's roughly 5%, give or take, of U.S. households. I'm close, but it's single-digits, mid-single-digits percent, depending on what you look at. That means there's 95% of U.S. households that it does not access. And so what we're doing with Capital Group is creating a product that will allow the other 95% of households to participate in what we do. In its simplest form, that's what we're doing. So it's hybrid. So there's going to be an element that is going to be the liquid strategies that will be managed by Capital Group and then a portion that is the private market strategies that will be managed by us. So think of all of these products as having a component of both and geared toward that broader audience, that mass market. As I said, we're starting with credit. So think of it as a component of liquid credit plus private credit. And for us, that will include both direct lending and asset based finance in the private credit sleeve. And then for the other products that we're talking about launching, infrastructure, private equity, real estate, we're in the design phase. So I would expect over time, I'm not going to put a timeframe on it today, but over time, you will likely see products from us together across all of those areas. And so that's how we expect it to play out over the coming years. But we'll keep you posted, but hopefully that helps.\nDaniel Fannon: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Next question, Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBrian Bedell: Great, thanks. Good morning. Yes, lots of questions to ask. Maybe if I can wrap in a two-part here on the capital markets that you talked about for the third quarter being elevated. Is there any Telecom Italia lumpiness in that? And do you see the environment for your capital markets fees improving as we move into the end of the year, given the pent-up demand that you were talking about? And then just if I can squeeze in an FRE margin question, the incremental margin on capital markets, obviously, I think being, well, maybe you can comment, is that above your overall FRE margin, therefore accretive? And do you see the 68% as sort of a peak.\nScott Nuttall: Right, thanks Brian. Good morning. So as it relates to capital markets, you're right, that Telecom Italia transaction closed July 1. We will generate a meaningful capital markets fee as part of being involved multiple different aspects of that transaction. But I would tell you, as I look at our broad-based capital markets pipeline, I think pipelines for that business are certainly good one quarter out, but probably two quarters. As I look at that back half of the year, I tell you that our aggregate pipeline is as good as we've ever seen it. And that includes 2021, when we generated roughly $850 million of revenue or capital markets business. So we're quite encouraged around what the back half of the year could look like. Again these are pipelines. They're forward indicators. A lot of stuff needs to come to fruition, but it is broad-based. It's across debt, it's across equity. It's U.S., Europe, Asia. It's also third party. So we're feeling really good about what the back half of the year could look like. As it relates to FRE margin, I would say absolutely. In an elevated capital markets quarter, you are going to see higher FRE margin the flow through is just higher, given our operating expenses are more fixed in nature relative to that incremental capital markets revenue. Here's how I've described our FRE margin in the past. I believe that today we can operate sustainably in the mid-60s on FRE margin basis across the firm, and that includes in most market environments, but that is definitely not the cap for us. And if we're successful with the business model that we've got a lot of conviction in here as a management team. We're going to scale our revenue. We're going to scale our fees at a pace that's meaningfully above our headcount growth and our operating complexity across the firm. And we would expect more margin expansion in the future if we're successful. So hopefully that gives you some color on the back half of the year and what we're feeling in capital markets and how that might translate into FRE margin.\nBrian Bedell: Super helpful. Thank you.\nScott Nuttall: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question, Brian McKenna with Citizens JMP. Please go ahead.\nBrian McKenna: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So you have $215 billion of carry eligible, 81 that's above cost and accruing carry. Would be great to get an update on how much this has grown over the past year, specifically on the heels of strong performance and then as you continue to deploy capital? And then is there a way to think about the breakdown of this AUM by vintage? How much is less than a few years old versus how much is older than that? I'm just trying to get a sense of the magnitude of the step up and accrued performance fees and ultimately realizations over the next couple of years.\nScott Nuttall: Yes, thanks, Brian, and let me take a shot at that. And we don't break out the vintage, but we could tell you that our, we've spent a lot of time around linear deployment as a firm, and so, feel good that as you look back over the past seven or eight years, you're going to find a healthy level of dispersion across different vintages. I think that to me, the metric that I look at as the best forward indicator, honestly, is the simplest one, and that's our gross accrued carried interest, that today on our balance sheet is roughly $7.1 billion. If you look back just two quarters ago, that number was $6 billion. So in an environment where we've actually been realizing a little bit more carry than we were expecting to realize, those are pretty healthy levels of step ups across the firm. And I think paints a pretty good picture for what the forward could look like as it relates to monetization related revenue book carried interest. But also we feel good about how investment income might ramp from here as well.\nBrian McKenna: Helpful. Thanks, Scott.\nRob Lewin: Just one additional statistic there, and this is not going to tie to your question specifically on the capital that is above cost and accruing carry, but just to look at the private equity portfolio as a whole and give you a sense, well over 50% of that, when we look at our remaining fair value, is marked at 1.5 times cost or greater. And roughly 30% of that capital dollars is at roughly 30% of that, excuse me, is marked at two times cost and greater. So I think one of the things that our team talked about at Investor Day, Pete and Nate, was this approach we've had on linear deployment. I think that has really served us well in terms of having a more mature portfolio. And I think some of the discipline that you've seen and how we've invested capital over the last several years, and honestly, lessons that we learned dating back to the GFC have an opportunity to really pay us dividends in the years ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you, guys.\nRob Lewin: Thank you.\nScott Nuttall: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question, Benjamin Budish with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBenjamin Budish: Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Given a lot of color around the capital markets outlook going into Q3, I was wondering if you could give us an update on the visible pipeline in terms of realizations and along the same lines. Could you talk about the $500 million in expected realization revenues thereabouts? What ended up shaking out better than you expected for Q2? Thank you.\nScott Nuttall: Sure. Thanks, Ben. I'll hand it above. Let me start with just visibility around monetizations for Q3. It's at a pretty healthy level. We are plus or minus 500 million of monetization related revenue for Q3. That is either that has either happened or from deals that are signed up that we expect to close this quarter. Just breakdown wise, that's roughly 60% carry and 40% investment income. So that pipeline is better today than it's been in quite some time. And then your question as it relates to the end of quarter press release we put out on our monetization update. You know that I think that press release went out around June 20. We give our best estimate and view of the quarter at that time. And of course things can happen in the next 10 days. And we had a few things that ended up on one side of the quarter versus the other. But I wouldn't say anything necessarily significant in size. One thing that was significant size, a few things that that added up to create the delta that you're referring to between where we landed, which is a bit over $600 million, and that June 20 press release that I believe stated we were at greater than $500 million through that point in time.\nBenjamin Budish: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nSteven Chubak: Good morning. So wanted to squeeze in just another question on cap markets, but I want to look at it with a longer term lens. It is something I pressed you guys on in the past, but just given the pipeline strength, sponsor recovery still feels like it's in the early stages. You expect to at least monetize the 100% GA ownership better. You're certainly going to see significant franchise growth over the next few years relative to the prior cycle peak. How would you frame what the capital markets trajectory for revenues might look like? Is there a way to maybe size what, under a normalized lens or by 2026, what you think the fee generation potential could be of that business?\nRob Lewin: Thanks, Steven. I'm not going to give you a number. We haven't given a number in the past, but let me try and frame it. In 2021, we did 850 million of revenue. Now the capital markets were pretty buoyant in 2021, but when you look at KKR and our platform, we do so much more across the firm. We think the opportunity to expand from a geographic perspective as the Asia capital markets mature is one that's very meaningful. That's both across Asia Pac, but also in Japan. And we're building for that effort. We're doing a lot more on the equity side of our business and the structured debt side of our business in combination. As you said with Global Atlantic, we've talked about that being a couple hundred plus million dollar revenue opportunity in its own right. And I really believe that our third-party capital markets business is going to continue to take share. We just have a very differentiated model in how we're approaching corporates and sponsors that we see resonate with the market daily. And we think we're also in a position where we're able to continue to recruit and retain best-in-class professionals to both execute and distribute those capital markets transactions. And so while we're not going to give you sort of that number, I think we're painting a picture of a business that we think can grow meaningfully from the base that we're at today.\nScott Nuttall: It's a really good question, Steven. Maybe we should invite you to our budget meetings. But to Rob's point, we're working across more asset classes, doing more in Europe and Asia, third parties up GA, we think is hundreds of millions of dollars of potential a year as we get that right. And the other thing that I would point out is our portfolio is bigger across all these asset classes and maturing, which I think is at least as big a contributor as some of the other topics. So we're not going to give you a number, but if you're positing that it should be a lot more than it's been, I agree with you.\nSteven Chubak: Well said. Thanks so much for taking my question.\nScott Nuttall: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question, Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMichael Cyprys: Great, thank you. Good morning. Just a question on infrastructure. I saw the recent partnership announcement with HASI on sustainable infrastructure projects. Seems like an interesting deal sourcing funnel. Just hoping you could elaborate a little bit on this partnership, how you view this strategically helping KKR, and then just more broadly on infrastructure. Just curious where you're seeing some of the most exciting opportunities right now for putting capital to work in the infrastructure space, and how you're thinking about other potential opportunities for other partnerships over time?\nCraig Larson: Hey Mike, it's Craig. Why don't I start? Thanks for the question again. Much like Steven's question would echo a lot of the broad themes in your question on infrastructure, so I think as we think about the platform and how we're situated today, we're just really encouraged with our progress to date. Four years ago, AUM was around $15 billion. As of June 30, we were at $73, so $15 to $70, all organic. That's a CAGR of 50%. And while you've seen AUM grow meaningfully, you've also seen our deployment stats have increased pretty meaningfully. In for deployment in 2019 was $2 billion, 2020 was $2.2 billion. And over the trailing twelve months, we've invested eight. And then as our footprint increases again, back to the last topic, capital markets, the fee opportunity there increases as well. And the growth in innovation hasn't stopped here. So again, we're in the early days as it relates to infrastructure and private wealth. Climate, as you noted, is an adjacency where we think we can be really differentiated given our expense to date. Investing behind the energy transition and then finally again, flagship infrastructure is very front of mind for us as we think about opportunities. I think broadly as it relates to some of the areas where we're most constructive on investing, I do think as it relates to digital infrastructure in particular, and some of those opportunities in particular are ones that are very exciting for us if we think about our data center investment activity. And why don't I hang out there for a moment? It's been one of the core investment themes for several years, and we do believe we're really uniquely positioned to be a major player across the space given the combination of our capabilities, the number of pools where we can invest. And that's not just in data center, it's also in power generation, transmissions, renewables, technology, and then also capital markets plays a piece in this as well, as you heard from the CyrusOne example. So again, just to put some numbers around things, we have four independent data infrastructure platforms, one in the U.S., one in Europe, two in Asia Pacific. The global footprint here is one that's a real differentiator and we benefit from the connectivity. So depending on the risk reward, we've got multiple pools of capital that can be relevant. So just in this area alone, we have investments in infrastructure, Asian infrastructure, core, private equity, real estate, as well as our wealth strategies $5 billion of invested capital today with an active pipeline. And if anything, this would understate the size and scale of our footprint here. To give you a sense, if you looked at the total enterprise value on 100% owned basis and included a current investments, together with that secured and highly visible pipeline, you'd be north of $150 billion of enterprise value. So the opportunities that we have in an area like this is one that's really exciting. On the power side, we have 10 plus renewable developers in real estate. We're active in both real estate equity and credit. Our credit vehicles alone this year have evaluated over $10 billion of data center financing opportunities. That's developments stabilized as well as ABS and CMBS. And we can be relevant here both at the opportunistic end of the spectrum on one end and insurance on the other. And again, the capital markets team has also been active, you heard in our prepared remarks, the CyrusOne case study. So I think it's a great example of the thematic approach that we can bring. I think it's also a great example of the connectivity you can see across the firm and in our culture and how we're able to work across teams and across geographies.\nScott Nuttall: Yes. Hey Michael thanks for the question. I think the two big themes to that part of your question I point to is digitalization. I think data centers; fiber, powers continue to be incredibly active across all of those areas. And if you look at recent deal announcements, you'll see that's a big theme. And then to Craig's point, it's energy transition, renewables climate. I think the HASI partnership that you referenced, I would think of that as a bit similar to what we've talked about in the past around our partnerships across asset based finance and real estate. And we have 35 platform partnerships there, the better part of 10,000 people out originating. So you'll continue to see us develop more relationships like that. It's in a similar vein.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thank you.\nScott Nuttall: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer and Company. Please go ahead.\nChris Kotowski: Yes. Good morning and thank you. I heard what Scott said about the, flagship funds playing a lesser role, but I am curious kind of about the kind of expected base management fee dynamics that we should be expecting here in the next couple of quarters. So you raised $8 billion in Infra five, and you said it's up over 10, but there's still $7 billion left in Infra four. So does that, quote, turn on later in the year or is that a third quarter event? And kind of similarly with your next flagship private equity fund, you still have, I think, $8 billion left in the prior fund. So does that turn on, like, later maybe early, mid-2025? Is that kind of what we should be expecting?\nRob Lewin: Hey, Chris, it's Rob. So in the case of infrastructure, given some activity through the end of the quarter and with some deployment early in the quarter, we're actually turning on Infra five in Q3. So you'll start to see management fees flow through for Infra five starting this quarter as it relates to North America, 13 that you referenced in terms of capital still left to deployed, I think as of 630 we had today, but prior to 630. I think we had four announced but not yet closed transactions and so we would expect to be nearing the end. But we still have time to go of our investment period and that's why we've been out fundraising and launching for next four.\nChris Kotowski: And have you shared kind of the target size of those funds or is that confidential?\nRob Lewin: Yes. We have not, Chris.\nChris Kotowski: Okay, all right. Thank you. That's it from me.\nScott Nuttall: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question Arnaud Giblat with BNP. Please go ahead.\nArnaud Giblat: Hey, good morning. A quick question on the opportunities to address the individual markets. I appreciate that you're doing a lot with K series and your capital agreement to go after distributing private market assets to individuals. I was just wondering if there was perhaps an opportunity to complement there through distribution or through the production and then distribution of secondaries. Thank you.\nScott Nuttall: Good question, Arnaud. So at this point, there might be an opportunity down the road, but it's nothing front and center for us in terms of the secondaries market. We spent time in that space. We've analyzed it, never say never, but it's not front and center part of how we're thinking about next step strategy at this stage. We think there's plenty to do candidly across the asset classes that we're in.\nArnaud Giblat: Got it. Thanks. Thank you.\nScott Nuttall: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I would like to turn the floor over to Craig Larson for closing remarks.\nCraig Larson: I would just like to thank everybody for your continued interest in KKR. We look forward to giving an update on next quarter in 90-days and if you have any additional follow-ups please reach out directly. Thank you again.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Rob Lewin",
            "content": "Thanks a lot, Craig. Given the recent S&P 500 inclusion, we expect that there are many on the call listening for the first time. Welcome. We would encourage you to also take a look at our April Investor Day replay and presentation that is found on our website. We feel as good as ever to hit our 2026 guidance figures that we introduced in April. As a reminder, those include $300 billion plus of new capital raised over the course of 2024 through 2026 and in terms of our financial metrics by 2026, $4.50 plus cents per share of FRE, $7 plus per share of total operating earnings and between $7 and $8 of adjusted net income per share, which is after tax. So looking at the LTM figures that we reported this morning, our 2026 guidance implies a 20% annual growth rate, plus or minus across all three of these key financial metrics. Overall, our activity levels and the momentum across the firm feel very strong. We are continuing to see our management fees scale meaningfully with 13% year-over-year growth, and this is before our in-market flagship funds have turned on. We are also seeing continued real signs of the monetization backdrop improving as evidenced by our Q2 realized performance fees and investment income. Last quarter I mentioned that we had very healthy pipelines on the back of the improved environment as well as our diversified and performing portfolio. I will echo those same comments again this quarter. Hey Craig, it's Rob. Thanks for the question. Why don't I start out and there's a couple of things going on, and maybe the shorter part of your answer is going to ultimately depend on what the growth is from here, but maybe let's talk a little bit about what we're seeing in the business. You referenced a lot of growth and just to put some numbers around that, if you look at the past nine months, we've taken on $50 billion of additional capital. That compares to $20 billion in the preceding nine months. And we're trying to be very thoughtful, as you can imagine, around deployment, as we're digesting that growth. We're also using new muscles inside of our firm as it relates to linking up our real estate equity team, our infrastructure team, our capital markets team and so there's a lot of really good work going on. And as a result, we've been operating at elevated levels of liquidity. And so just again, to put some numbers behind that, if you look at the end of the quarter, we had roughly $8 billion of cash. If you look a year ago, that number was closer to $4 billion and that doesn't even take into account a lot of the high-grade corporates that we have that are being weighted to be rotated into higher yielding assets. And I think the other point that I think is worth talking about, as we think about what the medium term net investment income can look like and ROE could look like, is really this point I was trying to get at in the prepared remarks around us actively making investments today that we believe will generate meaningful long-term ROE, but that's coming at the expense of shorter term ROE. It's that core real estate example that I mentioned where day one, we expect running yields to be roughly 4%. If you think about where we're originating liabilities today, that's north of 5% and so not only are those investments not accretive to our near-term P&L, they're actually dilutive. But for those who have followed us a while, been shareholders with us for a long time, I think they'll know that we're always going to make the decision to take some pain on short-term P&L for long-term earnings power. And so it's tough to then extrapolate from there exactly what that's going to mean to near-term ROEs and returns as a lot of that is a function of the growth that we expect. But as we look forward, we look at Q3 and Q4, our expectation is we'll have operating earnings that are in and around where we are in Q2. And as we think about how we ramp up into 2025, my expectation is we're probably based on the growth we see in front of us, we're probably operating at a level that's a little bit below our 14% to 15% long-term ROE range. But again, all in service for that long-term growth that we feel across the KKR platform and that we believe pretty strongly will benefit GA's long-term P&L. Thanks, Craig. And Bill, just one other thing from me, maybe two quick, because I know there's a lot of interest in the fundraising environment. We are continuing to see a couple of other themes. One is concentration of relationships. So we're finding more investors want to do more with fewer partners, and so we're continuing to see that trend accelerate. Also, I think there's increased recognition of what we've been talking about for the last decade, plus the power of portfolio construction, deployment, pacing and tools to add value. And you're going to see much higher dispersion of results, I think and we'll figure out who did a good job the last five years and we feel really well positioned in that context. Just one additional statistic there, and this is not going to tie to your question specifically on the capital that is above cost and accruing carry, but just to look at the private equity portfolio as a whole and give you a sense, well over 50% of that, when we look at our remaining fair value, is marked at 1.5 times cost or greater. And roughly 30% of that capital dollars is at roughly 30% of that, excuse me, is marked at two times cost and greater. So I think one of the things that our team talked about at Investor Day, Pete and Nate, was this approach we've had on linear deployment. I think that has really served us well in terms of having a more mature portfolio. And I think some of the discipline that you've seen and how we've invested capital over the last several years, and honestly, lessons that we learned dating back to the GFC have an opportunity to really pay us dividends in the years ahead. Thank you. Thanks, Steven. I'm not going to give you a number. We haven't given a number in the past, but let me try and frame it. In 2021, we did 850 million of revenue.

Hey, Chris, it's Rob. So in the case of infrastructure, given some activity through the end of the quarter and with some deployment early in the quarter, we're actually turning on Infra five in Q3. So you'll start to see management fees flow through for Infra five starting this quarter as it relates to North America, 13 that you referenced in terms of capital still left to deployed, I think as of 630 we had today, but prior to 630. I think we had four announced but not yet closed transactions and so we would expect to be nearing the end. But we still have time to go of our investment period and that's why we've been out fundraising and launching for next four. Yes. We have not, Chris."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Scott Nuttall",
            "content": "Thank you Rob, and thank you everybody for joining our call today. Last month we held our annual meeting for our fund investors, followed by KKR's partners meeting. I thought while we were together today I would share some of the messages we shared in those sessions and some reflections from Joe and me on the first half of the year and our expectations for the second half. The main message we shared with our investors is that we are seeing significantly greater market activity since the beginning of the year. The macro inflation and rates backdrop has improved, markets are open and the deal market is back. To give you a sense, globally, year-to-date, leveraged credit issuance is up over 100%, IPOs are up nearly 15% and announced M&A is up approximately 25%. And given it typically takes a couple of quarters for the market to turn back on, these numbers understate the run rate activity we are feeling today. If this momentum continues, we believe you will see even more activity and announced deals and exits in the second half of the year. We are seeing this dynamic across our businesses. Deployment is up, monetizations are up, capital markets revenues are up, yield pipelines are up and visibility is high. Unless something happens to disrupt this momentum, we expect to see increased activity in the second half of this year relative to the first. What's also encouraging is that we believe this is a very attractive investment environment. Volatility and uncertainty are still with us. So far 2024 feels like it could be a sweet spot year where values are attractive and activity levels are high. This is in contrast to last year when values were attractive but transaction volumes were more muted as owners of mature assets didn't want to sell or finance them in a closed market. This year we not only have an open market, we have pent up supply of deals that didn't get done the last couple of years coming to market, so we are optimistic. A couple other things we shared in our June sessions, in private equity, while many in our industry over deployed in and around 2021, we did not. We have been applying the lessons we learned before and during the financial crisis and have been deploying in a linear fashion the last many years. As a result, we have strong returns, dry powder and a healthy portfolio. In credit we're seeing the benefits of a scaled $230 billion plus platform with significant opportunity across now a $40 trillion global credit space. Our private credit business is now over $100 billion and we continue to see attractive investing opportunities in asset based finance, Asia credit, opportunistic investing and junior debt amongst other areas. In infrastructure, the global opportunity is immense across our efforts in core, value add and climate. The capital need massively outstrips supply and we feel very well positioned. In real estate, the credit opportunity remains compelling with banks on the sidelines and the equity investment opportunity is very attractive. As a reminder, we started our real estate business in 2011. We don't have office and retail exposure of any consequence, so we have the ability to play offense in this environment and we believe we will take share over the next several years and will benefit from the current and coming dislocation. The real estate investment opportunity is highly compelling. We have closed or are under exclusive contract on over $10 billion of real estate equity deals since April 1 and have a full pipeline as some owners of real estate seek liquidity and sell their best assets. And in this environment, scale is trading at a discount. And we also introduced a fifth asset class to our investors in June, insurance. This is the ivy sidecar franchise that invests alongside the global Atlantic balance sheet in block and flow deals. This area has amongst the most compelling capital supply-demand imbalances we see across the firm. And speaking of GA, we're now roughly seven months since we became 100% owners. We've been focused on mining the untapped opportunities we shared with you last November when we announced the deal. As you heard, GA is growing rapidly and as we transition the business to 100% ownership, we're seeing the combined impact of simultaneous fast growth and investing in the business for the long-term. As we sit here today, we feel very optimistic about the opportunities to create value with GA at 100%, investing across more KKR asset classes, scaling KKR capital markets and structured assets, going global in particularly in Japan, and finding more ways to work together more broadly. Overall, the opportunity with GA is greater in our minds today than it was at the beginning of the year. So to keep it simple, the market is open, the firm is very active, our investment performance is particularly strong. We've never felt better about our team and we are well positioned to execute the plan we shared with you at our April Investor Day. With that, we're happy to take your questions. Thanks, Craig. Hey, Bill, it's Scott. Thanks for the question. There are a couple things. One is just broader context for you. I know there tends to be a lot of focus on the flagship funds, but if you go back and think about what's been going on with the firm, even go back to the beginning of 2022, so call it the last two and a half years, we raised $214 billion. Only $14 billion of the 214 was in flagships. So happy to chat about the flagships, but we should also keep in mind the vast majority of the activity that we've been generating has been outside of that and to your point, we now have the flagships coming back as well. The overall tone in the fundraising market continues to improve. I think it kind of depends on where you are and what you're talking about. So let's just talk about asset classes. Infrastructure and private credit, we continued to see investors very interested and trying to catch-up to the allocations that they have made. So it continues to be quite a bit of activity in those asset classes. I would also include real estate credit in that area. It's kind of a similar theme to private corporate credit. Then you kind of move on into real estate equity, where I think the sentiment is shifting a bit right now. There has been more caution, no doubt. Our perspective is that the sentiment has bottomed in the last year. Valuations have bottomed in the first half of this year, and as you heard in the prepared remarks, we've been quite active deploying into real estate equity. I'd say the fundraising is going to lag that reality a little bit, but we're starting to have more conversations with investors that understand, although it may be perceived as a bit contrarian, this is a really good time to invest in real estate equity. And then in private equity activity is picking up. As you heard, monetizations are up and deployment is up. People are starting to get more money back, so those with more mature programs are starting to see some of that. I think you'll see more of that as we get into the latter half of the year. We have just launched our flagship U.S. private equity funds. There's not a lot to report as of yet. I'll let Craig give an update on our Ascendant strategy, which is a recent data point in a minute. But it feels to us like there's a decent chance the private equity fundraising environment has bottomed as well and you'll start to see sentiment shift to the positive. More broadly, as you know, private wealth, big opportunity for us all upside. Insurance companies we thought might pull back from us a little bit as rates went up, have not seen that, actually are seeing as much activity and momentum in insurance as we've seen in a while. And so we do think there's quite a bit of activity. Sorry for the long answer, but hopefully it gives you a sense that there's a variety of different things happening underneath the surface. And on private equity, Craig, why don't you just give the latest data point we have? It's not a big one, but it's at least indicative. Yes, Alex, it's Scott. I think that's well said. We use both. It depends on the circumstance and the deal. The way I think about this is last year the deal volumes were so muted. It was quite a bit of focus on how large a share the private credit market had. This is one of these environments where it becomes clear that a smaller share of more pie can still be more pie. And so that's how I would think about it. Hey, Patrick, it's Scott. Just a couple of quick additions. The platform rollout is kind of at or slightly ahead of our expectations. And it takes a while once you get on a platform to have it really kick in and work and train the advisors and the sales team. So I'd say really pleased with the progress, but the kind of capital raising power isn't embedded yet in the numbers that Craig walked through. To your question on new products, we don't have anything new to announce on the K-Series front today, but in the prepared remarks, we did mention our Capital Group partnership. As a reminder there, we're creating hybrid product in partnership with Capital Group. We announced two credit products that we're going to launch in the first half of next year together. But to be clear, that is not the extent of the vision. We expect to roll out hybrid products across the other parts of the alternative space as well with our partner. So more to come on that over the next few quarters. Thanks, Dan. I'll take a crack. How did it come together? A Capital Group called us and they had been thinking about how they wanted to participate in the alternative space. And if you go back to, I think, the original press release that our partner, Mike Gitlin did a really nice job laying out how they thought about it. Should they acquire something? Should they partner? Should they buy pieces of different businesses? And they decided that partnering was the best act. So, to be clear, they called us. We spent quite a bit of time together, got to know each other really well as firms and as people. And I think the reason this came together is the reason most things come together, just an extraordinary cultural fit. We thought about the world the same way, same focus on delivering value for all the clients counting on us and understanding, really who we work for. So that's how it came together. It was kind of a joint vision and shared values and how we see the world in terms of kind of where we're going and how this is different. So one simple way to think about it, let's just take the U.S. market. And the numbers are never precise, but to be close enough, with our K Series, we're targeting the accredited investor and the qualified purchaser. That's roughly 5%, give or take, of U.S. households. I'm close, but it's single-digits, mid-single-digits percent, depending on what you look at. That means there's 95% of U.S. households that it does not access. And so what we're doing with Capital Group is creating a product that will allow the other 95% of households to participate in what we do. In its simplest form, that's what we're doing. So it's hybrid. So there's going to be an element that is going to be the liquid strategies that will be managed by Capital Group and then a portion that is the private market strategies that will be managed by us. So think of all of these products as having a component of both and geared toward that broader audience, that mass market. As I said, we're starting with credit. So think of it as a component of liquid credit plus private credit. And for us, that will include both direct lending and asset based finance in the private credit sleeve. And then for the other products that we're talking about launching, infrastructure, private equity, real estate, we're in the design phase. So I would expect over time, I'm not going to put a timeframe on it today, but over time, you will likely see products from us together across all of those areas. And so that's how we expect it to play out over the coming years. But we'll keep you posted, but hopefully that helps. Right, thanks Brian. Good morning. So as it relates to capital markets, you're right, that Telecom Italia transaction closed July 1. We will generate a meaningful capital markets fee as part of being involved multiple different aspects of that transaction. But I would tell you, as I look at our broad-based capital markets pipeline, I think pipelines for that business are certainly good one quarter out, but probably two quarters. As I look at that back half of the year, I tell you that our aggregate pipeline is as good as we've ever seen it. And that includes 2021, when we generated roughly $850 million of revenue or capital markets business. So we're quite encouraged around what the back half of the year could look like. Again these are pipelines. They're forward indicators. A lot of stuff needs to come to fruition, but it is broad-based. It's across debt, it's across equity. It's U.S., Europe, Asia. It's also third party. So we're feeling really good about what the back half of the year could look like. As it relates to FRE margin, I would say absolutely. In an elevated capital markets quarter, you are going to see higher FRE margin the flow through is just higher, given our operating expenses are more fixed in nature relative to that incremental capital markets revenue. Here's how I've described our FRE margin in the past. I believe that today we can operate sustainably in the mid-60s on FRE margin basis across the firm, and that includes in most market environments, but that is definitely not the cap for us. And if we're successful with the business model that we've got a lot of conviction in here as a management team. We're going to scale our revenue. We're going to scale our fees at a pace that's meaningfully above our headcount growth and our operating complexity across the firm. And we would expect more margin expansion in the future if we're successful. So hopefully that gives you some color on the back half of the year and what we're feeling in capital markets and how that might translate into FRE margin. Thank you. Yes, thanks, Brian, and let me take a shot at that. And we don't break out the vintage, but we could tell you that our, we've spent a lot of time around linear deployment as a firm, and so, feel good that as you look back over the past seven or eight years, you're going to find a healthy level of dispersion across different vintages. I think that to me, the metric that I look at as the best forward indicator, honestly, is the simplest one, and that's our gross accrued carried interest, that today on our balance sheet is roughly $7.1 billion. If you look back just two quarters ago, that number was $6 billion. So in an environment where we've actually been realizing a little bit more carry than we were expecting to realize, those are pretty healthy levels of step ups across the firm. And I think paints a pretty good picture for what the forward could look like as it relates to monetization related revenue book carried interest. But also we feel good about how investment income might ramp from here as well. Thank you. Sure. Thanks, Ben. I'll hand it above. Let me start with just visibility around monetizations for Q3. It's at a pretty healthy level. We are plus or minus 500 million of monetization related revenue for Q3. That is either that has either happened or from deals that are signed up that we expect to close this quarter. Just breakdown wise, that's roughly 60% carry and 40% investment income. So that pipeline is better today than it's been in quite some time. And then your question as it relates to the end of quarter press release we put out on our monetization update. You know that I think that press release went out around June 20. We give our best estimate and view of the quarter at that time. And of course things can happen in the next 10 days. And we had a few things that ended up on one side of the quarter versus the other. But I wouldn't say anything necessarily significant in size. One thing that was significant size, a few things that that added up to create the delta that you're referring to between where we landed, which is a bit over $600 million, and that June 20 press release that I believe stated we were at greater than $500 million through that point in time. It's a really good question, Steven. Maybe we should invite you to our budget meetings. But to Rob's point, we're working across more asset classes, doing more in Europe and Asia, third parties up GA, we think is hundreds of millions of dollars of potential a year as we get that right. And the other thing that I would point out is our portfolio is bigger across all these asset classes and maturing, which I think is at least as big a contributor as some of the other topics. So we're not going to give you a number, but if you're positing that it should be a lot more than it's been, I agree with you. Thank you. Yes. Hey Michael thanks for the question. I think the two big themes to that part of your question I point to is digitalization. I think data centers; fiber, powers continue to be incredibly active across all of those areas. And if you look at recent deal announcements, you'll see that's a big theme. And then to Craig's point, it's energy transition, renewables climate. I think the HASI partnership that you referenced, I would think of that as a bit similar to what we've talked about in the past around our partnerships across asset based finance and real estate. And we have 35 platform partnerships there, the better part of 10,000 people out originating. So you'll continue to see us develop more relationships like that. It's in a similar vein. Thank you. Thank you. Good question, Arnaud. So at this point, there might be an opportunity down the road, but it's nothing front and center for us in terms of the secondaries market. We spent time in that space. We've analyzed it, never say never, but it's not front and center part of how we're thinking about next step strategy at this stage. We think there's plenty to do candidly across the asset classes that we're in. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to KKR's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. \n I would now like to hand the call over to Craig Larson, Partner and Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Thank you. You may begin. \nCraig Larson: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2024 earnings call. This morning, as usual, I'm joined by Rob Lewin, our Chief Financial Officer; and Scott Nuttall, our Co-Chief Executive Officer.\n We would like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, which is available on the Investor Center section at kkr.com. And as a reminder, we report our segment numbers on an adjusted share basis. This call will contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to our earnings release and our SEC filings for cautionary factors about these statements.\n We know many of you joined us for our 2024 Investor Day just 3 weeks ago. Thank you for spending the day with us. And for those of you who were unable to participate or are newer to KKR, we would encourage you to watch a replay of the webcast or review the Investor Day presentation and transcripts that are on the Investor Relations section of our website. There is a wealth of information, of course, across all of those materials.\n And as a reminder, before getting to the numbers themselves, starting with this quarter, our financial reporting reflects the previously announced segment and financial metric changes. Of particular note, first, we closed on the remaining interest in Global Atlantic on January 2, and we now own 100% of GA. Second, we're now reporting a new segment, Strategic Holdings. Third, we've introduced a new financial metric, total operating earnings, which consists of fee-related earnings plus insurance segment and Strategic Holdings operating earnings.\n Total operating earnings represents the more recurring and stable portion of our earnings and is a measure we look at to evaluate our performance as it reflects how our business model and how our financial profile has evolved. Our expectation is that total operating earnings should approximate 70% of pretax earnings over time. And finally, our Q1 financials reflect our revised compensation ratios, which deliver more FRE to our shareholders and drive even more alignment between our compensation model and the outcomes of our clients. And as a reminder, for additional details, we posted recash financials in late March.\n So now turning to Q1 and our headline financial metrics. Fee-related earnings per share for the quarter came in at $0.75, that's up 22% compared to Q1 '23. Total operating earnings were $1.08 per share in the quarter. And adjusted net income per share, which is after tax, was $0.97, and that's up 20% year-over-year.\n Looking at our financials in a little further detail. Management fees in Q1 were $815 million. That's up 4% sequentially from last quarter. Net transaction and monitoring fees were $152 million, $116 million of which were generated from our Capital Markets business. Our fee-related compensation ratio was 17.5%, which is right at the midpoint of our target range.\n Other operating expenses were $145 million. You're seeing a continued focus on expense management. This number is down 4% compared to Q1 of 2023. But we expect this line item to increase modestly over the balance of the year, driven by continued investments in operations across KKR, alongside an increase in placement fees, given our active fundraising pipeline.\n So in total for the quarter, fee-related earnings were $669 million or the $0.75 per share I mentioned a moment ago. And our FRE margin came in at 68%. That margin figure is up 700 basis points compared to Q1 '23, and that's driven both by the change in our compensation framework as well as the strong expense management in the quarter.\n Insurance operating earnings were $273 million. There are really 2 things to point out here. First, portfolio yields this quarter reflect elevated cash and more liquid assets at GA, and that's largely due to 2 sizable recent transactions with the MetLife and Manulife blocks closing in Q4 '23 and  Q1 '24, respectively. So the full cost of those liabilities come on to the GA balance sheet at close, but it does take some time to redeploy those assets into our target portfolios. And that delay or that ramp is expected, of course, and is built into our pricing for each of these deals.\n And secondly, we're seeing attractive investment opportunities in asset classes like core plus real estate and infrastructure, as our origination capabilities are presenting GA with attractive risk-adjusted return opportunities. However, while these opportunities come with attractive long-term ROEs, near-term yields tend to be more modest.\n And moving to our new segment, Strategic Holdings. In Page 18 of the earnings release. Remember, the segment today consists of our direct interests in our core private equity portfolio, which is a long-duration investment strategy with an expected hold period of 10 to 15-plus years. So 19 businesses that are well diversified and generally have durable, defensive financial profiles alongside growing earnings.\n And looking at KKR's share of these businesses, 2023 revenues were approximately $3.6 billion, with EBITDA of $900-some-odd million. And given the maturing of the portfolio as well as the stability of operating performance, we anticipate these investments to be more regular dividend payers over time.\n So operating earnings in the quarter were $21 million, driven by dividend activity. As we stated previously, we expect Strategic Holdings' operating earnings to be more modest in 2024. However,  we expect that will change in a pretty significant way looking beyond '24, with operating earnings of $300-plus million by 2026, $600-plus million by 2028 and $1-plus billion by 2030. Our visibility and the opportunities we see here are highly differentiated looking across our space. So putting all of that together, total operating earnings were $1.08 per share.\n Moving to investing earnings. Realized performance income was $272 million and realized investment income was $135 million. This was primarily driven by secondary sales, strategic exits, and realized carry from the core private equity portfolio. So altogether, adjusted net income totaled $864 million or $0.97 per share.\n Turning to investment performance. You can see this on Page 10 of the earnings release. The private equity portfolio was up 5% in the quarter and up 19% in the last 12 months. Opportunistic real estate was up 1% in the quarter as well as up 1% in the LTM. The infrastructure portfolio was up 5% in the quarter and is up 16% over the trailing 12 months. In credit in Q1, delevered at composite was up 3% and alternative credit composite was up 4%. And over the last 12 months, performance was plus 14% and plus 13%, respectively.\n And given performance in Q1, our gross unrealized carry interest balance increased to $6.9 billion at 3/31. That's up 16% from the end of 2023 and over 50% from Q1 of '23. And finally, consistent with historical practice and as we announced last quarter, we increased our dividend to $0.70 per share on an annualized basis or $0.175 per share per quarter, beginning with Q1. This is now the fifth consecutive year we've increased our dividend since we changed our corporate structure, increasing our annualized dividend from $0.50 per share to $0.70 over this period of time.\n And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Rob. \nRobert Lewin: Thanks a lot, Craig, and thank you all for joining our call this morning, and for the many of you that spent time with us at our Investor Day a few weeks back. I thought I would start this morning by going through some of our key operating metrics.\n During the quarter, we raised $31 billion of capital. That's almost $90 billion over the last 12 months. In just this quarter alone, we had attractive outcomes across each of our businesses. Our private equity and real asset businesses together raised $9 billion of capital across a number of strategies. And that's before any meaningful closes from our upcoming flagship raises. And our momentum in credit has really continued, with new capital raise totaling $21 billion, with most of the capital coming from our direct lending, asset-based finance and leveraged credit strategies.\n And looking more specifically at our K Series vehicles, we raised almost $3 billion year-to-date through April 1, primarily in private equity and infrastructure. We also launched a private BDC in the quarter and are starting to see some real inflows here as well.\n Turning to capital invested. We deployed $14 billion in the quarter. Deployment within private markets was largely driven by infrastructure as well as real estate equity. And over half of the capital invested in the quarter came from credit, primarily across asset-based finance and direct lending. We are seeing a significant ramp in credit deployment, reflecting the overall growth of our credit platform.\n Now looking forward to Q2, we expect there to be a healthy pipeline of new deployment given the activities we are seeing broadly across the firm. And over the course of the year, we do expect deployment to pick up meaningfully. \n  Before wrapping up this morning, I did want to spend a couple of minutes summarizing the key takeaways from our Investor Day a few weeks back. Scott and Joe led off our Investor Day with a very simple message: While we have experienced a lot of growth, it feels like we are just getting started.\n In terms of the key takeaways from the day. First, we provided medium-term guidance. Over the next 12 to 18 months, we expect to be raising capital for over 30 strategies, including a number of our flagships. We expect to raise $300-plus billion of capital over the course of 2024 through 2026. In terms of our financial metrics, by 2026, we expect $4.50-plus per share of FRE. Implying a CAGR of approximately 20%, $7-plus of total operating earnings per share and $7 to $8 per share of adjusted net income, implying a CAGR of roughly 30%.\n Second, looking ahead, we feel quite confident in our longer-term trajectory. We expect $15-plus of adjusted net income per share in the next 10 years or less, with approximately 70% of these earnings to be more recurring in nature. Over the next 5 years, we also expect $25-plus billion of cash generation. We anticipate that this cash will get deployed across 4 key areas: core private equity, share buyback, strategic M&A and insurance. Our model really gives us the confidence across all of these avenues of deployment. In each case, we have a strong track record of being able to deploy capital against high ROE opportunities that also generate recurring and growth-oriented earnings per share.\n And number three, looking at our key themes, we made sure to highlight our diversified and purpose-built business model. Asset Management plus Insurance plus Strategic Holdings, all working synergistically together to generate sustainable and significant P&L outcomes. And we have a lot of confidence in each of our 3 growth engines. In Asset Management, we have multiple paths to surpass $1 trillion of AUM over the next 5 years. In insurance, we have strong conviction that we could double Global Atlantic from here. And finally, strategic holdings, which is really an unconstrained market opportunity for us and where we have a real right to win. We expect to have $1 billion-plus of annual operating earnings by 2030.\n Our business model is built to drive compounding earnings over a very long period of time. And while the opportunity in front of us is a massive one, we do believe that we can achieve our outline targets without having to build anything new. And we have a team and culture, as you would have heard from over 15 of our business leaders on April 10, that both facilitates and accelerates our ability to achieve our strategic ambitions. So when you combine our business model, together with our team and our culture, this is what distinctly differentiates KKR.\n And with that, Scott, Craig and I are happy to take any questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. \nCraig Siegenthaler: Our question is on investing after Rob's healthy deployment commentary. But we wanted to focus specifically on private equity as I think there's a lot more visibility in direct lending and ABF, where you're seeing strength. But in private equity, we are watching some build in your deployment pipelines. I think Cotiviti is probably the biggest upcoming transaction. And now the CLO markets and syndicated loan markets are back online, but the recent rise in the 10-year probably wasn't that helpful. So can you provide us some comments on the expected investment activity levels in just your private equity business over the coming quarters? \nCraig Larson: Craig, it's Craig. Thanks for the question. Why don't I start? I'm sure Scott will have a couple of thoughts also. First -- and thanks for beginning in the way that you did. I think as Rob noted in our prepared remarks, the $1.1 billion of deployment you saw this quarter is not representative as we look at our activity. We've got a really healthy backlog of announced transactions. And if anything, it was just a dynamic, where a pretty modest amount of that activity closed in the 90 days ended March 31.\n I think in terms of where we've been deploying capital, we could start probably with some of the themes we talked about at Investor Day. So we talked about Asia as a region that we expect to drive meaningful opportunity for KKR for years to come. We talked about Japan, specifically. I think it's interesting when you look at Private Equity in our Real Assets business, the largest deployment we had this quarter was out of Japan. In that instance, it was out of our Japanese REIT business as they closed on the acquisition of 30-some-odd logistics warehouses that, again, we had touched on.\n I think as you also look at some of the activity we have in corporate carve-outs and private equity, we love those opportunities, where our operational resources and focus can really move the needle. So 2 of our larger pending investments, our corporate carve-out transactions, that's one in Europe as well as one in the U.S. Those are, again, both traditional private equity.\n And then I think the other point just to highlight in terms of broad deployment, we talked about it at Investor Day again, is infrastructure. And that's just an area where we bring deep expertise in the global footprint. Our second largest investment in the quarter was to take private of a U.K.-listed smart metering business. I'm sure some of you will remember that being a theme that we've invested behind and have had success historically.\n And again, as we look at our pipeline of announced but not yet closed activity, infra continues to be particularly active with themes and digital, renewables, et cetera. And again, activity here is global, well beyond the U.S. I think those -- some of the pending investments we have include companies based in Italy, Germany, Portugal, et cetera. So again, I think main takeaway is a very healthy pipeline, and we're continuing to find opportunities to deploy capital. \nScott Nuttall: Yes. The only thing I'd add, Craig, is we do think the M&A market is coming back. I think to your point, the leverage credit markets opened up in January. We are starting to see this impact all of our businesses, to Craig's comments. But I'd say, in particular, private equity pipeline, which is up significantly. There's a lot of activity. What we announced in Q1 is obviously backward looking given it takes some time for these deals to close. The Cotiviti deal that you mentioned actually closes today.\n So I think you're going to see more of the announced deals get closed, and you're going to see more deals get announced as this pipeline turns into real deal pipeline and that turns into real deployment. I think you're also going to see this on the monetization side. If the M&A market is picking up and the IPO markets are open, you're going to see us selling more assets as well, refinancing more assets and taking more companies public. So I think you're going to see more activity overall across private equity. \nOperator: Our next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. \nAlexander Blostein: I wanted to go back to some of the targets you laid out at the Investor Day and really speaking to the $25 billion of cash flow you expect to generate over the next 5 years. Rob, I know you mentioned several buckets which are not that different. They're fairly consistent with kind of how you allocated capital historically. But I was wondering if you could comment on the mix specifically and sort of your priorities within those 4 buckets that you mentioned earlier. And I guess as part of that, when you think about growth in Strategic Holdings and incremental capital that you'll deploy there, how much of that is likely to be driven to sort of allocation to existing portfolio companies versus new investments? \nRobert Lewin: Great. And thanks a lot for the question, Alex. So you did mention this, I think the most important thing as it relates to capital allocation is to have a consistent framework, and we've had a really consistent framework for some time with one overriding objective, and that's to use our excess free cash flow to drive durable and recurring and growth-oriented earnings per share and to do so by leveraging our platform at really high ROEs. And I think the only thing that's really changed is, at our Investor Day, we outlined the opportunity to generate $25-plus billion of cash generation over the course of the next 5 years, and it's just a huge opportunity for us.\n In terms of bucketing across the 4 main areas of deployment, core private equity, share buybacks, insurance and strategic M&A, we don't have a fixed percentage by design. And it's really about being able to allocate that capital base nimbly to the opportunities that drive the highest return and the highest amount of earnings per share over a long period of time. That's our focus that's what we think we're really good at.\n As it relates to your question on Strategic Holdings, we outlined a path to $1 billion plus of Strategic Holdings operating earnings by 2030. It's something that we're confident in. We've got real visibility on where that's going to come from. I do think there's the opportunity if we see investments for us to be able to make in Strategic Holdings to drive that number north of that over time as we allocate capital. But again, no fixed percentage in how we're thinking about it. And I think that's a good thing, frankly, because I think it allows us to go after the highest returning and most ROE-friendly and earnings per share friendly opportunities that exist. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Bill Katz with TD Cowen. \nWilliam Katz: Obviously, a noticeable step-up in your gross sales, generally speaking. And if you just run rate this number, you're already north of your $300 billion number. So not that a few weeks change in the argument. But I was just sort of wondering if you could speak to the sequential change, particularly in the credit portfolio, where you're seeing really good momentum and maybe tie in the insurance opportunity with that. And I'll leave it there. \nCraig Larson: Bill, it's Craig, why don't I start. So I think there are a couple of things here. First probably worth highlighting investor interest in private credit as that continues to feel very good. So I think in direct lending, spreads have come in certainly. But if you look at a new direct lending deal, given where base rates are in 3 months so far, that's still a 10%-plus piece of paper. And in ABF, there's just a number of really positive macro tailwinds, as Chris Sheldon, again, walked through a handful of weeks ago. And within that part, we're active in both ABF -- in investment-grade ABF in addition to opportunistic.\n And so private credit for KKR at March 31 was $93 billion of AUM. These are big businesses for us. A year ago, we were at [ $76 billion ]. So we've seen a 22% increase year-over-year. So I think that's the first part. And then the second part, which ties into your question, is fundraising in our activities. Because you're right, we are seeing growth and fundraising in a number of different ways for us. And it's broad, which is great to see. It's institutional. It's private wealth. It's insurance. It's across multiple forms of capital, traditional funds, SMAs, evergreen vehicles, other perpetual forms of capital. And it's in the U.S. and it's outside the U.S.\n And I think that breadth of activity is really what you're seeing in our activity this quarter. Direct lending, we raised evergreen capital both in the U.S. and Europe. Opportunistic asset-based finance, capital raised. Asia private credit, we raised capital. Again, this is another area where we're constructive on the opportunity and how we're positioned given the strength of our Asia franchise. And in our K Series suite of products, we just launched our private BDC strategy. So I think you could think of that almost as upside from where we are here. So it does feel like we have a healthy amount of momentum, and it's broad-based across the firm. \nScott Nuttall: Bill, it's Scott. The only thing I'd add is in addition to the organic fundraising that Craig ran through from third parties, we mentioned in the Investor Day the symbiotic relationship between Global Atlantic and our credit business in particular. We're definitely seeing that show up in the numbers as well. And it's also allowing us to see how our third-party insurance AUM as well at the same time. So it really does feed credit, and it has historically.\n What I think you're going to see over time though, and as Craig mentioned this, is that we are going to see GA also starting to do more across asset classes like real estate and infrastructure, especially on the core side. And as we mentioned last November when we announced that we're going to 100% ownership of Global Atlantic, that's one of the opportunities that we saw, we're just getting after that now. So I think you'll see it not only show up in credit, but in some of the real asset lines as well. \nOperator: Our next question is from Brian McKenna with Citizens JMP. \nBrian Mckenna: So just a 2-parter here on core private equity. So first, is the $20 million in net dividends in the first quarter a good quarterly baseline for the remainder of this year? Or should we expect some growth off of that? And then bigger picture, I'm curious if interest is picking up at all from LPs around the strategy, specifically as the portfolio continues to mature here while dividends are also set to increase notably in the coming years. \nRobert Lewin: Brian, it's Rob. I'll start off. Plus or minus $20 million Strategic Holdings operating earnings, a pretty good level to model for the remainder of the year. As we move forward and get closer to $300-plus million by 2026, I think you'll see a little bit more stability in that line item quarter-to-quarter. Might bump around a little bit in 2024, but plus or minus $20 million is about right.\n And as it relates to our core private equity strategy, listen, we are the largest core private equity manager today globally by a good margin. We think we've built because of our investment teams, our geographic reach, our industry gap, our collaborative culture. We've really built a best-in-class franchise, and it's something that I think we certainly be excited about continuing to partner with our clients on over time. \nScott Nuttall: Yes. I think to the second question, Brian, we haven't been out actively marketing core private equity. We've got plenty of dry powder in the pools that we manage today. The next thing we'll be talking about with our investors on the PE side is going to be America's private equity. So we'll give you an update as those conversations come in. \nOperator: Our next question is from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. \nGlenn Schorr: So you have a lot of growth in a lot of places. You mentioned no need to build anything new, but I'll ask the question anyway. Secondaries is just about the only area where you're not either scaled or well on the way to being scaled. I'm just curious if there is a plan, how important is it to LPs and for you? Or is that just a nice to have over time area? \nRobert Lewin: Glenn, it's Rob. I'll start. I think you hit on it in your last remarks there. It is not a need-to-have for us. And so we want to be in businesses where there are large addressable markets, and we've got conviction, we can be a top 3 player. Of course, over time, we've looked at the secondary space. You could assume that most every M&A transaction that's happened in the secondary space, has come across our desk here. And either we determined it wasn't the right partner to be a top 3 player or we determined that we just weren't willing to pay the price that was a prevailing price in the market.\n And so we're perfectly comfortable focusing on the aspects of our business that we're already in today. With that focus, we think we can be uniquely great at the things that we've already started and that provides more than enough running room for growth going forward. \nOperator: Our next question is from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. \nPatrick Davitt: Could you give a little bit more specificity or color on the gross and net flows at GA in 1Q, and within the growth side, the mix of channels? And then more broadly, it looks like all of the bigger PRT or pension risk transfer deals this year have gone to more traditional insurance players. So I want to get your thoughts on to what extent the lawsuits and regulatory focus on that issue are cycling the opportunity for the more alts-backed insurers. \nRobert Lewin: Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Patrick. So I'd say that if you look at the flows at GA this quarter, probably about 75% from the institutional side of our business, give or take. Again, that's inclusive of the big block transaction that we did in the quarter with Manulife. We've had really good momentum on the individual side of our business as well, with very strong sales both in Q4 of '23 and again in Q1 of 2024.\n And then on the PRT side, pension risk transfer side, we've talked about this as being a medium to long-term opportunity at GA. We really, coming into this year, did not have very much exposure here at all, but we have a team assembled against the opportunity, and we continue to believe that it's a really big opportunity given the capability of our Institutional Reinsurance platform for us to be able to take some share again starting off of a very low base. \nOperator: Our next question is from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. \nDaniel Fannon: I guess just a follow-up on the GA business. It seems like the cash in the block transactions kind of reduced returns a little bit in the quarter. Could you talk about the current operating environment for those returns based upon the business you're seeing today? \nRobert Lewin: Sure, Dan, it's Rob. I'll start. So what we're seeing in the GA business is really strong performance, really strong operating performance, and really an even stronger outlook for the future. What happened in Q1 or what transpired from a P&L perspective in Q1, very much by design. When you complete 2 very large block deals north of $20 billion of assets, you're going to take on the cost of those liabilities day one. But we really have a 12- to 18-month period where we've modeled redeployment of the assets into higher-yielding investments. And we're operating at higher levels of cash balance. That was point one. \n Point two is a really interesting one, Scott started to touch on it a little bit earlier. We're seeing a really interesting opportunity in core and core plus real estate right now. There is just almost no core and core plus real estate capital out there. And we're able to create really attractive unlevered returns by leaning into that asset class. But one of the downsides of leaning into that asset class is a near-term downside in that the running yields on those investments tend to be in the 4%, 4.5% range. But we think those investments will certainly more than pay off in terms of the longer-term ROEs that they could generate.\n So much like how you'd hear us talking about investing in the near term for benefits of long term across everything we do, that would be a really good example where you could see some dilution to ROEs in the near term, but we think that are more than going to benefit Global Atlantic, its policyholders, ultimately our shareholders, in the long term given the attractive risk-adjusted returns we're seeing there. \nScott Nuttall: Yes. The only thing I'd add, Dan, is that none of this is a surprise. I mean we closed on $23 billion worth of block transactions. And when we price these deals, we assume there's going to be a ramp period. So that's proceeding as we expected. And I think the business overall is performing incredibly well. Both on the institutional side and the individual parts of GA, we're seeing a significant amount of growth and a significant amount of opportunity.\n And I think to the crux of your question, so far, the dollars that are getting deployed in the investment portfolio were hitting our target return levels. So it's just a rotation and it will take a little bit of time to get this money to work, but we feel very good about the progress of the trajectory. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Budish with Barclays. \nBenjamin Budish: Just following up on the topic of GA and some maybe modeling tidbits. So helpful commentary in terms of the time it takes to redeploy some of those assets. Wondering if you could talk a little bit about the pace of growth and the cost of insurance. It looks like quarter-over-quarter, it goes up as kind of the book turns over a little bit. But I guess, how should we think about that just as we forecast longer term?\n And then similarly, from a high-level perspective, I think in the past, you've kind of talked about guiding us to think about book value growth and your target mid-teens ROE. Just trying to think about how we should be thinking about that given you're now talking about the opportunity to accelerate longer-term growth? I know it hasn't been that long since you've owned 100% of GA, but just wondering if that's still the right framework or any other considerations. And then that other piece on the cost of insurance side. \nRobert Lewin: Yes. Great. So starting on the cost of insurance, and I think you really hit on it. As you see the rotation in a higher interest rate environment, our crediting spreads have, of course, gone up so have the yields that we're able to generate on the investment side of the portfolio. So being able to generate that spread continues to really exist in the business. So you'll continue to see, I think, an upward draft on our crediting spreads for a little bit. And then ultimately, it would be a function of where interest rates shake out. \n In terms of our longer-term ROE numbers, I think the continued right range to be able to forecast Global Atlantic is really in that long term 14% to 15% pretax ROE range. Nothing has changed there. We feel really good about the liabilities that we're able to source in the marketplace. We've talked about our management team really feeling like they are best-in-class at being able to source simple, easy to understand, transparent liabilities at scale. I'll take our investment platforms up against anybody globally and being able to put those liabilities to work. \nOperator: Our next question is from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. \nSteven Chubak: So wanted to ask on the credit deployment and maybe just zooming in on the ABF opportunity. The U.S. banks have started to indicate greater appetite or willingness to pursue synthetic risk transfers just in an effort to alleviate some of their capital pressures. It's an area where, historically, they've been much less active than the European banks. And I was hoping you could just speak to the engagement levels with some of your U.S. bank partners, how you see the ABF deployment opportunity unfolding specifically within the SRT market and maybe just more broadly across the ABF landscape. \nCraig Larson: Why don't I start first. I think as it relates to SRTs, it is a market we are active in. It fits in our view, very well with our ABS strategy. We're knowledgeable across a host of assets, and we do like to partner with the banks. As you note, I think that activity has mainly been EU-focused. It does feel like we are starting to see more activity in the U.S. It also seems like the potential opportunity set could be expanding. I do think the most common underlying assets for SRTs have been in corporate loans, fund finance facilities, consumer term loans, does feel like banks are beginning to explore opportunities across other asset classes.\n And then I think the other point that you touched on, which is very important, is just this big macro tailwind we're seeing in that opportunity that it affords us and our team. Again, you look at the growth in our ABF platform as a whole, we're over $50 billion of AUM at this point in time. That's both opportunistic together with more investment-grade focused ABS strategies. And in terms of total deployment in a quarter like this one, we've overall as a firm have deployed a little over, round numbers, $3.5 billion of ABF activity in Q1, which is a pretty elevated pace for us. So activity does continue to feel like it's at a healthy level. \nScott Nuttall: Part of the reason, Steven, that we spent so much time on this part of the business at the Investor Day is we do think this is a really interesting and sizable opportunity. Direct lending is really interesting as well in private credit, but asset-based finance is a much larger market, probably a $5 trillion market on its way to $7 trillion to $8 trillion. And it encompasses a significant number of asset classes, and you really need to have scale to be able to do it well.\n And so we talked about our 19 or 20 platforms better part of 7,000 people working at those platforms. I think you're going to see that businesses continue to scale in an attractive pace. And pleasingly, we're also seeing institutional investors understand this part of credit much more than they did a few years ago. So we are seeing this trend spread from Europe to the U.S. on the risk transfer side. I think that just speaks to the fact that deployment opportunity will continue to be robust. And banks are trying to free up capital, whether it's for M&A or to redeploy into other areas that they find interesting. So we've got plenty of opportunity here. \nOperator: Our next question is from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. \nBrian Bedell: So maybe switching gears to the capital markets business. I think you performed a little bit better than you had indicated at the conference, Rob, I think back in March for 1Q. Maybe if you could just talk about, I guess, the near-term trajectory in 2Q and what you're seeing so far. And more broadly, longer term, given the improvement in leverage credit markets and M&A activity and of course, the structural growth in your credit business, including in the asset-based finance area, maybe just your confidence on getting back to, say, an $800 million plus run rate level and even a time line to get to, call it, $1 billion plus annual level provided markets are conducive for that. \nRobert Lewin: Yes. Brian, a few thoughts. When you look back at 2022 and 2023, really tough operating conditions for our Capital Markets business. And for much of that time, Capital Markets on the equity side, on the leverage finance side, were largely shut. And our business generated ballpark $600 million of revenue in each of those 2 years. And so we're really proud of the durability of the franchise that we created. As I look at our pipelines today for the remainder of 2024, we get updated pipelines weekly, our pipelines are a lot better today than they were at this time last year. Now there's a lot to go execute on between now and the end of the year. But the forward indicators for our capital markets business sitting here in early May are definitely better than they were in May of 2023.\n And then more to your question around the longer term. If you look back in 2021, our Capital Markets business generated, a ballpark, $850 million of revenue. And clearly, you had buoyant capital markets that helped in 2021. But if you look at KKR today as a firm, we do more today than we did in 2021. I believe we have greater market share with our third-party clients than we did in 2021. And we've talked about the real opportunity to scale what we're doing in coordination with Global Atlantic. So when you combine all that, we continue to be really optimistic about what we're going to be able to create over the next several years with our Capital Markets franchise that is truly a unique business relative to any of our competitors out there right now. \nScott Nuttall: Yes. So Brian, we've been in this business since 2006. And over that period of time, what you see is that the revenue tends to be quite correlated with deployment and monetization, especially in private equity and infrastructure. So if you go back to the prior discussion around the fact that our pipelines have picked up significantly, especially in those areas, and we're seeing more activity on the monetization side as well as the markets open up and strategic buyers come back. I think that bodes well.\n We had $800 million plus of revenues at KCM at a period of time where we had less dry powder, we had less overall AUM, we had less firm activity. So as the markets open back up, our expectation is we'll do better than that, but it's going to be somewhat dependent on deployment and monetizations across the firm. But it looks pretty good as we sit here today. \nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. \nMichael Cyprys: Just wanted to ask on ABF. You guys have had a lot of success. Heard the $50 billion ABF AUM figure, 19 platforms, $20 billion originations, I think last year. Just hoping you could talk a little bit more around the steps and actions you guys were taking to drive the originations meaningfully higher. How much of that do you think would be coming from more resources that are adding to the existing platforms versus or do you see a bigger needle mover from adding more platforms over time? And maybe you could talk about your vision around how you see this evolving over the next 5 years? \nCraig Larson: So why don't I start, Mike. I think you hit on a lot of the key points. I think that the asset-based finance business for us as a whole has just changed really dramatically post the Global Atlantic acquisition. And this is a business where scale begets scale. And so I think we've seen real advantages of partnering with GA, partnering with additional third-party clients. And then an important part of that have been all the platforms that Scott had mentioned and that Chris Sheldon had run through over the course of our Investor Day.\n And I think specifically, when you look at those 18, 19 platforms, they're global. As Scott mentioned, 7,000 people -- some-odd people, helping us source and originate unique deal flow for the benefit of our clients as we look forward from here. Will we look to grow that universe of platforms? I'm sure the answer to that is yes. Is that a number that's going to be 2x what it is today 2 years from now? I wouldn't want you to think anything along those lines. But I think there's continued opportunity for us to continue to build and drive scale.\n And one of the other important points, again, as Scott mentioned a few minutes ago, it does feel like client knowledge of this opportunity is one that's been increasing dramatically. It felt to us like infrastructure and direct lending in these other asset classes, there was a period of time where it took some real education on the part of our clients, and that education can come in baby steps. And ABF is a unique asset class because it's been around for a long, long time, but it's really not been a distinct asset class as many of our clients have thought about their portfolios. So at the same point in time that our strategic position is one that's increased dramatically and improved dramatically, it just feels like that knowledge level with our clients is coming up the curve at the same time. And I think that's what you're seeing in our results. \nScott Nuttall: Michael, it's Scott. I think we're going to -- we'll add more platforms, probably not as many as we have. We will add resources to the existing platforms. But remember, these businesses are already out in the market sourcing investment opportunity. And so to some extent, the way I think about it is we're capital constrained, not opportunity constrained. So to the extent we continue to scale our capital base here, we can do more with the existing origination platforms we've already set up. And it's less about needing to add a lot of resources as opposed to just taking more advantage of the flow we're already seeing.\n And as Craig said, now that private credit has become a better understood part of what we do, as private credit allocations get created, more work is getting done on this part of the space. And so we're seeing allocations to direct lending and ABF as part of that continue to pick up. And we've seen this across other asset classes, there's pattern recognition. As those allocations get created and people look to get to the number that they picked, what we tend to see on the back of that is quite a bit of capital formation. So we feel like we're ready for that. \nOperator: Our next question is from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. \nPatrick Davitt: Could you give us the updated visible announced but not closed realization revenue number? And then more broadly, I guess we've got some conflicting messages out there about how good the realization environment really is, overall sense that you're still pretty constructive. So maybe just update us on what your -- what's driving your confidence and maybe what you think is -- why your tone is diverging from what we've heard from some other players out there. \nRobert Lewin: Great. Thanks for the follow-up, Patrick. So today, we've got north of $400 million of visible pipeline as it relates to monetization, call that roughly 60% carry, 40% investment income. As you noted, our pipelines are pretty healthy. As we look at that $400 million, I should be clear, it's not certain all if that's going to close in Q2. Some of that's got some regulatory approvals as part of that. But as we look at our pipelines, they are better on the monetization side that they've been at any point over the past 12 to 18 months.\n I can't really comment on what others are saying. I could just comment on what we're feeling across the firm. And I'm not sure to be all that much of a surprise. We're seeing the leverage finance market come back. You're starting to see CLO formation sit behind the leveraged finance market. And that all creates additional dry powder in the system for deal activity, which is the fuel to greater monetization. And so we'll see. There's a lot to get done in order to monetize the pipeline. But at least for KKR, we're feeling relatively constructive versus where we had been maybe 12 months ago at this time. \nScott Nuttall: Yes. Patrick, I'd say we -- I don't know why you're hearing a bit of a different tone. Maybe the markets themselves have a little bit of fragility. The geopolitical risk, there's a good amount of angst about the macro, that could be part of it. Our comments are based on kind of the environment continuing like we see it right now. But if something happened, exogenous shocks, then sure, it could change the environment. But it could be that our portfolio is maybe more global than some, maybe a bit more mature across aspects of what we invested in some. But we're seeing it. This isn't a speculation, we can see it and feel it in terms of the live discussions we're having. \nCraig Larson: And only part, Patrick, I'd add on to both of those comments really would relate to that investment performance aspect of this, you look at our gross unrealized carry, that number is up 50% year-over-year. That's a pretty big increase, recognizing both the value creation we've seen, together with the fact that we've been in a more modest realization environment. And I think when you look at some of the underlying statistics, as Scott said, we've got a healthy amount of the portfolio that's pretty seasoned. So roughly 50% of that would be 4 years or greater as we look at the maturity of the private equity portfolio.\n But then you've got to layer in investment performance alongside of that. So almost 30% of that is marked at 2x or greater. And somewhere between 55% and 60% is marked at 1.5x cost and greater. So I think you have this combination of maturing portfolio together with strong investment performance that, as we look forward, gives us confidence and, again, ultimately seeing that flow through to our financials. \nOperator: We've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Craig Larson for closing comments. \nCraig Larson: I would just like to really thank everybody for the time that you've invested in KKR. When we think of the announcements we made in November and at the Investor Day just a few weeks ago, and then together with our Q4 and Q1 earnings, we've been very active in taking a lot of mind share from everyone. So thanks for your investment in understanding KKR better. And please follow up with us directly with any follow-on questions. Thanks so much. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Scott Nuttall",
            "content": "Yes. The only thing I'd add, Craig, is we do think the M&A market is coming back. I think to your point, the leverage credit markets opened up in January. We are starting to see this impact all of our businesses, to Craig's comments. But I'd say, in particular, private equity pipeline, which is up significantly. There's a lot of activity. What we announced in Q1 is obviously backward looking given it takes some time for these deals to close. The Cotiviti deal that you mentioned actually closes today.\n So I think you're going to see more of the announced deals get closed, and you're going to see more deals get announced as this pipeline turns into real deal pipeline and that turns into real deployment. I think you're also going to see this on the monetization side. If the M&A market is picking up and the IPO markets are open, you're going to see us selling more assets as well, refinancing more assets and taking more companies public. So I think you're going to see more activity overall across private equity. Bill, it's Scott. The only thing I'd add is in addition to the organic fundraising that Craig ran through from third parties, we mentioned in the Investor Day the symbiotic relationship between Global Atlantic and our credit business in particular. We're definitely seeing that show up in the numbers as well. And it's also allowing us to see how our third-party insurance AUM as well at the same time.

And as we mentioned last November when we announced that we're going to 100% ownership of Global Atlantic, that's one of the opportunities that we saw, we're just getting after that now. So I think you'll see it not only show up in credit, but in some of the real asset lines as well. Yes. I think to the second question, Brian, we haven't been out actively marketing core private equity. We've got plenty of dry powder in the pools that we manage today.

            "content": "Thanks a lot, Craig, and thank you all for joining our call this morning, and for the many of you that spent time with us at our Investor Day a few weeks back. I thought I would start this morning by going through some of our key operating metrics.\n During the quarter, we raised $31 billion of capital. That's almost $90 billion over the last 12 months. In just this quarter alone, we had attractive outcomes across each of our businesses. Our private equity and real asset businesses together raised $9 billion of capital across a number of strategies. And that's before any meaningful closes from our upcoming flagship raises. And our momentum in credit has really continued, with new capital raise totaling $21 billion, with most of the capital coming from our direct lending, asset-based finance and leveraged credit strategies.\n And looking more specifically at our K Series vehicles, we raised almost $3 billion year-to-date through April 1, primarily in private equity and infrastructure. We also launched a private BDC in the quarter and are starting to see some real inflows here as well.\n Turning to capital invested. We deployed $14 billion in the quarter. Deployment within private markets was largely driven by infrastructure as well as real estate equity. And over half of the capital invested in the quarter came from credit, primarily across asset-based finance and direct lending. We are seeing a significant ramp in credit deployment, reflecting the overall growth of our credit platform.\n Now looking forward to Q2, we expect there to be a healthy pipeline of new deployment given the activities we are seeing broadly across the firm. And over the course of the year, we do expect deployment to pick up meaningfully. \n  Before wrapping up this morning, I did want to spend a couple of minutes summarizing the key takeaways from our Investor Day a few weeks back. Scott and Joe led off our Investor Day with a very simple message: While we have experienced a lot of growth, it feels like we are just getting started.\n In terms of the key takeaways from the day. First, we provided medium-term guidance. Over the next 12 to 18 months, we expect to be raising capital for over 30 strategies, including a number of our flagships. We expect to raise $300-plus billion of capital over the course of 2024 through 2026. In terms of our financial metrics, by 2026, we expect $4.50-plus per share of FRE. Implying a CAGR of approximately 20%, $7-plus of total operating earnings per share and $7 to $8 per share of adjusted net income, implying a CAGR of roughly 30%.\n Second, looking ahead, we feel quite confident in our longer-term trajectory. We expect $15-plus of adjusted net income per share in the next 10 years or less, with approximately 70% of these earnings to be more recurring in nature. Over the next 5 years, we also expect $25-plus billion of cash generation. We anticipate that this cash will get deployed across 4 key areas: core private equity, share buyback, strategic M&A and insurance. Our model really gives us the confidence across all of these avenues of deployment. In each case, we have a strong track record of being able to deploy capital against high ROE opportunities that also generate recurring and growth-oriented earnings per share.\n And number three, looking at our key themes, we made sure to highlight our diversified and purpose-built business model. Asset Management plus Insurance plus Strategic Holdings, all working synergistically together to generate sustainable and significant P&L outcomes. And we have a lot of confidence in each of our 3 growth engines. In Asset Management, we have multiple paths to surpass $1 trillion of AUM over the next 5 years. In insurance, we have strong conviction that we could double Global Atlantic from here. And finally, strategic holdings, which is really an unconstrained market opportunity for us and where we have a real right to win. We expect to have $1 billion-plus of annual operating earnings by 2030.\n Our business model is built to drive compounding earnings over a very long period of time. And while the opportunity in front of us is a massive one, we do believe that we can achieve our outline targets without having to build anything new. And we have a team and culture, as you would have heard from over 15 of our business leaders on April 10, that both facilitates and accelerates our ability to achieve our strategic ambitions. So when you combine our business model, together with our team and our culture, this is what distinctly differentiates KKR.\n And with that, Scott, Craig and I are happy to take any questions. Great. And thanks a lot for the question, Alex. So you did mention this, I think the most important thing as it relates to capital allocation is to have a consistent framework, and we've had a really consistent framework for some time with one overriding objective, and that's to use our excess free cash flow to drive durable and recurring and growth-oriented earnings per share and to do so by leveraging our platform at really high ROEs. And I think the only thing that's really changed is, at our Investor Day, we outlined the opportunity to generate $25-plus billion of cash generation over the course of the next 5 years, and it's just a huge opportunity for us.\n In terms of bucketing across the 4 main areas of deployment, core private equity, share buybacks, insurance and strategic M&A, we don't have a fixed percentage by design. And it's really about being able to allocate that capital base nimbly to the opportunities that drive the highest return and the highest amount of earnings per share over a long period of time. That's our focus that's what we think we're really good at.\n As it relates to your question on Strategic Holdings, we outlined a path to $1 billion plus of Strategic Holdings operating earnings by 2030. It's something that we're confident in. We've got real visibility on where that's going to come from. I do think there's the opportunity if we see investments for us to be able to make in Strategic Holdings to drive that number north of that over time as we allocate capital. But again, no fixed percentage in how we're thinking about it. And I think that's a good thing, frankly, because I think it allows us to go after the highest returning and most ROE-friendly and earnings per share friendly opportunities that exist. Brian, it's Rob. I'll start off. Plus or minus $20 million Strategic Holdings operating earnings, a pretty good level to model for the remainder of the year. As we move forward and get closer to $300-plus million by 2026, I think you'll see a little bit more stability in that line item quarter-to-quarter. Might bump around a little bit in 2024, but plus or minus $20 million is about right.\n And as it relates to our core private equity strategy, listen, we are the largest core private equity manager today globally by a good margin. We think we've built because of our investment teams, our geographic reach, our industry gap, our collaborative culture. We've really built a best-in-class franchise, and it's something that I think we certainly be excited about continuing to partner with our clients on over time. Glenn, it's Rob. I'll start. I think you hit on it in your last remarks there. It is not a need-to-have for us. And so we want to be in businesses where there are large addressable markets, and we've got conviction, we can be a top 3 player. Of course, over time, we've looked at the secondary space. You could assume that most every M&A transaction that's happened in the secondary space, has come across our desk here. And either we determined it wasn't the right partner to be a top 3 player or we determined that we just weren't willing to pay the price that was a prevailing price in the market.\n And so we're perfectly comfortable focusing on the aspects of our business that we're already in today. With that focus, we think we can be uniquely great at the things that we've already started and that provides more than enough running room for growth going forward. Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Patrick. So I'd say that if you look at the flows at GA this quarter, probably about 75% from the institutional side of our business, give or take. Again, that's inclusive of the big block transaction that we did in the quarter with Manulife. We've had really good momentum on the individual side of our business as well, with very strong sales both in Q4 of '23 and again in Q1 of 2024.\n And then on the PRT side, pension risk transfer side, we've talked about this as being a medium to long-term opportunity at GA. We really, coming into this year, did not have very much exposure here at all, but we have a team assembled against the opportunity, and we continue to believe that it's a really big opportunity given the capability of our Institutional Reinsurance platform for us to be able to take some share again starting off of a very low base. Sure, Dan, it's Rob. I'll start. So what we're seeing in the GA business is really strong performance, really strong operating performance, and really an even stronger outlook for the future. What happened in Q1 or what transpired from a P&L perspective in Q1, very much by design. When you complete 2 very large block deals north of $20 billion of assets, you're going to take on the cost of those liabilities day one. But we really have a 12- to 18-month period where we've modeled redeployment of the assets into higher-yielding investments. And we're operating at higher levels of cash balance. That was point one. \n Point two is a really interesting one, Scott started to touch on it a little bit earlier. We're seeing a really interesting opportunity in core and core plus real estate right now. There is just almost no core and core plus real estate capital out there. And we're able to create really attractive unlevered returns by leaning into that asset class. But one of the downsides of leaning into that asset class is a near-term downside in that the running yields on those investments tend to be in the 4%, 4.5% range. But we think those investments will certainly more than pay off in terms of the longer-term ROEs that they could generate.\n So much like how you'd hear us talking about investing in the near term for benefits of long term across everything we do, that would be a really good example where you could see some dilution to ROEs in the near term, but we think that are more than going to benefit Global Atlantic, its policyholders, ultimately our shareholders, in the long term given the attractive risk-adjusted returns we're seeing there. Yes. Great. So starting on the cost of insurance, and I think you really hit on it. As you see the rotation in a higher interest rate environment, our crediting spreads have, of course, gone up so have the yields that we're able to generate on the investment side of the portfolio. So being able to generate that spread continues to really exist in the business. So you'll continue to see, I think, an upward draft on our crediting spreads for a little bit. And then ultimately, it would be a function of where interest rates shake out. \n In terms of our longer-term ROE numbers, I think the continued right range to be able to forecast Global Atlantic is really in that long term 14% to 15% pretax ROE range. Nothing has changed there. We feel really good about the liabilities that we're able to source in the marketplace. We've talked about our management team really feeling like they are best-in-class at being able to source simple, easy to understand, transparent liabilities at scale. I'll take our investment platforms up against anybody globally and being able to put those liabilities to work. Yes. Brian, a few thoughts. When you look back at 2022 and 2023, really tough operating conditions for our Capital Markets business. And for much of that time, Capital Markets on the equity side, on the leverage finance side, were largely shut. And our business generated ballpark $600 million of revenue in each of those 2 years. And so we're really proud of the durability of the franchise that we created. As I look at our pipelines today for the remainder of 2024, we get updated pipelines weekly, our pipelines are a lot better today than they were at this time last year. Now there's a lot to go execute on between now and the end of the year. But the forward indicators for our capital markets business sitting here in early May are definitely better than they were in May of 2023.\n And then more to your question around the longer term. If you look back in 2021, our Capital Markets business generated, a ballpark, $850 million of revenue. And clearly, you had buoyant capital markets that helped in 2021. But if you look at KKR today as a firm, we do more today than we did in 2021. I believe we have greater market share with our third-party clients than we did in 2021. And we've talked about the real opportunity to scale what we're doing in coordination with Global Atlantic. So when you combine all that, we continue to be really optimistic about what we're going to be able to create over the next several years with our Capital Markets franchise that is truly a unique business relative to any of our competitors out there right now. Great. Thanks for the follow-up, Patrick. So today, we've got north of $400 million of visible pipeline as it relates to monetization, call that roughly 60% carry, 40% investment income. As you noted, our pipelines are pretty healthy. As we look at that $400 million, I should be clear, it's not certain all if that's going to close in Q2. Some of that's got some regulatory approvals as part of that. But as we look at our pipelines, they are better on the monetization side that they've been at any point over the past 12 to 18 months.\n I can't really comment on what others are saying. I could just comment on what we're feeling across the firm. And I'm not sure to be all that much of a surprise. We're seeing the leverage finance market come back. You're starting to see CLO formation sit behind the leveraged finance market. And that all creates additional dry powder in the system for deal activity, which is the fuel to greater monetization. And so we'll see. There's a lot to get done in order to monetize the pipeline. But at least for KKR, we're feeling relatively constructive versus where we had been maybe 12 months ago at this time."
