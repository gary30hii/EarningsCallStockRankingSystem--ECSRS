[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Matt Kreps. Sir, the floor is yours.\nMatt Kreps: Thank you, John, and thanks, everyone, for participating in today's call to discuss Apollo's fourth quarter 2020 financial and operating results. Joining me on the call are Todd Newton, Chief Executive Officer; and Stefanie Cavanaugh, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to caution listeners that comments made by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, including Apollo's financial outlook and Apollo's plans and timing for product development and sales. In addition, there is uncertainty around the spread of the COVID-19 virus and the ultimate impact it may have on our operations, the demand for our products, global supply chains and economic activity in general. These forward-looking statements involve material risks and uncertainties and could cause actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of risk factors, I encourage you to review the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2020, filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The content of this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the day of this live broadcast, February 25, 2021. Except as required by law, Apollo undertakes no obligation to revise or update any statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call. During this call, we will interchangeably use the term ESS for OverStitch and term IGB for Orbera and vice versa. And now with that completed, I'd like to turn the call over to Todd.\nTodd Newton: Thank you, Matt. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call to discuss our fourth quarter 2020 results. Our expectation coming into the fourth quarter was for COVID disruption to persist, but to be less severe than certainly we experienced in the first half of 2020, and that overall procedure volumes using our products would return to levels similar to the fourth quarter of last year. This expectation was more or less what occurred in our business during the fourth quarter, with the U.S. market being up 15% versus Q4 of 2019, which made up for the more noticeable COVID procedure weakness, which lingered in our international markets, particularly in our European direct markets during November and December. Taken together, our worldwide endoscopy product sales increased 4% in the fourth quarter year-over-year. I am really pleased with our ability to reduce and maintain control over our cash burn in the fourth quarter. Expense reduction programs that were born from necessity due to the coronavirus, along with gradual gross margin progress, resulted in a 53% reduction in our net operating loss in Q4 compared to the same period in 2019 and a 58% improvement in our cash used in operations. The improvement in these 2 important financial metrics should be not just sustainable but can improve from here as our markets stabilize, health care utilization gets back on track and product revenues grow. I'm also pleased to tell you we have completed the X-Tack limited launch. I will give you more detail shortly, but I will tell you now, it went great. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Stefanie to cover the fourth quarter financial results in greater detail. Stef?\nStefanie Cavanaugh: Thank you, Todd, and good afternoon, everyone. As Todd mentioned, the fourth quarter of 2020 overall was a stabilizing period for our revenues, even amid regional COVID disruption fluctuations. On the top line, total revenues increased to $12.9 million, a gain of 7% in the fourth quarter of 2020 from the fourth quarter of 2019. Total endoscopy revenue increased 4% to $12.2 million, with U.S. endoscopy sales increasing 15%, while OUS endoscopy sales decreased 6%. Similar to the third quarter, these results reflect continuing U.S. rebound from COVID-19 and differing trend lines in our 2 OUS sales channels. In our OUS direct markets, endoscopy product sales declined 10% due to ongoing COVID case volatility in the fourth quarter. Product sales to distributors began to rebound somewhat and were back to the fourth quarter of 2019 levels. By product, fourth quarter ESS sales increased 2% from 2019, with U.S. ESS sales increasing 10%, to offset the weaker OUS ESS sales, which were impacted by the lingering COVID-19 disruption that I just noted. Fourth quarter IGB product revenue increased 7% from 2019 and U.S. Orbera sales increased 33%, and OUS IGB revenue remained largely stable and consistent compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 56% compared with 49% for the fourth quarter of 2019, increasing from the benefits of our gross margin improvement projects as well as the increase in direct market IGB sales this quarter. Increased inventory production also improved the fourth quarter gross margin results through higher overhead absorption. During the fourth quarter, we restarted select gross margin improvement projects that were put on hold during the pandemic. The next 2 of these projects will address our Sx material costs, and we expect both projects to be completed in the first half of this year. The Sx products represented over 1/3 of our ESS sales outside the U.S. as of the end of 2020 and is the product of choice for most of our newer distributor markets. At current Sx volumes, these 2 projects will reduce material costs by approximately $200,000 per year. Total operating expenses were $10.4 million, down more than $2.3 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. The 18% reduction in operating costs is due to the permanent cost savings initially implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As we referenced last quarter, we eliminated approximately $10 million of annual costs compared to pre-COVID spending levels as a result of restructuring efforts and realignment of our business priorities. Pulling all of this together, our operating loss in the fourth quarter of 2020 decreased to $3.2 million from $6.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Cash at the end of the fourth quarter was $37.2 million compared with $38.2 million at the end of the third quarter. We received our second $2 million installment payment from the sale of the surgical product line in December as required. Excluding this payment, our cash used in the fourth quarter was approximately $3 million. As we announced in December, we further enhanced our 2021 liquidity by $12 million through extension of the interest-only period and maturity date of our term loan by 12 months to March 2022 and September 2024, respectively. In addition, the amendment will automatically extend the interest-only period and maturity date by an additional 6 months if we meet specific revenue milestones during 2021. Our cash position, along with this amendment, provides a solid foundation as we focus on reaching positive operating cash flow over the next 4 or 5 quarters. With that, I'll turn it back to Todd.\nTodd Newton: Thanks, Stef. I want to update you on 2 important topics this afternoon: the X-Tack U.S. limited launch and the reimbursement effort underway to bring coding and coverage to our products. We completed the limited launch earlier this week, and the results were tremendous. During the limited launch, we completed 24 cases, consisting of 13 lower GI cases and 11 cases in the upper GI tract. These cases were performed by 10 doctors across 9 different accounts. The limited launch suggested a physician learning curve after only 1 device. Several of the limited launch cases have been done without our presence after that first use. It is proving to be a see one, do one, teach one kind of product. Our very first X-Tack case was to close a large dissection at the hepatic flexure of the colon of close to 6 centimeters in size and irregularly shaped. The dissection itself to remove the large flat polyp of this size was a significant and time-consuming procedure. Closing a dissection site of this size would likely have been an OverStitch case, except that the hepatic flexure, it would have been a big access challenge with OverStitch on a gastroscope. The physician used 4 X-Tack devices to close this particular defect site. Perhaps, we would have liked a little bit more of a conservative case right out of the gate as our procedure number one, but the challenging cases represent the big unmet need and the reason why we designed X-Tack to begin with. And the device worked great in this highly challenging clinical environment. Each case in the limited launch is its own story and represents a life-changing procedure for the patient. For those 24 limited launch cases completed, the closure sites range from a relatively standard 18-millimeter size all the way to 80 millimeters, which is getting to be a really large site.  During the limited launch, X-Tack has been used to close a large ESD site, all the way across the colon at the ileocecal valve close to the end of the ascending colon where the small intestine turns into the large intestine, a location where OverStitch could not reach. And the X-Tack was also used to successfully close large and irregularly shaped sites where through the scope clips, even in multiple numbers, could not span and would have been ineffective. Closure have been completed using 1 X-Tack device in the more straightforward cases, all the way up to 4 X-Tack devices in the larger and complex cases, such as the one at the ileocecal valve. The average number of X-Tack devices per case in the limited launch was 2. After each case, we asked the physician to rate the functionality and ease of use of the device across a number of performance attributes on a scale of 1 being poor and 5 being excellent, and the device has shown consistently high ratings across all performance measures, with an overall average rating of 4.7. With confirmation of X-Tack's stellar clinical performance and the closeout of our limited launch protocol, we have a very high degree of confidence as we direct our attention to scaling up our manufacturing capacity for the product.  The most important capacity enhancing step in front of our manufacturing team is to convert from prototype molds to production molds, and this conversion is on track. Also, the closeout of our limited launch with such high marks gives our sales team confidence as they pursue our highest-priority target accounts and get in front of customer new product evaluation committees. In summary, as we end the limited launch, we are exactly where we hope to be. And if anything, our expectations have been exceeded. We have confirmed device function across a broad diversity of cases and array of closure needs throughout the GI track. User ratings have been excellent. Feedback is that X-Tack is easy to learn and easy to use. We are moving into the next launch stage right on schedule with an acceleration of our X-Tack commercial programs. Yesterday, we went live with the X-Tack product website and began a campaign to harvest our medical education training records to introduce this new technology to physicians who have come through our medical education programs in the past. Right now, outstanding quotes in front of customers pending their new product committee approval aggregate to a high 6-figure dollar amount. Everything learned so far suggests that X-Tack has a real opportunity to significantly disrupt the GI closure market. Shifting to reimbursement. There are activities underway for all products. First, for OverStitch, this is where most of our management team's efforts are directed with specific focus on the ESG procedure and bariatric revisions. We are closing in on the time when we expect the MERIT investigators to publish their study results, which we then plan to use as the cornerstone data piece for our ESG reimbursement strategy. All indications remain that we will see the MERIT study data accepted for publication sometime before the middle point of 2021. We do not have access to this independent study's data, but we have high confidence that the study will achieve its primary outcome objectives based on more than 80 studies and articles published in peer-reviewed literature describing and analyzing the ESG procedure since 2015. This worldwide data has been remarkably consistent in reporting favorable efficacy and safety results. As MERIT data nears release, we have turned to other groundwork that is part of the ESG reimbursement plan. In the fourth quarter, we submitted applications to begin the process for both ICD-10 coding and HCPCS coding for all OverStitch applications, including the ESG procedure and for bariatric revisions. The reviews of these code applications are in process, and the earliest date for a decision on either code application is probably October. The CPT coding effort will become better known following the publication of MERIT data, but it would be our goal for ESG coding to be considered by the CPT panel hopefully before the end of the year. The MERIT data will also be of interest to the payer communities in the U.S. and several other key countries, and we intend to engage these communities in coverage and payment discussions with the primary endpoint results once they're published. The prize for expanding the market access for the ESG procedure is very meaningful. There were an estimated 350,000 bariatric procedures performed in our direct markets during 2019, while only 7,500 ESGs were performed, largely without coverage. Each 1% increase in ESG's market share that comes with coverage is an incremental $5.6 million of revenue at today's average selling prices. And of course, a 10% market share is therefore equivalent to $56 million of revenue. In addition to reimbursement, we have plans to expand the OverStitch labeling to include both the ESG procedure and bariatric revisions. The MERIT data, again, is very critical, along with other prospectively collected ESG and revision data for this label expansion effort. Label expansion adds value because it will allow us to improve our medical education content that we provide to physicians today and also improve patient awareness. Second, there appears to be some progress with respect to U.S. codings that could be beneficial to both Orbera and X-Tack. First, for Orbera. In the fourth quarter, ICD-10 codes for the endoscopic insertion and removal of devices were approved by CMS, which are applicable to Orbera. These became effective in October. And in the fourth quarter, we saw that an application for a CPT code for intragastric balloons was on the agenda for the CPT editorial panel meeting, which occurred earlier this month. Separately, we submitted for a HCPCS code for Orbera during the fourth quarter. And we continue to be in various society and regulator discussions for the consideration of Orbera as a treatment for pre-cirrhotic NASH patients with fibrosis ever since the publication of the Mayo Clinic study on this in early 2020. This data, along with previously published data outside the United States, in our opinion, shows that Orbera has a reasonable likelihood of both technical success and clinical success in providing a more effective NASH treatment than today's standard of care. If these discussions are successful, all these codings developments could be very meaningful for our U.S. Orbera product line. But the consideration of an IGB code wasn't the only CPT panel agenda item of interest to us. Also on this same agenda was consideration for a CPT code for endoscopic submucosal dissection or what is referred to as ESD. ESD is an endoluminal procedure for the en bloc resection of larger flat gastrointestinal tumors, especially colorectal tumors. The approval of this CPT code, along with the coverage and payments down the road, would expand the already attractive addressable market for X-Tack. The AMA's website indicates that the CPT panel results will be released by March 8. Lastly, our team also filed ICD-10 and HCPCS applications for X-Tack back in December upon its 510(k) clearance. For the past few years, we have made medical education the cornerstone of our OverStitch strategy. There were 2 important elements to this. First, because endoluminal suturing was so novel, it was very important to capture physician mind share through peer-reviewed publications that describe the clinical value that endoluminal suturing can deliver. And second, we needed world-class training capability to teach physicians the mechanics of using OverStitch, which can be technically challenging to get through a learning curve and get started with. Since we implemented this strategy in 2015, OverStitch revenue CAGR has been 38% up until the 2020 coronavirus disruption. In 2020, the literature side of the strategy, though, continued to deliver results, as 73 publications and medical journals mentioned OverStitch and 35 publications mentioned our intragastric balloons. 18 of these intragastric balloon publications referenced the potential as part of the treatment for NASH. The other element of our medical education strategy, which is positioned product training, did get disrupted by COVID. Physician society meetings went virtual, and travel and group gatherings were restricted. But nonetheless, at the beginning of the fourth quarter, we restarted the mobile lab in the United States and conducted hands-on training for 75 physicians in 14 different U.S. cities. We expect this effort will refill both our new account and expanding user pipelines for OverStitch in 2021 as well as support the launch of X-Tack. Before I open the call to questions, I want to say that we will not be providing 2021 guidance today. I think it's best for Apollo's next CEO to speak to that without me setting expectations for him, and I hope you will all understand that. I will say, however, that we are off to a good start in the first quarter and tracking to produce at least 10% sales growth over the first quarter of 2020, even before considering any X-Tack contribution. We have still been experiencing through the first 2 months of the first quarter some intermittent pockets of COVID weakness, which suggests that March results could surprise in either direction, but we are doing well so far in the first quarter. And demand from our international markets, particularly from distributor markets, is improving. And of course, the U.S. is continuing to progress very well. As I've said before, as long as elective procedures are allowed and health care delivery is normal, our business will do well. So after questions and answers, I'm going to have a couple of closing comments. But on that note, we'll now open the lines for questions. John, please proceed with questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We have a question coming from Matt Hewitt from Craig-Hallum Capital Group.\nMatt Hewitt: And I guess before I get to those, I just want to say, Todd, it's been a pleasure working with you. And best of luck in, obviously, all of your endeavors going forward. I look forward to checking your progress, see where you land next, but congratulations on all the progress that you've made here at Apollo.\nTodd Newton: Thank you, Matt.\nMatt Hewitt: First question in there, you hit some really key topics. But the first one, on X-Tack, congratulations on the soft launch. How quickly can we start to think about, from a commercial standpoint -- I think you mentioned that you've already got 6-figure orders outstanding, how quickly will that translate into the income statement? And where can that go maybe over the course of the year?\nTodd Newton: Yes. Matt, unfortunately, I did mention that I don't feel like I should give 2021 guidance, and that would include ramp rates and the like. I just feel like that's better for the next CEO to come. But I can tell you that I feel like we have a really good level of activity going on right now. As I indicated, the -- those quotes that are in front of accounts where we're going through the new product committee process, sometimes called the VAC process, that is going well. And the limited launch results certainly give us a great deal of confidence as we pursue those opportunities.\nMatt Hewitt: Okay. And maybe a different way of asking the question without getting necessary guidance, but how -- help us think about a 6-figure order. How quickly will an account work through something of that size? I mean, is that over a couple of months? Is that a couple of quarters? Just help us size that up.\nTodd Newton: Yes. So our view, if you base it off the limited launch results, we are going -- we're using about 2 X-Tack devices per case. And those cases generally are at that 2 -- let's say, 2-centimeter size that we have indicated is really the ideal target for X-Tack or higher. . And so I think it will just depend a little bit upon each individual account and how often they are encountering those, but I can feel confident in saying that our view is that the frequency at which doctors are going to have those cases will be at a greater rate than OverStitch use within a relatively short period of time. Relatively short period being over the next, say, few years, couple of years.\nMatt Hewitt: Okay. That's helpful. And then as far as OverStitch is concerned, I think everyone is excited and waiting on the MERIT data. But walk through -- so the data comes out, is it your hope and expectation that Apollo would have some, albeit maybe minor, but have some reimbursement in place even by the end of the year? Or is that more of a '22-type event before the reimbursement starts to layer on?\nTodd Newton: Yes. And just to remind you, Matt, I think you certainly you know this from our earlier conversations, we have, in some places, reimbursement today for ESG. And it's just not broad coverage. It's more individual accounts working with specific, let's call it, insurance providers, private payers, where they are getting reimbursed for OverStitch, the ones being used for ESG. And certainly, that's the case today for bariatric revisions. Bariatric revisions are nearly always paid for. It's an exceedingly rare situation today when we don't have a bariatric revision using OverStitch that is being just normally paid for. So what we're really looking at is trying to expand that and using the MERIT data to expand that and to really broaden this to being more of a national coverage and part of national coverage policies. That's probably still though going to involve coding and coverage and timing around all those things such that it's unlikely to affect us in 2021. Hopefully, there could even be some benefits in 2022. But the way that most of these coding processes lay out their calendars, it's probably more of a 2023 event in our future.\nMatt Hewitt: Okay. Understood. All right. And then shifting to Orbera. Obviously, the CPT code news was positive when we saw that it was on the calendar. We're still waiting for that news. But maybe -- that business has -- is starting to recover even without reimbursement, per se. And as we start to think about areas where reimbursement is possible or likely, I think some of the areas you talked about as having interest are NASH -- as a treatment for NASH, for surgical procedures where maybe high BMI patient, getting them down to a fighting weight beforehand. I know that there's trials ongoing for that and for orthopedic procedures. But how do you -- help us understand, from a size perspective, like how big of a market or -- what kind of an opportunity does that represent for Orbera?\nTodd Newton: Yes. We -- in our Investor Relations slide deck, which is on our website, and I don't have these numbers right in front of me right now. But on that -- in that deck, we have a number of demographic data points that talk about those top 3, if you will, priority areas that we have been pursuing. It talks about the population, for example, that is in our BMI range of 30 to 40, who also are going to be those NASH patients. And so I'd just refer you there. But the size of these markets are significant. I think you'll see that the number for NASH, for example, where the fibrosis levels are 2 or 3 and their BMI is over 30, but lower than 40, so it makes it consistent with Orbera label. That's roughly a 10 million U.S. population. If you go down to the -- to those that would be eligible for using Orbera, again, BMI 30 to 40 and the number of just total joint replacements done per year, that's another 300,000 procedures that are done for those patients that are within that range of BMI and so on and so on. So these are significant markets that can make a difference for our Orbera business here in the United States.\nMatt Hewitt: Okay. Maybe one last one for me, and I'll hop back in the queue. Another nice improvement in gross margin in the quarter. You've taken some steps. You mentioned that you're in the process of starting the next phase of gross margin improvement projects. But as we think about fiscal '21 and not so much of guidance, but that should continue, the gross margin should continue to trend higher along with your revenues as sales continue to grow? Is that accurate?\nStefanie Cavanaugh: Yes. It is. And our biggest contributor to gross margin improvement this year will be X-Tack. It has a high variable gross margin, and so that will be contributing to our gross margin improvement this year as will the 2 projects I talked about in my prepared remarks.\nOperator: I'd now like to turn the floor back to Todd Newton for some additional remarks.\nTodd Newton: Well, thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. This will be my last call as CEO of Apollo. Earlier this month, we announced the appointment of Chas McKhann as CEO effective on March 1. And this is a good time for transition as great things are on the horizon. Today, we sit with a high-growth product portfolio, and each of our products are directed at high-value, large addressable markets. As I reflect back about OverStitch, this was a product originally designed for NOTES, or Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery, which is a leading-edge and maybe you'd even say it's a bleeding-edge surgical concept. But no one is doing or looking to do oral appendectomies. 6 years ago, when we would engage physicians about OverStitch, their reactions would be, \"Well, gee, that's a cool technology. When will I ever use it?\" Since that time, we have answered that question. Today, OverStitch is emerging as the standard of care for bariatric provisions and for esophageal stent fixation in addition to various other core GI applications that call for full-thickness tissue approximation. Physicians see the enormous value potential of ESG for the obese as a primary obesity procedure. And in the months ahead, I expect us to hear more from physicians developing an OverStitch endoscopic antireflux procedure, which is today being called RAP, as a possible alternative to surgical fundoplication. We have taken down other OverStitch adoption barriers by building world-class medical education capabilities. We developed the Sx for those at locations or in markets who do not have access to a dual-channel scope. And now we are expanding the incredible versatility of suturing into the large lower GI market with X-Tack. Orbera, too, is under revival with a medical-use strategy that leverages its unique patient value proposition. Thank you to Matt Hewitt for that question of what those things look like today. And along the way, we have made some tough decisions to shed lower-performing products and programs to reach the point we are at today, a company with a clear identity. The future looks good, and we have specific plans for further improving the structural self-sufficiency of the business with very specific, well-conceived and executable gross margin improvement projects. We have dramatically reduced our cash burn, and we have probably the best ever balance sheet as a company. The business is certainly not on cruise control, and I would never say that it is, but we have a solid plan and the human and financial resources to execute it. So it's time to close the repositioning chapter and begin to write a great commercial execution chapter. I'll be supporting my transition and have every confidence in Chas, along with our executive team, to lead Apollo Endosurgery forward. Chas has an impressive track record, with a resume that includes successful commercial roles at Boston Scientific, Johnson & Johnson, Torax Medical and Intersect ENT. And lastly, to all the men and women of Apollo Endosurgery past and present over the past 6.5 years, thank you. We've come a long way, baby. Apollo Endosurgery has truly changed interventional gastrointestinal endoscopy as well as the treatment options for the many affected by the various metabolic diseases caused by obesity. And the company is poised to burn its mark even deeper. So should you have any questions or would like to arrange a call with us, please contact Matt Kreps at Darrow Associates. The company also plans to participate in several virtual investor conferences coming up ahead in the month of March. Please also contact Matt if you'd like to request a meeting as part of one of those events. Thank you, and have a good evening.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Thank you, Matt. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call to discuss our fourth quarter 2020 results. Our expectation coming into the fourth quarter was for COVID disruption to persist, but to be less severe than certainly we experienced in the first half of 2020, and that overall procedure volumes using our products would return to levels similar to the fourth quarter of last year. This expectation was more or less what occurred in our business during the fourth quarter, with the U.S. market being up 15% versus Q4 of 2019, which made up for the more noticeable COVID procedure weakness, which lingered in our international markets, particularly in our European direct markets during November and December. Taken together, our worldwide endoscopy product sales increased 4% in the fourth quarter year-over-year. I am really pleased with our ability to reduce and maintain control over our cash burn in the fourth quarter. Expense reduction programs that were born from necessity due to the coronavirus, along with gradual gross margin progress, resulted in a 53% reduction in our net operating loss in Q4 compared to the same period in 2019 and a 58% improvement in our cash used in operations. The improvement in these 2 important financial metrics should be not just sustainable but can improve from here as our markets stabilize, health care utilization gets back on track and product revenues grow. I'm also pleased to tell you we have completed the X-Tack limited launch. I will give you more detail shortly, but I will tell you now, it went great. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Stefanie to cover the fourth quarter financial results in greater detail. Stef? Thanks, Stef. I want to update you on 2 important topics this afternoon: the X-Tack U.S. limited launch and the reimbursement effort underway to bring coding and coverage to our products. We completed the limited launch earlier this week, and the results were tremendous. During the limited launch, we completed 24 cases, consisting of 13 lower GI cases and 11 cases in the upper GI tract. These cases were performed by 10 doctors across 9 different accounts. The limited launch suggested a physician learning curve after only 1 device. Several of the limited launch cases have been done without our presence after that first use. It is proving to be a see one, do one, teach one kind of product. Our very first X-Tack case was to close a large dissection at the hepatic flexure of the colon of close to 6 centimeters in size and irregularly shaped. The dissection itself to remove the large flat polyp of this size was a significant and time-consuming procedure. Closing a dissection site of this size would likely have been an OverStitch case, except that the hepatic flexure, it would have been a big access challenge with OverStitch on a gastroscope. The physician used 4 X-Tack devices to close this particular defect site. Perhaps, we would have liked a little bit more of a conservative case right out of the gate as our procedure number one, but the challenging cases represent the big unmet need and the reason why we designed X-Tack to begin with. And the device worked great in this highly challenging clinical environment. Each case in the limited launch is its own story and represents a life-changing procedure for the patient. For those 24 limited launch cases completed, the closure sites range from a relatively standard 18-millimeter size all the way to 80 millimeters, which is getting to be a really large site.  During the limited launch, X-Tack has been used to close a large ESD site, all the way across the colon at the ileocecal valve close to the end of the ascending colon where the small intestine turns into the large intestine, a location where OverStitch could not reach. And the X-Tack was also used to successfully close large and irregularly shaped sites where through the scope clips, even in multiple numbers, could not span and would have been ineffective. Closure have been completed using 1 X-Tack device in the more straightforward cases, all the way up to 4 X-Tack devices in the larger and complex cases, such as the one at the ileocecal valve. The average number of X-Tack devices per case in the limited launch was 2. After each case, we asked the physician to rate the functionality and ease of use of the device across a number of performance attributes on a scale of 1 being poor and 5 being excellent, and the device has shown consistently high ratings across all performance measures, with an overall average rating of 4.7. With confirmation of X-Tack's stellar clinical performance and the closeout of our limited launch protocol, we have a very high degree of confidence as we direct our attention to scaling up our manufacturing capacity for the product.  The most important capacity enhancing step in front of our manufacturing team is to convert from prototype molds to production molds, and this conversion is on track. Also, the closeout of our limited launch with such high marks gives our sales team confidence as they pursue our highest-priority target accounts and get in front of customer new product evaluation committees. In summary, as we end the limited launch, we are exactly where we hope to be. And if anything, our expectations have been exceeded. We have confirmed device function across a broad diversity of cases and array of closure needs throughout the GI track. User ratings have been excellent. Feedback is that X-Tack is easy to learn and easy to use. We are moving into the next launch stage right on schedule with an acceleration of our X-Tack commercial programs. Yesterday, we went live with the X-Tack product website and began a campaign to harvest our medical education training records to introduce this new technology to physicians who have come through our medical education programs in the past. Right now, outstanding quotes in front of customers pending their new product committee approval aggregate to a high 6-figure dollar amount. Everything learned so far suggests that X-Tack has a real opportunity to significantly disrupt the GI closure market. Shifting to reimbursement. There are activities underway for all products. First, for OverStitch, this is where most of our management team's efforts are directed with specific focus on the ESG procedure and bariatric revisions. We are closing in on the time when we expect the MERIT investigators to publish their study results, which we then plan to use as the cornerstone data piece for our ESG reimbursement strategy. All indications remain that we will see the MERIT study data accepted for publication sometime before the middle point of 2021. We do not have access to this independent study's data, but we have high confidence that the study will achieve its primary outcome objectives based on more than 80 studies and articles published in peer-reviewed literature describing and analyzing the ESG procedure since 2015. This worldwide data has been remarkably consistent in reporting favorable efficacy and safety results. As MERIT data nears release, we have turned to other groundwork that is part of the ESG reimbursement plan. In the fourth quarter, we submitted applications to begin the process for both ICD-10 coding and HCPCS coding for all OverStitch applications, including the ESG procedure and for bariatric revisions. The reviews of these code applications are in process, and the earliest date for a decision on either code application is probably October. The CPT coding effort will become better known following the publication of MERIT data, but it would be our goal for ESG coding to be considered by the CPT panel hopefully before the end of the year. The MERIT data will also be of interest to the payer communities in the U.S. and several other key countries, and we intend to engage these communities in coverage and payment discussions with the primary endpoint results once they're published. The prize for expanding the market access for the ESG procedure is very meaningful. There were an estimated 350,000 bariatric procedures performed in our direct markets during 2019, while only 7,500 ESGs were performed, largely without coverage. Each 1% increase in ESG's market share that comes with coverage is an incremental $5.6 million of revenue at today's average selling prices. And of course, a 10% market share is therefore equivalent to $56 million of revenue. In addition to reimbursement, we have plans to expand the OverStitch labeling to include both the ESG procedure and bariatric revisions. The MERIT data, again, is very critical, along with other prospectively collected ESG and revision data for this label expansion effort. Label expansion adds value because it will allow us to improve our medical education content that we provide to physicians today and also improve patient awareness. Second, there appears to be some progress with respect to U.S. codings that could be beneficial to both Orbera and X-Tack. First, for Orbera. In the fourth quarter, ICD-10 codes for the endoscopic insertion and removal of devices were approved by CMS, which are applicable to Orbera. These became effective in October. And in the fourth quarter, we saw that an application for a CPT code for intragastric balloons was on the agenda for the CPT editorial panel meeting, which occurred earlier this month. Separately, we submitted for a HCPCS code for Orbera during the fourth quarter. And we continue to be in various society and regulator discussions for the consideration of Orbera as a treatment for pre-cirrhotic NASH patients with fibrosis ever since the publication of the Mayo Clinic study on this in early 2020. This data, along with previously published data outside the United States, in our opinion, shows that Orbera has a reasonable likelihood of both technical success and clinical success in providing a more effective NASH treatment than today's standard of care. If these discussions are successful, all these codings developments could be very meaningful for our U.S. Orbera product line. But the consideration of an IGB code wasn't the only CPT panel agenda item of interest to us. Also on this same agenda was consideration for a CPT code for endoscopic submucosal dissection or what is referred to as ESD. ESD is an endoluminal procedure for the en bloc resection of larger flat gastrointestinal tumors, especially colorectal tumors. The approval of this CPT code, along with the coverage and payments down the road, would expand the already attractive addressable market for X-Tack. The AMA's website indicates that the CPT panel results will be released by March 8. Lastly, our team also filed ICD-10 and HCPCS applications for X-Tack back in December upon its 510(k) clearance. For the past few years, we have made medical education the cornerstone of our OverStitch strategy. There were 2 important elements to this. First, because endoluminal suturing was so novel, it was very important to capture physician mind share through peer-reviewed publications that describe the clinical value that endoluminal suturing can deliver. And second, we needed world-class training capability to teach physicians the mechanics of using OverStitch, which can be technically challenging to get through a learning curve and get started with. Since we implemented this strategy in 2015, OverStitch revenue CAGR has been 38% up until the 2020 coronavirus disruption. In 2020, the literature side of the strategy, though, continued to deliver results, as 73 publications and medical journals mentioned OverStitch and 35 publications mentioned our intragastric balloons. 18 of these intragastric balloon publications referenced the potential as part of the treatment for NASH. The other element of our medical education strategy, which is positioned product training, did get disrupted by COVID. Physician society meetings went virtual, and travel and group gatherings were restricted. But nonetheless, at the beginning of the fourth quarter, we restarted the mobile lab in the United States and conducted hands-on training for 75 physicians in 14 different U.S. cities. We expect this effort will refill both our new account and expanding user pipelines for OverStitch in 2021 as well as support the launch of X-Tack. Before I open the call to questions, I want to say that we will not be providing 2021 guidance today. I think it's best for Apollo's next CEO to speak to that without me setting expectations for him, and I hope you will all understand that. I will say, however, that we are off to a good start in the first quarter and tracking to produce at least 10% sales growth over the first quarter of 2020, even before considering any X-Tack contribution. We have still been experiencing through the first 2 months of the first quarter some intermittent pockets of COVID weakness, which suggests that March results could surprise in either direction, but we are doing well so far in the first quarter. And demand from our international markets, particularly from distributor markets, is improving. And of course, the U.S. is continuing to progress very well. As I've said before, as long as elective procedures are allowed and health care delivery is normal, our business will do well. So after questions and answers, I'm going to have a couple of closing comments. But on that note, we'll now open the lines for questions. John, please proceed with questions. Thank you, Matt. Yes. Matt, unfortunately, I did mention that I don't feel like I should give 2021 guidance, and that would include ramp rates and the like. I just feel like that's better for the next CEO to come. But I can tell you that I feel like we have a really good level of activity going on right now. As I indicated, the -- those quotes that are in front of accounts where we're going through the new product committee process, sometimes called the VAC process, that is going well. And the limited launch results certainly give us a great deal of confidence as we pursue those opportunities. Yes. So our view, if you base it off the limited launch results, we are going -- we're using about 2 X-Tack devices per case. And those cases generally are at that 2 -- let's say, 2-centimeter size that we have indicated is really the ideal target for X-Tack or higher. . And so I think it will just depend a little bit upon each individual account and how often they are encountering those, but I can feel confident in saying that our view is that the frequency at which doctors are going to have those cases will be at a greater rate than OverStitch use within a relatively short period of time. Relatively short period being over the next, say, few years, couple of years. Yes. And just to remind you, Matt, I think you certainly you know this from our earlier conversations, we have, in some places, reimbursement today for ESG. And it's just not broad coverage. It's more individual accounts working with specific, let's call it, insurance providers, private payers, where they are getting reimbursed for OverStitch, the ones being used for ESG. And certainly, that's the case today for bariatric revisions. Bariatric revisions are nearly always paid for. It's an exceedingly rare situation today when we don't have a bariatric revision using OverStitch that is being just normally paid for. So what we're really looking at is trying to expand that and using the MERIT data to expand that and to really broaden this to being more of a national coverage and part of national coverage policies. That's probably still though going to involve coding and coverage and timing around all those things such that it's unlikely to affect us in 2021. Hopefully, there could even be some benefits in 2022. But the way that most of these coding processes lay out their calendars, it's probably more of a 2023 event in our future. Yes. We -- in our Investor Relations slide deck, which is on our website, and I don't have these numbers right in front of me right now. But on that -- in that deck, we have a number of demographic data points that talk about those top 3, if you will, priority areas that we have been pursuing. It talks about the population, for example, that is in our BMI range of 30 to 40, who also are going to be those NASH patients. And so I'd just refer you there. But the size of these markets are significant. I think you'll see that the number for NASH, for example, where the fibrosis levels are 2 or 3 and their BMI is over 30, but lower than 40, so it makes it consistent with Orbera label. That's roughly a 10 million U.S. population. If you go down to the -- to those that would be eligible for using Orbera, again, BMI 30 to 40 and the number of just total joint replacements done per year, that's another 300,000 procedures that are done for those patients that are within that range of BMI and so on and so on. So these are significant markets that can make a difference for our Orbera business here in the United States. Well, thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. This will be my last call as CEO of Apollo. Earlier this month, we announced the appointment of Chas McKhann as CEO effective on March 1. And this is a good time for transition as great things are on the horizon. Today, we sit with a high-growth product portfolio, and each of our products are directed at high-value, large addressable markets. As I reflect back about OverStitch, this was a product originally designed for NOTES, or Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery, which is a leading-edge and maybe you'd even say it's a bleeding-edge surgical concept. But no one is doing or looking to do oral appendectomies. 6 years ago, when we would engage physicians about OverStitch, their reactions would be, \"Well, gee, that's a cool technology. When will I ever use it?\" Since that time, we have answered that question. Today, OverStitch is emerging as the standard of care for bariatric provisions and for esophageal stent fixation in addition to various other core GI applications that call for full-thickness tissue approximation. Physicians see the enormous value potential of ESG for the obese as a primary obesity procedure. And in the months ahead, I expect us to hear more from physicians developing an OverStitch endoscopic antireflux procedure, which is today being called RAP, as a possible alternative to surgical fundoplication. We have taken down other OverStitch adoption barriers by building world-class medical education capabilities. We developed the Sx for those at locations or in markets who do not have access to a dual-channel scope. And now we are expanding the incredible versatility of suturing into the large lower GI market with X-Tack. Orbera, too, is under revival with a medical-use strategy that leverages its unique patient value proposition. Thank you to Matt Hewitt for that question of what those things look like today. And along the way, we have made some tough decisions to shed lower-performing products and programs to reach the point we are at today, a company with a clear identity. The future looks good, and we have specific plans for further improving the structural self-sufficiency of the business with very specific, well-conceived and executable gross margin improvement projects. We have dramatically reduced our cash burn, and we have probably the best ever balance sheet as a company. The business is certainly not on cruise control, and I would never say that it is, but we have a solid plan and the human and financial resources to execute it. So it's time to close the repositioning chapter and begin to write a great commercial execution chapter. I'll be supporting my transition and have every confidence in Chas, along with our executive team, to lead Apollo Endosurgery forward. Chas has an impressive track record, with a resume that includes successful commercial roles at Boston Scientific, Johnson & Johnson, Torax Medical and Intersect ENT. And lastly, to all the men and women of Apollo Endosurgery past and present over the past 6.5 years, thank you. We've come a long way, baby. Apollo Endosurgery has truly changed interventional gastrointestinal endoscopy as well as the treatment options for the many affected by the various metabolic diseases caused by obesity. And the company is poised to burn its mark even deeper. So should you have any questions or would like to arrange a call with us, please contact Matt Kreps at Darrow Associates. The company also plans to participate in several virtual investor conferences coming up ahead in the month of March. Please also contact Matt if you'd like to request a meeting as part of one of those events. Thank you, and have a good evening."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Boston Scientific Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode.  After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.  Please note, this event is being recorded.\nSusan Lisa: Thank you, Andrew. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q3 2020 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release, as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financials & Filings. The duration of this morning's call will be approximately an hour. Mike will focus his comments on Q3 performance, inclusive of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as future catalysts and the general outlook for our business. Dan will review the financials for the quarter, and then we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Ian Meredith and Dr. Ken Stein. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, operational revenue excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, and organic revenue further excludes the impact of certain acquisitions, including BTG through August 15, as there are no prior period related net sales, as well as the divestitures of the global embolic microspheres portfolio and the Intrauterine Health Franchise. On this call, all references to sales and revenue, unless otherwise specified, are organic. Finally, average daily sales, ADS, normalizes sales growth for a difference in selling days year-over-year. Of note, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate and other similar words. They include, among other things, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic upon the company's operations and financial results, statements about our growth and market share, new product approvals and launches, clinical trials, cost savings and growth opportunities, our cash flow and expected use, our financial performance, including sales, margins and earnings, as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Q filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them.\nMichael Mahoney: Thanks, Susie. And thank you to everyone for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we made significant progress in third quarter, with excellent commercial execution and strong clinical adoption across our category-leading portfolio, as we build new capabilities and fuel our new product launch cadence. We continue to invest in our promising future and are confident that this will enable us to continue to grow at the high end of our peer group, improve operating margins and deliver double-digit adjusted EPS growth and strong free cash flow for the long term. In the third quarter, operational sales declined 2.5%, and organic sales declined 5.7%, normalizing for currency and the divestiture of both our Intrauterine Health business and Legacy B's  business, as well as excluding the contribution of BTG through August 15. Importantly, note that the organic revenue result include a negative 230 basis point impact related to sales return reserves in the quarter as we strategically shifted to a consignment based model for our left atrial appendage closure franchise with the launch of our next-generation WATCHMAN FLX device in the US. I'll provide more detail on the strategy and the success of the WATCHMAN FLX launch in a bit. I now offer highlights of our performance of third quarter '20. Every region and every business segment improved sequentially versus second quarter, and many countries returned to year-over-year growth in third quarter. Regional performance improved significantly. It was very consistent around the globe. US sales declined 4%. Europe, Middle East, Africa also declined 3% and Asia Pac declined 4%. We delivered growth in China for the second consecutive quarter, plus 2% growth in the third quarter on an organic basis. This China growth includes a negative 770 basis point impact from sales return reserves for channel inventory adjustments in anticipation to becoming a national tender in drug-eluting stents in fourth quarter.  China has strong sales in Complex PCI, including Imaging, Rhythm management, Intervention, Structural Heart and urology public health, and our swift progress diversifying the portfolio into these high-growth markets means that DES will represent approximately 10% of our China revenue in 2020. We expect our China business to accelerate growth in the fourth quarter, and we are targeting double-digit growth in 2021, including the DES tender related impact. This regional sales performance was mirrored with a balanced and sharp recovery across our business units.\nDaniel Brennan: Thanks, Mike. Third quarter consolidated revenue of $2.659 billion, represents a reported revenue decline of 1.8% and reflecting $19 million tailwind from foreign exchange. On an operational basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, revenue declined 2.5% in the quarter. BTG sales contributed 370 basis points prior to becoming organic on August 15, partially offset by the divestitures of our legacy embolic beads portfolio and Intrauterine Health business. Excluding the net contribution of acquisitions and divestitures, organic revenue declined 5.7%, and includes a $63 million or 230 basis point headwind from the sales return reserve related to our conversion to a consignment inventory model for our WATCHMAN franchise, with the launch of our next-generation WATCHMAN FLX device here in the United States. These sales results represent strong sequential improvement over the second quarter as procedural volumes continue to trend upward through the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. A rebounding top line and continued P&L discipline contributed to our Q3 adjusted earnings per share of $0.37, along with a $0.06 tax benefit, which was partially offset by a negative $0.04 impact from the WATCHMAN consignment sales return reserve. Adjusted gross margin for the third quarter was 69.3%, in line with our expectations to approach 70% in the back half of the year, as we outlined on the Q2 call. The sequential improvement is driven by lower negative manufacturing variances, slightly offset by the impact of the transition to WATCHMAN consignment. As a reminder, Q2 production levels were below 75% of capacity resulting in material manufacturing variances that were expensed within the P&L in that quarter. In Q3, with production levels above 75% in the majority of our plants, unfavorable manufacturing variances deceased and were capitalized within inventory on the balance sheet and will be recognized over a 6 month period corresponding to our inventory turns. Looking forward, we continue to expect Q4 adjusted gross margin to be in line with Q3 approaching 70%. Third quarter adjusted operating margin was 23.4% or 25.1%, excluding a 170 basis point headwind related to the WATCHMAN consignment transition. This is slightly ahead of our expectations given the trajectory of our revenue recovery in the quarter and continued P&L discipline. We increased investment spending, while maintaining prudent adjusted SG&A and adjusted R&D rates of 35.9% and 9.5%, respectively. Q3 also had some favorability related to timing and investment spend will continue to increase throughout the fourth quarter. Based on these results, we expect Q4 adjusted operating margin to be similar to Q3, excluding the impact of WATCHMAN consignment in both quarters. On a GAAP basis, operating margin was negative 7.7%, and includes a $219 million intangible asset impairment, primarily related to Apama and a $260 million litigation-related expense. As Mike detailed, we've discontinued the development of the Apama RF balloon, and I'll provide an update on our legal reserve shortly. Moving below the line, our expectations for full year adjusted interest and other expense have not changed from our Q2 call to be slightly above the range of $400 million to $425 million provided at the beginning of the year. Our tax rate for the third quarter was 31.7% on a GAAP basis and minus 3.5% on an adjusted basis, which includes an $88 million non-cash benefit, driven by this quarter's completion of the IRS examination of our 2014 to 2016 tax years in a favorable position compared to our reserves. This resulted in a $0.06 benefit to adjusted earnings per share. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $870 million, and reported free cash flow was $595 million, driven by strong operating margins and improved working capital efficiency. As of September 30, 2020, we had cash on hand of $2 billion. Total liquidity, including available credit facilities of $4.8 billion and a prudent debt maturity profile with no near term maturities. During the quarter, we prepaid the remaining $250 million balance on our February 2021 term loan. This leaves us with no debt maturities until May of 2022. The capital expenditures for the third quarter were $49 million. We continue to expect full year 2020 capital expenditures of approximately $350 million as we focus on certain plant expansions and projects to meet capacity needs and drive value improvement programs. With respect to our legal reserves, we booked $260 million in Q3, primarily related to mesh, inclusive of a reserve related to onetime claims made by a coalition of state attorneys general. Year-to-date, we have made cash payments of $30 million into qualified settlement funds, leaving approximately $85 million remaining to fund outstanding individual plaintiffs claims. We ended Q3 with $1.445 billion of fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding and expect approximately 1.447 billion for the fourth quarter 2020 and 1.432 billion for the full year 2020. In closing, our businesses and pipeline remain very strong, and our long-term fundamentals have not changed, with targeted organic revenue growth at the high end of our peers, sustained adjusted operating margin expansion, double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth and strong free cash flow. Please check our investor relations website for Q3 2020 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more detailed Q3 results. And with that, I'll turn it back to Susie, who will moderate the Q&A.\nSusan Lisa: Thanks, Dan. Andrew, let's open it up to questions for the next 30 minutes or so. In order to enable us to take as many as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up. Andrew, please go ahead.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  Our first question comes from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDavid Lewis: Great. Well, good morning and thanks for taking the question. Just got one for Mike and then a follow-up related for Dan. So Mike, I just want to come back to this high-end device comment you made. So I just want to confirm that whatever the MedTech peers grow, let's say, that's 4% to 5%, you inspire to grow 3 points faster. And then, also for you, I think it's a concern in light of CRM and IC market dynamics or TAVR that the ability to do that, frankly, has changed. So clearly, people are focusing on the things that have gotten below plan. Maybe you could maybe focus on some of the pieces of the business or segments that are above plan that are giving you the confidence that, that algorithm of 3 points above 4% to 5% or whatever have - you have is still achievable? And then I have a follow-up for Dan.\nMichael Mahoney: Good morning, David. Thanks for the question. Yeah, we're very confident in our ability to continue to grow at the high end of our peer group. We've done so for a number of years and our product launch cadence as we look to round out \u201820 and 2021 are quite exciting. Now if you look across our businesses and our launch schedule, we've highlighted WATCHMAN FLX, and we laid out at TCT, why we believe the WATCHMAN FLX market is larger than originally anticipated. And based on the increase in utilization that we're seeing, we see that as a multibillion-dollar market. So I don't want to go across every business, but we have a very strong product launch cadence. We talked about in PI with both the Eluvia stent and the pending approval for Ranger. We're seeing excellent growth out of our Interventional Oncology business, led by BTG, which actually grew upper single digits in the quarter and really the strength of our MedSurg businesses. Our Endo business, with the launch of our single use scopes, the momentum of our urology business. And we have two big launches in neuromod in Europe in both SCS and DBS, where we continue to take share. So really across the portfolio, we have a rich bag of product launches. Clearly, we would have liked to have the ACURATE neo approval prior to 2024. And that's certainly something that we wish we could pull in, and we'll continue to try that based on our discussions with the FDA. But if you look at just the incremental tailwind of WATCHMAN growth and paclitaxel, we believe those two elements there neutralize the slight delay with ACURATE neo on its own. So we have a history of growing above market, and the product launch cadence we have is strong. And our VC portfolio is quite good. And the free cash flow and balance sheet to deploy against that is very strong.\nDavid Lewis: Okay. Very helpful, Mike. And then, Dan, just for you, I appreciate the confirmation of growing in fourth quarter. Should we assume that growth in the fourth quarter is kind of low single digit type growth? And then look, \u201821, I know we're not going to get a lot idea here, but everyone is very focused on \u201821 as a percent of 2019. Streets at double-digit growth for next year. I wonder if maybe you'd comment on kind of the reality of those numbers, but more specifically, any parameters you can offer us on \u201821 on the top, bottom line tax margins for consideration of our models as we head into next year? Thanks so much.\nDaniel Brennan: Sure, David. So relative to Q4, the commentary is just very simple. It's aimed to grow. So we haven't given specific guidance relative to a number, whether it be one number or another. So the commentary and our belief is that we're aiming to grow in the fourth quarter, obviously, with the COVID caveats that Mike mentioned. With respect to 2021, I probably can't give you a lot of detail on that. We're right in the middle of our annual operating plan process right now, except to say that, again, as I mentioned, closing out my prepared commentary that it's really the same goals we've always had, which is to grow at the high end of the peers to expand operating margin and to deliver double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth. So really no change there. We're working through the process, and the goal would be, when we get to the February call to give you a sense of where we are and let you know what we think 2021 might hold.\nOperator: The next question comes from Robert Hopkins of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nRobert Hopkins: Thanks and good morning. Can you hear me, okay?\nMichael Mahoney: Good morning, Bob.\nDaniel Brennan: Hear you fine, Bob.\nRobert Hopkins: Good morning, great. Thanks so much. So to start, I apologize for the short-term oriented question. But Mike, I was wondering if you could just comment on the degree to which the pretty significant global flare-up of COVID in the last few weeks has impacted the business. And therefore, how confident are you in that comment on fourth quarter that you offer at WATCHMAN?\nMichael Mahoney: Sure. So we - obviously, you've seen an uptick globally. Everyone reads the newspapers there. I would say the hospitals are doing an amazing job of managing COVID while still performing elective procedures. So you've seen that with the sequential growth that we've had in the third quarter. We're certainly mindful of the fourth quarter of potential interruptions there. So our goal is to aim to return and grow ex-WATCHMAN. But we're obviously watching COVID quite significant like everyone else's. And we continue to see month-over-month improvement in our trends, but we put a caveat there in the fourth quarter as we aim to, excluding WATCHMAN and obviously, if the COVID dramatically improves \u2013 increases, and there is more shutdowns and more pressures on the hospital system that, that could impact the fourth quarter. But so far, we've seen nice improvement sequentially month-over-month. Hospitals doing better job managing it, and patients need the care that products like Boston Scientific our peers provide. We're also obviously managing our spend, and you saw the strong improvement in our operating income margins in the third quarter and the drop-through in EPS. So we expect that trend to continue.\nRobert Hopkins: Okay. Great. And then just one product comment. Could you just remind me what you said on WATCHMAN in the quarter? I think you said \u2013 did you say it grew double-digits? Just curious, it sounds like you saw a very rapid recovery in WATCHMAN over the course of the quarter. Just wondering if we get any more specifics or details? Thank you.\nMichael Mahoney: Yes, it did grow double-digits in third quarter. And it's really \u2013 it's been just an excellent launch. The early results have been very good. And as I mentioned in the script, we aim with this consignment model to switch the majority \u2013 high majority of our customers over by year end and complete that by second quarter. And that consignment model shift, we think, is a smart move because it gets FLX in the hands of our operators, which they want, allows us to tie up longer term \u2013 highly committed share contracts at an appropriate price premium. So the launch is going extremely well, and it bounced back very quickly in third quarter, growing double-digits.\nRobert Hopkins: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nVijay Kumar: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Mike, maybe getting back to a bigger picture question on the algorithm here, double-digit earnings algorithm. One, perhaps, could you give us an update on BTG? I think the last update was 5 or 6 decretion  with synergies coming in better where we are in BTG? And when you look at that 2021, I guess, the double-digit EPS, is the right base 2019, I'm curious because the deals annualize here and it's included in the 2020 numbers and streets modeling close to 18%, 19% revenue growth for next year. It seems a little excess, but any comments, I think, would be helpful.\nDaniel Brennan: Sure. Vijay, this is Dan. I can start and Mike can add in certainly as well. Relative to BTG, I think we're potentially even more committed to the benefits of that deal now than we were when we did it. If you look at the growth, one of the highlights in the quarter, and Mike mentioned it, when you pro forma for the various pieces within interventional medicines, they were all in high single digits. And so that's obviously accretive to where we are, and that's in the middle of a global dynamic. So a lot of good hopes for that. Mike also mentioned on the BTG synergies that we had talked about $175 million in total synergies, well, now we're at $125 million, we believe, exiting 2020. We believe that we'll get that whole $175 million in total out of cost. So the revenue synergies that we had planned will actually be upside. So we look at BTG as a nice driver for us going forward. Relative to comps, I think, the most relevant comp is going to end up being 2019. I mean, 2020, we will compare to that, obviously, but it's a different year. I'm not going to comment on the specific numbers that are out there relative to your revenue growth for 2021, but I think when you look at it, it will be 2021 versus 2019, that will be the most relevant comparison, I think, we have.\nVijay Kumar: Got you. And then, maybe on structural hearts here. Mike, maybe just comment on Scope 2, does it matter? I mean, the stocks have reacted post-ECT, but it feels like with that neo2, it shouldn't matter. Perhaps could you talk about what structural thought should look like for Boston within Europe?\nMichael Mahoney: Sure. Dr. Meredith can make some additional comments. But we just \u2013 are launching scope - our neo2 platform right now. And so that, obviously, as you know, is our second-gen platform, as shown in our EU study that Ian or Dr. Meredith can further comment on. It\u2019s got improved PVL rates, very low pacemaker rates, very good hemodynamics. And it's our second-generation valve. And the enrollment in the U.S. is going quite well for that system. So we're quite bullish on ACURATE neo2 in Europe. And we're hoping as COVID, as we're hopefully in the second half here of COVID overall, that we\u2019ll continue to accelerate the trialing in the US for that platform. So we'll continue to reiterate that platform, and we're confident that the European team will deliver strong results in \u201821 with ACURATE neo2.\nIan Meredith: Yeah. Thanks, Mike, just to reinforce your comments. I think you heard the panel discussion, Vijay, at TCT and most of the physicians on the panel recognized that this is comparison of the first generation versus a third-generation product as a comparison for Scope 2. Most physicians who had significant experience with the ACURATE neo platform know how to use it appropriately. They recognize that ACURATE neo2 has a 60% larger skirt  and significantly improved PVL performance in independent core and adjudicated data sets. So I don't think it's going to influence scope, the use of ACURATE neo2.\nVijay Kumar: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just a follow-up on TAVR. Actually, a couple of TAVR questions, and I'll just leave it at that. Mike, at a high level, does it still make sense from an ROI perspective to develop two TAVR platforms? And then for you, Ian, I heard your comments to Vijay, regarding the commercial impact. But given the result of Scope 1 and 2, there seem to be some clinical risk with the U.S. pivotal trial. And I've looked at the primary safety and efficacy end points. Can you talk about your confidence in the neo2 U.S. pivotal trial being able to show non-inferiority between neo2 and SAPIEN 3 and Evolut PRO, given what we've seen with Scope 1 and 2? It doesn't look like a slam dunk, but I'd love to hear your thoughts. Thanks for taking the questions guys.\nMichael Mahoney: So perhaps I'll start with the second question there, Larry, about our confidence around the ACURATE neo2 platform. As we said before, the ACURATE neo2 is different to ACURATE neo1 with the larger good and significantly different PBL performance, as we saw from the CE Mark study. And so we believe that data will certainly play out in the \u2013 what we saw in the CE Mark study of ACURATE neo2 will play out in the US ACURATE neo2 IDE study. So we are working with the FDA now. As a consequence of the results of Scope 1 and Scope 2 to plot the path forward. We believe that we will require longer patient follow-up as part of that study, but we remain confident.\nLarry Biegelsen: Thank you, Mike.\nMichael Mahoney: In the first quarter on our product portfolio, we're always looking at across our portfolio where our investment spend makes the most sense, given the market opportunities. And we've obviously had the two valve strategy and we're seeing strong results in the sites that are using Lotus in the US, opening new sites has been a challenging exercise for us given the pandemic, but the sites that are using Lotus in the US are using it quite regularly. So we do believe that the two valve strategy makes sense, and we're excited about the ACURATE neo2 launch in Europe.\nLarry Biegelsen: Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Next question comes from Joanne Wuensch of Citibank. Please go ahead.\nJoanne Wuensch: Hi. Can you hear me, okay?\nMichael Mahoney: Yes, we hear you fine, Joanne.\nJoanne Wuensch: Excellent. Good morning. Two sets of questions. First one has to deal with some of your commentary for the fourth quarter. I'm curious, why operating margins would not improve in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter? And I want to make sure I can quantify what the WATCHMAN adjustment is in the fourth quarter because you say you'll have growth ex-WATCHMAN adjustment?\nMichael Mahoney: Sure. I can probably take that one, Joanne. Second part first. We expect it to be roughly similar. So you saw $63 million top line adjustment for the sales term reserve for the transition. And so as we look at it, obviously, it depends on how we \u2013 how that rolls out in the fourth quarter, but roughly similar, I would say. And then in terms of operating margin, the main driver of that is that Q3 was probably better than we had anticipated. So 23.4%, and that obviously included 170 basis point negative impact from the WATCHMAN sales term reserve. So we're kind of back into a pretty good range on that operating margin in Q3 and would believe that as we head into Q4, being in that range for the fourth quarter is a good place to be. From a gross margin standpoint, it's probably, again, largely similar to what you saw in the third quarter. We were 69.3% gross margin in the quarter. That included a 60 basis point negative impact from the WATCHMAN reserves. So we're in that 69% to 70% range. That's probably where gross margin would settle out in the fourth quarter. And the rest of the P&L should look pretty similar. So the adjusted operating margin for the fourth quarter, I think, is in a good spot, if it's similar to Q3.\nJoanne Wuensch: Okay. And then big picture, there is a perception, and this is largely after the TCT meeting that there's, how do I say this? Sort of an execution issue that may or may not be happening at Boston Scientific. How much of this is reality? And how much of it is just \u2013 you have so many products that are going through the pipeline, not everything is going to go exactly as planned.\nMichael Mahoney: Sure. Yes, I think just overall, if you look at the overall execution for a number of years in a row. We've accelerated organic sales growth each year. Last year, we put up about 7.3%, and we \u2013 obviously, with the impact of COVID in 2020, and we've seen strong improvements each quarter. And we're set up for a very strong 2021 based on that product launch schedule. There's no doubt that we were disappointed with the delay with ACURATE neo in the U.S. I think Dr. Meredith has laid out some of those reasons. And now we're excited about the neo2 launch, but we are disappointed in the Scope 1, Scope 2, which delayed the impact of ACURATE neo. But I think the benefit of Boston Scientific is we're highly diversified. You look at the growth of WATCHMAN. You look at the significant growth improvement across our businesses and really the diversification of our business. We've, for many years in a row, continue to reduce down the weighting of DES and CRM in our portfolio, given the growth trajectory of those markets and increase the weighting of our other businesses. And you look at the growth of our PI business with BTG, Endoscopy, URO and neuromod, and also promising growth that we see in EP. So we clearly wish the accurate scope results would have been different. But if you look at the overall execution of the company and the diversification that we've enabled as well as the strong free cash flow and ability to continue to improve margins, we're excited about \u201821 and beyond.\nJoanne Wuensch: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRobbie Marcus: Thanks for taking my question. Maybe Dan or Mike, I was wondering if you could speak to the current M&A environment. You've had a lot of investments on the private side, the balance sheet looks better than it's been in the past. How should we think about M&A? And if you could also touch on the reason for the discontinuation of Apama?\nDaniel Brennan: Sure. Again, I can start and Mike can comment as well. The M&A environment is a little bit challenging. I think you're probably referring to the IPO market. So within our VC portfolio, we've seen some of the companies go public and with some pretty lofty valuations. We weren't able to acquire those companies. Obviously, the upside on the other side of it is it's a nice financial gain, but that's not why we invest in these. We invested them obviously for the potential to acquire them. So it does seem to present a short-term challenge. We have over 40 companies in our VC portfolio. So there's a lot to choose from, and we'll see where that goes. And we have \u2013 as you know, we have the cash ready and available to be opportunistic relative to M&A in general. So still optimistic that we're going to get some good solid M&A done over time and be able to add to the top line story that we have.\nMichael Mahoney: Yeah. I think, the pipeline is certainly there of M&A opportunities, but we want to be disciplined in terms of the price that we'll pay and to drive shareholder value. So we'll continue to do that, and we certainly plan to do a few tuck-in acquisitions over the next 12 months. On Apama, essentially, we made the decision there on our portfolio, given the timeline delays that impacted the Apama program with COVID, really along with faster than anticipated new technology developments, namely IRE. We made the decision to discontinue the development and clinical investment in the Apama platform. So we're going to continue to invest significantly in our stable point, our force-sensing catheter. We're very bullish on our Apama \u2013 sorry, on our cryoballoon in Europe. That will be in full launch mode in the fourth quarter, which should provide some significant growth in 2021. And we're very encouraged about the investment that we have in Veripos  for IRE and that's an investment we made six years ago. And now we have an option to purchase that company. So as the market continues to shift, we believe we're in very strong position with those platforms for the future.\nRobbie Marcus: Thanks. And maybe a quick follow-up. As I listen to your commentary, it sounds like volume trends continue to improve. Are you able to speak to how the pipeline is filling up behind that? How patient visits and scans are filling up behind them? Is there a discrepancy by geography? Thanks.\nMichael Mahoney: Yeah. I had a few comments there in my script. It's a difficult one to call. I would say, overall, globally, it differs by region, by state. Some states in the U.S. have very normalized referral patterns and new patient funnels, some in the U.S., maybe down 10%. China is essentially back to normal, I would say. And Japan is quite strong. So it really varies around the world. I think if you were to net it all out, it's down. So we're not quite at normal new patient referral programs globally, and we're down. It's tough to call that, whether it's down 5% or down 10%, but it's down slightly. And it really varies by state and by country.\nRobbie Marcus: Appreciate it. Thanks.\nMichael Mahoney: Yeah.\nOperator: Next question comes from Rick Wise of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nRick Wise: Good morning, everybody. Maybe just a couple of product questions and just updates. Mike, you highlighted the early success of EXALT-D, 100 accounts opened. Is that where you wanted to be? Is that what you expected? Again, COVID aside and post-COVID, is that what you expected? Just maybe talk us through what's next. And I'll go ahead and ask the other two. Just curious, SENTINEL obviously had a terrific quarter. What's next there and talk about the trial enrollment? And maybe we haven't talked to the S-ICD program in a long time. Just wondering, it seems a little random, but just hearing some competitive noise. What's next from Boston Scientific on that side of the ledger? Thanks a lot.\nMichael Mahoney: Sure. So EXALT, SENTINEL and S-ICD.\nRick Wise: Yeah.\nMichael Mahoney: I get Dr. Meredith the pitch-in in the middle here. So I don't bore you too much here. But on EXALT, we clearly lost, call it, four to six months, with EXALT-D with that launch. But the really encouraging news in third quarter, we\u2019ve really picked up quite a bit of momentum. So our accounts, we've had more access to our customers in the U.S. and in Europe. And we've opened approximate 100 global accounts. And so, the team has really made strong progress, call it, the last 60 to 90 days in new account openings, training and really starting to increase utilization of that platform. And we also had a nice tailwind. Just I would say broadly, we had strong tailwinds and reimbursement in the third quarter. I won't get through off track. But with the new TPT with EXALT, it was a nice tailwind for that. So we looked at, for EXALT, to be a nice growth driver for us in 2021, we also have the surgical scope recently approved, and we're on track for a bronchoscope. So that's a multibillion-dollar opportunity. Just broadly with reimbursement, I'll just call this out because we picked on a few of the headwinds with Scope 1 and Scope 2. We had some great reimbursement news, not only with Eluvia, but with EXALT, also with in the quarter. So I think it really demonstrates the clinical efficacy of these platforms and the evidence to support the additional reimbursement. So I'll turn it over to Sentinel to Dr. Meredith and maybe S-ICD comments from Dr. Stein.\nIan Meredith: Thanks for the question, Rick. With respect to Sentinel, as you know, we were more than 750 accounts worldwide and 20% of in the sites that are actually using Sentinel, actually having a procedure. Shocking as you know is a debilitating and devastating condition that's underreported in TAVR. We believe that this is the right strategy, the protected TAVR trial that you mentioned is now more than ever a critical study to actually prove beyond a shadow of the doubt that protection is the right strategy for TAVR. We're very pleased with having designed that study prospectively. As you know, it's a 3,000 patient study looking at clinical stroke. We have 30 sites enrolled in that trial and continue to activate sites despite COVID. Obviously, there was some slowing of new site activation in the second and early in the third quarter, but we believe that, that will continue to ramp up. So we're looking forward to the results of that trial. It's a critical study in light of the data evidence. And almost everybody pointed to the protected TAVR trial as the single most important study in this field, and I'm glad that we actually planned this prospectively.\nMichael Mahoney: Dr. Stein, any comments on S-ICD?\nKenneth Stein: Yes. Thanks a lot, Mike. And Rick, I'll be quick here. I think we're very pleased with what we're seeing in terms of continued growth with the S-ICD. As I think you know, we recently reported out the results of 2 major clinical trials, pretoria untouched. Pretoria published in the medicine on touched was just published in circulation, which really convincingly show that the S-ICD is a remarkably safe straightforward procedure and ought to be considered as first-line therapy for the broad group of patients with a primary prevention indication who don't have indication for antibradycardia pacing or antitachycardia pacing. I think what comes next and what's, I think, very exciting from that standpoint is we push out our modular cardiac rhythm management concept with the development of our empower pacemaker, which is designed to be able to communicate with S-ICD and can deliver both backup brady pacing and antitachycardia pacing. And that is still on track to launch into clinical trials in the first half of next year.\nRick Wise: Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: Next question comes from Matt Miksic of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nMichael Mahoney: Good morning, Matt.\nMatt Miksic: Hi. Can you hear me okay?\nMichael Mahoney: Yeah. We hear you fine.\nMatt Miksic: Terrific. Thank you. So just a couple of questions, if I could, on ASCs and your exposure to the outpatient channel. You've talked that, if I remember correctly, kind of in the two-thirds range. If you could maybe comment on just how those are \u2013 how some of those businesses are performing related to the predominantly inpatient lines of business, maybe in terms of pre-COVID \u2013 percent of pre-COVID levels or any other metrics like that? And then I just had one quick follow-up on the same topic.\nMichael Mahoney: Sure. Yes, we provided, I think as our \u2013 maybe our first quarter earnings call, the mix by business roughly of our inpatient versus outpatient. And that's really been very consistent in terms of the recovery during COVID. So, across our businesses, not surprising where we had a stronger outpatient orientation. You've seen a bit stronger recovery there with PI and urology, endo and neuromod. You saw neuromod, it was down like, what, 70%, 80% or some crazy number in the second quarter and came back dramatically in third quarter because of patient demand in that setting. So really, uro, endo, PI, neuromod are more oriented to outpatient setting and CRM and interventional cardiology lean a little bit more towards inpatient. And the kind of pace recovery, if you look at the third quarter results are pretty consistent with that.\nMatt Miksic: That's super helpful. And then just if I could, I think we're all looking at the current trends and wondering over the next couple of months if we're going to be facing some version of what we saw in like July and August in some areas of the country. And in terms of hospitals getting, capacity getting tighter, some regions and states picking counties or ZIP codes and trying to steer folks away from booking inpatient cases or open cases or things like that. I'm wondering if you have any comments or experience from how that went in those areas in the \u2013 in Q3 because we did see a little bit of that and potentially what that might entail over the next several months, if we continue to see that happen as anecdotal as that might be?\nMichael Mahoney: Yeah. It's tough to call. I mean, we don't see a scenario where the results of 2Q are matched again. So we don't see that happening. And you saw, obviously, a strong improvement, 3% negative growth, neutralizing for the one-time versus third quarter. And as I mentioned before, we've seen sequential improvement really each quarter since the darkest time of COVID. And so the hospitals are doing a remarkably good job of managing COVID patients and electoral procedures. Hospitals have built additional capacity to manage COVID patients during the surge. They're better staffed for it. So I think it's going to be potentially a challenging winter, but the hospitals are much better prepared to manage it, I believe, than they were six to eight months ago. And they're also better able to manage electoral procedures in parallel. So with that, we commented before that the new patient referral pattern globally still isn't at 100% and so that likely still could be under some pressure as COVID continues to surge. But we'll continue to \u2013 we're having great progress in launching new products, getting products approved. We're managing our margins. We'll drive strong EPS, and we'll see how the COVID impact plays out. But we've seen sequential improvement monthly, and we continue to aim for growth in the fourth quarter despite the COVID challenges and excluding the WATCHMAN consignment.\nMatt Miksic: Thanks Mike. Appreciate that.\nMichael Mahoney: You bet.\nSusan Lisa: Last question, Andrew.\nOperator: Thank you. And that will come from Danielle Antalffy of SVB Leerink. Please go ahead.\nDanielle Antalffy: Hey, good morning everyone. Thank you so much for squeezing me in and congrats on a strong quarter. Mike, I have two product related questions. So, first on WATCHMAN, one of the things investors are paying attention to is a potential competitor coming to market. And I was hoping maybe you could outline what the mode from a competitive perspective are that you've built around the WATCHMAN business that should make us feel okay about the continued growth trajectory there? And I'll just ask my second now. On EXALT-D, given the financial constraints at hospitals, I'm just curious about how quickly that can be the meaningful revenue contributor that it probably ultimately will be, but hospitals have to work through their current financial duress. And those are my questions. Thanks so much.\nMichael Mahoney: Sure. Dr. Stein, do you want to speak to the WATCHMAN clinical capabilities?\nKenneth Stein: Yes. Thanks Mike. And Danielle, I think on WATCHMAN, first of all, we're very pleased with the response that we've seen and the clinical data we generated with the FLX device approved on the basis of a trial that didn't just meet its endpoints, but actually showed 100% successful seal at one year. And I think combined with the great clinical results and physician familiarity and ease of use with the FLX device, I think, it is very strong against any competition. We continue to push what is the most robust portfolio of clinical science on the safety and efficacy of the device, the ongoing option trial, which in spite of COVID has continued to enroll well, which extends the use of the device as a first line for patients following a fibrillation. And then as I think you know, we've recently announced the imminent launch of our CHAMPION trial, which is a head-to-head trial of the WATCHMAN device as first line therapy against novel or coagulants.\nMichael Mahoney: Yes. So, obviously, the clinical safety efficacy is the primary driver and that's why Dr. Stein commented first. And then on the business model that was obviously one of the reasons we switched to the consignment model was to continue to build a strong moat supported by our clinical and efficacy and also the easy to use and just the penetration that we see globally. And the consignment model changeover allows us to drive longer term high committed share contracts at the appropriate price uplift. So, we think that's a smart move for us. On EXALT-D, I mentioned before, with the breakthrough status, we did get the additional reimbursement in the outpatient setting, which is very, very helpful. And we believe with the -- in the inpatient setting and the outpatient setting, there's room in that DRG that makes sense for the EXALT-D platform. So, our Endoscopy team will continue to drive health care economic studies with EXALT-D. It's clear that physicians see the benefit of reducing the infection. And our team is gaining more and more capabilities in terms of how to drive utilization of EXALT-D as each month passes. So, we think this will be a nice growth driver, and we know it will be a nice growth driver for us in 2021.\nDanielle Antalffy: Thank you.\nMichael Mahoney: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Susan Lisa for any closing remarks.\nSusan Lisa: Thank you, Andrew, and thanks, everyone, for joining.

            "name": "Michael Mahoney",
            "content": "Thanks, Susie. And thank you to everyone for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we made significant progress in third quarter, with excellent commercial execution and strong clinical adoption across our category-leading portfolio, as we build new capabilities and fuel our new product launch cadence. We continue to invest in our promising future and are confident that this will enable us to continue to grow at the high end of our peer group, improve operating margins and deliver double-digit adjusted EPS growth and strong free cash flow for the long term. In the third quarter, operational sales declined 2.5%, and organic sales declined 5.7%, normalizing for currency and the divestiture of both our Intrauterine Health business and Legacy B's  business, as well as excluding the contribution of BTG through August 15. Importantly, note that the organic revenue result include a negative 230 basis point impact related to sales return reserves in the quarter as we strategically shifted to a consignment based model for our left atrial appendage closure franchise with the launch of our next-generation WATCHMAN FLX device in the US. I'll provide more detail on the strategy and the success of the WATCHMAN FLX launch in a bit. I now offer highlights of our performance of third quarter '20. Every region and every business segment improved sequentially versus second quarter, and many countries returned to year-over-year growth in third quarter. Regional performance improved significantly. It was very consistent around the globe. US sales declined 4%. Europe, Middle East, Africa also declined 3% and Asia Pac declined 4%. We delivered growth in China for the second consecutive quarter, plus 2% growth in the third quarter on an organic basis. This China growth includes a negative 770 basis point impact from sales return reserves for channel inventory adjustments in anticipation to becoming a national tender in drug-eluting stents in fourth quarter.  China has strong sales in Complex PCI, including Imaging, Rhythm management, Intervention, Structural Heart and urology public health, and our swift progress diversifying the portfolio into these high-growth markets means that DES will represent approximately 10% of our China revenue in 2020. We expect our China business to accelerate growth in the fourth quarter, and we are targeting double-digit growth in 2021, including the DES tender related impact. This regional sales performance was mirrored with a balanced and sharp recovery across our business units. Good morning, David. Thanks for the question. Yeah, we're very confident in our ability to continue to grow at the high end of our peer group. We've done so for a number of years and our product launch cadence as we look to round out \u201820 and 2021 are quite exciting. Now if you look across our businesses and our launch schedule, we've highlighted WATCHMAN FLX, and we laid out at TCT, why we believe the WATCHMAN FLX market is larger than originally anticipated. And based on the increase in utilization that we're seeing, we see that as a multibillion-dollar market. So I don't want to go across every business, but we have a very strong product launch cadence. We talked about in PI with both the Eluvia stent and the pending approval for Ranger. We're seeing excellent growth out of our Interventional Oncology business, led by BTG, which actually grew upper single digits in the quarter and really the strength of our MedSurg businesses. Our Endo business, with the launch of our single use scopes, the momentum of our urology business. And we have two big launches in neuromod in Europe in both SCS and DBS, where we continue to take share. So really across the portfolio, we have a rich bag of product launches. Clearly, we would have liked to have the ACURATE neo approval prior to 2024. And that's certainly something that we wish we could pull in, and we'll continue to try that based on our discussions with the FDA. But if you look at just the incremental tailwind of WATCHMAN growth and paclitaxel, we believe those two elements there neutralize the slight delay with ACURATE neo on its own. So we have a history of growing above market, and the product launch cadence we have is strong. And our VC portfolio is quite good. And the free cash flow and balance sheet to deploy against that is very strong. Good morning, Bob. Sure. So we - obviously, you've seen an uptick globally. Everyone reads the newspapers there. I would say the hospitals are doing an amazing job of managing COVID while still performing elective procedures. So you've seen that with the sequential growth that we've had in the third quarter. We're certainly mindful of the fourth quarter of potential interruptions there. So our goal is to aim to return and grow ex-WATCHMAN. But we're obviously watching COVID quite significant like everyone else's. And we continue to see month-over-month improvement in our trends, but we put a caveat there in the fourth quarter as we aim to, excluding WATCHMAN and obviously, if the COVID dramatically improves \u2013 increases, and there is more shutdowns and more pressures on the hospital system that, that could impact the fourth quarter. But so far, we've seen nice improvement sequentially month-over-month. Hospitals doing better job managing it, and patients need the care that products like Boston Scientific our peers provide. We're also obviously managing our spend, and you saw the strong improvement in our operating income margins in the third quarter and the drop-through in EPS. So we expect that trend to continue. Yes, it did grow double-digits in third quarter. And it's really \u2013 it's been just an excellent launch. The early results have been very good. And as I mentioned in the script, we aim with this consignment model to switch the majority \u2013 high majority of our customers over by year end and complete that by second quarter. And that consignment model shift, we think, is a smart move because it gets FLX in the hands of our operators, which they want, allows us to tie up longer term \u2013 highly committed share contracts at an appropriate price premium. So the launch is going extremely well, and it bounced back very quickly in third quarter, growing double-digits. Sure. Dr. Meredith can make some additional comments. But we just \u2013 are launching scope - our neo2 platform right now. And so that, obviously, as you know, is our second-gen platform, as shown in our EU study that Ian or Dr. Meredith can further comment on. It's got improved PVL rates, very low pacemaker rates, very good hemodynamics. And it's our second-generation valve. And the enrollment in the U.S. is going quite well for that system. So we're quite bullish on ACURATE neo2 in Europe. And we're hoping as COVID, as we're hopefully in the second half here of COVID overall, that we'll continue to accelerate the trialing in the US for that platform. So we'll continue to reiterate that platform, and we're confident that the European team will deliver strong results in \u201821 with ACURATE neo2. So perhaps I'll start with the second question there, Larry, about our confidence around the ACURATE neo2 platform. As we said before, the ACURATE neo2 is different to ACURATE neo1 with the larger good and significantly different PBL performance, as we saw from the CE Mark study. And so we believe that data will certainly play out in the \u2013 what we saw in the CE Mark study of ACURATE neo2 will play out in the US ACURATE neo2 IDE study. So we are working with the FDA now. As a consequence of the results of Scope 1 and Scope 2 to plot the path forward. We believe that we will require longer patient follow-up as part of that study, but we remain confident. In the first quarter on our product portfolio, we're always looking at across our portfolio where our investment spend makes the most sense, given the market opportunities. And we've obviously had the two valve strategy and we're seeing strong results in the sites that are using Lotus in the US, opening new sites has been a challenging exercise for us given the pandemic, but the sites that are using Lotus in the US are using it quite regularly. So we do believe that the two valve strategy makes sense, and we're excited about the ACURATE neo2 launch in Europe. Yes, we hear you fine, Joanne. Sure. I can probably take that one, Joanne. Second part first. We expect it to be roughly similar. So you saw $63 million top line adjustment for the sales term reserve for the transition. And so as we look at it, obviously, it depends on how we \u2013 how that rolls out in the fourth quarter, but roughly similar, I would say. And then in terms of operating margin, the main driver of that is that Q3 was probably better than we had anticipated. So 23.4%, and that obviously included 170 basis point negative impact from the WATCHMAN sales term reserve. So we're kind of back into a pretty good range on that operating margin in Q3 and would believe that as we head into Q4, being in that range for the fourth quarter is a good place to be. From a gross margin standpoint, it's probably, again, largely similar to what you saw in the third quarter. We were 69.3% gross margin in the quarter. That included a 60 basis point negative impact from the WATCHMAN reserves. So we're in that 69% to 70% range. That's probably where gross margin would settle out in the fourth quarter. And the rest of the P&L should look pretty similar. So the adjusted operating margin for the fourth quarter, I think, is in a good spot, if it's similar to Q3. Sure. Yes, I think just overall, if you look at the overall execution for a number of years in a row. We've accelerated organic sales growth each year. Last year, we put up about 7.3%, and we \u2013 obviously, with the impact of COVID in 2020, and we've seen strong improvements each quarter. And we're set up for a very strong 2021 based on that product launch schedule. There's no doubt that we were disappointed with the delay with ACURATE neo in the U.S. I think Dr. Meredith has laid out some of those reasons. And now we're excited about the neo2 launch, but we are disappointed in the Scope 1, Scope 2, which delayed the impact of ACURATE neo. But I think the benefit of Boston Scientific is we're highly diversified. You look at the growth of WATCHMAN. You look at the significant growth improvement across our businesses and really the diversification of our business. We've, for many years in a row, continue to reduce down the weighting of DES and CRM in our portfolio, given the growth trajectory of those markets and increase the weighting of our other businesses. And you look at the growth of our PI business with BTG, Endoscopy, URO and neuromod, and also promising growth that we see in EP. So we clearly wish the accurate scope results would have been different. But if you look at the overall execution of the company and the diversification that we've enabled as well as the strong free cash flow and ability to continue to improve margins, we're excited about \u201821 and beyond. Yeah. I think, the pipeline is certainly there of M&A opportunities, but we want to be disciplined in terms of the price that we'll pay and to drive shareholder value. So we'll continue to do that, and we certainly plan to do a few tuck-in acquisitions over the next 12 months. On Apama, essentially, we made the decision there on our portfolio, given the timeline delays that impacted the Apama program with COVID, really along with faster than anticipated new technology developments, namely IRE. We made the decision to discontinue the development and clinical investment in the Apama platform. So we're going to continue to invest significantly in our stable point, our force-sensing catheter. We're very bullish on our Apama \u2013 sorry, on our cryoballoon in Europe. That will be in full launch mode in the fourth quarter, which should provide some significant growth in 2021. And we're very encouraged about the investment that we have in Veripos  for IRE and that's an investment we made six years ago. And now we have an option to purchase that company. So as the market continues to shift, we believe we're in very strong position with those platforms for the future. Yeah. I had a few comments there in my script. It's a difficult one to call. I would say, overall, globally, it differs by region, by state. Some states in the U.S. have very normalized referral patterns and new patient funnels, some in the U.S., maybe down 10%. China is essentially back to normal, I would say. And Japan is quite strong. So it really varies around the world. I think if you were to net it all out, it's down. So we're not quite at normal new patient referral programs globally, and we're down. It's tough to call that, whether it's down 5% or down 10%, but it's down slightly. And it really varies by state and by country. Yeah. Sure. So EXALT, SENTINEL and S-ICD. I get Dr. Meredith the pitch-in in the middle here. So I don't bore you too much here. But on EXALT, we clearly lost, call it, four to six months, with EXALT-D with that launch. But the really encouraging news in third quarter, we've really picked up quite a bit of momentum. So our accounts, we've had more access to our customers in the U.S. and in Europe. And we've opened approximate 100 global accounts. And so, the team has really made strong progress, call it, the last 60 to 90 days in new account openings, training and really starting to increase utilization of that platform. And we also had a nice tailwind. Just I would say broadly, we had strong tailwinds and reimbursement in the third quarter. I won't get through off track. But with the new TPT with EXALT, it was a nice tailwind for that. So we looked at, for EXALT, to be a nice growth driver for us in 2021, we also have the surgical scope recently approved, and we're on track for a bronchoscope. So that's a multibillion-dollar opportunity. Just broadly with reimbursement, I'll just call this out because we picked on a few of the headwinds with Scope 1 and Scope 2. We had some great reimbursement news, not only with Eluvia, but with EXALT, also with in the quarter. So I think it really demonstrates the clinical efficacy of these platforms and the evidence to support the additional reimbursement. So I'll turn it over to Sentinel to Dr. Meredith and maybe S-ICD comments from Dr. Stein. Dr. Stein, any comments on S-ICD? Good morning, Matt. Yeah. We hear you fine. Sure. Yes, we provided, I think as our \u2013 maybe our first quarter earnings call, the mix by business roughly of our inpatient versus outpatient. And that's really been very consistent in terms of the recovery during COVID. So, across our businesses, not surprising where we had a stronger outpatient orientation. You've seen a bit stronger recovery there with PI and urology, endo and neuromod. You saw neuromod, it was down like, what, 70%, 80% or some crazy number in the second quarter and came back dramatically in third quarter because of patient demand in that setting. So really, uro, endo, PI, neuromod are more oriented to outpatient setting and CRM and interventional cardiology lean a little bit more towards inpatient. And the kind of pace recovery, if you look at the third quarter results are pretty consistent with that. Yeah. It's tough to call. I mean, we don't see a scenario where the results of 2Q are matched again. So we don't see that happening. And you saw, obviously, a strong improvement, 3% negative growth, neutralizing for the one-time versus third quarter. And as I mentioned before, we've seen sequential improvement really each quarter since the darkest time of COVID. And so the hospitals are doing a remarkably good job of managing COVID patients and electoral procedures. Hospitals have built additional capacity to manage COVID patients during the surge. They're better staffed for it. So I think it's going to be potentially a challenging winter, but the hospitals are much better prepared to manage it, I believe, than they were six to eight months ago. And they're also better able to manage electoral procedures in parallel. So with that, we commented before that the new patient referral pattern globally still isn't at 100% and so that likely still could be under some pressure as COVID continues to surge. But we'll continue to \u2013 we're having great progress in launching new products, getting products approved. We're managing our margins. We'll drive strong EPS, and we'll see how the COVID impact plays out. But we've seen sequential improvement monthly, and we continue to aim for growth in the fourth quarter despite the COVID challenges and excluding the WATCHMAN consignment. You bet. Sure. Dr. Stein, do you want to speak to the WATCHMAN clinical capabilities? Yes. So, obviously, the clinical safety efficacy is the primary driver and that's why Dr. Stein commented first. And then on the business model that was obviously one of the reasons we switched to the consignment model was to continue to build a strong moat supported by our clinical and efficacy and also the easy to use and just the penetration that we see globally. And the consignment model changeover allows us to drive longer term high committed share contracts at the appropriate price uplift. So, we think that's a smart move for us. On EXALT-D, I mentioned before, with the breakthrough status, we did get the additional reimbursement in the outpatient setting, which is very, very helpful. And we believe with the -- in the inpatient setting and the outpatient setting, there's room in that DRG that makes sense for the EXALT-D platform. So, our Endoscopy team will continue to drive health care economic studies with EXALT-D. It's clear that physicians see the benefit of reducing the infection. And our team is gaining more and more capabilities in terms of how to drive utilization of EXALT-D as each month passes. So, we think this will be a nice growth driver, and we know it will be a nice growth driver for us in 2021. Thank you."

            "name": "Ian Meredith",
            "content": "Yeah. Thanks, Mike, just to reinforce your comments. I think you heard the panel discussion, Vijay, at TCT and most of the physicians on the panel recognized that this is comparison of the first generation versus a third-generation product as a comparison for Scope 2. Most physicians who had significant experience with the ACURATE neo platform know how to use it appropriately. They recognize that ACURATE neo2 has a 60% larger skirt  and significantly improved PVL performance in independent core and adjudicated data sets. So I don't think it's going to influence scope, the use of ACURATE neo2. Thanks for the question, Rick. With respect to Sentinel, as you know, we were more than 750 accounts worldwide and 20% of in the sites that are actually using Sentinel, actually having a procedure. Shocking as you know is a debilitating and devastating condition that's underreported in TAVR. We believe that this is the right strategy, the protected TAVR trial that you mentioned is now more than ever a critical study to actually prove beyond a shadow of the doubt that protection is the right strategy for TAVR. We're very pleased with having designed that study prospectively. As you know, it's a 3,000 patient study looking at clinical stroke. We have 30 sites enrolled in that trial and continue to activate sites despite COVID. Obviously, there was some slowing of new site activation in the second and early in the third quarter, but we believe that, that will continue to ramp up. So we're looking forward to the results of that trial. It's a critical study in light of the data evidence. And almost everybody pointed to the protected TAVR trial as the single most important study in this field, and I'm glad that we actually planned this prospectively."

            "name": "Kenneth Stein",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks a lot, Mike. And Rick, I'll be quick here. I think we're very pleased with what we're seeing in terms of continued growth with the S-ICD. As I think you know, we recently reported out the results of 2 major clinical trials, pretoria untouched. Pretoria published in the medicine on touched was just published in circulation, which really convincingly show that the S-ICD is a remarkably safe straightforward procedure and ought to be considered as first-line therapy for the broad group of patients with a primary prevention indication who don't have indication for antibradycardia pacing or antitachycardia pacing. I think what comes next and what's, I think, very exciting from that standpoint is we push out our modular cardiac rhythm management concept with the development of our empower pacemaker, which is designed to be able to communicate with S-ICD and can deliver both backup brady pacing and antitachycardia pacing. And that is still on track to launch into clinical trials in the first half of next year. Yes. Thanks Mike. And Danielle, I think on WATCHMAN, first of all, we're very pleased with the response that we've seen and the clinical data we generated with the FLX device approved on the basis of a trial that didn't just meet its endpoints, but actually showed 100% successful seal at one year. And I think combined with the great clinical results and physician familiarity and ease of use with the FLX device, I think, it is very strong against any competition. We continue to push what is the most robust portfolio of clinical science on the safety and efficacy of the device, the ongoing option trial, which in spite of COVID has continued to enroll well, which extends the use of the device as a first line for patients following a fibrillation. And then as I think you know, we've recently announced the imminent launch of our CHAMPION trial, which is a head-to-head trial of the WATCHMAN device as first line therapy against novel or coagulants."

            "name": "Daniel Brennan",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Third quarter consolidated revenue of $2.659 billion, represents a reported revenue decline of 1.8% and reflecting $19 million tailwind from foreign exchange. On an operational basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, revenue declined 2.5% in the quarter. BTG sales contributed 370 basis points prior to becoming organic on August 15, partially offset by the divestitures of our legacy embolic beads portfolio and Intrauterine Health business. Excluding the net contribution of acquisitions and divestitures, organic revenue declined 5.7%, and includes a $63 million or 230 basis point headwind from the sales return reserve related to our conversion to a consignment inventory model for our WATCHMAN franchise, with the launch of our next-generation WATCHMAN FLX device here in the United States. These sales results represent strong sequential improvement over the second quarter as procedural volumes continue to trend upward through the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. A rebounding top line and continued P&L discipline contributed to our Q3 adjusted earnings per share of $0.37, along with a $0.06 tax benefit, which was partially offset by a negative $0.04 impact from the WATCHMAN consignment sales return reserve. Adjusted gross margin for the third quarter was 69.3%, in line with our expectations to approach 70% in the back half of the year, as we outlined on the Q2 call. The sequential improvement is driven by lower negative manufacturing variances, slightly offset by the impact of the transition to WATCHMAN consignment. As a reminder, Q2 production levels were below 75% of capacity resulting in material manufacturing variances that were expensed within the P&L in that quarter. In Q3, with production levels above 75% in the majority of our plants, unfavorable manufacturing variances deceased and were capitalized within inventory on the balance sheet and will be recognized over a 6 month period corresponding to our inventory turns. Looking forward, we continue to expect Q4 adjusted gross margin to be in line with Q3 approaching 70%. Third quarter adjusted operating margin was 23.4% or 25.1%, excluding a 170 basis point headwind related to the WATCHMAN consignment transition. This is slightly ahead of our expectations given the trajectory of our revenue recovery in the quarter and continued P&L discipline. We increased investment spending, while maintaining prudent adjusted SG&A and adjusted R&D rates of 35.9% and 9.5%, respectively. Q3 also had some favorability related to timing and investment spend will continue to increase throughout the fourth quarter. Based on these results, we expect Q4 adjusted operating margin to be similar to Q3, excluding the impact of WATCHMAN consignment in both quarters. On a GAAP basis, operating margin was negative 7.7%, and includes a $219 million intangible asset impairment, primarily related to Apama and a $260 million litigation-related expense. As Mike detailed, we've discontinued the development of the Apama RF balloon, and I'll provide an update on our legal reserve shortly. Moving below the line, our expectations for full year adjusted interest and other expense have not changed from our Q2 call to be slightly above the range of $400 million to $425 million provided at the beginning of the year. Our tax rate for the third quarter was 31.7% on a GAAP basis and minus 3.5% on an adjusted basis, which includes an $88 million non-cash benefit, driven by this quarter's completion of the IRS examination of our 2014 to 2016 tax years in a favorable position compared to our reserves. This resulted in a $0.06 benefit to adjusted earnings per share. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $870 million, and reported free cash flow was $595 million, driven by strong operating margins and improved working capital efficiency. As of September 30, 2020, we had cash on hand of $2 billion. Total liquidity, including available credit facilities of $4.8 billion and a prudent debt maturity profile with no near term maturities. During the quarter, we prepaid the remaining $250 million balance on our February 2021 term loan. This leaves us with no debt maturities until May of 2022. The capital expenditures for the third quarter were $49 million. We continue to expect full year 2020 capital expenditures of approximately $350 million as we focus on certain plant expansions and projects to meet capacity needs and drive value improvement programs. With respect to our legal reserves, we booked $260 million in Q3, primarily related to mesh, inclusive of a reserve related to onetime claims made by a coalition of state attorneys general. Year-to-date, we have made cash payments of $30 million into qualified settlement funds, leaving approximately $85 million remaining to fund outstanding individual plaintiffs claims. We ended Q3 with $1.445 billion of fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding and expect approximately 1.447 billion for the fourth quarter 2020 and 1.432 billion for the full year 2020. In closing, our businesses and pipeline remain very strong, and our long-term fundamentals have not changed, with targeted organic revenue growth at the high end of our peers, sustained adjusted operating margin expansion, double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth and strong free cash flow. Please check our investor relations website for Q3 2020 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more detailed Q3 results. And with that, I'll turn it back to Susie, who will moderate the Q&A. Sure, David. So relative to Q4, the commentary is just very simple. It's aimed to grow. So we haven't given specific guidance relative to a number, whether it be one number or another. So the commentary and our belief is that we're aiming to grow in the fourth quarter, obviously, with the COVID caveats that Mike mentioned. With respect to 2021, I probably can't give you a lot of detail on that. We're right in the middle of our annual operating plan process right now, except to say that, again, as I mentioned, closing out my prepared commentary that it's really the same goals we've always had, which is to grow at the high end of the peers to expand operating margin and to deliver double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth. So really no change there. We're working through the process, and the goal would be, when we get to the February call to give you a sense of where we are and let you know what we think 2021 might hold. Hear you fine, Bob. Sure. Vijay, this is Dan. I can start and Mike can add in certainly as well. Relative to BTG, I think we're potentially even more committed to the benefits of that deal now than we were when we did it. If you look at the growth, one of the highlights in the quarter, and Mike mentioned it, when you pro forma for the various pieces within interventional medicines, they were all in high single digits. And so that's obviously accretive to where we are, and that's in the middle of a global dynamic. So a lot of good hopes for that. Mike also mentioned on the BTG synergies that we had talked about $175 million in total synergies, well, now we're at $125 million, we believe, exiting 2020. We believe that we'll get that whole $175 million in total out of cost. So the revenue synergies that we had planned will actually be upside. So we look at BTG as a nice driver for us going forward. Relative to comps, I think, the most relevant comp is going to end up being 2019. I mean, 2020, we will compare to that, obviously, but it's a different year. I'm not going to comment on the specific numbers that are out there relative to your revenue growth for 2021, but I think when you look at it, it will be 2021 versus 2019, that will be the most relevant comparison, I think, we have. Sure. Again, I can start and Mike can comment as well. The M&A environment is a little bit challenging. I think you're probably referring to the IPO market. So within our VC portfolio, we've seen some of the companies go public and with some pretty lofty valuations. We weren't able to acquire those companies. Obviously, the upside on the other side of it is it's a nice financial gain, but that's not why we invest in these. We invested them obviously for the potential to acquire them. So it does seem to present a short-term challenge. We have over 40 companies in our VC portfolio. So there's a lot to choose from, and we'll see where that goes. And we have \u2013 as you know, we have the cash ready and available to be opportunistic relative to M&A in general. So still optimistic that we're going to get some good solid M&A done over time and be able to add to the top line story that we have."

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. I'd like to remind you that this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Matt Kreps, Managing Director at Darrow Associates Investor Relations. Mr. Kreps, you may begin.\nMatt Kreps: Thank you, Taren, and thanks, everyone, for participating in today's call to discuss Apollo's second quarter 2020 financial and operating results. Joining me on the call today are Todd Newton, Chief Executive Officer; and Stefanie Cavanaugh, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that comments made by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, including Apollo's financial outlook and Apollo's plans and timing for product development and sales. In addition, there is uncertainty about the spread of the COVID-19 virus, and the ultimate impact it may have on our operations, the demand for our products, global supply chains and economic activity in general. These forward-looking statements involve material risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of risk factors, I encourage you to review the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2019, as well as our most recent Form 10-Q filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The content of this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, August 4, 2020. Except as required by law, Apollo undertakes no obligation to revise or update any statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call. During this call, we will interchangeably use the term ESS for OverStitch and the term IGB for Orbera and vice versa. And with that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Todd.\nTodd Newton: Thank you, Matt. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call to discuss our second quarter 2020 results. I hope all of you joining us today and your families are remaining safe and healthy. On July 20, we preannounced our second quarter revenue and highlights. And in just a moment, Stefanie Cavanaugh, our CFO, will take you through the details of the second quarter. Before she does, I will open with four key points that best describe for investors, the state of the company here at the midway point of 2020. One, the immediate liquidity preservation actions we took at the start of the COVID disruption were successful. These decisions were hard to make and hard to implement because of the impact on our team. But we knew that the actions were necessary to preserve the interest of our shareholders, and the Board of Directors fully supported management's plans. Two, we have made sacrifices to reduce spend, but we have continued to pursue shareholder value creation by investing in our most important development programs such as the X-Tack program. This took tremendous teamwork and adaptation due to stay-at-home directives and travel restrictions, but our team persevered. And as announced on July 7, the X-Tack 510k application was submitted to the FDA and now in the regulatory review process. Three, our business is coming back. The COVID pandemic had an immediate and significant impact on all health care procedures, and, of course, it impacted our sales in the second quarter. But since March and April initial shutdown of elective procedures, we have been on a positive recovery path. In June, U.S. product sales were close to 90% of June sales in 2019. Our recovery trends outside the United States are also encouraging, but tracking slower in June than the U.S. pace. Four, our liquidity has been shored up. While COVID-related market risk continues to cloud the immediate future with uncertainty, our recently completed equity financing and simultaneous credit amendment provides us the capital to accelerate our business recovery from this period of COVID market disruption and fund through the X-Tack launch. I will pause with that and turn the call over to Stephanie now to cover the second quarter financial results in greater detail. Stef?\nStefanie Cavanaugh: Thank you, Todd, and good afternoon, everyone. As addressed in our press release from earlier today and the 10-Q filing, the dominant theme in the second quarter has been the COVID-19 disruption to health care resources and elective or deferrable procedure volumes worldwide, including procedures that use our products. As a result, our revenue decreased 60% in the second quarter of 2020 from the second quarter of 2019. By geography. U.S. endoscopy sales declined 40%, while OUS endoscopy sales declined close to 68%. The difference in geographic decline is that the U.S. procedure volumes and health care activity appears to be recovering at a quicker rate, and the OUS decline includes our distributor channel, which was down by 76% compared to the second quarter of 2019. Both ESS and IGB worldwide sales were affected by COVID-19. As a result, total endoscopy product sales were $5.4 million, which is a 56% reduction. Foreign currency movements in the quarter did not materially affect revenue trends. The proportion of the ESS product sales to total endoscopy product sales were 67% in the second quarter of 2020, which is roughly equivalent to its share of sales back in the second quarter of 2019. Total revenues in the second quarter of last year also included $1.9 million in transition service revenues related to our former surgical product line that we sold in December of 2018, while transition services were only $200,000 in the second quarter of this year. We expect to be completely free of any remaining service obligations by the end of 2020. Gross margin for the second quarter was 43% compared with 50% for the second quarter of 2019. The liquidity preservation program we implemented at the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a series of postponements and cancellations of inventory purchases. And we also reduced our production plan to align our inventory with the expected decline in product demand. These efforts idled our production facilities for a large portion of the second quarter and resulted in a direct charge of $0.5 million to cost of sales in the period. Without this charge for unabsorbed overhead in the second quarter, our gross margin would have been comparable to the second quarter of last year and more consistent with our pre-COVID gross margin percentage expectations. Total operating expenses were $6.7 million or more than 50% reduced compared to the second quarter of 2019 due to cost savings initiatives the management team implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As we have discussed, we undertook a number of aggressive actions at the beginning of the pandemic to preserve cash. Our goal was to complete the second quarter with the same net cash use we expected before the COVID crisis, and we met this goal. We will continue to closely manage cash during the remainder of the COVID-19 disruption to maintain a balance between our cash commitments and business improvements. Descriptions of these cost savings initiatives were detailed in our past shareholder periodic reports on Form 10-K for 2019 and 10-Q for the first quarter of 2020 and the Form 8-K dated April 20. Our operating loss in the second quarter of 2020 decreased 40% to $4.3 million from $7.2 million in the second quarter of 2019. Similarly, our net loss for the second quarter of 2020 improved to $6.3 million compared to $8.8 million for the second quarter of 2019, an improvement of 29%. Cash at the end of the second quarter was $19.7 million, and we were in compliance with our credit agreement. Subsequent to quarter end, on July 21, we completed the transaction to sell common stock and prefunded warrants for total gross proceeds of $25 million. Concurrently, we modified our existing loan agreement to waive any minimum revenue covenant requirement for the remainder of 2020 and decreased our minimum liquidity requirement that was set to increase to $20 million this quarter, down to $12.5 million. The combination of these two transactions increased our liquidity by $32.5 million and greatly reduces our COVID-19 near-term market risk. The length of the runway from these transactions somewhat depends on the pace at which our business continues to improve from COVID-19. But in any event, we expect, as of today, that our liquidity will be sufficient to get us past this year's 2020 disruption through the readout of the MERIT trial in 2021 and fund the X-Tack launch in 2021 as well. I will now turn it back to Todd.\nTodd Newton: Thank you, Stefanie. The first half of this year has been an unprecedented, unpredictable and difficult period for everyone. But Apollo Endosurgery has tremendous opportunities in front of us, and these opportunities are the management team's focus. The equity raise that we just completed, which was entirely funded by existing shareholders, is a testament to the support and belief of our current shareholder base in these opportunities. And I'll highlight three of these opportunities today. First, core GI use has been an important part of our OverStitch growth story, particularly in the United States. We've spoken for a while now of the goal to bring the benefits of flexible endoscopic suturing to core GI needs in the lower GI track, especially the colon. And this is what X-Tack is designed for. During our development labs, doctor feedback has been very positive. The feature that stands out is it's through the scope delivery designed to work with any 2.8 millimeter or larger working channel, which includes any of the leading gastroscopes or colonoscopes on the market. Advanced endoscopists, like those who use OverStitch today will find it distinctive with broad case application. Every endoscopist should find it easier to pick up and use and economical. It is specifically designed to easily and effectively close larger or irregularly shaped defects, which would otherwise be very challenging for the endoscopist to address with the existing closure devices in the market. X-Tack should also be a very good fit with our sales organization. Our top 100 OverStitch accounts in the United States where we generated 80% of our U.S. OverStitch sales last year, and we think there will be strong core GI demand for X-Tack at more than 75% of these same top 100 accounts. The range of use for X-Tack runs from being a rescue tool for acute perforations on one end of the spectrum to the prophylactic closure following a mid to large-sized polyp removal for patients at higher risk of delayed bleeding because of either polyp size, location or the need to use anti-thrombotic medications being at the other end of the spectrum and many uses in between. X-Tack will materially expand our addressable market in core GI. With more than 20 million colonoscopies performed each year in the United States, X-Tack moves us into a large and important market where our existing customers have an existing unmet need that X-Tack will address. If typical 510k processing time is a guide, we believe that X-Tack could be cleared by the end of this year. Second, we have substantial bariatric growth potential still ahead. The bariatric procedure market is a roughly 200,000 procedure per year market in the United States alone and the endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty, or ESG procedure, that is enabled by the full-thickness suturing capabilities of OverStitch, has a very attractive value proposition for patients, physicians and the health care system at large due to its effectiveness, low adverse event rate and ease to revise when revision is needed. While bariatrics have been an important part of our OverStitch past growth as has core GI, we have yet to tap the potential of ESG. The ESG procedure continues to build momentum worldwide and we estimate that there were probably somewhere around 5,000 ESG procedures performed worldwide last year. But data generation is required to break into a bigger share of the bariatric market or to grow the market. And the MERIT trial, which we've spoken about many times before, is intended to provide this data. As a reminder, MERIT is a randomized prospective multicenter trial being conducted at various sites in the United States to study the effectiveness and safety of the ESG procedure and is a key piece of our reimbursement strategy for the ESG procedure and label expansion for OverStitch. We remain very confident that the MERIT study will achieve its goals. And the reason for our optimism is simple. ESG has already been studied and reported on multiple times by multiple centers with highly consistent results across the globe. In 2019 there were there were three meta-analysis published, the pooled the results of over 1,700 patient experiences. Some of the MERIT site activities experienced some COVID-19-related delays. But as of last week, less than 10 crossover procedures remain to be performed. The PIs anticipate the primary MERIT data readout by the middle of 2021. And with reimbursement, we believe the ESG procedure will be disruptive to today's bariatric marketplace. Third, expanding physician access to our products remains a priority for us. COVID-19 has disruptive travel and many of the planned in-person physician meetings we have historically leveraged to address medical education demand. However, there remains a strong physician interest to learn more about OverStitch, and we have found alternative ways to address this interest. In the second quarter, we held two international webinars on the benefits of endoluminal suturing. The first webinar focused on the benefits of endoluminal suturing as part of the core GI basket of procedures and was attended by 300 persons. The second discussed endoluminal bariatric suturing applications, and that was attended by almost 500 participants. At the end of July, we also hosted two didactic training sessions here in the United States. Again, one for bariatric and one on core GI, designed as precursors to hands on training activity. We had more than 80 registrants for each of these classes. And subsequently conducted our first in-person lab training session since the beginning of COVID just this past Friday to test how we might reopen the hands-on aspects of our education programs. As normalcy returns, the level of engagement we have seen on our virtual platforms makes us feel confident that new user interest will be as high as we were experiencing pre COVID. Expanding physician interest to our products goes beyond medical education note. In 2019, we launched the SX OverStitch device as part of the strategy to avail our suturing technology to those physicians or account locations that did not have access to a dual-channel endoscope. Since that launch, about a third of all new OverStitch accounts globally are SX users. And by the end of this year, we will be making minor modifications to further improve the user experience with SX. In addition, during the second quarter of this year and despite COVID, our regulatory team succeeded in securing market approvals or clearances for one or more of our endoscopic products in seven countries. These new markets will be served by either new or existing third-party distributors. Regulatory efforts are ongoing inside of Apollo to further expand the availability of our products to new markets. Indeed, we have multiple growth drivers ahead for our business following COVID-19 recovery. I want to say a couple of words as well about our gross margin improvement programs. These remain important, but had to be put on hold as part of our liquidity preservation program. Of course, we kept X-Tack moving forward. And X-Tack is probably our most important gross margin improvement project as we expect X-Tack at its launch to be accretive to our overall gross margin. We will resume other gross margin improvement projects as our business recovery and organizational bandwidth dictates as reasonable. Finally, a soft outlook for the third quarter ahead. Our team has built a solid growing business. This business is coming back as quickly as elective procedures are allowed to come back. In the United States, in the second quarter, we had very good recovery in the Mid-Atlantic, in Southeast as well as the Southwest and Western states. Still the Northeast area of the United States, where we have a sizable business, was severely hit by COVID-19 and slower to recover during the second quarter. And outside the United States, direct markets such as Germany, Spain and Italy showed good signs of recovery throughout the second quarter, while the United Kingdom and France trailed behind. Some of our larger distributor markets, such as the Middle East, have yet to show signs of recovery. But overall, we like what we are seeing so far in the third quarter based on July from both OverStitch and Orbera. In July, our direct market endoscopy product sales both in the United States and outside the United States increased compared to July of 2019. In fact, if we had June and July of 2020 together, our direct markets endoscopy product sales increased compared to those same two months in 2019. The third quarter is traditionally a seasonally soft quarter, but all indications right now are that the third quarter sales will be sequentially up compared to the second quarter. However, much COVID risks remain and we are still planning for the third quarter to be below the third quarter of last year. And by the end of the fourth quarter, perhaps, we'll see a return to pre-COVID procedure levels. With that, we'll now open the lines up for questions. Taren, please proceed.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Matt Hewitt with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Please go ahead, sir.\nMatt Hewitt: Good afternoon and thanks for the update and for taking the questions. \nTodd Newton: Good afternoon Matt.\nMatt Hewitt: Maybe on the first one regarding the rebound that you've seen May to June, and now it sounds like through July, how much of that is just kind of getting back -- or getting through the backlog that was created in late March and April versus new pipeline opportunities for your GI customers? And maybe what does that pipeline look like today if you have any thoughts there?\nTodd Newton: Yes. It's a good question, Matt. It's one of the uncertainties, I think, I would say, right now, as we look at our business is knowing to what degree have we been dealing with backlog, especially in June and July, versus to what degree we are really back to more of a normal health care utilization pattern. Undoubtedly, we have concerns, as do others, that higher unemployment rates and loss of insurance potentially can impact beyond the current backlog that we see right now, could impact recovery rates in the latter half of this year. So it's a good question, very difficult to answer. It's one of the reasons why we still are anticipating that even though July has been really a very satisfactory month, we still anticipate that the third quarter will likely be below the third quarter of last year. And it'll be a little bit longer before we see a return to pre-COVID procedure levels. We hope that we're being too conservative.\nMatt Hewitt: That's helpful. Thank you and then one of the risk -- the key risk categories for coronavirus patients is obesity. There's been a number of tweets from some of your customers talking about seeing an incremental demand once the lockdown orders were lifted for ESG and for other bariatric procedures. I'm just curious, is that something that you think could become a little bit of a tailwind here? I realize it's a tough environment, but given that risk factor, is that -- does that create opportunities for you?\nTodd Newton: Matt, it's a good question again. I think our opportunities were always exceedingly large in the bariatric marketplace. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, this is a market of 200,000 procedures per year in the United States, and we haven't even tapped it in any meaningful way. This is, of course, the whole investment thesis behind the MERIT study. And our goal is reimbursement. And if the market grows as a result of the higher COVID risk factors associated with obese patients, that is something we aspire to help address. But we just see that the bariatric market pre-COVID was already a very attractive market for us and one worth pursuing and one that, once we are able to tap into it and compete on a reimbursed basis, I think we're going to see tremendous growth potential arise.\nMatt Hewitt: Okay. Great. And then one last one, I'll hop back into queue. The in-person training that you spoke about in your prepared remarks, was that in a customer facility? Or was that using your mobile lab? And I would think that you'd be able to control that mobile lab environment maybe a little bit better than even one of your customers' facilities. Is that something that you're looking to exploit, I guess, at least over the near term when there's still coronavirus circulating?\nTodd Newton: Well, what I mentioned that was conducted on Friday. That was actually done at a lab in Chicago at the ASGE. They have a fantastic facility. And I think this was actually their first training course that they hosted at that facility since the beginning of COVID as well as ours. So we've enjoyed always a really good relationship with physician societies, such as the ASGE, and we've always had very good success with their facility, which is just a top-notch facility. We have yet to turn back on, so to speak, the mobile lab, and we're going to be continuing to evaluate that here in the second half of the year.\nMatt Hewitt: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Adam Maeder with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead, sir.\nAndrew Stafford: Hi guys this is Drew on for Adam. Thank you for taking the questions and congrats on a nice quarter. I was wondering if you could speak a little bit to either quantitatively or qualitatively, some of the mindset of your customers, given that you guys have a sizable cash pay exposure. You mentioned a couple of things on the previous question that feel a little more cautious as far as insurance or the financial health of some of your customers. But just to be clear, is that something you're hearing at all so far? And then just any patient concerns as far as coming in due to COVID?\nTodd Newton: Yes. Let me take the first part of your question, and you may have to repeat the second part of your question, I'm not sure I heard it, Drew. But the prominent, let's call it, message from customers throughout the second quarter, lesser so now, but throughout the second quarter was that they just wanted to get back to work. And it really had more to do with them than it had to do with anything related to us or our procedures. It was just a desire to get back to work. But there was a large need to address things such as patient intake procedures and how to keep the hospital or ambulatory surgical environment secure from this highly contagious situation. And so we've had for some time a communication from our customers that they were ready to go and get started. And so I think what is interesting right now is that while Q3 tends to be a seasonal period that is somewhat lower than Q2, because of that period of disruption, I think we're hearing more from accounts that they plan to continue working through the third quarter at rates that perhaps in the past, would not have been typical. In the past, maybe they would have taken more vacation in August because that's seasonally what is done. But right now, I think our -- the things we're hearing in the marketplace suggests that procedures may continue to move forward, although probably because of these intake type of safeguards that have been put in place at a lot of places, capacity may be slightly reduced.\nAndrew Stafford: Okay. That make sense.\nTodd Newton: And what was the second part of your question, Drew, I missed it?\nAndrew Stafford: Yes. So the second part of the question was just more on the patient side. Are you hearing at all from your customers that some of their patients are concerned about coming in due to COVID? I mean, I think, based on your answer to your previous question, I think the answer is no, but anything on the patient side would be helpful, too.\nTodd Newton: Yes. I think I'll just go with your answer, Drew, no. That's a good answer.\nStefanie Cavanaugh: That's what we're experiencing.\nAndrew Stafford: Okay. That's very helpful. And then congrats on the submission for X-Tack. It sounds like it could be pretty complementary to some of your products. Forgive me if I missed this, but assuming you get approval in a couple of months down the road, what can we expect as far as a full or a limited launch probably late this year or early next? And then from a sales model perspective, is there a bundling opportunity into some of those large accounts you spoke about?\nStefanie Cavanaugh: So I'll start with our launch plans at this point. We believe if everything progresses with -- at the normal rate of the 510k submission that we will have approval by the end of this year, late this year. And so at that point, we will begin a limited launch that we would expect to carry forward with a small group of people for a couple of months. And then when we have our national sales meeting in the middle-ish of the first quarter, we would then begin a full launch and roll out our lessons learned from that limited launch experience through to our full sales force. As far as a bundling opportunity, I'm not aware of any discussion along those lines.\nTodd Newton: No, I don't -- yes. I think on bundling. We have two products that are very innovative. And so there would seem to be less need. Let me reuse that word, less need for us to consider bundling in order to improve access. So I don't anticipate that right now, but we'll be looking at pricing strategies as we continue to get closer to this point in time when we can introduce the product to the market.\nAndrew Stafford: Okay. That makes complete sense. Just one more quick one from me here. Just on the expense side, obviously, you took some chunks out of the business, due to COVID particularly on the sales and marketing portion, how quickly should we think about some of that investment return to the business as a recovery happens here? And then, I guess, with the recent capital raise, do you feel like you're in a good place to go on the offensive right away? Or do you kind of stay in cash preservation mode until there's a little bit more clarity with COVID. Thank you for taking the questions.\nStefanie Cavanaugh: Thank you, Adam. Appreciate the question. How quickly our expenses come back will be entirely gated by how quickly our revenue comes back. So we will be very judicious in returning our expenses across the board for furloughed employees, salary reductions as well as sales and marketing activities to match that to what our revenue return looks like. So that would be how I would counsel you there in your thought process. And we're watching it daily -- weekly in order to make the right decisions for that effect. From our liquidity perspective, we are very pleased with the equity we just raised, and we see that giving us a nice runway through this disruption, the end of this year and helping us fund our X-Tack launch and getting us through the MERIT readout sometime in 2021. So our risk has been significantly decreased.\nStefanie Cavanaugh: Thank you Adam.\nOperator: [Technical Difficulty] My apologies. Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I'll now turn the floor back over to Mr. Newton. Sir, the floor is yours.\nTodd Newton: Well, thank you, Taren. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today on the call. And should you have any questions or would like to arrange a call to have questions asked, please contact Matt Kreps at Darrow Associates. We also plan to participate in several investor conferences during the third quarter, all virtual for the moment. And these include the LD Micro event in early September on September 1 through September 4 and the H.C. Wainwright Conference in September on the 14th and through the 16th and potentially others. So we would welcome a chance to visit with one of you as part of those events. And so please contact Matt again if you would like to request a meeting. Stay safe, everyone, and thank you again.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a great day.",

            "name": "Stefanie Cavanaugh",
            "content": "Thank you, Todd, and good afternoon, everyone. As addressed in our press release from earlier today and the 10-Q filing, the dominant theme in the second quarter has been the COVID-19 disruption to health care resources and elective or deferrable procedure volumes worldwide, including procedures that use our products. As a result, our revenue decreased 60% in the second quarter of 2020 from the second quarter of 2019. By geography. U.S. endoscopy sales declined 40%, while OUS endoscopy sales declined close to 68%. The difference in geographic decline is that the U.S. procedure volumes and health care activity appears to be recovering at a quicker rate, and the OUS decline includes our distributor channel, which was down by 76% compared to the second quarter of 2019. Both ESS and IGB worldwide sales were affected by COVID-19. As a result, total endoscopy product sales were $5.4 million, which is a 56% reduction. Foreign currency movements in the quarter did not materially affect revenue trends. The proportion of the ESS product sales to total endoscopy product sales were 67% in the second quarter of 2020, which is roughly equivalent to its share of sales back in the second quarter of 2019. Total revenues in the second quarter of last year also included $1.9 million in transition service revenues related to our former surgical product line that we sold in December of 2018, while transition services were only $200,000 in the second quarter of this year. We expect to be completely free of any remaining service obligations by the end of 2020. Gross margin for the second quarter was 43% compared with 50% for the second quarter of 2019. The liquidity preservation program we implemented at the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a series of postponements and cancellations of inventory purchases. And we also reduced our production plan to align our inventory with the expected decline in product demand. These efforts idled our production facilities for a large portion of the second quarter and resulted in a direct charge of $0.5 million to cost of sales in the period. Without this charge for unabsorbed overhead in the second quarter, our gross margin would have been comparable to the second quarter of last year and more consistent with our pre-COVID gross margin percentage expectations. Total operating expenses were $6.7 million or more than 50% reduced compared to the second quarter of 2019 due to cost savings initiatives the management team implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As we have discussed, we undertook a number of aggressive actions at the beginning of the pandemic to preserve cash. Our goal was to complete the second quarter with the same net cash use we expected before the COVID crisis, and we met this goal. We will continue to closely manage cash during the remainder of the COVID-19 disruption to maintain a balance between our cash commitments and business improvements. Descriptions of these cost savings initiatives were detailed in our past shareholder periodic reports on Form 10-K for 2019 and 10-Q for the first quarter of 2020 and the Form 8-K dated April 20. Our operating loss in the second quarter of 2020 decreased 40% to $4.3 million from $7.2 million in the second quarter of 2019. Similarly, our net loss for the second quarter of 2020 improved to $6.3 million compared to $8.8 million for the second quarter of 2019, an improvement of 29%. Cash at the end of the second quarter was $19.7 million, and we were in compliance with our credit agreement. Subsequent to quarter end, on July 21, we completed the transaction to sell common stock and prefunded warrants for total gross proceeds of $25 million. Concurrently, we modified our existing loan agreement to waive any minimum revenue covenant requirement for the remainder of 2020 and decreased our minimum liquidity requirement that was set to increase to $20 million this quarter, down to $12.5 million. The combination of these two transactions increased our liquidity by $32.5 million and greatly reduces our COVID-19 near-term market risk. The length of the runway from these transactions somewhat depends on the pace at which our business continues to improve from COVID-19. But in any event, we expect, as of today, that our liquidity will be sufficient to get us past this year's 2020 disruption through the readout of the MERIT trial in 2021 and fund the X-Tack launch in 2021 as well.

            "name": "Todd Newton",
            "content": "Thank you, Matt. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call to discuss our second quarter 2020 results. I hope all of you joining us today and your families are remaining safe and healthy. On July 20, we preannounced our second quarter revenue and highlights. And in just a moment, Stefanie Cavanaugh, our CFO, will take you through the details of the second quarter. Before she does, I will open with four key points that best describe for investors, the state of the company here at the midway point of 2020. One, the immediate liquidity preservation actions we took at the start of the COVID disruption were successful. These decisions were hard to make and hard to implement because of the impact on our team. But we knew that the actions were necessary to preserve the interest of our shareholders, and the Board of Directors fully supported management's plans. Two, we have made sacrifices to reduce spend, but we have continued to pursue shareholder value creation by investing in our most important development programs such as the X-Tack program. This took tremendous teamwork and adaptation due to stay-at-home directives and travel restrictions, but our team persevered. And as announced on July 7, the X-Tack 510k application was submitted to the FDA and now in the regulatory review process. Three, our business is coming back. The COVID pandemic had an immediate and significant impact on all health care procedures, and, of course, it impacted our sales in the second quarter. But since March and April initial shutdown of elective procedures, we have been on a positive recovery path. In June, U.S. product sales were close to 90% of June sales in 2019. Our recovery trends outside the United States are also encouraging, but tracking slower in June than the U.S. pace. Four, our liquidity has been shored up. While COVID-related market risk continues to cloud the immediate future with uncertainty, our recently completed equity financing and simultaneous credit amendment provides us the capital to accelerate our business recovery from this period of COVID market disruption and fund through the X-Tack launch. I will pause with that and turn the call over to Stephanie now to cover the second quarter financial results in greater detail. Stef? Thank you, Stefanie. The first half of this year has been an unprecedented, unpredictable and difficult period for everyone. But Apollo Endosurgery has tremendous opportunities in front of us, and these opportunities are the management team's focus. The equity raise that we just completed, which was entirely funded by existing shareholders, is a testament to the support and belief of our current shareholder base in these opportunities. And I'll highlight three of these opportunities today. First, core GI use has been an important part of our OverStitch growth story, particularly in the United States. We've spoken for a while now of the goal to bring the benefits of flexible endoscopic suturing to core GI needs in the lower GI track, especially the colon. And this is what X-Tack is designed for. During our development labs, doctor feedback has been very positive. The feature that stands out is it's through the scope delivery designed to work with any 2.8 millimeter or larger working channel, which includes any of the leading gastroscopes or colonoscopes on the market. Advanced endoscopists, like those who use OverStitch today will find it distinctive with broad case application. Every endoscopist should find it easier to pick up and use and economical. It is specifically designed to easily and effectively close larger or irregularly shaped defects, which would otherwise be very challenging for the endoscopist to address with the existing closure devices in the market. X-Tack should also be a very good fit with our sales organization. Our top 100 OverStitch accounts in the United States where we generated 80% of our U.S. OverStitch sales last year, and we think there will be strong core GI demand for X-Tack at more than 75% of these same top 100 accounts. The range of use for X-Tack runs from being a rescue tool for acute perforations on one end of the spectrum to the prophylactic closure following a mid to large-sized polyp removal for patients at higher risk of delayed bleeding because of either polyp size, location or the need to use anti-thrombotic medications being at the other end of the spectrum and many uses in between. X-Tack will materially expand our addressable market in core GI. With more than 20 million colonoscopies performed each year in the United States, X-Tack moves us into a large and important market where our existing customers have an existing unmet need that X-Tack will address. If typical 510k processing time is a guide, we believe that X-Tack could be cleared by the end of this year. Second, we have substantial bariatric growth potential still ahead. The bariatric procedure market is a roughly 200,000 procedure per year market in the United States alone and the endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty, or ESG procedure, that is enabled by the full-thickness suturing capabilities of OverStitch, has a very attractive value proposition for patients, physicians and the health care system at large due to its effectiveness, low adverse event rate and ease to revise when revision is needed. While bariatrics have been an important part of our OverStitch past growth as has core GI, we have yet to tap the potential of ESG. The ESG procedure continues to build momentum worldwide and we estimate that there were probably somewhere around 5,000 ESG procedures performed worldwide last year. But data generation is required to break into a bigger share of the bariatric market or to grow the market. And the MERIT trial, which we've spoken about many times before, is intended to provide this data. As a reminder, MERIT is a randomized prospective multicenter trial being conducted at various sites in the United States to study the effectiveness and safety of the ESG procedure and is a key piece of our reimbursement strategy for the ESG procedure and label expansion for OverStitch. We remain very confident that the MERIT study will achieve its goals. And the reason for our optimism is simple. ESG has already been studied and reported on multiple times by multiple centers with highly consistent results across the globe. In 2019 there were there were three meta-analysis published, the pooled the results of over 1,700 patient experiences. Some of the MERIT site activities experienced some COVID-19-related delays. But as of last week, less than 10 crossover procedures remain to be performed. The PIs anticipate the primary MERIT data readout by the middle of 2021. And with reimbursement, we believe the ESG procedure will be disruptive to today's bariatric marketplace. Third, expanding physician access to our products remains a priority for us. COVID-19 has disruptive travel and many of the planned in-person physician meetings we have historically leveraged to address medical education demand. However, there remains a strong physician interest to learn more about OverStitch, and we have found alternative ways to address this interest. In the second quarter, we held two international webinars on the benefits of endoluminal suturing. The first webinar focused on the benefits of endoluminal suturing as part of the core GI basket of procedures and was attended by 300 persons. The second discussed endoluminal bariatric suturing applications, and that was attended by almost 500 participants. At the end of July, we also hosted two didactic training sessions here in the United States. Again, one for bariatric and one on core GI, designed as precursors to hands on training activity. We had more than 80 registrants for each of these classes. And subsequently conducted our first in-person lab training session since the beginning of COVID just this past Friday to test how we might reopen the hands-on aspects of our education programs. As normalcy returns, the level of engagement we have seen on our virtual platforms makes us feel confident that new user interest will be as high as we were experiencing pre COVID. Expanding physician interest to our products goes beyond medical education note. In 2019, we launched the SX OverStitch device as part of the strategy to avail our suturing technology to those physicians or account locations that did not have access to a dual-channel endoscope. Since that launch, about a third of all new OverStitch accounts globally are SX users. And by the end of this year, we will be making minor modifications to further improve the user experience with SX. In addition, during the second quarter of this year and despite COVID, our regulatory team succeeded in securing market approvals or clearances for one or more of our endoscopic products in seven countries. These new markets will be served by either new or existing third-party distributors. Regulatory efforts are ongoing inside of Apollo to further expand the availability of our products to new markets. Indeed, we have multiple growth drivers ahead for our business following COVID-19 recovery. I want to say a couple of words as well about our gross margin improvement programs. These remain important, but had to be put on hold as part of our liquidity preservation program. Of course, we kept X-Tack moving forward. And X-Tack is probably our most important gross margin improvement project as we expect X-Tack at its launch to be accretive to our overall gross margin. We will resume other gross margin improvement projects as our business recovery and organizational bandwidth dictates as reasonable. Finally, a soft outlook for the third quarter ahead. Our team has built a solid growing business. This business is coming back as quickly as elective procedures are allowed to come back. In the United States, in the second quarter, we had very good recovery in the Mid-Atlantic, in Southeast as well as the Southwest and Western states. Still the Northeast area of the United States, where we have a sizable business, was severely hit by COVID-19 and slower to recover during the second quarter. And outside the United States, direct markets such as Germany, Spain and Italy showed good signs of recovery throughout the second quarter, while the United Kingdom and France trailed behind. Some of our larger distributor markets, such as the Middle East, have yet to show signs of recovery. But overall, we like what we are seeing so far in the third quarter based on July from both OverStitch and Orbera. In July, our direct market endoscopy product sales both in the United States and outside the United States increased compared to July of 2019. In fact, if we had June and July of 2020 together, our direct markets endoscopy product sales increased compared to those same two months in 2019. The third quarter is traditionally a seasonally soft quarter, but all indications right now are that the third quarter sales will be sequentially up compared to the second quarter. However, much COVID risks remain and we are still planning for the third quarter to be below the third quarter of last year. And by the end of the fourth quarter, perhaps, we'll see a return to pre-COVID procedure levels. With that, we'll now open the lines up for questions. Taren, please proceed. Good afternoon Matt. Yes. It's a good question, Matt. It's one of the uncertainties, I think, I would say, right now, as we look at our business is knowing to what degree have we been dealing with backlog, especially in June and July, versus to what degree we are really back to more of a normal health care utilization pattern. Undoubtedly, we have concerns, as do others, that higher unemployment rates and loss of insurance potentially can impact beyond the current backlog that we see right now, could impact recovery rates in the latter half of this year. So it's a good question, very difficult to answer. It's one of the reasons why we still are anticipating that even though July has been really a very satisfactory month, we still anticipate that the third quarter will likely be below the third quarter of last year. And it'll be a little bit longer before we see a return to pre-COVID procedure levels. We hope that we're being too conservative. Matt, it's a good question again. I think our opportunities were always exceedingly large in the bariatric marketplace. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, this is a market of 200,000 procedures per year in the United States, and we haven't even tapped it in any meaningful way. This is, of course, the whole investment thesis behind the MERIT study. And our goal is reimbursement. And if the market grows as a result of the higher COVID risk factors associated with obese patients, that is something we aspire to help address. But we just see that the bariatric market pre-COVID was already a very attractive market for us and one worth pursuing and one that, once we are able to tap into it and compete on a reimbursed basis, I think we're going to see tremendous growth potential arise. Well, what I mentioned that was conducted on Friday. That was actually done at a lab in Chicago at the ASGE. They have a fantastic facility. And I think this was actually their first training course that they hosted at that facility since the beginning of COVID as well as ours. So we've enjoyed always a really good relationship with physician societies, such as the ASGE, and we've always had very good success with their facility, which is just a top-notch facility. We have yet to turn back on, so to speak, the mobile lab, and we're going to be continuing to evaluate that here in the second half of the year. Yes. Let me take the first part of your question, and you may have to repeat the second part of your question, I'm not sure I heard it, Drew. But the prominent, let's call it, message from customers throughout the second quarter, lesser so now, but throughout the second quarter was that they just wanted to get back to work. And it really had more to do with them than it had to do with anything related to us or our procedures. It was just a desire to get back to work. But there was a large need to address things such as patient intake procedures and how to keep the hospital or ambulatory surgical environment secure from this highly contagious situation. And so we've had for some time a communication from our customers that they were ready to go and get started. And so I think what is interesting right now is that while Q3 tends to be a seasonal period that is somewhat lower than Q2, because of that period of disruption, I think we're hearing more from accounts that they plan to continue working through the third quarter at rates that perhaps in the past, would not have been typical. In the past, maybe they would have taken more vacation in August because that's seasonally what is done. But right now, I think our -- the things we're hearing in the marketplace suggests that procedures may continue to move forward, although probably because of these intake type of safeguards that have been put in place at a lot of places, capacity may be slightly reduced. And what was the second part of your question, Drew, I missed it? Yes. I think I'll just go with your answer, Drew, no. That's a good answer. No, I don't -- yes. I think on bundling. We have two products that are very innovative. And so there would seem to be less need. Let me reuse that word, less need for us to consider bundling in order to improve access. So I don't anticipate that right now, but we'll be looking at pricing strategies as we continue to get closer to this point in time when we can introduce the product to the market. Well, thank you, Taren. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today on the call. And should you have any questions or would like to arrange a call to have questions asked, please contact Matt Kreps at Darrow Associates. We also plan to participate in several investor conferences during the third quarter, all virtual for the moment. And these include the LD Micro event in early September on September 1 through September 4 and the H.C. Wainwright Conference in September on the 14th and through the 16th and potentially others. So we would welcome a chance to visit with one of you as part of those events. And so please contact Matt again if you would like to request a meeting. Stay safe, everyone, and thank you again."

[Operator Instructions] At this time, it is my pleasure to turn the floor over to Matt Kreps. Sir, the floor is yours.\nMatt Kreps: Thank you, and thanks everyone for participating in today's call to discuss Apollo's first quarter 2020 financial and operating results. Joining me on the call are Todd Newton, Chief Executive Officer; and Stefanie Cavanaugh, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to caution listeners that comments made by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, including Apollo's financial outlook and Apollo's plans and timing for product development and sales. In addition there is uncertainty about the spread of the COVID-19 virus and the ultimate impact it may have on our operations, the demand for our products, global supply chains and economic activity in general. These forward-looking statements involve material risks and uncertainties and Apollo's actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of risk factors, I encourage you to review the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2019, as well as our most recent Form 10-Q filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The content of this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast May 4, 2020. Except as required by law, Apollo undertakes no obligation to revise or update any statements reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call. During this call, we will interchangeably use the term ESS for OverStitch and the term IGB for Orbera and vice-versa. With that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Todd.\nTodd Newton: Thank you, Matt. Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining today's call to discuss our first quarter 2020 results. I hope all of you joining us today and your families are safe, healthy and adapting well wherever you are. In hindsight, the first quarter of 2020 had the makings of a true breakout quarter, particularly for OverStitch in our direct markets. We had very good demand through the start of March when the COVID-19 macro disruption began. Even with the COVID-19 disruption, first quarter OverStitch sales increased 25% in the United States, and 15% in direct markets outside the United States as measured in constant currency. For Intragastric Balloons are direct market sales outside the United States, we are also trending very well in Q1, prior to the COVID-19 disruption. In the U.S., IGB sales were trending to decline by a single, - high single-digit rate before the disruption, and Stef will go further into detail on our first quarter sales shortly. As this well known to everyone on this call, in March, a number of countries, particularly countries in Europe that comprised our most important international markets and the United States implemented several public health interventions to reduce the risk of COVID-19 disease transmission and conserve healthcare resources for the anticipated community health needs from COVID-19. This resulted in an unprecedented decline in global healthcare resources available for elective or deferrable procedures including those that use our products. Patient access to treatments was also interrupted due to shelter in place and social distancing protocols resulting in cancellation or postponement of procedures. In order to preserve our balance sheet and withstand the severe disruption, the COVID-19 began to have on our business in late March and on into the second quarter, we took several aggressive cost reduction steps that have already been publicly disclosed. The initial steps we took to reduce expenses can be found in item 9B of our 10-K which was filed on March 26, subsequent actions which include a number of personnel furloughs in additional salary reduction measures were disclosed in an 8-K that we filed on April 20. One thing that is certain though, the pre COVID-19 benefits and desire to perform procedures less invasively will survive this temporary disruption to our markets. For the medical conditions impacting the gastrointestinal tract, this next level of less invasiveness is endoluminal. Whether due to gastrointestinal complications, there were no obese patients need for more palatable interventional weight loss solutions, our products and our company intend to contribute tremendously to this post COVID-19 future. I will pause with that, and turn the call over to Stefanie now to cover the first quarter financial results in greater detail. Stef?\nStefanie Cavanaugh: Thank you, Todd, and good afternoon, everyone. Beginning with ESS, worldwide ESS product sales increased 5% as reported and 8% in constant currency. U.S. ESS product sales increased 25% to $3.8 million in the first quarter of 2020. Outside the U.S., ESS product sales decreased 12% as reported and 8% in constant currency to $3.1 million. While OUS direct market sales increased by close to 15% in constant currency, overall OUS, ESS sales declined due to lower sales to distributors. Certain OUS distributor orders that have been received and scheduled for shipment in March were deferred due to the distributors concern that COVID-19 would reduce second quarter procedure demand in that market. Intragastric Balloon or IGB worldwide decreased 18% as reported and 16% on a constant currency basis for the quarter reflecting soft demand in the U.S. and a $200,000 reduction OUS both of which were impacted by COVID-19 concerns. As a result, total endoscopy product sales decreased $500,000 to $10.4 million, which is a 4% reduction as reported and 2% in constant currency. ESS product sales are now 66% of total endoscopy sales in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 60% in the first quarter of 2019. Total revenues in the first quarter of last year included $2.3 million related to our former surgical product line that we sold in December of 2018. Today, our sole remaining obligation is to continue to manufacture products and this obligation will expire by the end of 2020. Gross margin for the first quarter was 53% for 2020 compared with 55% for 2019. The decline in gross margin is primarily due to the absence of surgical product sales in Q1 of 2020. Gross margin for our endoscopy products was 52% for the three months ended 31, 2020 compared to 51% for the same period of 2019. Total operating expenses in the first quarter of last year included a $5.6 million settlement gain that reduced operating expenses on a one-time basis. Excluding last year's settlement gain, total operating expenses in the first quarter of 2020 decreased $3.1 million due to reduced consumer advertising and clinical trial expenses. Similarly, after adjustment for the one-time gain in last year's first quarter results, our operating loss in the first quarter 2020 contracted by $1.5 million, or 18% to $6.7 million. Our net loss for the first quarter of 2020 was $10.3 million compared to $2.8 million for the first quarter 2019, which again benefited from the $5.6 million settlement gain. In addition, currency rate fluctuations in late March of 2020 increased net loss by $3 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to unrealized currency losses on inter-company payables. Cash at the end of the first quarter was $24 million. As Todd indicated, we have undertaken a number of aggressive actions on multiple fronts toward preserving cash. Our goal is to complete the second quarter with the same cash balance we expected before the COVID crisis. These actions included suspension of all advertising, medical education and conference activity, salary reductions across the company, productions or deferrals of our inventory purchase commitments, consolidation of our California and Australia offices into existing facilities, and the transition of our Brazilian business to a third-party distributor. In addition, in mid-April we furloughed approximately 90 of our 200 worldwide employees. From these actions, we estimate the overall cash savings in the second quarter to exceed $7 million. In closing, our Form 10-Q filed this afternoon also indicates that we were approved for an SBA loan in the amount of $2.8 million under the CARES Act. This two-year loan defers interest and principal payments until November of this year and bears interest at a rate of 1% annually. Also we disclosed an amendment to our credit agreement, which provides a waiver on minimum revenue covenants for the second and third quarter and permits the SBA loans. Together the SBA loan and the credit agreement waiver further improve liquidity and relief as we work through the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and charter pass back to normal operations as the pandemic awaits. I will now turn it back to Todd.\nTodd Newton: Thank you, Stefanie. Like most in our industry, we are expecting a substantial reduction procedure volumes during the second quarter. This has been our experience for April, which was very quiet but the push within our customer base to restart suggests to us that we might see sequential monthly improvement here in May and more still in June. The third quarter will likely also be down compared to the third quarter of last year and perhaps by the fourth quarter, we will see a more normal level of procedure activity. As we took the aggressive cost reduction measures step outlined to preserve capital, we have also retained flexibility to monitor the demand signals in any initial emerging customer support needs. Additionally, we are continuing to make key investments to position the Company to thrive again when the market returns to normal. I'm going to take the next couple of minutes to update you on some of these continuing efforts. First the MERIT trial continues to make progress. This nine-center prospective randomized trial comparing the Endoscopic Sleeve Gastroplasty or ESG procedure to medically managed lifestyle management is a key piece of our reimbursement strategy for the ESG procedure and also supports label expansion. In late 2019, the investigator sites completed all level one procedures. As of this past week, more than 60% of the crossover procedures are completed. With the remaining crossovers being primarily patients resident in U.S. cities, they were hardest hit by COVID-19. In the first quarter in order to adapt to the COVID-19 situation, all MERIT trial investigator sites began to use our Apollo Care telehealth platform to support their recurring MERIT patient follow up needs. Apollo Care is our interactive telehealth tool that enables physician practices to engage with and follow the progress of their patients and the MERIT investigators determine this could be very helpful and ideal for patient follow-up, while current stay at home and shelter in place guidelines are in place and potentially beyond. Second, in 2019, Apollo provided an educational grant to the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, or the ASGE, to collaborate on the development of an Endoscopic suturing channel. This channel was launched in the first quarter and is now offered as part of the ASGE's GI Leap online learning portal. ASGE's GI Leap online learning platform is the home to all of ASGE's online educational offerings. The advanced technological features of GI Leap give the learner a modern optimal online learning experience delays the foundation for the future of GI learning. The Endoscopic suturing channel and GI Leap includes 20 procedural videos that highlight endoscopic suturing techniques across a wide variety of clinical applications in advanced GI closure, as well as revisional and primary bariatric suturing applications. In the three months this channel has been available more than 80 U.S. physicians have registered. Medical education has been a very, has been very important to our ESS success and this collaboration with the ASGE continues to advance our medical education mission. Moving forward, we see ASGE's GI Leap as an attractive virtual medical education platform to supplement our more traditional in-person medical education resources once in person training is again an option. We plan to work with ASGE to offer their endoscopic suturing content to physicians outside the United States and add robust continent to further develop the channel. Lastly, we are continuing to invest in new product development to bring the benefits of endoluminal suturing to the lower GI tract. Based on the preclinical work today, we think this offers - this will offer a meaningful advancement for better closure of complex to fix in the colon. There are two important elements of this project. First, we expect the new product will expand the addressable market for endoluminal suturing. As most of you will know our current OverStitch product portfolio is primarily used in upper GI procedures due to the length of our current product line. Within the broad GI endoscopic procedure market, upper endoscopy represents about 40% of the overall market, and thus the lower GI tract represents a significant market opportunity for us. In the U.S. alone, there are over 20 million colonoscopies performed per year and the need for the closure in the lower GI tract is as prevalent as it is in the upper GI tract. Second, it will address a very important technical need as most of you will also know our current ESS product portfolio requires that the device is attached externally to or over a flexible endoscope which is the reason the device was given the name OverStitch to begin with. For core GI applications, this requires either the physician to a planned to use suturing prior to scope insertion or it requires a physician to remove the endoscope, attach our ESS device and then re-unserved and reorient the scope, back to the area of the GI tract suturing this desire. Our new product offering is designed to provide the physician with the ability to suture through the lumen of the endoscope, and this will improve the efficiency of many core GI procedures when suturing is desired. There is always some uncertainty to a product development timeline, but we are currently of the belief that the new lower GI product has the potential to be available in the U.S. market late this year. And with that, we'll now open the lines for - to read questions-and-answer session. Christie, please proceed.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first group of questions comes from Matt Hewitt with Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.\nMatt Hewitt: I guess my first one is, when you look at the landscape today, obviously a lot has changed given from your fourth quarter earnings call. But where do things stand maybe internationally and domestically, separately, but where do those sit today versus maybe two weeks ago or a month ago. Are you starting to see some of those, particularly in international markets or some of those starting to relax their procedures and therefore you could start to see things pop back up? I know you mentioned it briefly in your prepared remarks, but where do we sit today and how do you see those opening up over the next couple of months to quarters.\nTodd Newton: Yes. Thanks, Matt. We are seeing, I would say, a more pragmatic approach to the return to normalcy in the U.S. market then what we're seeing at least in Europe. What we're seeing in Europe continues to be just very slow at this point. But in the U.S., we clearly are seeing a great desire especially among our physician base to give restarted. Now in some cases the reality of having new processes implemented for things like patient intake within a hospital or facility setting that those are still lagging a little bit behind the desire of the physicians to get going but that gap between the desire and the ability to get going is continuously closing over the last couple of weeks and so we are comfortable to say that in May, I think we're going to start to see some facilities again begin to do procedures. And that's particularly in the U.S. Like I said, outside the U.S., little bit slower at this point. Still, especially in Europe.\nMatt Hewitt: Okay, that's helpful. And then a second, one of the things that I guess as you look at the data on the coronavirus and this is globally, one of the key factors that has been shown to be - are shown to result in increased severity for the patients that receive it has been obesity and I'm curious if there is something that you're doing or that you see the potential to do from a marketing perspective, once things start to normalize. Is that something that you can, I hate to use the word capitalize on, but is that something that you can do to help before a second wave or to address the problem before next winter.\nTodd Newton: Well, it's a great macro question, Matt. It's a difficult one to answer, we have known for a long time and it's been demonstrated for a long time that probably the co-morbidities of obesity may drive higher cost in our health care system than any other identifiable factor that's been down for quite some time. I do hope that - if there is silver lining of the COVID-19 pandemic, it will be a - let's call it a clarifying the importance that addressing the obesity epidemic has on our total healthcare costs as a society.\nMatt Hewitt: Got it. And maybe one last one, then I'll hop back in the queue. Regarding the new R&D program, the new device and it's not the attachment. But what you're discussing at the end there. Is that a regular 510-K pathway or will that require PMA just help us understand, it sounds like it was the end of the year, then you're looking at just a simple 510-K, is that correct?\nTodd Newton: That is correct, We believe regular 510-K pathway is available for this new product.\nOperator: And our next set of questions comes from Adam Maeder with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nAdam Maeder: Was hoping to dig in a little bit more on Q1 just between January, February and March. Obviously with large kind of when COVID really started to impact the business, just wondering if you're able to quantify that to some degree. Just really, just hoping to get a better sense for what the impact was from COVID-19 in Q1.\nTodd Newton: Yes, we don't have quantitative monthly information to share with you. But what we've disclosed in our Q and we'll say again here on this call, Adam is that January and February were tracking very well to our expectations and March, we saw probably at the same time, the most of elective procedure markets saw the truncation, we saw that. That was probably around the second week of March that we started to feel that in earnest right around the time of the World Health Organization announcements and of course, the President's national declaration of the State Emergency here in the United States that tracks really well with when we started to see a pullback on elective procedures. So January, February were great. March really saw it begin to slow down and slowed down fast.\nAdam Maeder: Okay. I appreciate the color there. And then I guess as it relates to just the near-term cost-cutting efforts for Q2. I understand you want to be judicious with cash. But do you see any potential impact to your business from a competitive standpoint over the next three, six, 12 months from the lack of spend and then just put the furloughing of employees. Any more color there, is it manufacturing, is it sales force and just how quickly can you bring those folk back online and then I just had one more follow-up. Thanks.\nTodd Newton: Yes. Any need time that you go through a cost cutting exercise, you're weighing long-term and short-term goals sometimes against each other. Nonetheless, we felt like that the actions we need to take in order to maintain our liquidity were the right actions to take. We have a technology that we feel like is very unique and different in the marketplace, so we're not really competing against another endoluminal suturing device, and as a result as we've talked about I think in the past, Adam our customers are - customers who are - who like the technology, very much and like to use it in their practice. So we waive those things and felt like the right course of action was nonetheless the short-term actions that we took and we'll figure out the longer-term consequences as we go. In terms of the where the personnel reside, it was basically across the entire spectrum.\nAdam Maeder: Okay, got it. That's very clear and just for my last question, OUS Orbera sales were pretty solid, all things considered and ahead of our expectations. I'm just curious and sorry if I missed this in the prepared remarks, what drove the strength in that business outside the U.S. in Q1. And just I guess looking ahead, how do you think about the Balloon business in subsequent quarters just given that it is cash pay. Just any color there would be helpful. Thanks again.\nTodd Newton: Yes. And so our Orbera business outside the United States is a very well established solid business. We enjoy in various different markets, aspects of reimbursement for the Orbera device that we don't have in the U.S. or in the U.S. is probably be considered fully cash pay, it's not necessarily considered fully cash pay in Europe, especially in certain markets. So it's been a good franchise for us and continues to be stable and we would anticipate that coming out of this COVID-19 situation that the Orbera franchise outside the United States will continue to be a very stable business for us.\nOperator: And that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I will turn it back over to management for any closing remarks.\nTodd Newton: Well, thank you, Christie. And thank you everyone for joining us today on the call. Stefanie is of course disappointed she didn't get chance to answer any question directly, but should you have any questions or would like to arrange a call with us, please contact Matt Kreps of Darrow Associates. Stay safe everyone, and thank you again.\nOperator: And that does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a great day.",

In closing, our Form 10-Q filed this afternoon also indicates that we were approved for an SBA loan in the amount of $2.8 million under the CARES Act. This two-year loan defers interest and principal payments until November of this year and bears interest at a rate of 1% annually. Also we disclosed an amendment to our credit agreement, which provides a waiver on minimum revenue covenants for the second and third quarter and permits the SBA loans. Together the SBA loan and the credit agreement waiver further improve liquidity and relief as we work through the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and charter pass back to normal operations as the pandemic awaits. I will now turn it back to Todd."

            "content": "Thank you, Matt. Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining today's call to discuss our first quarter 2020 results. I hope all of you joining us today and your families are safe, healthy and adapting well wherever you are. In hindsight, the first quarter of 2020 had the makings of a true breakout quarter, particularly for OverStitch in our direct markets. We had very good demand through the start of March when the COVID-19 macro disruption began. Even with the COVID-19 disruption, first quarter OverStitch sales increased 25% in the United States, and 15% in direct markets outside the United States as measured in constant currency. For Intragastric Balloons are direct market sales outside the United States, we are also trending very well in Q1, prior to the COVID-19 disruption. In the U.S., IGB sales were trending to decline by a single, - high single-digit rate before the disruption, and Stef will go further into detail on our first quarter sales shortly. As this well known to everyone on this call, in March, a number of countries, particularly countries in Europe that comprised our most important international markets and the United States implemented several public health interventions to reduce the risk of COVID-19 disease transmission and conserve healthcare resources for the anticipated community health needs from COVID-19. This resulted in an unprecedented decline in global healthcare resources available for elective or deferrable procedures including those that use our products. Patient access to treatments was also interrupted due to shelter in place and social distancing protocols resulting in cancellation or postponement of procedures. In order to preserve our balance sheet and withstand the severe disruption, the COVID-19 began to have on our business in late March and on into the second quarter, we took several aggressive cost reduction steps that have already been publicly disclosed. The initial steps we took to reduce expenses can be found in item 9B of our 10-K which was filed on March 26, subsequent actions which include a number of personnel furloughs in additional salary reduction measures were disclosed in an 8-K that we filed on April 20. One thing that is certain though, the pre COVID-19 benefits and desire to perform procedures less invasively will survive this temporary disruption to our markets. For the medical conditions impacting the gastrointestinal tract, this next level of less invasiveness is endoluminal. Whether due to gastrointestinal complications, there were no obese patients need for more palatable interventional weight loss solutions, our products and our company intend to contribute tremendously to this post COVID-19 future. I will pause with that, and turn the call over to Stefanie now to cover the first quarter financial results in greater detail. Stef? Thank you, Stefanie. Like most in our industry, we are expecting a substantial reduction procedure volumes during the second quarter. This has been our experience for April, which was very quiet but the push within our customer base to restart suggests to us that we might see sequential monthly improvement here in May and more still in June. The third quarter will likely also be down compared to the third quarter of last year and perhaps by the fourth quarter, we will see a more normal level of procedure activity. As we took the aggressive cost reduction measures step outlined to preserve capital, we have also retained flexibility to monitor the demand signals in any initial emerging customer support needs. Additionally, we are continuing to make key investments to position the Company to thrive again when the market returns to normal. I'm going to take the next couple of minutes to update you on some of these continuing efforts. First the MERIT trial continues to make progress. This nine-center prospective randomized trial comparing the Endoscopic Sleeve Gastroplasty or ESG procedure to medically managed lifestyle management is a key piece of our reimbursement strategy for the ESG procedure and also supports label expansion. In late 2019, the investigator sites completed all level one procedures. As of this past week, more than 60% of the crossover procedures are completed. With the remaining crossovers being primarily patients resident in U.S. cities, they were hardest hit by COVID-19. In the first quarter in order to adapt to the COVID-19 situation, all MERIT trial investigator sites began to use our Apollo Care telehealth platform to support their recurring MERIT patient follow up needs. Apollo Care is our interactive telehealth tool that enables physician practices to engage with and follow the progress of their patients and the MERIT investigators determine this could be very helpful and ideal for patient follow-up, while current stay at home and shelter in place guidelines are in place and potentially beyond. Second, in 2019, Apollo provided an educational grant to the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, or the ASGE, to collaborate on the development of an Endoscopic suturing channel. This channel was launched in the first quarter and is now offered as part of the ASGE's GI Leap online learning portal. ASGE's GI Leap online learning platform is the home to all of ASGE's online educational offerings. The advanced technological features of GI Leap give the learner a modern optimal online learning experience delays the foundation for the future of GI learning. The Endoscopic suturing channel and GI Leap includes 20 procedural videos that highlight endoscopic suturing techniques across a wide variety of clinical applications in advanced GI closure, as well as revisional and primary bariatric suturing applications. In the three months this channel has been available more than 80 U.S. physicians have registered. Medical education has been a very, has been very important to our ESS success and this collaboration with the ASGE continues to advance our medical education mission. Moving forward, we see ASGE's GI Leap as an attractive virtual medical education platform to supplement our more traditional in-person medical education resources once in person training is again an option. We plan to work with ASGE to offer their endoscopic suturing content to physicians outside the United States and add robust continent to further develop the channel. Lastly, we are continuing to invest in new product development to bring the benefits of endoluminal suturing to the lower GI tract. Based on the preclinical work today, we think this offers - this will offer a meaningful advancement for better closure of complex to fix in the colon. There are two important elements of this project. First, we expect the new product will expand the addressable market for endoluminal suturing. As most of you will know our current OverStitch product portfolio is primarily used in upper GI procedures due to the length of our current product line. Within the broad GI endoscopic procedure market, upper endoscopy represents about 40% of the overall market, and thus the lower GI tract represents a significant market opportunity for us. In the U.S. alone, there are over 20 million colonoscopies performed per year and the need for the closure in the lower GI tract is as prevalent as it is in the upper GI tract. Second, it will address a very important technical need as most of you will also know our current ESS product portfolio requires that the device is attached externally to or over a flexible endoscope which is the reason the device was given the name OverStitch to begin with. For core GI applications, this requires either the physician to a planned to use suturing prior to scope insertion or it requires a physician to remove the endoscope, attach our ESS device and then re-unserved and reorient the scope, back to the area of the GI tract suturing this desire. Our new product offering is designed to provide the physician with the ability to suture through the lumen of the endoscope, and this will improve the efficiency of many core GI procedures when suturing is desired. There is always some uncertainty to a product development timeline, but we are currently of the belief that the new lower GI product has the potential to be available in the U.S. market late this year. And with that, we'll now open the lines for - to read questions-and-answer session. Christie, please proceed. Yes. Thanks, Matt. We are seeing, I would say, a more pragmatic approach to the return to normalcy in the U.S. market then what we're seeing at least in Europe. What we're seeing in Europe continues to be just very slow at this point. But in the U.S., we clearly are seeing a great desire especially among our physician base to give restarted. Now in some cases the reality of having new processes implemented for things like patient intake within a hospital or facility setting that those are still lagging a little bit behind the desire of the physicians to get going but that gap between the desire and the ability to get going is continuously closing over the last couple of weeks and so we are comfortable to say that in May, I think we're going to start to see some facilities again begin to do procedures. And that's particularly in the U.S. Like I said, outside the U.S., little bit slower at this point. Still, especially in Europe. Well, it's a great macro question, Matt. It's a difficult one to answer, we have known for a long time and it's been demonstrated for a long time that probably the co-morbidities of obesity may drive higher cost in our health care system than any other identifiable factor that's been down for quite some time. I do hope that - if there is silver lining of the COVID-19 pandemic, it will be a - let's call it a clarifying the importance that addressing the obesity epidemic has on our total healthcare costs as a society. That is correct, We believe regular 510-K pathway is available for this new product. Yes, we don't have quantitative monthly information to share with you. But what we've disclosed in our Q and we'll say again here on this call, Adam is that January and February were tracking very well to our expectations and March, we saw probably at the same time, the most of elective procedure markets saw the truncation, we saw that. That was probably around the second week of March that we started to feel that in earnest right around the time of the World Health Organization announcements and of course, the President's national declaration of the State Emergency here in the United States that tracks really well with when we started to see a pullback on elective procedures. So January, February were great. March really saw it begin to slow down and slowed down fast. Yes. Any need time that you go through a cost cutting exercise, you're weighing long-term and short-term goals sometimes against each other. Nonetheless, we felt like that the actions we need to take in order to maintain our liquidity were the right actions to take. We have a technology that we feel like is very unique and different in the marketplace, so we're not really competing against another endoluminal suturing device, and as a result as we've talked about I think in the past, Adam our customers are - customers who are - who like the technology, very much and like to use it in their practice. So we waive those things and felt like the right course of action was nonetheless the short-term actions that we took and we'll figure out the longer-term consequences as we go. In terms of the where the personnel reside, it was basically across the entire spectrum. Yes. And so our Orbera business outside the United States is a very well established solid business. We enjoy in various different markets, aspects of reimbursement for the Orbera device that we don't have in the U.S. or in the U.S. is probably be considered fully cash pay, it's not necessarily considered fully cash pay in Europe, especially in certain markets. So it's been a good franchise for us and continues to be stable and we would anticipate that coming out of this COVID-19 situation that the Orbera franchise outside the United States will continue to be a very stable business for us. Well, thank you, Christie. And thank you everyone for joining us today on the call. Stefanie is of course disappointed she didn't get chance to answer any question directly, but should you have any questions or would like to arrange a call with us, please contact Matt Kreps of Darrow Associates. Stay safe everyone, and thank you again."

At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode, and we will open the floor for your questions and comments after the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Matt Kreps. Sir, the floor is yours.\nMatt Kreps: Thank you, John. And thanks everyone for participating in today's call to discuss Apollo 's fourth quarter and full-year 2021 financial and operating results. Joining me on the call today are Charles McKhann, Chief Executive Officer and Jeff Black, our Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will include slides to accompany the audio presentation. For those joining us by telephone, you can download a copy of the slides at our investor relations site, ir.apolloendo.com and choosing Events and Presentations. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that comments made by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, including Apollo's financial outlook and Apollo's plans and timing for product development and sales. In addition, there is uncertainty about the continued spread of COVID-19 virus and the ongoing impact it may have on our operations, the demand for our products, global supply chains, and economic activity in general. These forward-looking statements involve material risks and uncertainties, and Apollo 's actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of risk factors, I encourage you to review the company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and our most recent Form 10-Q. The content of this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, February 22, 2022.  As required, except as required by law, Apollo undertakes no obligation to revise or update any statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call. Additionally, today's discussion will include certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide an additional tool for evaluating the company's core performance. Management uses these metrics in its own evaluation of continuing operating performance, and a baseline for assessing the future earnings potential of the company. Included in our press release issued today our financial results and corresponding 8-K filing, our supplemental tables reconciling non-GAAP figures to their closest GAAP comparable. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Charles.\nCharles McKhann: Thanks, Matt. And thank everyone, good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. Next week will mark one year since I joined Apollo Endosurgery. And I am truly grateful for having the honor of leading this team and this company with such unique products that impact patients' lives. Last year, I laid out a three-phase strategy as described on page 3. The first phase was to energize the business by building momentum across all three of our product lines while executing on foundational initiatives that can set us up for growth in the years ahead.  The second phase is to accelerate the business by developing new indications in markets. And the third phase is to lead in the fields of advanced defect closure and as endoscopic treatments for weight loss. As we implement this strategy, we have bolstered the Apollo leadership team by bringing in new talent into the organization to join an already strong Apollo team. And in addition, we are focusing our efforts on developing large market opportunities.  I'm pleased to report today that in the past 12 months and in Q4 that we've made tremendous progress, which strengthened the team at Apollo at all levels. At the leadership team earlier in the year, we brought on new commercial leaders here in the U.S., we brought in Jeff Black as our new CFO who's with me today. And then just in January, we announced the addition of Keely Scamperle to lead our reimbursement and market access efforts. Keely is an experienced professional and is already working at building her team that will lead our reimbursement efforts in facilitating patient access for our products.  We've nearly doubled our sales team in the U.S. and we've added to our OUS team. We're building our marketing and trading capabilities and becoming a more professional selling organization. We strengthened our R&D and engineering team and are implementing new processes to strengthening our new product pipeline. And we are addressing a historical underinvestment in other critical functions like operations, supply chain, business analytics, and customer service. Simply put, we have very talented people at Apollo and I'm very proud of the work that they've done. We've just not had a scalable organization.  And so we're strengthening our capabilities across the organization to support our growth plans. We're also building and developing a new culture, focusing on a set of five core values that I'll come back to later in the discussion. And so in summary, at Apollo, we're undergoing substantial change in our team, our processes, and our culture. And we anticipate that these changes will allow the company that has historically struggled at times and underperformed to become a growth engine. Now, often when a company undergoes this much change, the business often needs to take a step backwards before moving ahead with renewed confidence. And I'm very pleased that that is not the case for Apollo in 2021. For the year, we delivered 50% revenue growth, and for Q4, we delivered 26% growth. Despite a meaningful impact of the omicron variant in many markets in Western Europe and the U.S.., our growth has been balanced across product lines with OverStitch, ORBERA, and our newest product, X-Tack, all contributing to growth. And we've seen balanced growth across geographies with strong performance in both the U.S. and international markets. And while we kick-started the business in 2021, we've also created a foundation for the years ahead. In our advanced GI franchise, X-Tack is an important new product for us.  We gained initial traction in the marketplace and published the first clinical data for the product. In our endoscopic weight loss franchise, obesity is a global epidemic that remains largely unchecked and the opportunity for endoscopic weight loss therapies is tremendous. 2021 was a year of important strategic milestones. Early in the year, in the spring of last year, the AGA implemented new clinical practice guidelines for the first time ever in favor of intragastric balloons therapies. The MERIT investigators presented the initial results at the IPSO meeting in the fall.  We submitted a new De Novo application, De Novo 510(k) application for Apollo ESG and Apollo REVISE. And through the course of the year, we saw an emergence of new endobariatric programs in both academic and private practice settings. In the area of NASH, we received a breakthrough designation for ORBERA for the treatment of NASH in Q1 of last year. We've also been collecting data on ESG, and working through the best strategy to address this large market opportunity. And then on our balance sheet. In 2021, we secured access to a $175 million in capital. We now have a strong balance sheet to support our growth initiatives. And so Page 5 gives you a sense of the balance that I just mentioned. On the left side of the page, you can see 50% year-on-year revenue growth, 55% for the ESS franchise. And importantly, 50% for the IGB franchise. And the figures relative to 2019 are shown as well. Another interesting development has been the growth in our top 10 accounts.  We saw 85% year-on-year growth in our top 10 accounts. And the average sales for Apollo in those 10 accounts is more than $600,000. And we think that gives a pretty good indication of the scale that we can drive as we increase penetration into -- of our products into our largest customers. For X-Tack, we continue to gain traction and we saw 40% sequential quarter-on-quarter growth for X-Tack. And as I mentioned, we're already hit -- we had important milestones for both the MERIT study and the De Novo 510(k). Related to MERIT and clinical data for ESG and revisions, we do expect a conditional presentations of the data at the upcoming DDW meeting. That's the Digestive Disease Week meeting that's in May. We also expect other publications on -- I'm sorry, presentations at that meeting on ESG and revisions from investigators around the world, sort of important additions to the clinical body of evidence. For MERIT itself, the investigators are working on the publication and we look forward to that in the months ahead. Jeff will now provide a review of our financial performance, and I will be back to provide additional commentary on our priorities for the year ahead.\nJeff Black: Thank you, Charles, and good afternoon, everybody. Thank you all for joining us today. I'll spend a few minutes to recap our financial results and then to hand it back to Charles to discuss our 2022 outlook and strategy. Starting with revenue on Slide 7. In Q4, we continued to see strong year-over-year growth across the product portfolio, and our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. And that was against the backdrop of pandemic-related pressure. As we all know, this has been a changing dynamic throughout 2021, and we did see pressure on Q4 volumes.  Outside the U.S., we saw pressure earlier in the quarter in concentrated markets, particularly Western Europe. And inside the U.S., we began to see slowdowns later in the quarter, particularly December, predominantly in academic hospitals and larger community hospitals where access was more limited. Even with this pressure on procedure volumes, we still maintained a healthy monthly revenue cadence in December, consistent with the rest of the quarter where we didn't see was the ramp that we expected in the last half of December.  And that was really difference between hitting the low end of our annual revenue guidance and the high end or better. Growth in the fourth quarter was balanced between U.S., where we saw 25% growth, and international, which grew 27%. Globally, our endoscopic suturing business was up over 37% in the fourth quarter and that's just highlights continued demand for our OverStitch and X-Tack products across a broad range of indications. Globally, ORBERA revenue was up 20% and that was below our blended growth rate, really due to volume pressure in the U.S., where growth was about 6%. But we believe this down tick is transitory and that it was mostly attributed to inpatient in hospital settings in the U.S. where access was limited in Q4. For the full year, we saw revenue growth of 50% and a gained balanced across our U.S. or international businesses and across product lines. Overall, we're pleased with our revenue performance in 2021 and our ability to navigate a challenging fourth quarter for Medtech broadly. Turning to gross margin on Slide 8. In the fourth quarter, we saw gross margin improved by 40 basis points in -- versus fourth quarter of 2022, 260 basis points on a year-to-date basis. We continue to remain focused on gross margin improvements, particularly with OverStitch, which as we've discussed, had a lower margin profile than ORBERA and X-Tack. Major drivers of overall gross margin expansion will be product mix, improved overhead absorption, and direct cogs improvement programs, again, focused primarily on OverStitch.  During 2022, we should start to see the impact of some of the cost improvement initiatives that we completed in 2021. And at the same time, we're navigating supply chain and manufacturing scale-up complexities, but we remain confident in our ability to drive blended gross margin to the mid 60% range over the next three to five years. Moving to Slide 10 -- so moving to Slide 9. As we look at operating spend profile, we think it's important to exclude non-cash stock-based compensation to get a clearer picture of what our real non-core GAAP operating expense run rate is.  In the near-term, we're focused on building capabilities following historical underinvestment in the business. For example, you'll see in the fourth quarter, our non-GAAP OpEx ran at about 79% of revenue, that reflects our planned investments in growth initiatives, primarily to build out our U.S. sales channel and our marketing programs as we prepare for the anticipated launch of our ESG products. In the U.S., we have a small commercial team relative to the size of our opportunities, but we made great progress throughout 2021 to expand that footprint.  We started the year with 16 direct reps in the U.S. We ended with about 30 by the end of the fourth quarter. And going forward, we'll continue to evaluate the appropriate scale of our commercial team and invest as necessary. Our other focused areas of planned investment will be medical education, clinical reimbursement, product development, and continued COGS improvement initiatives. We do expect to see operating expenses increase in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue, particularly in 2022 and we should start to see operating expense leverage in 2023 and beyond. But I think importantly, we have the ability to modulate spend as appropriate. And we're now well positioned from a balance sheet perspective to make these investments. Moving to Slide 10, you'll see that during 2021, our average quarterly burn was about $4 million a quarter. We ended the year with cash of about $92 million. Until now, Apollo has not been capitalized to adequately fund our long-term plan. The company historically did a very nice job managing burn, particularly during a very challenging global pandemic. However, due to historical under-investment, the company really has not been well positioned to support even modest growth. That changed for us in the fourth quarter as we secured over $125 million in new capital and borrowing capacity, which enables us to begin making the investments required to capitalize on the opportunities we see ahead of us, and this -- we can do this without creating a concern about cash runway. We're now extremely well positioned to execute on our plan growth initiatives. Turning to Slide 11. And before I turn things back over to Charles, just a few comments on our new credit facility with Innovatus Capital Partners, which we executed in December of last year. Key terms of -- or key strategic reasons for the new term loan is a reduction in our cost of capital, an extension of our amortization by an additional 33 months over our prior-term loan, and a decrease in debt service costs by nearly $30 million over the next three years, we also have now additional borrowing capacity that provides [Indiscernible] and delusive growth capital, and strategic flexibility.  At close, we drew $35 million to repay our prior-term debt, and we now have up to $65 million available for future tranches, $15 million will be available in 2023 and $25 million available in 2024, both based on achievement of revenue milestones. And another up to $25 million available for approved strategic acquisitions is such opportunities to rise. Borrowings mature in December of 2027, interest-only payments run through January of 2027. This was a great result for us. We couldn't be happier with the outcome of this and we look forward to our new partnership with Innovatus. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Charles.\nCharles McKhann: Okay. Now as we look ahead to the year of 2022, let me talk about our overall strategy and our outlook for the year ahead. Page 13 gives you a summary of our three product lines and the two main businesses in which we operate: an advanced GI and endoscopic weight loss. And we are excited that we have very attractive growth opportunities across both sides of our business. As I mentioned previously, we also are focused on going after large market opportunities in advanced GI, in weight loss, and then over time in NASH as well.  So for the year ahead, our outlook from a revenue standpoint is $73 million to $75 million, which translates to 16% to 19% growth compared to 202. And let me also share a few words as it relates to the COVID impact. In Q4 and early Q1 of this year, we have seen an impact in markets globally. As others have reported lower procedure volumes, staffing issues, reduced hospital access, have all presented challenges, especially in larger academic medical centers and community hospital. That said, more recently, the omicron case counts are coming down, the situation appears to be improving. And so we are optimistic that the impact of this wave is beginning to abate. And so as we look ahead for 2022, we see four key catalysts to drive our growth in the year ahead. X-Tack expansion and ORBERA resurgence, preparing for the Apollo ESG and Apollo Revise launches, and continuing to advance our organization. The first with X-Tack, and I'm on Slide 16. The X-Tack has been a very important product for us as it adds to our portfolio in the advanced GI side of our business, and it offers a truly differentiated product in defect closure. And with X-Tack, we're still in the early days of the adoption of the new product and procedure, and we feel that we've got a lot of room to continue to grow.  For example, currently more than 60% of our X-Tack sales are in upper GI. There are many reasons for this. Our OverStitch device, which is the core device for the company, is used primarily in the upper GI. And so many of our existing customers primarily due upper GI procedures and are familiar with suturing techniques. Furthermore, for most of 2021, we had a very small sales team in the U.S., and it's not surprising that they had more success with our existing customers initially in applications in the upper GI. That said, we continue to see very positive feedback from customers about the role of X-Tack following pulp removal and lower GI cases such as the colon and the duodenum. And procedure volumes suggests that ultimately these applications have potential to do much and much larger market opportunity.  And so in 2022, we anticipated that we can continue to expand usage in both upper and lower GI, approach and train new users, and increase adoption of X-Tack. Importantly, 2022 will also be a year where we add additional clinical data for X-Tack.  To date, the data is strong but it's very limited. We anticipate additional studies on the use of X-Tack, including at the same up DDW meeting that I mentioned in areas like the colon [Indiscernible] and stent fixation and other potential applications for the product. In addition, we are ramping up our efforts in peer-to-peer education for X-Tack. The best way for physicians to learn about a new products or procedure is from their colleagues. And we've done some peer-to-peer education to date, but we are ramping up these efforts as part of our strategy in 2022. And we also have a significant growth opportunity for X-Tack outside the U.S. We've gained initial success in a handful of markets outside the U.S., and we are actively working towards a CE mark, which we expect in the second half of this year. And for feedback from physicians, for example, in Western Europe, they are very excited about the clinical and economic value proposition for X-Tack in their practice. Turning to Slide 17 in ORBERA. ORBERA as a meaningful part of the Apollo portfolio and offers compelling clinical benefits for patients. And 2021 was a very strong year for ORBERA. It accounts for more than a third of our total revenue and grew by more than 50%. And there are a number reasons for this resurgence and many of these we view as sustainable trends.  First, as it relates to COVID, we have seen a trend towards more procedures taking place in outpatient facilities and offices, which is the primary location for ORBERA. I mentioned earlier the AGA practice guidelines. And again, those talked about the clinical benefits of intragastric balloons in general, but especially the clinical benefits of a 10% total body weight loss on cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and liver function. So really adding to the clinical validation of the product. We've seen an uptick in physician interest and training on the balloon. And we are implementing new co-marketing programs. These are programs where we can work directly with practices that know how to treat patients with balloons and get excellent patient outcomes. And we can invest in these, we can track the performance, and then double-down on the programs that are most successful.  Finally, we anticipate a continued opportunity for intragastric balloons to be a meaningful part of a broader endoscopic endobariatric practice, endoscopic weight loss practice. And I'll come back to that here in a minute. But a lot of good things happening to the intragastric balloon franchise. The next catalyst which we've talked about previously is the potential for a new indication for the Apollo ESG and the Apollo REVISE products. Now importantly, we don't currently have an indication for these weight loss applications, and we are very careful to only promote within our approve labeling. But we have submitted to FDA and we're working through that process, and we are very excited about the potential for a launch of Apollo ESG and Apollo REVISE. and I use the word launch very intentionally here.  I want you to think about this like a new product launch. You hear about it in the pharmaceutical world, or you hear about from a large medical device manufacturer, in terms of our comprehensive, holistic approach to really maximize the opportunity for the product. Internally, we have a massive effort ongoing in areas across marketing and medical education, training, reimbursement and market access, and sales team readiness to prepare ourselves for the ultimate launch of these new products. Our team is very busy and they're very excited. And while we're busy preparing for the launches internally, there's an interesting dynamic in development taking place more broadly in the medical community. The growth of new endobariatric programs in academic settings. A few years ago, there were a handful of pioneering physicians and practices in this field. The centers that participated in the MERIT study were among the early adopters. The Mayo Clinic, UT Houston, Brigham and Women's, Cornell, and Johns Hopkins are all good examples, as well as some leading centers internationally that really have developed -- driven the development of this field. More recently, many new programs are emerging across the country in institutions such as the Cleveland Clinic, UCLA, USC, West Virginia, and USC and others. In recent months, I personally visited many of these centers that are highlighted on this page and it's very encouraging to hear about their plans to develop this emerging field of endoscopic weight loss. And this is just a U.S. snapshot. Similar phenomenon absolutely happening outside the U.S. in countries around the world as it'd become more familiar with the MERIT study and other data that's been collected for both primary ESG s and revision procedures, as well as for the intragastric balloon and the role of the ORBERA balloon with the new AGA practice guidelines. So it's [Indiscernible] development one that we'll keep an eye on.  So turning now to our organization, I mentioned right up front that we are retooling up all those people, processes, and culture to meet our aspirations. Our new commercial leadership team is creating a professional selling organization, new sales processes. We've hired a new director of sales training. We're improving our analytics and CRM capabilities. We've also recently brought on Cooley to lead the reimbursement and market access efforts and we're also and we are rallying organization around a new culture that centers on five core values: we are patient - centric, we're customer-focused, we are innovative, we are passionate, and we care.  We care about all of our stakeholders and we care about delivering operational excellence. And we are working to build an organization that can deliver sustainable growth in the years ahead. So before we move to the Q&A, I'd like to take a moment to recognize Dr. Bruce Robertson from HIG Capital for his tremendous service to Apollo Endosurgery and our Board of Directors for more than 14 years. Bruce participated in the very first institutional investment round for the company in 2008, and has served on our board since then.  He's been instrumental in guiding the company through its formative stages and getting us to the point where we are today. In addition, Bruce has been a fantastic colleague and advisor for me in my first year as CEO. Bruce has decided to step down due to other commitments, and we wish him well. We're conducting a board search process and look forward to providing updates soon. It's on closing. In 2021, we made excellent progress in energizing the business and building the foundation for future growth. I am -- I anticipate that over the course of 2022, we'll begin to transition from this initial energized phase of our strategy. We have multiple catalyst s for growth across our product lines and geographies, and we're putting in place the right team, the right processes, the right culture to meet our aspirations. Thank you for your time today and for your interest in Apollo. And we'll now open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is open for questions. [Operator Instructions]. The first question is coming from Josh Jennings from Cowen. Your line is live.\nEric Assaraf: Hi, this is Eric on for Josh. Thanks for taking the questions. I appreciate all the great commentary around the early experience with X-Tack. Just curious, as you get closer to European approval here, could you help us understand what would be included in your CE mark submission. And then is any of your U.S. regulatory work leverageable for attaining that CE mark. Thank you.\nCharles McKhann: Yeah, no. Thanks, Eric. Yes, under the new NDR requirements, there's obviously additional need for clinical data. So we have been able to leverage some of the data that was included in our initial clinical study that's been published, as well as a lot of the work that went into the U.S. application. As I'm sure, you know, in the past, having an FDA approval, it'd be almost a slam dunk, right? To quickly follow on in U.S. first. It really, right now, is just a timing element of as our notified body works through a backlog of applications from a lot of companies, but we think we've got the right materials that they need to get the approval.\nEric Assaraf: Understood. That's great. Thank you. And then thinking about guidance for 2022, could you help us understand what COVID assumptions you're baking into the range here. Jeff, your comments around trends in December, especially in the U.S. How should we be thinking about Q1 revenues relative to the results that you've just delivered here in the fourth quarter? Just any commentary on the cadence of revenue through the year would be really helpful. Thank you.\nJeff Black: Sure, Eric. And again, we haven't given quarterly guidance as you know, but I think it's consistent with what -- I think what you're hearing broadly in the industry is certainly early in the quarter, we saw pressured volumes, much like we saw in the fourth quarter. We're starting to see some of that abate. We're seeing nice momentum. But what we can say about the quarter is that we're certainly comfortable with where the street has us in terms of consensus for Q1. That in case, we start to think about the acceleration of the ramp to that 20% growth. That really happens once we get beyond the COVID impact and we start to see acceleration in some of these endobariatric practices.\nEric Assaraf: That's great. Thank you guys.\nOperator: Okay. The next question is coming from Matthew Blackman from Stifel. Your line is live.\nMatthew Blackman: All right. Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. Just got a couple. Maybe Charles, just to start with you, I was hoping to get the priorities in 2022 for the U.S. commercial team, whether it's figuring out the sales force size, whether it's focusing on existing accounts or expanding the customer base. I just want to understand what the focus is in '22. And if you could layer on top of that the folks that you've onboarded over the course of 2021, how they are ramping, how productivity for the whole sales force looks like. And then just a couple of quick follow-ups.\nCharles McKhann: Sure. Matt, as I think, you know, we have our core reps and the vast majority of our sales team in the U.S. carry the full bag of all three products, and then we've now layered on regional endobariatric managers that are focused on the opportunity in that area. And so for the first group, their priorities, if you look across product lines, we think we still have excellent opportunities to continue to identify and train new users in OverStitch, and they're doing that. But also driving additional usage in our existing base. That's a very important focus. For X-Tack, it's -- the strategy we laid out last year of continuing to be quite focused on a targeted set of accounts, and really driving the model of increasing adoption remains a priority for us.  And as I just alluded to the importance of being able to do that across multiple users in both upper and lower GI is a real focus for that group. And then another focus, I'd say is to sell the whole bag. We've got some of our reps who are very good at selling ORBERA, and some who've got less experience in it. And I think given what we're seeing already in the marketplace of a nice bounce for that product, we've got a lot of share learnings on it that I think is going to help our sales organization expand the product across some regions that have had a lot of success, and make that more consistent. So we're pretty excited about the opportunities across each of those. And then for the -- these already [Indiscernible] roles I mentioned, we have a group of early adopters internally, we refer to as Wave 1 that's reference on one of the slides you saw. And to really learning from them, right? It's a mix of both academic and private practices. It's a mix of GIs and surgeons. So we got different models that are already having a lot of success across a range of endobariatric. So the balloon is big part of that, but then also some of the other procedures. So we're learning a lot about everything it takes to build and grow those kinds of practices, and then having a focus on what the next waves are going to look like. And we're just striking the right balance given the fact that we don't have any indication for the suture inside of it. But we absolutely to do a lot with the balloon, including those co-margin programs I mentioned.\nMatthew Blackman: Got it. I appreciate that and I'll just ask one more. I'm curious, you've called out the top ten accounts, something like greater than 600,000 in revenue. Are those accounts using multiple products within the APEN portfolio? Or is it largely driven by one product? I'm obviously trying to get at to what opportunity there may be to cross-sell. And obviously, as you've mentioned before, how you could turn that into a playbook for the rest of your accounts.\nCharles McKhann: I think you see there's a mix of accounts in there. Some of that are pretty broad-based, some of the larger academic settings that truly are using a whole range of the products, and really incorporating X-Tack into that as well. So you've got all three products that are involved. And then you've got some that are more endobariatric accounts that absolutely will use both the Balloon and OverStitch, probably not likely to use a lot of X-Tack, because the applications are more limited in that setting.\nMatthew Blackman: Got it. Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Okay. The next question is coming from Adam Maeder from Piper Sandler. Your line is live.\nAdam Maeder: Hey, Charles, hey, Jeff. Thanks for taking the questions here and congrats on a nice year. Wanted to start with the guidance and see if we can just deconstruct that a little bit further particularly by segment. Just curious to get some additional color on how you think about the ESS franchise versus the balloon business in 2022. And if you're willing to kind of put any color around contribution from X-Tack, maybe we can start there and then I had a follow-up or two. Thanks.\nCharles McKhann: Yeah, I know. Thanks, Adam. You know what? As we look across, we see each product can continue to contribute to growth. Thinking in order a little bit, I think the -- on the balloon side, I think we're still learning frankly in terms of sustainable elements of growth and what it can deliver, but we're encouraged. Obviously, we had a very good year last year. I'm not -- we're not planning for another year of 50% growth, but I'd be nice. But we do think it can be a sustainable contributor, which given the history for the product line would be a really good outcome. And so we're looking at that, and as we implement more of these programs and get more one-way with it, we'll have more to build on to say sort of the level of sustainable growth. And then we see, I think, a good balanced contribution then across the other two products. Good opportunities with X-Tack here in the U.S., and then layering on depending on the timing of approvals outside the U.S., and so that can absolutely be out there both this year and beyond. And then a lot of excitement, obviously around OverStitch, both the core GI applications we continue to add new users there. And the opportunities as the year progresses on the weight loss side. And again, that I mentioned before, we really are trying to be appropriate and have the right level of where we're not the folks promoting the aspects around the weight loss side for OverStitch until we have the right indication.\nJeff Black: Yes, Adam. Just to add to that, as you think about it, as we think about our long-term growth play, and we talked about this 20-plus percent long-term CAGR, I think you need to think about it as, yes, as OverStitch and X-Tack being the outsized growers relative to that 20% and ORBERA likely being behind that, but that's really how you get to the blended growth of 20 plus percent. If that's helpful.\nAdam Maeder: Yes, that's helpful color guys. And maybe just a quick follow-up on that, and then if I could squeeze in a third, I'll try my luck. But for the follow-up, wondering if you guys can put a finer point on ESG in revision, FDA approval timing. Any finer point or specific quarter where we should expect those to come on label? And then is there anything in terms of the guidance that you've had -- that you have issued $73 million to $75 million that currently contemplates revenue directly associated to those indications? Thanks.\nCharles McKhann: Yes. So when we submitted the application for the De Novo 510(k), I think even in the press release, Adam, we mentioned that, we had one of our outside law firms do an analysis that says on average, the De novo 5 10(K) takes 12 months. And each one is unique because there is no predicate. And we're working through the process, but we've mentally prepared ourselves for that kind of a timeline, which would put you in the second half of the year from a timing standpoint. But there's uncertainty around that, and we're going to do everything we can to move it along and support the process, hopefully to a successful conclusion. From that vantage point, given that kind of timeline, we haven't put a hockey stick kind of ramp into the sort of back half of our year, although we do know that even just general awareness in the community is having somewhat of a lift effect. So again, we're playing our role appropriately, but we do see a broader awareness about weight loss and endoscopic procedures, and people are coming to us interested about it. So -- and we can appropriately do things like training on the suturing techniques. But again, we're trying to be careful here.\nAdam Maeder: Okay. Really helpful, Chas. And just the last one if I may, just gross margin. Jeff, I think you gave some helpful puts and takes in the prepared remarks. But just want to kind of flush that out a little bit more. I think you have the mid 60s number in the slide deck over the next three to five years. Do we straight-line that from where we currently are to get there? Is it going to be a bit lumpy? Or I guess just trying to figure out exactly how we think about 2022 gross margin if you're willing to quantify to any extent. Thanks so much, guys. Appreciate it.\nJeff Black: Sure. Yes, Adam. Thinking about '22, we haven't given specific guidance, but we will see expansion. I think it's more of an evolution of the margin and not a step change. I think that's the way you need to think about it. There's still a lot that we're working through in terms of the planning for the launch of new products, the configurations, pricing considerations, a lot to really think about in terms of what might drive longer-term margin. I think you think about '22 margin and even really '23 is more of a gradual evolution.\nAdam Maeder: Okay, got it. That's helpful. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Okay. The next question is coming from Matt Hewitt from Craig - Hallum. Matt, your line is live.\nMatt Hewitt: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the questions and congratulations on the progress in '21. Maybe first up, and I don't know if this is a metric that you can provide or if you're going to focus on other areas. But as far as X-Tack accounts, where did the year end up? And as you look at '22, is it more about driving utilization and focusing on the quality of the accounts or is it still about grabbing new greenfield opportunities within new accounts entirely?\nCharles McKhann: Matt, I think the overall, it's still very much about the quality aspects. We do view this as a product that can be used quite widespread, but there are definitely learnings about the learning curve and nuances to even just, especially for people who aren't used to suturing. And it's much simpler than OverStitch, but it is for some of the alternative procedures are doing nothing. And so we want to make sure that people understand the product and how to use it well. And so we've got a heavy focus on a targeted set of accounts that are using the product -- sorry, that are doing these kinds of procedures at high volumes, and they are the primary focus for our sales organization. It doesn't mean we're not opening other additional accounts, but again, we really are trying to focus on that utilization metric because I think many people who have been involved with launches where you try to get out too quickly, get out to a lot of institutions or you're not getting the traction you want to get from a utilization standpoint, that continues to be a big focus with the team. We will continue then to build and grow over time by kind of the utilization first strategy in terms of how we do it.\nMatt Hewitt: That's helpful. And I guess along those lines and I really, as it might be a little bit early, but as the year progresses or as we maybe start looking at '23, will you start providing some utilization trends even if just high level to help us recognize the ramp that you're seeing within accounts.\nCharles McKhann: Yeah. Matt, it's a fair question. I think the answer is possibly. It's a competitively sensitive product as well. So we're trying to be as guarded as we can around how much we actually offer. But to the extent that we can continue to share more of our key metrics without compromising some of that, we'll do that. I mean, we try to lay out as an example our sequential percentage growth, 40%, we saw 20% increase in number of ordering accounts. And clearly, you probably don't have a good view on the baseline, but we're trying to give you what we can without sort of compromising some of the competitive sensitivity.\nMatt Hewitt: Completely understand, thank you. And then maybe one last one. Is there any update on the status of the Nash trial as far as timing or plans, whether or not there would just be ORBERA or whether we would include OverStitch? Any color on that process will be helpful. Thank you.\nCharles McKhann: Yeah. Now, Matt, it's a good question and one that we are working through, frankly. It's -- we've been with some experts in both the GI side of things and the hepatology side of things to really work through the learnings that have gone into recent trials in the NASH area. As I'm sure you're aware, there have been tens of trials, multiple trials on the drug side, many of which haven't been very successful. And so we're really trying to learn from those, while also taking a hard look at the data that we have for both Balloons and ESG, right? As we are collecting some additional data, you know MERIT has data on comorbidities, liver function was not one of them. But we've got some other studies in Europe that have reported some initial data that looks interesting.  And then you wrap in that there is still a whole ongoing set of discussions with CMS about exactly what their coverage policies might be for new technologies. The previous MCIT doesn't look like it's going forward, but they're talking about new versions of what they might do. So for all those reasons, we're taking a pretty deliberate approach to whether it's one product or both products, it's a one trial or multiple trials. As a small company, we probably only get one chance to get this right, so we're measuring twice, cut once approach here intentionally because there's just a lot of moving parts.\nMatt Hewitt: I completely understand. All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. The next question is coming from Frank Takkinen from Lake Street Capital Markets. Your line is live.\nFrank Takkinen: Chas, Jeff, congrats on all progress. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask a couple more on the top 10 accounts. First, can you comment on how many of those top 10 are endobariatric -specific. And then 2, my assumption is there's been a little mix in the composition of those top 10 accounts. Can you comment on what's driving that, whether that's the OverStitch account and introduced X-Tack or endobariatric accounts that's growing quicker than the rest of the account base. Just any color around how the composition has changed and why would be great.\nCharles McKhann: Yeah. Then I would say the majority do fall under that category of endobariatric or at least where endobariatric is a significant portion of what they do. And so that's an important element. Some of those will also be doing some of the core GI procedures, so they may, as I said in fact be using X-Tack as well. And so I think we do have some where it's kind of all in, and you've got both -- all three product lines contributing to that growth. But I would say a number of them, and probably the majority is primarily being driven by the balloon and OverStitch at that level, right. Really driving sort of those, as I mentioned, $600,000 volumes. Those are typically when you have institutions that really are embracing the role for endoscopic therapies on the weight loss side. Again, with the balloon often being a big part of that.\nFrank Takkinen: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then two in the operating expense region. First, how do we think about sales force growth for 2022? And then secondly, thinking about just broad business investments sounds like that's going to take up pretty aggressively now that you have the funds to do so. Where should we expect to see that most in the operating expense structure?\nJeff Black: Yeah, Frank, good question. I think the first question on the sales force growth, we ramped up to about 30 by the end of the year. We've made some incremental hires throughout the course of the first quarter. I think where we are now is that we were really more focused on making sure that the existing sales force is trained up and that they begin to ramp up and we start to see the programs that are working, the ones that aren't, and adjust. And so I think you'll definitely see a bit of a ramp in hiring Q1, and we'll probably start to see another ramp later in the year. So I think as as you start to think about sales and marketing expenses ramping in the near term, it is some of the run rate from the larger commercial sales rep footprint. But then it's also the investment in the marketing type programs around endobariatric s that Charles walked you through. And then as you think about investments beyond sales and marketing, the reimbursement initiatives, bringing Keely on board and building out that team, some of the clinical initiatives in terms of a deeper dive on X-Tack publications and NASH strategy that we hope we'll get more clarity on by the end of the year, and then across the R&D product portfolio, COGS improvement, it really is in many cases just really making up for some level of under-investment historically.\nCharles McKhann: Just one more thing on the salesforce. Just to give you an order of magnitude, Frank. Last year, we -- this is U.S. I'm talking about. We almost doubled the sales force to about 30. I'd say order of magnitude by the end of the year of 2022 will be in the range of call it 40 to 45. We're not looking to double again. Now, that could change. Things take off and we're going to evaluate that as we go. But just to give you a sense of our thinking, it's not doubling again. It's continuing to grow and split some of the larger territories continue to get depth in some of the markets where we know we can drive growth with our current footprint. While in parallel, we're going to evaluate the overall footprint. I mentioned these regional endobariatric managers. That's almost like a pilot, right? To see what that role, how it contributes, how it complements the existing roles, in advance of the newer indication. And so we'll see the exact structure and size as the year goes on.\nFrank Takkinen: Got it. That's helpful. I'll stop there. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Chris Cooley from Stephens. Your line is live.\nBen Bienvenu: Hi. This is Ben on for Chris. Thanks for taking the question just a quick one for us. Given the current inflationary environment and your prior comments around potentially passing on price, I was just wondering if you could provide some additional color around any potential timing on those price uptakes. And then really how we can think about volume growth moving forward, if you do implement those. Thank you.\nCharles McKhann: Hi, Ben. So for OverStitch, we did take a price increase at beginning of the year. We have in the past taken a cost of living increase. It was modestly higher this year in light of the inflationary environment that we see, and so that was certainly part of our planning. And so we implemented that really at the start of the year. Jeff was alluding to also as we get the new indication and the new products, how exactly we price those in the marketplace is still something we're working through when that plays into things like some of our reimbursement strategies and other areas. So that determination will be more closely tied to the roll-out of the new products, and the systems as it were for ESG and revisions, which will certainly in the back half of the year or even beyond as we kind of think through that aspect of it.\nOperator: Thank you. I'd now like to turn the floor back to management for any closing remarks.\nJeff Black: Awesome. Thanks again, folks for joining us. We really appreciate it. Very gratified with the progress we made in 2021 and looking forward to an exciting year ahead and thank you for your interest and the follow-up.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Charles McKhann",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt. And thank everyone, good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. Next week will mark one year since I joined Apollo Endosurgery. And I am truly grateful for having the honor of leading this team and this company with such unique products that impact patients' lives. Last year, I laid out a three-phase strategy as described on page 3. The first phase was to energize the business by building momentum across all three of our product lines while executing on foundational initiatives that can set us up for growth in the years ahead.  The second phase is to accelerate the business by developing new indications in markets. And the third phase is to lead in the fields of advanced defect closure and as endoscopic treatments for weight loss. As we implement this strategy, we have bolstered the Apollo leadership team by bringing in new talent into the organization to join an already strong Apollo team. And in addition, we are focusing our efforts on developing large market opportunities.  I'm pleased to report today that in the past 12 months and in Q4 that we've made tremendous progress, which strengthened the team at Apollo at all levels. At the leadership team earlier in the year, we brought on new commercial leaders here in the U.S., we brought in Jeff Black as our new CFO who's with me today. And then just in January, we announced the addition of Keely Scamperle to lead our reimbursement and market access efforts. Keely is an experienced professional and is already working at building her team that will lead our reimbursement efforts in facilitating patient access for our products.  We've nearly doubled our sales team in the U.S. and we've added to our OUS team. We're building our marketing and trading capabilities and becoming a more professional selling organization. We strengthened our R&D and engineering team and are implementing new processes to strengthening our new product pipeline. And we are addressing a historical underinvestment in other critical functions like operations, supply chain, business analytics, and customer service. Simply put, we have very talented people at Apollo and I'm very proud of the work that they've done. We've just not had a scalable organization.  And so we're strengthening our capabilities across the organization to support our growth plans. We're also building and developing a new culture, focusing on a set of five core values that I'll come back to later in the discussion. And so in summary, at Apollo, we're undergoing substantial change in our team, our processes, and our culture. And we anticipate that these changes will allow the company that has historically struggled at times and underperformed to become a growth engine. Now, often when a company undergoes this much change, the business often needs to take a step backwards before moving ahead with renewed confidence. And I'm very pleased that that is not the case for Apollo in 2021. For the year, we delivered 50% revenue growth, and for Q4, we delivered 26% growth. Despite a meaningful impact of the omicron variant in many markets in Western Europe and the U.S.., our growth has been balanced across product lines with OverStitch, ORBERA, and our newest product, X-Tack, all contributing to growth. And we've seen balanced growth across geographies with strong performance in both the U.S. and international markets. And while we kick-started the business in 2021, we've also created a foundation for the years ahead. In our advanced GI franchise, X-Tack is an important new product for us.  We gained initial traction in the marketplace and published the first clinical data for the product. In our endoscopic weight loss franchise, obesity is a global epidemic that remains largely unchecked and the opportunity for endoscopic weight loss therapies is tremendous. 2021 was a year of important strategic milestones. Early in the year, in the spring of last year, the AGA implemented new clinical practice guidelines for the first time ever in favor of intragastric balloons therapies. The MERIT investigators presented the initial results at the IPSO meeting in the fall.  We submitted a new De Novo application, De Novo 510(k) application for Apollo ESG and Apollo REVISE. And through the course of the year, we saw an emergence of new endobariatric programs in both academic and private practice settings. In the area of NASH, we received a breakthrough designation for ORBERA for the treatment of NASH in Q1 of last year. We've also been collecting data on ESG, and working through the best strategy to address this large market opportunity. And then on our balance sheet. In 2021, we secured access to a $175 million in capital. We now have a strong balance sheet to support our growth initiatives. And so Page 5 gives you a sense of the balance that I just mentioned. On the left side of the page, you can see 50% year-on-year revenue growth, 55% for the ESS franchise. And importantly, 50% for the IGB franchise. And the figures relative to 2019 are shown as well. Another interesting development has been the growth in our top 10 accounts.  We saw 85% year-on-year growth in our top 10 accounts. And the average sales for Apollo in those 10 accounts is more than $600,000. And we think that gives a pretty good indication of the scale that we can drive as we increase penetration into -- of our products into our largest customers. For X-Tack, we continue to gain traction and we saw 40% sequential quarter-on-quarter growth for X-Tack. And as I mentioned, we're already hit -- we had important milestones for both the MERIT study and the De Novo 510(k). Related to MERIT and clinical data for ESG and revisions, we do expect a conditional presentations of the data at the upcoming DDW meeting. That's the Digestive Disease Week meeting that's in May. We also expect other publications on -- I'm sorry, presentations at that meeting on ESG and revisions from investigators around the world, sort of important additions to the clinical body of evidence. For MERIT itself, the investigators are working on the publication and we look forward to that in the months ahead. Jeff will now provide a review of our financial performance, and I will be back to provide additional commentary on our priorities for the year ahead. Okay. Now as we look ahead to the year of 2022, let me talk about our overall strategy and our outlook for the year ahead. Page 13 gives you a summary of our three product lines and the two main businesses in which we operate: an advanced GI and endoscopic weight loss. And we are excited that we have very attractive growth opportunities across both sides of our business. As I mentioned previously, we also are focused on going after large market opportunities in advanced GI, in weight loss, and then over time in NASH as well.  So for the year ahead, our outlook from a revenue standpoint is $73 million to $75 million, which translates to 16% to 19% growth compared to 202. And let me also share a few words as it relates to the COVID impact. In Q4 and early Q1 of this year, we have seen an impact in markets globally. As others have reported lower procedure volumes, staffing issues, reduced hospital access, have all presented challenges, especially in larger academic medical centers and community hospital. That said, more recently, the omicron case counts are coming down, the situation appears to be improving. And so we are optimistic that the impact of this wave is beginning to abate. And so as we look ahead for 2022, we see four key catalysts to drive our growth in the year ahead. X-Tack expansion and ORBERA resurgence, preparing for the Apollo ESG and Apollo Revise launches, and continuing to advance our organization. The first with X-Tack, and I'm on Slide 16. The X-Tack has been a very important product for us as it adds to our portfolio in the advanced GI side of our business, and it offers a truly differentiated product in defect closure. And with X-Tack, we're still in the early days of the adoption of the new product and procedure, and we feel that we've got a lot of room to continue to grow.  For example, currently more than 60% of our X-Tack sales are in upper GI. There are many reasons for this. Our OverStitch device, which is the core device for the company, is used primarily in the upper GI. And so many of our existing customers primarily due upper GI procedures and are familiar with suturing techniques. Furthermore, for most of 2021, we had a very small sales team in the U.S., and it's not surprising that they had more success with our existing customers initially in applications in the upper GI. That said, we continue to see very positive feedback from customers about the role of X-Tack following pulp removal and lower GI cases such as the colon and the duodenum. And procedure volumes suggests that ultimately these applications have potential to do much and much larger market opportunity.  And so in 2022, we anticipated that we can continue to expand usage in both upper and lower GI, approach and train new users, and increase adoption of X-Tack. Importantly, 2022 will also be a year where we add additional clinical data for X-Tack.  To date, the data is strong but it's very limited. We anticipate additional studies on the use of X-Tack, including at the same up DDW meeting that I mentioned in areas like the colon [Indiscernible] and stent fixation and other potential applications for the product. In addition, we are ramping up our efforts in peer-to-peer education for X-Tack. The best way for physicians to learn about a new products or procedure is from their colleagues. And we've done some peer-to-peer education to date, but we are ramping up these efforts as part of our strategy in 2022. And we also have a significant growth opportunity for X-Tack outside the U.S. We've gained initial success in a handful of markets outside the U.S., and we are actively working towards a CE mark, which we expect in the second half of this year. And for feedback from physicians, for example, in Western Europe, they are very excited about the clinical and economic value proposition for X-Tack in their practice. Turning to Slide 17 in ORBERA. ORBERA as a meaningful part of the Apollo portfolio and offers compelling clinical benefits for patients. And 2021 was a very strong year for ORBERA. It accounts for more than a third of our total revenue and grew by more than 50%. And there are a number reasons for this resurgence and many of these we view as sustainable trends.  First, as it relates to COVID, we have seen a trend towards more procedures taking place in outpatient facilities and offices, which is the primary location for ORBERA. I mentioned earlier the AGA practice guidelines. And again, those talked about the clinical benefits of intragastric balloons in general, but especially the clinical benefits of a 10% total body weight loss on cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and liver function. So really adding to the clinical validation of the product. We've seen an uptick in physician interest and training on the balloon. And we are implementing new co-marketing programs. These are programs where we can work directly with practices that know how to treat patients with balloons and get excellent patient outcomes. And we can invest in these, we can track the performance, and then double-down on the programs that are most successful.  Finally, we anticipate a continued opportunity for intragastric balloons to be a meaningful part of a broader endoscopic endobariatric practice, endoscopic weight loss practice. And I'll come back to that here in a minute. But a lot of good things happening to the intragastric balloon franchise. The next catalyst which we've talked about previously is the potential for a new indication for the Apollo ESG and the Apollo REVISE products. Now importantly, we don't currently have an indication for these weight loss applications, and we are very careful to only promote within our approve labeling. But we have submitted to FDA and we're working through that process, and we are very excited about the potential for a launch of Apollo ESG and Apollo REVISE. and I use the word launch very intentionally here.  I want you to think about this like a new product launch. You hear about it in the pharmaceutical world, or you hear about from a large medical device manufacturer, in terms of our comprehensive, holistic approach to really maximize the opportunity for the product. Internally, we have a massive effort ongoing in areas across marketing and medical education, training, reimbursement and market access, and sales team readiness to prepare ourselves for the ultimate launch of these new products. Our team is very busy and they're very excited. And while we're busy preparing for the launches internally, there's an interesting dynamic in development taking place more broadly in the medical community. The growth of new endobariatric programs in academic settings. A few years ago, there were a handful of pioneering physicians and practices in this field. The centers that participated in the MERIT study were among the early adopters. The Mayo Clinic, UT Houston, Brigham and Women's, Cornell, and Johns Hopkins are all good examples, as well as some leading centers internationally that really have developed -- driven the development of this field. More recently, many new programs are emerging across the country in institutions such as the Cleveland Clinic, UCLA, USC, West Virginia, and USC and others. In recent months, I personally visited many of these centers that are highlighted on this page and it's very encouraging to hear about their plans to develop this emerging field of endoscopic weight loss. And this is just a U.S. snapshot. Similar phenomenon absolutely happening outside the U.S. in countries around the world as it'd become more familiar with the MERIT study and other data that's been collected for both primary ESG s and revision procedures, as well as for the intragastric balloon and the role of the ORBERA balloon with the new AGA practice guidelines. So it's [Indiscernible] development one that we'll keep an eye on.  So turning now to our organization, I mentioned right up front that we are retooling up all those people, processes, and culture to meet our aspirations. Our new commercial leadership team is creating a professional selling organization, new sales processes. We've hired a new director of sales training. We're improving our analytics and CRM capabilities. We've also recently brought on Cooley to lead the reimbursement and market access efforts and we're also and we are rallying organization around a new culture that centers on five core values: we are patient - centric, we're customer-focused, we are innovative, we are passionate, and we care.  We care about all of our stakeholders and we care about delivering operational excellence. And we are working to build an organization that can deliver sustainable growth in the years ahead. So before we move to the Q&A, I'd like to take a moment to recognize Dr. Bruce Robertson from HIG Capital for his tremendous service to Apollo Endosurgery and our Board of Directors for more than 14 years. Bruce participated in the very first institutional investment round for the company in 2008, and has served on our board since then.  He's been instrumental in guiding the company through its formative stages and getting us to the point where we are today. In addition, Bruce has been a fantastic colleague and advisor for me in my first year as CEO. Bruce has decided to step down due to other commitments, and we wish him well. We're conducting a board search process and look forward to providing updates soon. It's on closing. In 2021, we made excellent progress in energizing the business and building the foundation for future growth. I am -- I anticipate that over the course of 2022, we'll begin to transition from this initial energized phase of our strategy. We have multiple catalyst s for growth across our product lines and geographies, and we're putting in place the right team, the right processes, the right culture to meet our aspirations. Thank you for your time today and for your interest in Apollo. And we'll now open the line for questions. Yeah, no. Thanks, Eric. Yes, under the new NDR requirements, there's obviously additional need for clinical data. So we have been able to leverage some of the data that was included in our initial clinical study that's been published, as well as a lot of the work that went into the U.S. application. As I'm sure, you know, in the past, having an FDA approval, it'd be almost a slam dunk, right? To quickly follow on in U.S. first. It really, right now, is just a timing element of as our notified body works through a backlog of applications from a lot of companies, but we think we've got the right materials that they need to get the approval. Sure. Matt, as I think, you know, we have our core reps and the vast majority of our sales team in the U.S. carry the full bag of all three products, and then we've now layered on regional endobariatric managers that are focused on the opportunity in that area. And so for the first group, their priorities, if you look across product lines, we think we still have excellent opportunities to continue to identify and train new users in OverStitch, and they're doing that. But also driving additional usage in our existing base. That's a very important focus. For X-Tack, it's -- the strategy we laid out last year of continuing to be quite focused on a targeted set of accounts, and really driving the model of increasing adoption remains a priority for us.  And as I just alluded to the importance of being able to do that across multiple users in both upper and lower GI is a real focus for that group. And then another focus, I'd say is to sell the whole bag. We've got some of our reps who are very good at selling ORBERA, and some who've got less experience in it. And I think given what we're seeing already in the marketplace of a nice bounce for that product, we've got a lot of share learnings on it that I think is going to help our sales organization expand the product across some regions that have had a lot of success, and make that more consistent. So we're pretty excited about the opportunities across each of those. And then for the -- these already [Indiscernible] roles I mentioned, we have a group of early adopters internally, we refer to as Wave 1 that's reference on one of the slides you saw. And to really learning from them, right? It's a mix of both academic and private practices. It's a mix of GIs and surgeons. So we got different models that are already having a lot of success across a range of endobariatric. So the balloon is big part of that, but then also some of the other procedures. So we're learning a lot about everything it takes to build and grow those kinds of practices, and then having a focus on what the next waves are going to look like. And we're just striking the right balance given the fact that we don't have any indication for the suture inside of it. But we absolutely to do a lot with the balloon, including those co-margin programs I mentioned. I think you see there's a mix of accounts in there. Some of that are pretty broad-based, some of the larger academic settings that truly are using a whole range of the products, and really incorporating X-Tack into that as well. So you've got all three products that are involved. And then you've got some that are more endobariatric accounts that absolutely will use both the Balloon and OverStitch, probably not likely to use a lot of X-Tack, because the applications are more limited in that setting. Yeah, I know. Thanks, Adam. You know what? As we look across, we see each product can continue to contribute to growth. Thinking in order a little bit, I think the -- on the balloon side, I think we're still learning frankly in terms of sustainable elements of growth and what it can deliver, but we're encouraged. Obviously, we had a very good year last year. I'm not -- we're not planning for another year of 50% growth, but I'd be nice. But we do think it can be a sustainable contributor, which given the history for the product line would be a really good outcome. And so we're looking at that, and as we implement more of these programs and get more one-way with it, we'll have more to build on to say sort of the level of sustainable growth. And then we see, I think, a good balanced contribution then across the other two products. Good opportunities with X-Tack here in the U.S., and then layering on depending on the timing of approvals outside the U.S., and so that can absolutely be out there both this year and beyond. And then a lot of excitement, obviously around OverStitch, both the core GI applications we continue to add new users there. And the opportunities as the year progresses on the weight loss side. And again, that I mentioned before, we really are trying to be appropriate and have the right level of where we're not the folks promoting the aspects around the weight loss side for OverStitch until we have the right indication. Yes. So when we submitted the application for the De Novo 510(k), I think even in the press release, Adam, we mentioned that, we had one of our outside law firms do an analysis that says on average, the De novo 5 10(K) takes 12 months. And each one is unique because there is no predicate. And we're working through the process, but we've mentally prepared ourselves for that kind of a timeline, which would put you in the second half of the year from a timing standpoint. But there's uncertainty around that, and we're going to do everything we can to move it along and support the process, hopefully to a successful conclusion. From that vantage point, given that kind of timeline, we haven't put a hockey stick kind of ramp into the sort of back half of our year, although we do know that even just general awareness in the community is having somewhat of a lift effect. So again, we're playing our role appropriately, but we do see a broader awareness about weight loss and endoscopic procedures, and people are coming to us interested about it. So -- and we can appropriately do things like training on the suturing techniques. But again, we're trying to be careful here. Matt, I think the overall, it's still very much about the quality aspects. We do view this as a product that can be used quite widespread, but there are definitely learnings about the learning curve and nuances to even just, especially for people who aren't used to suturing. And it's much simpler than OverStitch, but it is for some of the alternative procedures are doing nothing. And so we want to make sure that people understand the product and how to use it well. And so we've got a heavy focus on a targeted set of accounts that are using the product -- sorry, that are doing these kinds of procedures at high volumes, and they are the primary focus for our sales organization. It doesn't mean we're not opening other additional accounts, but again, we really are trying to focus on that utilization metric because I think many people who have been involved with launches where you try to get out too quickly, get out to a lot of institutions or you're not getting the traction you want to get from a utilization standpoint, that continues to be a big focus with the team. We will continue then to build and grow over time by kind of the utilization first strategy in terms of how we do it. Yeah. Matt, it's a fair question. I think the answer is possibly. It's a competitively sensitive product as well. So we're trying to be as guarded as we can around how much we actually offer. But to the extent that we can continue to share more of our key metrics without compromising some of that, we'll do that. I mean, we try to lay out as an example our sequential percentage growth, 40%, we saw 20% increase in number of ordering accounts. And clearly, you probably don't have a good view on the baseline, but we're trying to give you what we can without sort of compromising some of the competitive sensitivity. Yeah. Now, Matt, it's a good question and one that we are working through, frankly. It's -- we've been with some experts in both the GI side of things and the hepatology side of things to really work through the learnings that have gone into recent trials in the NASH area. As I'm sure you're aware, there have been tens of trials, multiple trials on the drug side, many of which haven't been very successful. And so we're really trying to learn from those, while also taking a hard look at the data that we have for both Balloons and ESG, right? As we are collecting some additional data, you know MERIT has data on comorbidities, liver function was not one of them. But we've got some other studies in Europe that have reported some initial data that looks interesting.  And then you wrap in that there is still a whole ongoing set of discussions with CMS about exactly what their coverage policies might be for new technologies. The previous MCIT doesn't look like it's going forward, but they're talking about new versions of what they might do. So for all those reasons, we're taking a pretty deliberate approach to whether it's one product or both products, it's a one trial or multiple trials. As a small company, we probably only get one chance to get this right, so we're measuring twice, cut once approach here intentionally because there's just a lot of moving parts. Yeah. Then I would say the majority do fall under that category of endobariatric or at least where endobariatric is a significant portion of what they do. And so that's an important element. Some of those will also be doing some of the core GI procedures, so they may, as I said in fact be using X-Tack as well. And so I think we do have some where it's kind of all in, and you've got both -- all three product lines contributing to that growth. But I would say a number of them, and probably the majority is primarily being driven by the balloon and OverStitch at that level, right. Really driving sort of those, as I mentioned, $600,000 volumes. Those are typically when you have institutions that really are embracing the role for endoscopic therapies on the weight loss side. Again, with the balloon often being a big part of that. Just one more thing on the salesforce. Just to give you an order of magnitude, Frank. Last year, we -- this is U.S. I'm talking about. We almost doubled the sales force to about 30. I'd say order of magnitude by the end of the year of 2022 will be in the range of call it 40 to 45. We're not looking to double again. Now, that could change. Things take off and we're going to evaluate that as we go. But just to give you a sense of our thinking, it's not doubling again. It's continuing to grow and split some of the larger territories continue to get depth in some of the markets where we know we can drive growth with our current footprint. While in parallel, we're going to evaluate the overall footprint. I mentioned these regional endobariatric managers. That's almost like a pilot, right? To see what that role, how it contributes, how it complements the existing roles, in advance of the newer indication. And so we'll see the exact structure and size as the year goes on. Hi, Ben. So for OverStitch, we did take a price increase at beginning of the year. We have in the past taken a cost of living increase. It was modestly higher this year in light of the inflationary environment that we see, and so that was certainly part of our planning. And so we implemented that really at the start of the year. Jeff was alluding to also as we get the new indication and the new products, how exactly we price those in the marketplace is still something we're working through when that plays into things like some of our reimbursement strategies and other areas. So that determination will be more closely tied to the roll-out of the new products, and the systems as it were for ESG and revisions, which will certainly in the back half of the year or even beyond as we kind of think through that aspect of it."

            "name": "Jeff Black",
            "content": "Thank you, Charles, and good afternoon, everybody. Thank you all for joining us today. I'll spend a few minutes to recap our financial results and then to hand it back to Charles to discuss our 2022 outlook and strategy. Starting with revenue on Slide 7. In Q4, we continued to see strong year-over-year growth across the product portfolio, and our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. And that was against the backdrop of pandemic-related pressure. As we all know, this has been a changing dynamic throughout 2021, and we did see pressure on Q4 volumes.  Outside the U.S., we saw pressure earlier in the quarter in concentrated markets, particularly Western Europe. And inside the U.S., we began to see slowdowns later in the quarter, particularly December, predominantly in academic hospitals and larger community hospitals where access was more limited. Even with this pressure on procedure volumes, we still maintained a healthy monthly revenue cadence in December, consistent with the rest of the quarter where we didn't see was the ramp that we expected in the last half of December.  And that was really difference between hitting the low end of our annual revenue guidance and the high end or better. Growth in the fourth quarter was balanced between U.S., where we saw 25% growth, and international, which grew 27%. Globally, our endoscopic suturing business was up over 37% in the fourth quarter and that's just highlights continued demand for our OverStitch and X-Tack products across a broad range of indications. Globally, ORBERA revenue was up 20% and that was below our blended growth rate, really due to volume pressure in the U.S., where growth was about 6%. But we believe this down tick is transitory and that it was mostly attributed to inpatient in hospital settings in the U.S. where access was limited in Q4. For the full year, we saw revenue growth of 50% and a gained balanced across our U.S. or international businesses and across product lines. Overall, we're pleased with our revenue performance in 2021 and our ability to navigate a challenging fourth quarter for Medtech broadly. Turning to gross margin on Slide 8. In the fourth quarter, we saw gross margin improved by 40 basis points in -- versus fourth quarter of 2022, 260 basis points on a year-to-date basis. We continue to remain focused on gross margin improvements, particularly with OverStitch, which as we've discussed, had a lower margin profile than ORBERA and X-Tack. Major drivers of overall gross margin expansion will be product mix, improved overhead absorption, and direct cogs improvement programs, again, focused primarily on OverStitch.  During 2022, we should start to see the impact of some of the cost improvement initiatives that we completed in 2021. And at the same time, we're navigating supply chain and manufacturing scale-up complexities, but we remain confident in our ability to drive blended gross margin to the mid 60% range over the next three to five years. Moving to Slide 10 -- so moving to Slide 9. As we look at operating spend profile, we think it's important to exclude non-cash stock-based compensation to get a clearer picture of what our real non-core GAAP operating expense run rate is.  In the near-term, we're focused on building capabilities following historical underinvestment in the business. For example, you'll see in the fourth quarter, our non-GAAP OpEx ran at about 79% of revenue, that reflects our planned investments in growth initiatives, primarily to build out our U.S. sales channel and our marketing programs as we prepare for the anticipated launch of our ESG products. In the U.S., we have a small commercial team relative to the size of our opportunities, but we made great progress throughout 2021 to expand that footprint.  We started the year with 16 direct reps in the U.S. We ended with about 30 by the end of the fourth quarter. And going forward, we'll continue to evaluate the appropriate scale of our commercial team and invest as necessary. Our other focused areas of planned investment will be medical education, clinical reimbursement, product development, and continued COGS improvement initiatives. We do expect to see operating expenses increase in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue, particularly in 2022 and we should start to see operating expense leverage in 2023 and beyond. But I think importantly, we have the ability to modulate spend as appropriate. And we're now well positioned from a balance sheet perspective to make these investments. Moving to Slide 10, you'll see that during 2021, our average quarterly burn was about $4 million a quarter. We ended the year with cash of about $92 million. Until now, Apollo has not been capitalized to adequately fund our long-term plan. The company historically did a very nice job managing burn, particularly during a very challenging global pandemic. However, due to historical under-investment, the company really has not been well positioned to support even modest growth. That changed for us in the fourth quarter as we secured over $125 million in new capital and borrowing capacity, which enables us to begin making the investments required to capitalize on the opportunities we see ahead of us, and this -- we can do this without creating a concern about cash runway. We're now extremely well positioned to execute on our plan growth initiatives. Turning to Slide 11. And before I turn things back over to Charles, just a few comments on our new credit facility with Innovatus Capital Partners, which we executed in December of last year. Key terms of -- or key strategic reasons for the new term loan is a reduction in our cost of capital, an extension of our amortization by an additional 33 months over our prior-term loan, and a decrease in debt service costs by nearly $30 million over the next three years, we also have now additional borrowing capacity that provides [Indiscernible] and delusive growth capital, and strategic flexibility.  At close, we drew $35 million to repay our prior-term debt, and we now have up to $65 million available for future tranches, $15 million will be available in 2023 and $25 million available in 2024, both based on achievement of revenue milestones. And another up to $25 million available for approved strategic acquisitions is such opportunities to rise. Borrowings mature in December of 2027, interest-only payments run through January of 2027. This was a great result for us. We couldn't be happier with the outcome of this and we look forward to our new partnership with Innovatus. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Charles. Sure, Eric. And again, we haven't given quarterly guidance as you know, but I think it's consistent with what -- I think what you're hearing broadly in the industry is certainly early in the quarter, we saw pressured volumes, much like we saw in the fourth quarter. We're starting to see some of that abate. We're seeing nice momentum. But what we can say about the quarter is that we're certainly comfortable with where the street has us in terms of consensus for Q1. That in case, we start to think about the acceleration of the ramp to that 20% growth. That really happens once we get beyond the COVID impact and we start to see acceleration in some of these endobariatric practices. Yes, Adam. Just to add to that, as you think about it, as we think about our long-term growth play, and we talked about this 20-plus percent long-term CAGR, I think you need to think about it as, yes, as OverStitch and X-Tack being the outsized growers relative to that 20% and ORBERA likely being behind that, but that's really how you get to the blended growth of 20 plus percent. If that's helpful. Sure. Yes, Adam. Thinking about '22, we haven't given specific guidance, but we will see expansion. I think it's more of an evolution of the margin and not a step change. I think that's the way you need to think about it. There's still a lot that we're working through in terms of the planning for the launch of new products, the configurations, pricing considerations, a lot to really think about in terms of what might drive longer-term margin. I think you think about '22 margin and even really '23 is more of a gradual evolution. Yeah, Frank, good question. I think the first question on the sales force growth, we ramped up to about 30 by the end of the year. We've made some incremental hires throughout the course of the first quarter. I think where we are now is that we were really more focused on making sure that the existing sales force is trained up and that they begin to ramp up and we start to see the programs that are working, the ones that aren't, and adjust. And so I think you'll definitely see a bit of a ramp in hiring Q1, and we'll probably start to see another ramp later in the year. So I think as as you start to think about sales and marketing expenses ramping in the near term, it is some of the run rate from the larger commercial sales rep footprint. But then it's also the investment in the marketing type programs around endobariatric s that Charles walked you through. And then as you think about investments beyond sales and marketing, the reimbursement initiatives, bringing Keely on board and building out that team, some of the clinical initiatives in terms of a deeper dive on X-Tack publications and NASH strategy that we hope we'll get more clarity on by the end of the year, and then across the R&D product portfolio, COGS improvement, it really is in many cases just really making up for some level of under-investment historically. Awesome. Thanks again, folks for joining us. We really appreciate it. Very gratified with the progress we made in 2021 and looking forward to an exciting year ahead and thank you for your interest and the follow-up."

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Matt Kreps. Sir, the floor is yours.\nMatt Kreps: Thank you and thanks everyone for participating in today\u2019s call to discuss Apollo\u2019s third quarter 2021 financial and operating results. Joining me on the call are Charles McKhann, Chief Executive Officer and Jeff Black, our Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s call will include slides to accompany the audio presentation. For those of you joining us by telephone, you can download a copy of the slides at our Investor Relations site, ir.apolloendo.com in choosing Events and Presentations. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that comments made by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, including Apollo\u2019s financial outlook and Apollo\u2019s plans and timing for product development and sales. In addition, there is uncertainty about the continued spread of the COVID-19 virus and the ongoing impact it may have on our operations, the demand for our products, global supply chains and economic activity in general. These forward-looking statements involve material risks and uncertainties and Apollo\u2019s actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of risk factors, I encourage you to review the company\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2020 filed previously with the Securities and Exchange Commission and our most recent Form 10-Q. The content of this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of this live broadcast, November 1, 2021. Except as required by law Apollo undertakes no obligation to revise or update any statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call. Additionally, today\u2019s discussion will include certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide an additional tool for evaluating the company\u2019s core performance. Management uses these metrics in its own evaluation and continued operating performance and a baseline for assessing the future earnings potential of the company. Included in the press release issued today with our financial results and corresponding 8-K filing are supplemental tables reconciling non-GAAP figures to their closest GAAP comparable. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Charles.\nCharles McKhann: Thanks, Matt and thank you everyone for joining us this afternoon to discuss our results for the third quarter and participating in the webcast format as well. Today marks my 8-month anniversary since joining as CEO of Apollo. And so in addition to covering the quarter, I also want to give an update on what we have accomplished in the first 8 months and perspectives on where we are heading going forward. On the first call that I did after Q1, I laid out a strategy that we have been implementing over three phases to energize the business, put us in a position to then accelerate and then lead over time. And that has involved really forming a new leadership team that it takes the best of Apollo and great people that we had on board and then supplementing that with some key additions as we focus and go after some really large market opportunities. And so I am very pleased to then report today the progress that we have made. In that energized phase, the first phase of our growth strategy, we really talked about three main areas of focus: strengthening and revitalizing the team, delivering on near-term growth and building a foundation for future success. And as you can see on the slide, we are very pleased with the progress we have made across all three of them. On the team, we have made some additions to the leadership team, including Jeff Black, our CFO, who is with me here today, as well as additions to our sales and marketing organization. We also have been building out the team on the ground. We started \u2013 in the U.S. we had 16 sales reps, which was not enough frankly to adequately cover the large country that we have here. And so by the end of the year, we are projecting to have as many as 30 reps. And so a nice addition, including bringing back some experienced reps from Apollo as well as hiring others who are very experienced in the GI space. We have also made other targeted additions into key functions around the organization as we build to scale the business. And then we have also been very outwardly facing with our customers, spending time, meeting with them, talking about our plans for the future and really engaging and enrolling them in where we want to go with the business. Secondly, we have delivered on the near-term growth. We are very pleased with the results for the quarter, but also, if you look year-to-date, we have got 60% growth spread equally across our endoscopic suturing business and our intragasic balloons and also quite equally across U.S. and outside the U.S. So, the word I use, as I look at our growth so far this year it\u2019s balance, really nice balance across products and across geographies. And then the X-Tack launch has been a big component of that as well. And we are very pleased with the success of the X-Tack launch and the progress we are making and I will provide some updates there as well. And then all the while, we are building a foundation for future opportunities. Just about 10 days ago, we announced the results from the MERIT study at the IPSO meeting and I am going to touch on those. We also just this morning announced the first clinical publication for X-Tack. We have submitted the FDA a de novo 510(k) submission for Apollo ESG and Apollo revise, a critical step for us in developing a new indication for endoscopic weight loss for the OverStitch device. Early in the year, we got our breakthrough designation for the Orbera balloon for the treatment of NASH, and we continue to make progress on designing the path forward for a huge opportunity in front of us with NASH potentially. And then we also have the X-Tack approval that we\u2019ve received in Australia, which we\u2019ve already gotten the approval in some of the other markets around the world, but this is another important one and sets us up, we think, well, for more approvals outside the U.S. in the coming months. And then last, but certainly not least, we completed the fund base here in just a few weeks ago, which helped strengthen our balance sheet and positions us for future growth. So, some key metrics. As we look through the quarter, I mentioned already 60% year-on-year growth. Clearly, 2020 was a difficult and challenging year and also a strange comparison. So you can see 33% growth compared to 2019, equally spread across our ESS and IGB businesses and an issuing metric also that our top 10 accounts, direct accounts in both U.S. and outside the U.S. have grown 100% year-on-year, so really building nice depth while also expanding the breadth of our business in new accounts as well X-Tack, as I mentioned, is progressing well. And a key metric there is that in the third quarter, 72% of our sales came from utilization from reorders. And that\u2019s important because that\u2019s showing real usage, real utilization, while we also, in addition, continue to open additional accounts as well. We are very pleased with the publication for X-Tack that just came out. It\u2019s a multi-center trial, 93 patients, excellent centers involved, including the Meo, Johns Hopkins, New York University. So this is the first clinical publication for X-Tack. Remember, it\u2019s a very new product for us. And as you \u2013 if you had a chance to see the press release we issued today, demonstrated excellent efficacy and results in that publication. And then the MERIT trial, a big milestone for us, as I mentioned, was presented, and I will touch on that here in just a minute. So the MERIT study, I think many on the call are familiar with it, but if you\u2019re new to Apollo and are not, it is a randomized controlled trial of our ESG procedure, which utilizes the OverStitch device. So, ESG is an endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty. And this was a trial that was randomized to patients who receive ESG versus a standard of care of medically monitored diet and exercise. It enrolled 208 subjects with a BMI between 30 and 40. We have \u2013 are very thankful to the principal investigators, Dr. Barmabadeo from Ameo Clinic, a leading GI in the field; and Dr. Eric Wilson from the University of Texas or Houston, a leading surgeon. And so we have had a close partnership throughout the study on GI and surgeons. You can see the primary end points of the study on the page, excess body weight loss of at least 25% and safety, having a serious adverse event rate of less than 5%. We also importantly enrolled patients, a pre-specified number of patients with hypertension and patients with type 2 diabetes. Some of the highlights of the presentation that was made by Dr. Abada, again, at a virtual session from IFSO are presented here on this slide. We achieved a 49% excess body weight loss at 12 months or patients did who underwent ESG. That was compared to a target of 25%. And importantly, the targets were developed based off of a 2011 white paper that was developed by the ASGE, which is a gastroenterology society and the ASMBS, which is a surgical society. And they set out guidelines for endoscopic weight loss therapies and a target of at least a 25% excess body weight loss was used to set the primary end point. Importantly, there was a 45% difference in excess body weight loss compared to control versus a target of 15%. 77% of patients achieved at least a 25% excess body weight loss and the SAE rate as defined by the investigators was 2% and all patients recovered from those events. The \u2013 importantly, as you see on the right side of the page, we also exhibited very good durability in the study. So after 2 years, patients maintained the majority of the weight loss out to 2 years as well as the crossover patients who received ESG had excellent results. As I mentioned, one of the other key metrics or areas that we looked at in the study was the impact on comorbidities. And as you can see on the slide, we\u2019re very pleased with the results on comorbidities. Metabolic syndrome, significant improvements, 82%, 83% improvement in metabolic syndrome, Type 2 diabetes, and hypertension also showed significant differences compared to control. Same was true with quality of life as measured by a standard questionnaire called the SF36. Another interesting finding is around GERD. The ESG procedure preserves the function of the stomach. And one of the evidence of that, that we saw was actually a reduction in GERD symptoms and no new or worsening GERD, which is an interesting finding because traditional bariatric surgeries actually often result in an increase in GERD symptoms. So this is important clinically and a nice finding from the MERIT study. And so these results, along with other data in support of ESG have formed the basis for the de novo submission, and we will look to continue dialogue with FDA about that in the coming months. So with that update on the quarter, let me take a step back and provide a little bit of an update on where we view the company going over the coming years and vision for where we\u2019re heading. To start with, we are serving large market opportunities. We have three products, the X-Tack, OverStitch and Revera products across two large business opportunities, what we call advanced GI and our endoscopic weight loss opportunities. In addition, in the future, we have a third potential opportunity in the area of NASH, which is non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. So, three product lines, big opportunities that we are already being able to build some really nice momentum in. And one of the things I really like as I look across each of the 3 product lines is that we\u2019ve got really nice opportunities for growth and value creation over the near term, medium term and over time. With OverStitch, we continue to increase the number of users and the range of applications for the product, again, across both of those two main areas and are building a foundation for growth in the weight loss area. As I mentioned, we\u2019ve submitted to the FDA for a new indication and if that submission is successful, we would be in a position to then launch ESG, Apollo ESG and Apollo Revised in the coming months. In addition, over time, we can see that establishing endoscopic weight loss as a standard of care. For X-Tack, we are pleased with the development here in the U.S., primarily right now in terms of building utilization and experience. Over time, we will be able to move that into a global product line as evidenced by some of the near-term approvals. But likely a CE mark, which is the European approval, is more of a 2022 event. And over time, we see the combination of X-Tack and OverStitch, putting us in a position to create a leadership position in defect closure. And then the Orbera Agograstic balloon has been performing very well, as you can see in our results. There are new AGA guidelines, AGA, the American Gastroenterology Association issued clinical practice guidelines earlier this year and the market conditions have been favorable. Over time, we see the balloon as a key component of an integrated endobariatric weight loss practice that can incorporate both balloons and suturing options. And then in addition, we are working on the trial design for a new indication for NASH, which will create a brand-new pathway to have the balloon potentially be reimbursed for those patients. So, moving through each of the products, OverStitch in that advanced GI therapies, it really is the flagship product for the company. It is \u2013 creates a unique offering of being able to do what are called full thickness futures through the stomach. Primarily, we\u2019ve been growing through training, through medical education, new users, different applications, developing additional procedures and data. And you can see the procedure mix, right, about 60% of our business in the U.S. for OverStitch, are these advanced GI applications. Outside the U.S., it\u2019s more heavily weighted to the endobariatric procedures, both ESG and bariatric provisions, which I\u2019ll come back to in a minute. For X-Tack, it\u2019s an important new addition to our portfolio. It creates \u2013 it fills an important clinical need between OverStitch that is used for full thickness, large defects typically in the upper GI and through the scope clips, which often are used for quite small defects. X-Tack can be used in the upper and lower GI and has a good clinical and value proposition, especially in cases where you might need more than 3 or 4 through the scope clips. We are in the process of targeting high-volume accounts here in the U.S. and building utilization, building experience with the product and are pleased with the progress we\u2019re making. And I just emphasize we\u2019re still in quite early days of account penetration of experience with the product and with just the first clinical data being published today. So, lots of room and opportunity to continue to grow. Moving to the endobariatric side of things, it\u2019s a really, really significant and large opportunity. Obesity is clearly an epidemic that is continuing virtually unabated. You can see some numbers of 650 million people globally who suffer from obesity, in the U.S., 42% of adults. That translates to more than 100 million adults in the U.S., have a BMI over 30. And yet despite that, there are only about 200,000 primary surgical procedures currently in the U.S. In addition to primary procedures, revisions of prior surgeries, is a very meaningful opportunity for us. It\u2019s the fastest growing segment of the bariatric surgery market, increasing almost 5x in the last decade. And we believe to be a potentially $1 billion opportunity based off of the volume of procedures that have taken place. Building on that, to be clear, what we\u2019re talking about are patients who have previously undergone the two leading procedures for bariatric surgeries. One is a gastric bypass procedure and the other is a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. The data showed that there were 1.4 million of those procedures in the last decade. And there is a lot of clinical evidence that suggests that at least a third to a half of patients will, in fact, regain weight often and within about a 5-year period. And there were 43,000 revision procedures, surgical revision procedures that were already done in 2019. But we believe that there is potentially an important role for OverStitch in endoscopic revisions. And in fact, 70% of our top 100 accounts in the U.S. are already performing at least some of these procedures. And the reason why or at least some evidence for it is on the right-hand side. This is from a study that was published over the summer. It was conducted at Brigham in Women\u2019s Hospital, and it\u2019s a 5-year study that compares endoscopic revisions to surgical revisions of gastric bypass patients. And what you see in the data are essentially equivalent weight loss were very close to it and then \u2013 but a much better safety profile, a lower rate of adverse events and especially serious adverse events. So we\u2019re encouraged by that. And it\u2019s one of the main reasons why, in addition to submitting for ESG for de novo into cushion, we also submitted for revisions as well. For the ESG procedure, again, endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty, it has performed completely using the OverStitch device. And interestingly, it\u2019s been in development for a number of years now. And there are over 200 publications or abstracts that have already been developed more than 6,500 patients in addition to the MERIT study that I referenced earlier. And consistently, those results have shown a procedure that has a very good efficacy profile. The data on the right side of the page show a pooled analysis of eight studies and nearly 2,000 patients that showed very promising both excess body weight loss and total body weight loss. There is another part of the same pooled analysis showed an SAE rate of 2%, which is exactly what we saw in the MERIT study. And then there are other inherent benefits to the ESG procedure as well. It can be reversible if need be. It\u2019s anatomy sparing because we\u2019re not taking out any tissue. There is no scarring. It can be done as an outpatient procedure, and there is a relatively quick return to work. So there are a number of potential benefits. And one of the reasons why we are already seeing some practitioners embrace the procedure, but we are also very conscious of not marketing explicitly for it. And so we are going to work through the approval processes with the FDA and look forward to the potential of a new indication. We would estimate in a period on average de novo 510(k) take about 12 months. And so we will be flatting around that kind of a time line for a new launch. So hopefully, that gives you an update on the quarter-to-date from an overall business standpoint and a vision for where we\u2019re going forward. But to dive more into the financials, let me turn it to Jeff.\nJeff Black: Thank you, Chad and good afternoon everybody. I\u2019d spend a couple of minutes here just reviewing the financials review for today and then give some brief commentary on our operating spend profile and cash profile. So, starting with revenue, we ended the quarter with strong growth across all product \u2013 all of our products, the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. As Chad mentioned, we saw a nice balance in that growth. In the U.S., we saw a 66% growth outside the U.S., 55%. Our endoscopic suturing was up 30%, and that\u2019s just highlighting continued demand for our products, OverStitch and X-Tack across a number of patient indications. Orbera grew more than 20%, and that was against what we would consider a stronger-than-expected rebound in elective procedures a year ago in Q3 2020. On a year-to-date basis, suturing and balloon product lines both grew 63% over 2022. In terms of the full year outlook, we expect $63 million to $64 million in revenue for 2021. And this represents more than 50% growth over 2022, which we acknowledge was heavily impacted \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, over 2020, which we acknowledge was heavily impacted by COVID, but it also represents 40% growth in endobariatric revenue over 2019. Moving to gross margin, in the third quarter, we saw gross margin improve by 190 basis points over Q3 2020. We saw an improved 360 basis points on a year-to-date basis. We also saw gross margin improve sequentially over the second quarter by 150 basis points. As we continue to talk about, we remain very focused on continued gross margin improvements, particularly with OverStitch, which has a lower margin profile than Orbera and X-Tack. Major drivers of overall margin expansion will be product mix, improved absorption of overhead and direct COGS improvement programs, particularly focused on OverStitch. We\u2019re still very early innings, but we\u2019re beginning to see the impact from all of these factors. And we remain confident that we will see a blended gross margin in the mid-60s over the next 3 to 5 years. Moving on to the operating expenses, we look at our operating expense spend profile, and we think it\u2019s important to exclude non-cash stock-based compensation to get a clearer picture of what our non-GAAP core operating expense run rate looks like. And today, our non-GAAP OpEx is running at about 72% of revenue, of which 36% is sales and marketing, and that\u2019s a combination of variable and fixed compensation and investments in overall channel development, much like we\u2019ve been talking about. We do plan to invest for top line growth over the midterm and focus areas there will be sales channel expansion, marketing, medical education, clinical reimbursement, product development and COGS improvement programs. So we do expect to see operating expenses, increase in both absolute dollars and percentage of sales, particularly in 2022, and we should start to see some operating expense leverage in \u201823 and beyond. But I think importantly, we have the ability to modulate spend as we need to, and we\u2019re well positioned from a balance sheet perspective to make these investments. And that brings me to Slide 21 on cash usage. You\u2019ll see that over the first 9 months of this year, our average gross \u2013 our gross quarterly cash burn was $3.7 million, net burn was under $3 million. We ended the quarter with pro forma cash of $98 million. That includes the net proceeds from the $75 million follow-on we executed a few weeks ago. So we\u2019re now very well positioned to execute on our growth initiatives. But not only do this financing provide us with substantial cash runway, it added a number of very high-quality fundamental healthcare investors to a solid and growing shareholder base. And so we thank our investors both existing and new for the continued support and confidence. And then finally, before I turn it back to Chad, just a few comments on Slide 22 here regarding our cap table, we think it\u2019s important to paint a complete picture here, given that there are a couple of elements that don\u2019t show up in our issued and outstanding share count. So today, we have just under 40 million in issued and outstanding common shares. In addition, there are just under 14 million shares in prepaid funded warrants. So this would equate to 54 million shares in outstanding common and common equivalents. We also have about 6.3 million shares underlying our $19 million in convertible debt. So all in, as we think about our cap table is we represent just over 60 million common shares outstanding on a pro forma fully diluted basis. And we think it\u2019s important to provide this clarity on the call, just given the recent raise and historical funding mechanics for Apollo. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Chad.\nCharles McKhann: Thanks, Jeff. And let me echo Jeff\u2019s comments of thank you to our investors, both existing who\u2019s been with the company for a long time as well as those who joined us in the recent fund raise. We very much appreciate it. So looking forward and kind of wrapping up, we absolutely view a number of very significant catalysts across each of our product lines in the coming months and years. And I\u2019ve touched on these already, but with OverStitch the submission for the 510(k) is a big step for us, looking for a potential approval, right? We still need to work through the process with the FDA, but if successful, a potential approval potentially in the next year, which could form the basis of developing endoscopic rate loss practices and procedures and then also the basis of expanding reimbursement over time. With X-Tack, good progress with the U.S. launch, our first clinical evidence published and just recently here, and we announced it today. We are aware of others that are also in development and so more studies that will be coming out about the product in coming meetings over the course of the next year. And as I mentioned, looking towards a broader launch outside the U.S. potentially in 2022 as well and we also have our engineers working with the early clinicians who use X-Tack on R&D initiatives and what we\u2019re calling product line extensions for X-Tack. There is some great ideas there and hold the future potential of new developments of using X-Tack essentially as a platform for new developments. And we will have more updates as we move forward with that. And then they have balloon, which has been doing very well globally. In the coming year, we would expect to start a trial for NASH and the new indication. As we\u2019ve announced previously, there are new CPT codes that will be implemented starting in January 1, 2023. And then we also see the balloon as a critical component of an integrated practice for endoscopic weight loss as a key driver for the product line globally. And so to finish with our overall growth outlook, we\u2019re very pleased with the growth we\u2019ve seen this year, essentially 50% growth over 2020 as you look at the guidance of $63 million to $64 million. And all of that underlying this energized phase. So top line growth, really building the team and energizing the organization as well as our customers, continuing to grow the commercial organizations globally, both within the U.S. and outside the U.S., enhancing our position in that advanced GI category, overstated product and then adding X-Tack to it, developing the next new things from an R&D standpoint and then very importantly, fortifying our balance sheet. And all of that creates the foundation, we believe, for the next phase of acceleration and then ultimately, leadership. And so with that, we thank you for your interest. Thank you for joining the call, and we will open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Frank Takkinen from Lake Street Capital Markets. Your line is live.\nFrank Takkinen: Thanks for taking my questions guys and congrats on the great results. Want to start with X-Tack, curious if you could tease out just how much revenue was generated from X-Tack in the third quarter? And then as a follow-up to that, can we just take a step back and we\u2019ve spoken about market sizes a couple of times as far as total account opportunity. How large the clip market is and those types of things? But I wanted to take a step back and just now that you\u2019ve had a couple of quarters under your belt, if you could frame up how large of a product line you feel like X-Tack can be for Apollo?\nCharles McKhann: Yes. So thanks, Frank. Appreciate your comments. So for competitive reasons, we\u2019re still not separating X-Tack out individually. It\u2019s continued to do well. As you know, in the first half of the year on our Q2 call, we mentioned that we passed the $1 million mark, which was an important milestone for us. And we\u2019ve been able to continue to grow from there. We see X-Tack as an important contributor to growth, especially as it becomes a global product line for us. It\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re pleased with the utilization across both upper and lower GI. There are a lot of potential cases, inclusive of a big opportunity that we\u2019ve talked about colonoscopies. 20 million colonoscopies that are performed each year, a significant portion of those that do require \u2013 should be closed, right? There is a lot of clinical data that they should be closed. Otherwise, there is a risk of delayed bleeding. That\u2019s at least 8% to 10% based off of a number of studies. And that aspect predates X-Tack, right, that the pivotal study that studied that was actually sponsored by some of the equipment manufacturers but it\u2019s growing. I just recently at the ACG meeting, and there was a discussion of the need to close. And we think X-Tack is very much well positioned for that market, among others. So we see it being an important growth driver for us as well as along with OverStitch as well as the balloon. And so it can play a very important role going forward.\nFrank Takkinen: Got it. Okay. And then I just wanted to maybe back up to a little bit broader question. I think I saw in your slides a 20% plus midterm target revenue CAGR on a go-forward basis. Am I understanding this correctly that you\u2019re thinking on a regular basis, you can be growing top line about 20% as a whole?\nCharles McKhann: Yes. I mean that\u2019s a \u2013 we went through a strategic planning process over the summer as a team and really looked at our opportunities across product lines and across markets. And so that is, in our view, sort of a medium to longer term target that we\u2019re aiming for and that we believe that we can potentially achieve. It\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re not guiding to next year yet. But it is what we are kind of aiming for from an overall \u2013 we want to be a consistent growth company, and we believe that that\u2019s at the right level that we can achieve.\nFrank Takkinen: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then the last one for me, I just wanted to touch on the revision market a little bit more, specifically as it relates to reimbursement, I know there is some things working, you\u2019re working through as it relates to ESG reimbursement. But my sense is there is some reimbursement that\u2019s in place and it\u2019s a little bit easier for the reimbursement in place to be revisions with OverStitch product. One, am I understanding this correctly? And two, can you maybe just give us a little background around reimbursement as it specifically relates to revisions?\nCharles McKhann: Yes. So revisions are interesting in that you\u2019re right, because the patients have had a prior procedure and have experienced the benefits of weight loss. When they have like regain, they often also have a lot of additional comorbidities as well. And the alternative is a surgical procedure, right, and which is often an inpatient procedure. So what we find or at least as I talk to many of our customers, is that they are able to pursue case-by-case prior authorizations for revision procedures. They are using typically an unlisted code. There is no dedicated code for revisions. But what we hear quite frequently is a lot of success in being able to make the case that an endoscope revision is the right way to go and be able to get those procedures reimbursed. And so we think that\u2019s a good foundation to build on. That\u2019s our customers are pursuing that individually. Again, we don\u2019t have the indication. So we are not actively supporting that. We\u2019re learning from our customers, and we\u2019re thinking about the team we might want to have in place if we are, in fact, successful with an indication to help support other customers and having similar success.\nFrank Takkinen: Got it. Perfect. Thanks. I will stop there.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Chris Cooley from Stephens. Your line is live.\nChris Cooley: Good afternoon and congratulations on the stellar quarter. Maybe just two quick operational questions for me, could you help us think a little bit just when we look at the growth in the U.S. and internationally, I guess, two components there. One, do you attribute the decline in the IGB franchise outside the United States to \u2013 is this more COVID-related? Do you think these were competitive concerns during the quarterly period? Just would appreciate some color there and then how we might extrapolate that to the United States now that the stats balloon is approved here as well. And then similarly, though, if I could just think about the U.S. growth, which was really strong in the ESS franchise up about 130%, I\u2019m looking at this correctly. Could you maybe just help us think a little bit about the contribution there from X-Tack? I know you\u2019re not willing to give the dollar revenue piece out. In the past, you\u2019ve talked about a number of accounts. I\u2019m curious if that\u2019s a statistic you\u2019d still be willing to help us with? And then I have got one quick follow-up.\nCharles McKhann: Sure. Chris, let me make sure I\u2019m clear on your question on IGB when you talked about the decline. What \u2013 I just want to make sure I\u2019m addressing the line question.\nChris Cooley: I picked up the wrong number. It\u2019s only \u2013 it\u2019s actually up there. I\u2019m looking at the queue here quickly. I apologize. So if you could just maybe speak more to the U.S. growth?\nCharles McKhann: Sure. Yes. So, just wanted to make sure I was clear in answering the right question. Actually, on the IGB, we are very pleased with the growth. Important to recall last year, was actually kind of a rebound quarter at least in the U.S. for gastric balloons. And so seeing growth on top of that, we were very pleased with. On the U.S. growth for endoscopic suturing, again, the growth, I think has been nicely balanced, both core growth with OverStitch, if we look \u2013 especially, if we look year-on-year, pretty comparable quarter-on-quarter. And that\u2019s not surprising as you think about summer months and as well as \u2013 and we have talked about previously the navigating through COVID and OverStitch depending on the setting of care can be impacted as a lot of procedures still are, and we are all still navigating that. But we did see with X-Tack a growth in the number of accounts utilizing in the quarter of kind of a double-digit growth in that. Our strategy is much more focused on utilization than just growing accounts. So, we do continue to see growth in accounts, but we are actually, frankly, incentivizing our team and focusing our team on growth within the targeted accounts that we are already in while continuing to add the account base.\nChris Cooley: That\u2019s helpful. And if I could just as well quickly and I will get back in queue, just looking through here as well, see that distributor sales increased pretty significantly as a percentage of revenue versus the prior year. But when I look at least at first pass here in terms of kind of the standard metrics like DSO and the like cash conversion cycle. It doesn\u2019t seem like that impacted things if, in fact, you improved on those ratios. So one, I was hoping you could just expand on maybe the increase in distributor efforts outside of the U.S. And two, if you are doing anything different there such that just when we look at those kind of metrics, we are not seeing any kind of expansion in the short run with that kind of step up in distributor sales? Thanks so much.\nCharles McKhann: Sure. I will hit the sales side of it, and then Jeff can elaborate. Distributor sales can be somewhat lumpy, sometimes, right. They can be large orders. And then I would say the historical comparison is important in that. The U.S. did recover faster last year than the distributor markets. And so it is important to kind of take a longer term view of kind of quarter-to-quarter. But we feel good about where we are in terms of with the distributor orders and then solid orders across geographies. So, there wasn\u2019t one big order that affected the results here. It was pretty balanced again across our different distributor markets. My lumpy comment was really just sort of a reference to the comparison for last year where the distributor market was much slower to come back. And so that comparison is probably important as to year-on-year. Jeff, as you look about the other metrics?\nJeff Black: Yes, Chris, on DSOs, I can tell you that I am almost 90 days in now, I guess, 90 days in today. I have actually been really \u2013 was that \u2013 thank you, I have been really impressed with the company\u2019s ability to collect. And I think it\u2019s a function, both OUS and in the U.S. of the team really knowing the customer, particularly in OUS distribution. Mike and his team has just done a phenomenal job at building a customer base or whether you call them a direct distributor or otherwise and really understand their customer. And so we have been really pleased. We have not had collection issues to-date. And as we bring on new distributors, they are very well vetted. And so I think we continue to really push on collections and we have had a lot of success there.\nChris Cooley: Super. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Matt Hewitt from Craig-Hallum Capital. Your line is live.\nMatt Hewitt: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the questions. Maybe first one and I realize it\u2019s only been a week, but I am just curious what the initial feedback or interest or inbound calls that you receive from following the final release of the MERIT data. This is something that I know the investment committee has been waiting for several years, but so has I would think, the practitioners, the people that are doing these procedures on a daily basis have likely been waiting too. So, I am just curious what you have heard in the past week.\nCharles McKhann: Thanks, Matt. Yes, there has been a lot of excitement. It was fun to be at the ACG meeting, which was immediately after that, if so, a virtual meeting and so to talk to a lot of customers there. It was as you follow the space and know the data were very much confirmatory to a lot of data that have already been collected, but it\u2019s still really nice to see, right, in terms of randomized control data that supports the value proposition. And so we have had good conversations with leaders from both the GI and the surgical side of things. People are obviously looking forward to the indication as well because that will certainly also play a role in things like reimbursement and other activities. But the general feedback is a lot of excitement and very positive.\nMatt Hewitt: That\u2019s great. Thank you. And then on the \u2013 we really appreciate the slide kind of going through what\u2019s next, the near-term and kind of mid-term catalysts. But one that I didn\u2019t see on there, how should we be thinking about CPT codes for OverStitch? Do you need to get the labels in place first, or is it possible that in the January meeting, you could see even if it\u2019s just more of a generic label CPT code, what\u2019s the cadence there?\nCharles McKhann: Yes. No. So, the CPT process really is led by the societies. And so the GI societies are very aware of and are thinking about CPT codes, both around revisions and primary ESGs. And so they are actively working on that. We are just getting into the new cycle that would be for the next three meetings that take place over the next year would point towards a CPT code being in effect January 1, 2024. That\u2019s just the way those cycles work. And so they know those deadlines and are thinking about it. It\u2019s a combination of primarily making sure all the ducks are aligned with the actual publication and then the submission process. In fact, we are working together across other societies to ensure there is support. And so that activity is ongoing. We are optimistic that it happen within one of these next three meetings to be in that January 2024 cycle. But there is more work to do. And ultimately, the societies are going to drive that timeline. We will do our best to make sure they have got the information they need to be able to do that.\nMatt Hewitt: Got it. Yes. Just like you had with ORBERA where the societies were kind of led that charge to, I understand that. And then maybe last one for me and then I will hop back in. Regarding the ORBERA NASH study, has there been any update as far as the specifics on the trial? Where do those stand, because I think it starts early next year, but if you could provide an update on that, it would be appreciated? Thank you.\nCharles McKhann: Yes. Matt, previously, we had communicated start potentially at the beginning of next year. We are still in the design phase, quite frankly, of that as we work through both with the FDA and with CMS and working it through. We have also with the information around the comorbidity effects with ESG are also having some interesting discussions as exclusively an ORBERA balloon trial. Is it potentially an ORBERA balloon as well as an ESG trial, maybe a multi-arm trial. So, we want to make sure that whatever study we design and get approved by the agencies does lead us to a pathway towards positive reimbursement. So, we are taking the time with our advisers to make sure we get that right. And so we won\u2019t be starting a study early next year, but we are working on the design of that that would still allow us to move forward from there.\nMatt Hewitt: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Adam Maeder from Piper Sandler. Your line is live.\nAdam Maeder: Hi Charles. Hi Jeff. Congrats on all the success here and I appreciate you guys taking the questions. Two for me, one near-term and then one on the mid to longer term. So first and foremost, just on the guidance, revenue guide, you took that up to $63 million to $64 million. I think that implies $16.8 million or so at the midpoint for Q4. Clearly, some good underlying momentum in the business exiting Q3 and by my math, that\u2019s about 4% quarter-over-quarter sequential growth. So, it seems pretty reasonable and I guess prudent, given the environment, but I wanted to dig in a little bit just on the construction of the guidance. So, maybe what\u2019s embedded in the guide for various things like COVID-19, potential staffing issues or other capacity constraints. And then we have heard some other medtech companies talk about a backlog accumulating during Q3. So, just wondering if you have a backlog that needs to be worked through as well? And then I have a follow-up.\nJeff Black: Yes. Adam, this is Jeff. I appreciate the question. Look, I think as we have talked about Q3 was \u2013 there was definitely COVID impact. And we are maybe less exposed to it than others that are more dependent upon inpatient hospital procedures. We do have a fair amount of our business is outpatient and even in surgery centers. So, I think we are probably less impacted, but we certainly saw the impact. And it\u2019s lumpy. And to the extent that we see concentrations of impact in geographies where we have greater amounts of business and will certainly be impacted. But I think we have got the benefit of being an outpatient. We have got the benefit of having being geographically dispersed, not just within U.S. geography, but globally. But that said, we are still seeing some pressure and we expect to continue seeing pressure. So, we are being cautiously optimistic and feel good about the guidance we put set forth. I would like to say that there is a huge backlog. We would love the backlog. That\u2019s not been our experience. And we are pretty certain that the business that we are seeing represents run rate demand. And going into the fourth quarter, it would have been great to start with the backlog, but that\u2019s not the case for us.\nAdam Maeder: Okay. Very helpful, Jeff. Thank you for that. And then just for the second question, the MERIT data now in hand, results look really compelling. Just curious if I could push a little bit on the mid to longer term outlook for OverStitch. How are you guys thinking about growth going forward? You have grown that product very nicely, 20% to 25% range or even above that with the exception of last year, which is impacted by the pandemic. So, does the future ESG label potential broader reimbursement steep in that curve? Does it sustain the durability? Just how do we think about the dynamics there? And I will hop back in the queue. Thanks so much guys.\nCharles McKhann: Yes, Adam. The \u2013 so the three phases I laid out going back to originally sort of defining the strategy, we have never put an exact timeline against those. But in my mind, the critical trigger of moving from that energized to the accelerate phase is the indication for ESG and for revisions, right. And so I do see them as a potential accelerator even while we are working on the broader reimbursement pathways that we just discussed. But even in that sort of medium-term of with an indication, being able to again, learn from physicians and institutions that have already started to connect the dots, we do think that there is a significant opportunity here. And so we are in that learning phase. We are going to be very careful and appropriate from a promotional standpoint. But if we are successful in getting the new indication, then absolutely, we see that as a potential of an accelerator from a growth standpoint for OverStitch.\nAdam Maeder: That\u2019s helpful, Charles. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Josh Jennings from Cowen. Your line is live.\nJosh Jennings: Hi. Good evening and thanks for taking the questions. It\u2019s great to see the positive MERIT results and the strong quarterly results. I wanted to ask about the MERIT study and just what you saw with the durability of the outcome for ESG and just thinking about the body that is crude in front of Marriott, what do you think or what does your team think that durability will wind up? I mean this seems like 2-year sustained weight loss was demonstrated effectively in the MERIT study, and I was just curious in terms of how we should be thinking about the durability of the procedure going forward.\nCharles McKhann: Thanks, Josh for the question. Yes, the MERIT study had a 2-year endpoint. And you are right. As you saw in the data that we summarized today, there really was a nice durability and maintenance of weight loss out to 2 years. And there have been a number of other studies that have demonstrated that as well, including the pool analysis that\u2019s in the slide set. That does show nice consistent results out of that time period. There is also one study on ESG out to 5 years that was published just a few years ago. That has also showed a really nice maintenance of effect out to 5 years. And so we will encourage our investigators to keep collecting longer term data, because durability will certainly be an open question, especially for payers, for example. But we are pleased with what we are seeing. And so we think it \u2013 I think the investigators presenting the MERIT study talked about ESG potentially filling a really nice important gap between whether it\u2019s the bloom that typically has a shorter term time horizon as well as medications, right. There are some really interesting new medications, but compliance and costs have often been an issue for medications between those and then the surgeries, which do have some very good durability data for both laparoscopic sleeve and gastric bypasses. We think ESG can fill an important gap or very good durability and then an overall really good value proposition. And so we were pleased with the outcomes.\nJosh Jennings: Excellent. Just one quick follow-up on the \u2013 I understand the societies will be submitting for CPT code issuances. But thinking about payer decisions on coverage and payments, is there anything that Apollo can do while the FDA is reviewing the de novo application to just get this data in front of payers and start that process or do you need to have approval first before those discussions start? Thanks for taking the questions.\nCharles McKhann: Yes. No, we are going to tread pretty carefully there just because we don\u2019t want to get ahead of ourselves from a \u2013 but we can absolutely get all of our ducks in line, right. Now, with the benefit of the multiple studies I referenced and then the MERIT study on top of that, things like putting together all the economic value dossiers that you would need, continuing to encourage our investigators to publish on their results with comorbidities, for example, really reinforcing the different aspects of the value proposition. So, we have got a really good story to tell. So, I think it\u2019s a matter of, again, sort of planning and preparation now, making sure we have got the right team in place to do that, and we have been working on filling out that group. But the actual activities will depend on, first, the publication, but importantly, the indication as well.\nJosh Jennings: Great. Thanks again.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions in the queue.\nCharles McKhann: Listen, thank you all very much for joining us this evening. We very much appreciate your support and have a good evening.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s event. You may disconnect at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Charles McKhann",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt and thank you everyone for joining us this afternoon to discuss our results for the third quarter and participating in the webcast format as well. Today marks my 8-month anniversary since joining as CEO of Apollo. And so in addition to covering the quarter, I also want to give an update on what we have accomplished in the first 8 months and perspectives on where we are heading going forward. On the first call that I did after Q1, I laid out a strategy that we have been implementing over three phases to energize the business, put us in a position to then accelerate and then lead over time. And that has involved really forming a new leadership team that it takes the best of Apollo and great people that we had on board and then supplementing that with some key additions as we focus and go after some really large market opportunities. And so I am very pleased to then report today the progress that we have made. In that energized phase, the first phase of our growth strategy, we really talked about three main areas of focus: strengthening and revitalizing the team, delivering on near-term growth and building a foundation for future success. And as you can see on the slide, we are very pleased with the progress we have made across all three of them. On the team, we have made some additions to the leadership team, including Jeff Black, our CFO, who is with me here today, as well as additions to our sales and marketing organization. We also have been building out the team on the ground. We started \u2013 in the U.S. we had 16 sales reps, which was not enough frankly to adequately cover the large country that we have here. And so by the end of the year, we are projecting to have as many as 30 reps. And so a nice addition, including bringing back some experienced reps from Apollo as well as hiring others who are very experienced in the GI space. We have also made other targeted additions into key functions around the organization as we build to scale the business. And then we have also been very outwardly facing with our customers, spending time, meeting with them, talking about our plans for the future and really engaging and enrolling them in where we want to go with the business. Secondly, we have delivered on the near-term growth. We are very pleased with the results for the quarter, but also, if you look year-to-date, we have got 60% growth spread equally across our endoscopic suturing business and our intragasic balloons and also quite equally across U.S. and outside the U.S. So, the word I use, as I look at our growth so far this year it's balance, really nice balance across products and across geographies. And then the X-Tack launch has been a big component of that as well. And we are very pleased with the success of the X-Tack launch and the progress we are making and I will provide some updates there as well. And then all the while, we are building a foundation for future opportunities. Just about 10 days ago, we announced the results from the MERIT study at the IPSO meeting and I am going to touch on those. We also just this morning announced the first clinical publication for X-Tack. We have submitted the FDA a de novo 510(k) submission for Apollo ESG and Apollo revise, a critical step for us in developing a new indication for endoscopic weight loss for the OverStitch device. Early in the year, we got our breakthrough designation for the Orbera balloon for the treatment of NASH, and we continue to make progress on designing the path forward for a huge opportunity in front of us with NASH potentially. And then we also have the X-Tack approval that we've received in Australia, which we've already gotten the approval in some of the other markets around the world, but this is another important one and sets us up, we think, well, for more approvals outside the U.S. in the coming months. And then last, but certainly not least, we completed the fund base here in just a few weeks ago, which helped strengthen our balance sheet and positions us for future growth. So, some key metrics. As we look through the quarter, I mentioned already 60% year-on-year growth. Clearly, 2020 was a difficult and challenging year and also a strange comparison. So you can see 33% growth compared to 2019, equally spread across our ESS and IGB businesses and an issuing metric also that our top 10 accounts, direct accounts in both U.S. and outside the U.S. have grown 100% year-on-year, so really building nice depth while also expanding the breadth of our business in new accounts as well X-Tack, as I mentioned, is progressing well. And a key metric there is that in the third quarter, 72% of our sales came from utilization from reorders. And that's important because that's showing real usage, real utilization, while we also, in addition, continue to open additional accounts as well. We are very pleased with the publication for X-Tack that just came out. It's a multi-center trial, 93 patients, excellent centers involved, including the Meo, Johns Hopkins, New York University. So this is the first clinical publication for X-Tack. Remember, it's a very new product for us. And as you \u2013 if you had a chance to see the press release we issued today, demonstrated excellent efficacy and results in that publication. And then the MERIT trial, a big milestone for us, as I mentioned, was presented, and I will touch on that here in just a minute. So the MERIT study, I think many on the call are familiar with it, but if you're new to Apollo and are not, it is a randomized controlled trial of our ESG procedure, which utilizes the OverStitch device. So, ESG is an endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty. And this was a trial that was randomized to patients who receive ESG versus a standard of care of medically monitored diet and exercise. It enrolled 208 subjects with a BMI between 30 and 40. We have \u2013 are very thankful to the principal investigators, Dr. Barmabadeo from Ameo Clinic, a leading GI in the field; and Dr. Eric Wilson from the University of Texas or Houston, a leading surgeon. And so we have had a close partnership throughout the study on GI and surgeons. You can see the primary end points of the study on the page, excess body weight loss of at least 25% and safety, having a serious adverse event rate of less than 5%. We also importantly enrolled patients, a pre-specified number of patients with hypertension and patients with type 2 diabetes. Some of the highlights of the presentation that was made by Dr. Abada, again, at a virtual session from IFSO are presented here on this slide. We achieved a 49% excess body weight loss at 12 months or patients did who underwent ESG. That was compared to a target of 25%. And importantly, the targets were developed based off of a 2011 white paper that was developed by the ASGE, which is a gastroenterology society and the ASMBS, which is a surgical society. And they set out guidelines for endoscopic weight loss therapies and a target of at least a 25% excess body weight loss was used to set the primary end point. Importantly, there was a 45% difference in excess body weight loss compared to control versus a target of 15%. 77% of patients achieved at least a 25% excess body weight loss and the SAE rate as defined by the investigators was 2% and all patients recovered from those events. The \u2013 importantly, as you see on the right side of the page, we also exhibited very good durability in the study. So after 2 years, patients maintained the majority of the weight loss out to 2 years as well as the crossover patients who received ESG had excellent results. As I mentioned, one of the other key metrics or areas that we looked at in the study was the impact on comorbidities. And as you can see on the slide, we're very pleased with the results on comorbidities. Metabolic syndrome, significant improvements, 82%, 83% improvement in metabolic syndrome, Type 2 diabetes, and hypertension also showed significant differences compared to control. Same was true with quality of life as measured by a standard questionnaire called the SF36. Another interesting finding is around GERD. The ESG procedure preserves the function of the stomach. And one of the evidence of that, that we saw was actually a reduction in GERD symptoms and no new or worsening GERD, which is an interesting finding because traditional bariatric surgeries actually often result in an increase in GERD symptoms. So this is important clinically and a nice finding from the MERIT study. And so these results, along with other data in support of ESG have formed the basis for the de novo submission, and we will look to continue dialogue with FDA about that in the coming months. So with that update on the quarter, let me take a step back and provide a little bit of an update on where we view the company going over the coming years and vision for where we're heading. To start with, we are serving large market opportunities. We have three products, the X-Tack, OverStitch and Revera products across two large business opportunities, what we call advanced GI and our endoscopic weight loss opportunities. In addition, in the future, we have a third potential opportunity in the area of NASH, which is non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. So, three product lines, big opportunities that we are already being able to build some really nice momentum in. And one of the things I really like as I look across each of the 3 product lines is that we've got really nice opportunities for growth and value creation over the near term, medium term and over time. With OverStitch, we continue to increase the number of users and the range of applications for the product, again, across both of those two main areas and are building a foundation for growth in the weight loss area. As I mentioned, we've submitted to the FDA for a new indication and if that submission is successful, we would be in a position to then launch ESG, Apollo ESG and Apollo Revised in the coming months. In addition, over time, we can see that establishing endoscopic weight loss as a standard of care. For X-Tack, we are pleased with the development here in the U.S., primarily right now in terms of building utilization and experience. Over time, we will be able to move that into a global product line as evidenced by some of the near-term approvals. But likely a CE mark, which is the European approval, is more of a 2022 event. And over time, we see the combination of X-Tack and OverStitch, putting us in a position to create a leadership position in defect closure. And then the Orbera Agograstic balloon has been performing very well, as you can see in our results. There are new AGA guidelines, AGA, the American Gastroenterology Association issued clinical practice guidelines earlier this year and the market conditions have been favorable. Over time, we see the balloon as a key component of an integrated endobariatric weight loss practice that can incorporate both balloons and suturing options. And then in addition, we are working on the trial design for a new indication for NASH, which will create a brand-new pathway to have the balloon potentially be reimbursed for those patients. So, moving through each of the products, OverStitch in that advanced GI therapies, it really is the flagship product for the company. It is \u2013 creates a unique offering of being able to do what are called full thickness futures through the stomach. Primarily, we've been growing through training, through medical education, new users, different applications, developing additional procedures and data. And you can see the procedure mix, right, about 60% of our business in the U.S. for OverStitch, are these advanced GI applications. Outside the U.S., it's more heavily weighted to the endobariatric procedures, both ESG and bariatric provisions, which I'll come back to in a minute. For X-Tack, it's an important new addition to our portfolio. It creates \u2013 it fills an important clinical need between OverStitch that is used for full thickness, large defects typically in the upper GI and through the scope clips, which often are used for quite small defects. X-Tack can be used in the upper and lower GI and has a good clinical and value proposition, especially in cases where you might need more than 3 or 4 through the scope clips. We are in the process of targeting high-volume accounts here in the U.S. and building utilization, building experience with the product and are pleased with the progress we're making. And I just emphasize we're still in quite early days of account penetration of experience with the product and with just the first clinical data being published today. So, lots of room and opportunity to continue to grow. Moving to the endobariatric side of things, it's a really, really significant and large opportunity. Obesity is clearly an epidemic that is continuing virtually unabated. You can see some numbers of 650 million people globally who suffer from obesity, in the U.S., 42% of adults. That translates to more than 100 million adults in the U.S., have a BMI over 30. And yet despite that, there are only about 200,000 primary surgical procedures currently in the U.S. In addition to primary procedures, revisions of prior surgeries, is a very meaningful opportunity for us. It's the fastest growing segment of the bariatric surgery market, increasing almost 5x in the last decade. And we believe to be a potentially $1 billion opportunity based off of the volume of procedures that have taken place. Building on that, to be clear, what we're talking about are patients who have previously undergone the two leading procedures for bariatric surgeries. One is a gastric bypass procedure and the other is a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. The data showed that there were 1.4 million of those procedures in the last decade. And there is a lot of clinical evidence that suggests that at least a third to a half of patients will, in fact, regain weight often and within about a 5-year period. And there were 43,000 revision procedures, surgical revision procedures that were already done in 2019. But we believe that there is potentially an important role for OverStitch in endoscopic revisions. And in fact, 70% of our top 100 accounts in the U.S. are already performing at least some of these procedures. And the reason why or at least some evidence for it is on the right-hand side. This is from a study that was published over the summer. It was conducted at Brigham in Women's Hospital, and it's a 5-year study that compares endoscopic revisions to surgical revisions of gastric bypass patients. And what you see in the data are essentially equivalent weight loss were very close to it and then \u2013 but a much better safety profile, a lower rate of adverse events and especially serious adverse events. So we're encouraged by that. And it's one of the main reasons why, in addition to submitting for ESG for de novo into cushion, we also submitted for revisions as well. For the ESG procedure, again, endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty, it has performed completely using the OverStitch device. And interestingly, it's been in development for a number of years now. And there are over 200 publications or abstracts that have already been developed more than 6,500 patients in addition to the MERIT study that I referenced earlier. And consistently, those results have shown a procedure that has a very good efficacy profile. The data on the right side of the page show a pooled analysis of eight studies and nearly 2,000 patients that showed very promising both excess body weight loss and total body weight loss. There is another part of the same pooled analysis showed an SAE rate of 2%, which is exactly what we saw in the MERIT study. And then there are other inherent benefits to the ESG procedure as well. It can be reversible if need be. It's anatomy sparing because we're not taking out any tissue. There is no scarring. It can be done as an outpatient procedure, and there is a relatively quick return to work. So there are a number of potential benefits. And one of the reasons why we are already seeing some practitioners embrace the procedure, but we are also very conscious of not marketing explicitly for it. And so we are going to work through the approval processes with the FDA and look forward to the potential of a new indication. We would estimate in a period on average de novo 510(k) take about 12 months. And so we will be flatting around that kind of a time line for a new launch. So hopefully, that gives you an update on the quarter-to-date from an overall business standpoint and a vision for where we're going forward. But to dive more into the financials, let me turn it to Jeff. Thanks, Jeff. And let me echo Jeff's comments of thank you to our investors, both existing who's been with the company for a long time as well as those who joined us in the recent fund raise. We very much appreciate it. So looking forward and kind of wrapping up, we absolutely view a number of very significant catalysts across each of our product lines in the coming months and years. And I've touched on these already, but with OverStitch the submission for the 510(k) is a big step for us, looking for a potential approval, right? We still need to work through the process with the FDA, but if successful, a potential approval potentially in the next year, which could form the basis of developing endoscopic rate loss practices and procedures and then also the basis of expanding reimbursement over time. With X-Tack, good progress with the U.S. launch, our first clinical evidence published and just recently here, and we announced it today. We are aware of others that are also in development and so more studies that will be coming out about the product in coming meetings over the course of the next year. And as I mentioned, looking towards a broader launch outside the U.S. potentially in 2022 as well and we also have our engineers working with the early clinicians who use X-Tack on R&D initiatives and what we're calling product line extensions for X-Tack. There is some great ideas there and hold the future potential of new developments of using X-Tack essentially as a platform for new developments. And we will have more updates as we move forward with that. And then they have balloon, which has been doing very well globally. In the coming year, we would expect to start a trial for NASH and the new indication. As we've announced previously, there are new CPT codes that will be implemented starting in January 1, 2023. And then we also see the balloon as a critical component of an integrated practice for endoscopic weight loss as a key driver for the product line globally. And so to finish with our overall growth outlook, we're very pleased with the growth we've seen this year, essentially 50% growth over 2020 as you look at the guidance of $63 million to $64 million. And all of that underlying this energized phase. So top line growth, really building the team and energizing the organization as well as our customers, continuing to grow the commercial organizations globally, both within the U.S. and outside the U.S., enhancing our position in that advanced GI category, overstated product and then adding X-Tack to it, developing the next new things from an R&D standpoint and then very importantly, fortifying our balance sheet. And all of that creates the foundation, we believe, for the next phase of acceleration and then ultimately, leadership. And so with that, we thank you for your interest. Thank you for joining the call, and we will open it up for questions. Yes. So thanks, Frank. Appreciate your comments. So for competitive reasons, we're still not separating X-Tack out individually. It's continued to do well. As you know, in the first half of the year on our Q2 call, we mentioned that we passed the $1 million mark, which was an important milestone for us. And we've been able to continue to grow from there. We see X-Tack as an important contributor to growth, especially as it becomes a global product line for us. It's \u2013 we're pleased with the utilization across both upper and lower GI. There are a lot of potential cases, inclusive of a big opportunity that we've talked about colonoscopies. 20 million colonoscopies that are performed each year, a significant portion of those that do require \u2013 should be closed, right? There is a lot of clinical data that they should be closed. Otherwise, there is a risk of delayed bleeding. That's at least 8% to 10% based off of a number of studies. And that aspect predates X-Tack, right, that the pivotal study that studied that was actually sponsored by some of the equipment manufacturers but it's growing. I just recently at the ACG meeting, and there was a discussion of the need to close. And we think X-Tack is very much well positioned for that market, among others. So we see it being an important growth driver for us as well as along with OverStitch as well as the balloon. And so it can play a very important role going forward. Yes. I mean that's a \u2013 we went through a strategic planning process over the summer as a team and really looked at our opportunities across product lines and across markets. And so that is, in our view, sort of a medium to longer term target that we're aiming for and that we believe that we can potentially achieve. It's \u2013 we're not guiding to next year yet. But it is what we are kind of aiming for from an overall \u2013 we want to be a consistent growth company, and we believe that that's at the right level that we can achieve. Yes. So revisions are interesting in that you're right, because the patients have had a prior procedure and have experienced the benefits of weight loss. When they have like regain, they often also have a lot of additional comorbidities as well. And the alternative is a surgical procedure, right, and which is often an inpatient procedure. So what we find or at least as I talk to many of our customers, is that they are able to pursue case-by-case prior authorizations for revision procedures. They are using typically an unlisted code. There is no dedicated code for revisions. But what we hear quite frequently is a lot of success in being able to make the case that an endoscope revision is the right way to go and be able to get those procedures reimbursed. And so we think that's a good foundation to build on. That's our customers are pursuing that individually. Again, we don't have the indication. So we are not actively supporting that. We're learning from our customers, and we're thinking about the team we might want to have in place if we are, in fact, successful with an indication to help support other customers and having similar success. Sure. Chris, let me make sure I'm clear on your question on IGB when you talked about the decline. What \u2013 I just want to make sure I'm addressing the line question. Sure. Yes. So, just wanted to make sure I was clear in answering the right question. Actually, on the IGB, we are very pleased with the growth. Important to recall last year, was actually kind of a rebound quarter at least in the U.S. for gastric balloons. And so seeing growth on top of that, we were very pleased with. On the U.S. growth for endoscopic suturing, again, the growth, I think has been nicely balanced, both core growth with OverStitch, if we look \u2013 especially, if we look year-on-year, pretty comparable quarter-on-quarter. And that's not surprising as you think about summer months and as well as \u2013 and we have talked about previously the navigating through COVID and OverStitch depending on the setting of care can be impacted as a lot of procedures still are, and we are all still navigating that. But we did see with X-Tack a growth in the number of accounts utilizing in the quarter of kind of a double-digit growth in that. Our strategy is much more focused on utilization than just growing accounts. So, we do continue to see growth in accounts, but we are actually, frankly, incentivizing our team and focusing our team on growth within the targeted accounts that we are already in while continuing to add the account base. Sure. I will hit the sales side of it, and then Jeff can elaborate. Distributor sales can be somewhat lumpy, sometimes, right. They can be large orders. And then I would say the historical comparison is important in that. The U.S. did recover faster last year than the distributor markets. And so it is important to kind of take a longer term view of kind of quarter-to-quarter. But we feel good about where we are in terms of with the distributor orders and then solid orders across geographies. So, there wasn't one big order that affected the results here. It was pretty balanced again across our different distributor markets. My lumpy comment was really just sort of a reference to the comparison for last year where the distributor market was much slower to come back. And so that comparison is probably important as to year-on-year. Jeff, as you look about the other metrics? Thanks, Matt. Yes, there has been a lot of excitement. It was fun to be at the ACG meeting, which was immediately after that, if so, a virtual meeting and so to talk to a lot of customers there. It was as you follow the space and know the data were very much confirmatory to a lot of data that have already been collected, but it's still really nice to see, right, in terms of randomized control data that supports the value proposition. And so we have had good conversations with leaders from both the GI and the surgical side of things. People are obviously looking forward to the indication as well because that will certainly also play a role in things like reimbursement and other activities. But the general feedback is a lot of excitement and very positive. Yes. No. So, the CPT process really is led by the societies. And so the GI societies are very aware of and are thinking about CPT codes, both around revisions and primary ESGs. And so they are actively working on that. We are just getting into the new cycle that would be for the next three meetings that take place over the next year would point towards a CPT code being in effect January 1, 2024. That's just the way those cycles work. And so they know those deadlines and are thinking about it. It's a combination of primarily making sure all the ducks are aligned with the actual publication and then the submission process. In fact, we are working together across other societies to ensure there is support. And so that activity is ongoing. We are optimistic that it happen within one of these next three meetings to be in that January 2024 cycle. But there is more work to do. And ultimately, the societies are going to drive that timeline. We will do our best to make sure they have got the information they need to be able to do that. Yes. Matt, previously, we had communicated start potentially at the beginning of next year. We are still in the design phase, quite frankly, of that as we work through both with the FDA and with CMS and working it through. We have also with the information around the comorbidity effects with ESG are also having some interesting discussions as exclusively an ORBERA balloon trial. Is it potentially an ORBERA balloon as well as an ESG trial, maybe a multi-arm trial. So, we want to make sure that whatever study we design and get approved by the agencies does lead us to a pathway towards positive reimbursement. So, we are taking the time with our advisers to make sure we get that right. And so we won't be starting a study early next year, but we are working on the design of that that would still allow us to move forward from there. Yes, Adam. The \u2013 so the three phases I laid out going back to originally sort of defining the strategy, we have never put an exact timeline against those. But in my mind, the critical trigger of moving from that energized to the accelerate phase is the indication for ESG and for revisions, right. And so I do see them as a potential accelerator even while we are working on the broader reimbursement pathways that we just discussed. But even in that sort of medium-term of with an indication, being able to again, learn from physicians and institutions that have already started to connect the dots, we do think that there is a significant opportunity here. And so we are in that learning phase. We are going to be very careful and appropriate from a promotional standpoint. But if we are successful in getting the new indication, then absolutely, we see that as a potential of an accelerator from a growth standpoint for OverStitch. Thanks, Josh for the question. Yes, the MERIT study had a 2-year endpoint. And you are right. As you saw in the data that we summarized today, there really was a nice durability and maintenance of weight loss out to 2 years. And there have been a number of other studies that have demonstrated that as well, including the pool analysis that's in the slide set. That does show nice consistent results out of that time period. There is also one study on ESG out to 5 years that was published just a few years ago. That has also showed a really nice maintenance of effect out to 5 years. And so we will encourage our investigators to keep collecting longer term data, because durability will certainly be an open question, especially for payers, for example. But we are pleased with what we are seeing. And so we think it \u2013 I think the investigators presenting the MERIT study talked about ESG potentially filling a really nice important gap between whether it's the bloom that typically has a shorter term time horizon as well as medications, right. There are some really interesting new medications, but compliance and costs have often been an issue for medications between those and then the surgeries, which do have some very good durability data for both laparoscopic sleeve and gastric bypasses. We think ESG can fill an important gap or very good durability and then an overall really good value proposition. And so we were pleased with the outcomes. Yes. No, we are going to tread pretty carefully there just because we don't want to get ahead of ourselves from a \u2013 but we can absolutely get all of our ducks in line, right. Now, with the benefit of the multiple studies I referenced and then the MERIT study on top of that, things like putting together all the economic value dossiers that you would need, continuing to encourage our investigators to publish on their results with comorbidities, for example, really reinforcing the different aspects of the value proposition. So, we have got a really good story to tell. So, I think it's a matter of, again, sort of planning and preparation now, making sure we have got the right team in place to do that, and we have been working on filling out that group. But the actual activities will depend on, first, the publication, but importantly, the indication as well. Listen, thank you all very much for joining us this evening. We very much appreciate your support and have a good evening."

            "name": "Jeff Black",
            "content": "Thank you, Chad and good afternoon everybody. I'd spend a couple of minutes here just reviewing the financials review for today and then give some brief commentary on our operating spend profile and cash profile. So, starting with revenue, we ended the quarter with strong growth across all product \u2013 all of our products, the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. As Chad mentioned, we saw a nice balance in that growth. In the U.S., we saw a 66% growth outside the U.S., 55%. Our endoscopic suturing was up 30%, and that's just highlighting continued demand for our products, OverStitch and X-Tack across a number of patient indications. Orbera grew more than 20%, and that was against what we would consider a stronger-than-expected rebound in elective procedures a year ago in Q3 2020. On a year-to-date basis, suturing and balloon product lines both grew 63% over 2022. In terms of the full year outlook, we expect $63 million to $64 million in revenue for 2021. And this represents more than 50% growth over 2022, which we acknowledge was heavily impacted \u2013 I'm sorry, over 2020, which we acknowledge was heavily impacted by COVID, but it also represents 40% growth in endobariatric revenue over 2019. Moving to gross margin, in the third quarter, we saw gross margin improve by 190 basis points over Q3 2020. We saw an improved 360 basis points on a year-to-date basis. We also saw gross margin improve sequentially over the second quarter by 150 basis points. As we continue to talk about, we remain very focused on continued gross margin improvements, particularly with OverStitch, which has a lower margin profile than Orbera and X-Tack. Major drivers of overall margin expansion will be product mix, improved absorption of overhead and direct COGS improvement programs, particularly focused on OverStitch. We're still very early innings, but we're beginning to see the impact from all of these factors. And we remain confident that we will see a blended gross margin in the mid-60s over the next 3 to 5 years. Moving on to the operating expenses, we look at our operating expense spend profile, and we think it's important to exclude non-cash stock-based compensation to get a clearer picture of what our non-GAAP core operating expense run rate looks like. And today, our non-GAAP OpEx is running at about 72% of revenue, of which 36% is sales and marketing, and that's a combination of variable and fixed compensation and investments in overall channel development, much like we've been talking about. We do plan to invest for top line growth over the midterm and focus areas there will be sales channel expansion, marketing, medical education, clinical reimbursement, product development and COGS improvement programs. So we do expect to see operating expenses, increase in both absolute dollars and percentage of sales, particularly in 2022, and we should start to see some operating expense leverage in \u201823 and beyond. But I think importantly, we have the ability to modulate spend as we need to, and we're well positioned from a balance sheet perspective to make these investments. And that brings me to Slide 21 on cash usage. You'll see that over the first 9 months of this year, our average gross \u2013 our gross quarterly cash burn was $3.7 million, net burn was under $3 million. We ended the quarter with pro forma cash of $98 million. That includes the net proceeds from the $75 million follow-on we executed a few weeks ago. So we're now very well positioned to execute on our growth initiatives. But not only do this financing provide us with substantial cash runway, it added a number of very high-quality fundamental healthcare investors to a solid and growing shareholder base. And so we thank our investors both existing and new for the continued support and confidence. And then finally, before I turn it back to Chad, just a few comments on Slide 22 here regarding our cap table, we think it's important to paint a complete picture here, given that there are a couple of elements that don't show up in our issued and outstanding share count. So today, we have just under 40 million in issued and outstanding common shares. In addition, there are just under 14 million shares in prepaid funded warrants. So this would equate to 54 million shares in outstanding common and common equivalents. We also have about 6.3 million shares underlying our $19 million in convertible debt. So all in, as we think about our cap table is we represent just over 60 million common shares outstanding on a pro forma fully diluted basis. And we think it's important to provide this clarity on the call, just given the recent raise and historical funding mechanics for Apollo. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Chad. Yes, Chris, on DSOs, I can tell you that I am almost 90 days in now, I guess, 90 days in today. I have actually been really \u2013 was that \u2013 thank you, I have been really impressed with the company's ability to collect. And I think it's a function, both OUS and in the U.S. of the team really knowing the customer, particularly in OUS distribution. Mike and his team has just done a phenomenal job at building a customer base or whether you call them a direct distributor or otherwise and really understand their customer. And so we have been really pleased. We have not had collection issues to-date. And as we bring on new distributors, they are very well vetted. And so I think we continue to really push on collections and we have had a lot of success there. Yes. Adam, this is Jeff. I appreciate the question. Look, I think as we have talked about Q3 was \u2013 there was definitely COVID impact. And we are maybe less exposed to it than others that are more dependent upon inpatient hospital procedures. We do have a fair amount of our business is outpatient and even in surgery centers. So, I think we are probably less impacted, but we certainly saw the impact. And it's lumpy. And to the extent that we see concentrations of impact in geographies where we have greater amounts of business and will certainly be impacted. But I think we have got the benefit of being an outpatient. We have got the benefit of having being geographically dispersed, not just within U.S. geography, but globally. But that said, we are still seeing some pressure and we expect to continue seeing pressure. So, we are being cautiously optimistic and feel good about the guidance we put set forth. I would like to say that there is a huge backlog. We would love the backlog. That's not been our experience. And we are pretty certain that the business that we are seeing represents run rate demand. And going into the fourth quarter, it would have been great to start with the backlog, but that's not the case for us."

At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions and comments following the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Matt Kreps. Sir, the floor is yours.\nMatt Kreps: Thank you, Catherine, and thanks, everyone, for participating in today's call to discuss Apollo's second quarter 2021 financial and operating results. Joining me on the call are Chas McKhann, Chief Executive Officer; Stefanie Cavanaugh, our Chief Financial Officer. And also joining today's call is Jeff Black, our Incoming Chief Financial Officer, who will officially assume his duty upon filing of our second quarter Form 10-Q. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that comments made by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Federal Securities laws, including Apollo's financial outlook and Apollo's plans and timing for product development and sales. In addition, there is uncertainty about the continued spread of the COVID-19 virus and the ongoing impact it may have on our operations, the demand for our products, global supply chain and economic activity in general. These forward-looking statements involve material risks and uncertainties and cause actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of risk factors, I encourage you to review the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2020, filed previously with the Securities and Exchange Commission and our most recent Form 10-Q. The content of this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, August 3, 2021. Except as required by law, Apollo undertakes no obligation to revise or update any statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call. And now with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Chas.\nChas McKhann: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. Our strong momentum continued into the second quarter, driving our fourth straight quarter of sales growth. In the release that just crossed the wire, we reported record sales for endoscopy products of $16.6 million for the second quarter, leading us to increase our revenue guidance for the full year from $55 million to $57 million to now $61 million to $63 million. You may remember that my first call with you in May, I laid out a growth strategy with three phases: to energize the business, accelerate growth and lead from the front. Our investor deck available online includes a slide describing the three phases in more detail. The results are reported a clearly aligned with the first phase, energize as we seek to deliver transformational growth at Apollo. The energized phase is all about building momentum by driving near-term performance and achieving strategic milestones that will lay the foundation for years of sustainable growth. Customer demand for our products is increasing around the world, and we are seeing that reflected in our performance despite ongoing challenges presented by the pandemic. In addition to delivering record revenue for our Endoscopic Suturing and Intragastric Balloon businesses, we made substantial progress on many key initiatives. These include: first, transforming our senior leadership team with the recent appointments of Kirk Ellis, our VP of U.S. Sales: Steve Bosrock, our VP of Marketing and Medical Education; and Jeff Black, our Incoming CFO, who started this week and is with us on today's call. Second, strengthen and expanding our sales team. In the U.S., we have hired back 4 experienced sales reps, all of whom are fully trained on our products and were previously top performers. In addition, we have recently opened 6 additional new U.S. sales positions and some key positions in our international team to further improve coverage and allow our sales team to focus on driving growth in high priority geographies. Third, announcing that the MERIT study investigators have reported that in a preliminary analysis, the trial has achieved its primary efficacy and safety endpoints. And fourth, continuing the successful launch of our novel X-Tack Helix Tacking System with more than 120 active sites at the end of Q2. Since starting at Apollo earlier this year, I've been engaging with customers continually as have many on our leadership team. We consistently are feedback that physicians love our products, and now they also show our excitement for the revitalization that is taking place in Apollo. Turning now to updates on each of our product lines, starting with OverStitch. We continue to see strong OverStitch demand from our core users. We are very pleased to see that in Q2, growth of OverStitch was driven by an increase in both the total number of accounts ordering and the average revenue per account. This tells me that we are successfully growing the base of physicians who are trained and using OverStitch while also increasing adoption among our experienced users. Our mobile learning lab is back on the road training physicians on our products and our training programs continue to evolve to best meet the needs of physicians. We work closely with physician societies, such as the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, the ASGE, who just last week, hosted an excellent training program focused on Endoscopic Suturing with OverStitch. Outside the U.S., we are seeing strong results despite periodic COVID flare-ups in various markets around the world. Mike Gutteridge and our international team have done a remarkable job navigating these complex market dynamics in the first half of the year and conditions continue to improve in most of our markets. We do anticipate the disruptions from COVID will continue to pop up, but we are seeing broad basis of improvements in both our direct and distributor markets that we expect will continue to build in the second half of the year. Perhaps one of the most significant OverStitch milestones to date came in June at the Surgical Disruptive Technology Summit, where the MERIT study investigators announced that based on a preliminary analysis, the study has achieved its primary endpoints for both efficacy and safety. I'm pleased to now report that the MERIT study results have been accepted for a presentation by the International Federation for the Surgery of Obesity and Metabolic Disorders, otherwise known as IFSO, at their annual meeting in Miami in October. Based on the positive announcement about the MERIT trial endpoints, we anticipate filing a de novo submission with the FDA for a new indication for weight loss, most likely in the third quarter. In addition, we are initiating preparation for a comprehensive launch of the ESG procedure at the time of a new indication. We are very excited about this milestone because we believe ESG has the potential to be transformative, not just for our business but also to the millions of patients worldwide looking for weight loss solution that better fits their needs. As a reminder, there are more than 100 million adults in the U.S. alone with a BMI greater than 30 and there is a vast unmet clinical need for new treatment options. Our sense of optimism for ESG stems directly from what we hear from our customers who are expressing rising enthusiasm on 2 dimensions: first, that the ESG value proposition resonates very well with patients. And second, that they have been experienced success offering both provider-driven cash pay solutions as well as some positive case-by-case reimbursement decisions by private payers. Turning to X-Tack. The customer response continues to be very promising. On our May call, we announced that we had added over 50 accounts in the first quarter, and I'm pleased to say that we are now more than 120 accounts in the U.S. We also have initiated our OUS launch in select countries, including Hong Kong, Chile and Israel and are making plans for additional markets. Our OUS X-Tack launch will be targeted to select markets initially, while we work through the new procedures to gain CE Mark in Europe, which we believe will be a 2022 event. Our U.S. X-Tack rollout initially targeted experienced OverStitch users, which made good sense and generated initial interest in the product. Awareness about X-Tack continues to build in the GI community. And at the end of the second quarter, we have a pipeline of approximately 80 additional prospective accounts worth approximately $650,000 of initial orders to be delivered upon completion. That said, under the direction of Kirk Ellis and Steve Bosrock, our new commercial leadership team in the U.S. is increasingly focusing sales activities on driving additional utilization with any key targeted institutions rather than simply opening up a large number of new accounts. We believe this approach can generate more sustainable success by having multiple users at each hospital, including many who are not existing OverStitch users and create highly experienced advocates who see X-Tack as a vital tool that they rely on frequently for their closure needs. We are also supporting multiple clinical evaluations of X-Tack with several papers in development based on initial cases that have already been completed, and we look forward to the first clinical publications in the months ahead. We anticipate that these studies will further document X-Tack unique benefits and ease of use in the closure applications for which it was specifically designed. In short, we are very pleased with the initial clinical performance of this highly differentiated and effective product, and we look forward to building on its initial success going forward. Recognizing that these are simply anecdotes allow me to share some additional comments that we've just recently received about X-Tack. A physician within a large VA hospital shared, \u201cX-Tack is going to be the new normal in endoscopic repairs.\u201d From a user at a major medical center said, \u201cX-Tack has good applications and can replace the need for a lot of endocrips.\u201d And finally, a message from another KOL physician after their first case. \u201cI absolutely love the X-Tack device. I used it last week for the first time on a very challenging case, the X-Tack system worked beautifully, I'm 100% obsessed.\u201d This enthusiasm from our customers, driven by delivering better patient care and real clinical success is very roto our entire team, but especially to our R&D engineers who develop this outstanding product. And completing the product update, ORBERA continues to demonstrate very compelling performance on a global basis, achieving the best revenue quarter since the very early days of the launch of the U.S. I continue to believe that this is a potentially underappreciated asset. We're seeing growing market adoption of IGB as a less invasive but effective weight loss solution for those needing something more effective than diet and exercise alone. ORBERA is the leading IGB the market leader globally with an unmatched body of clinical evidence, excellent weight loss results and excellent value for the patient. A recent publication of new clinical practice guidelines by the American Gastroenterology Association have been very well received, and there were many positive sessions about the lower balloon therapy at the 2021 Digestive Disease Week meeting in May. Looking ahead, we believe the recent positive announcement of new Category I CPT codes for IGB procedures and the FDA breakthrough designation for the treatment of NASH further bolster the potential value of this franchise. We are now seeing rapidly rising interest among physicians in building dedicated endobariatric practices, another development in favor of ORBERA. The ASGE has created a specialty group called the Association of Bariatric Endoscopy that is focused on developing this emerging field. In addition, there were multiple sessions of the DBL view meeting about developing successful endobariatric practices, which include the placement of Intragastric Balloon such as ORBERA as one of the cornerstone procedures offered to patients. Over time, we believe that Endoscopic Suturing, including both primary ESG procedures and endoscopic revisions of prior bariatric surgeries could become the second cornerstone. Apollo's product lines are uniquely positioned to support this emerging field. And briefly an update on our ORBERA for NASH. Recall that non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, is a debilitating condition that impacts millions of patients and is one of the leading conditions that cause the need for a liver transplant. In February, we received a breakthrough designation for ORBERA for this new indication of NASH. We continue to work on potential designs for a NASH pivotal trial, and we'll continue to make additional updates on this as it becomes in a better focus. FDA's breakthrough designation was a seminal event for us and an affirmation of IGB's full potential as a therapeutic solution. With this update, I hope to have conveyed the tremendous sense of excitement and momentum that permeates Apollo right now. In my first two quarters as CEO, I've had the pleasure of hearing directly from our customers how positively they view Apollo's products. And in addition, our team here at Apollo has a passion for improving patient care and a dedication to advancing the field of therapeutic endoscopy. We are well positioned to deliver continued growth with large opportunities across all 3 of our product lines. We continue to build our capabilities, including addition to our sales and marketing team, and we work to scale supply and expand our volumes across all 3 platforms and move towards the accelerate phase of our growth strategy. With that, I'll turn the call over to Stefanie to cover the second quarter financial results. Stef?\nStefanie Cavanaugh: Thank you, Chas, and good afternoon, everyone. The second quarter of 2021 demonstrated strong growth, leading to record endoscopy revenue. This is indicative of our strong momentum as well as our recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, even with some U.S. states and OUS countries continuing to experience periodic COVID surges, which has continued to limit access in certain health care systems. Total revenue was $16.6 million, up 20% sequentially from the first quarter and 194% over the second quarter of 2020. ESS revenue increased 196% and IGB revenue increased 220% versus the prior year. Both product lines demonstrated large increases in both the U.S. and OUS markets, as demand for our products has continued to increase exiting the pandemic. As a reminder, X-Tack sales are included in our ESS results, which we don't intend to disclose separately at this time, but we did cross the $1 million mark in X-Tack sales since the launch in Q1. OUS markets performed well in the quarter as activity continued to increase as more of our markets recover from the effects of the pandemic. In particular, we are very pleased with performance of our direct markets in Europe. Despite COVID-related shutdowns in a number of countries in Q2, our European direct markets delivered 190% growth compared to the prior year quarter and 24% sequential growth as both OverStitch and ORBERA demand improved. This strong Q2 performance gives us confidence in the growing market opportunities for both product lines in key markets around the world. Gross margin also continued to improve, increasing to 55% due to higher sales and the accretive contribution from X-Tack, which was designed from the beginning to be accretive to our historical consolidated gross margin. In addition, we continue to make progress on our internal program of gross margin improvement projects. Operating expenses increased as we expanded investment in growth initiatives, including strategic hiring in our marketing and sales organization as well as higher stock-based compensation expense as compared to the cost controls we implemented during the pandemic in the prior year. Operating loss also increased to $5.2 million, primarily as a result of the non-cash stock compensation expense I just mentioned. We recorded a $2.9 million benefit on the forgiveness of the PPP loan this quarter, resulting in a net loss of $3 million or $0.11 per share. Excluding the non-cash stock compensation and loan forgiveness, our net loss improved 42% compared to the second quarter of 2020 and 14% on a sequential basis this year. Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash position remained strong at $31.2 million compared with $32.6 million at the end of the first quarter, a decline of just over $1 million as the $2 million used for operations this quarter was offset by $1 million of stock option proceeds. As Chas mentioned at the beginning, we are pleased to have delivered a solid first half and increased our full year revenue target from the $55 million to $57 million estimated on our last call to the $61 million to $63 million today, representing a $6 million increase and annual revenue growth of 45% to 50%. A number of continued uncertainties are reflected in that range. We continue to anticipate ongoing uncertainty around the impact of COVID-19 variance in certain markets, particularly OUS in the second half of 2021. We also anticipate a typical seasonal summer slowdown in procedure volumes in the third quarter. And finally, we are still in the early days of our X-Tack product launch and continue to learn about the likely growth in new accounts and X-Tack utilization over time.\nChas McKhann: Thanks, Stefanie. And before we move to Q&A, I would like to officially welcome and introduce Jeff Black, who joins Apollo as CFO this week. Jeff brings 30 years of experience to Apollo Endosurgery, most recently, he served as Chief Financial Officer at Alphatec Holdings, a medical technology company providing spinal fusion solutions. Jeff played a key role in the successful turnaround of the company, securing nearly $500 million in financing to support accelerated growth, transform the balance sheet and execute strategic acquisitions. Under his leadership, Alphatec grew from a market capitalization of $20 million to more than $1.5 billion. I would also like to thank Stefanie for an invaluable contribution to Apollo over the past 6 years, and I'm very pleased that Steph will be continuing on with us as we position the company for the next phase of growth. Stefanie, thank you, and Jeff, welcome to Apollo.\nJeffrey Black: Thank you, Chas, and good afternoon, everybody. I could not be happier to be joining Chas and the team during a very exciting time for the company. There's a tremendous opportunity ahead of us to improve patient lives, to transform and even expand a very large and growing market with truly differentiated technology and all with the eye toward continuing to build shareholder value. Stef's built a very strong finance foundation here at Apollo. I look forward to partnering her with her as we prudently scale the organization to support our plans for accelerated growth. Many of you on this call, I know and looking forward to getting reconnected and reacquainted. Others, I don't, and looking forward to getting to know you in the coming days and weeks. With that, that concludes our prepared remarks, and I'll turn it back over to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Matt Hewitt with Craig-Hallum. Your line is live.\nMatt Hewitt: Good afternoon, and congratulations on the very strong quarter and welcome, Jeff.\nChas McKhann: Thanks, Matt.\nJeffrey Black: Thank you.\nMatt Hewitt: First off, obviously, a big bounce back from where we were a year ago, a relatively easy comp, given what happened a year ago, but we're still seeing pockets that you were able to put up some really strong numbers. How much of that do you think was some pent-up demand versus just the growth that you're seeing in new sites offering X-Tack, OverStitch, ORBERA coming back? Is there a way to kind of parse through it and see where that growth is coming from?\nChas McKhann: Yeah, Matt. We actually think this is real growth, right? As you recall, we had a little bit of a bounce back in Q3 of last year, and it had by our circular terms, a very strong Q3, especially when you factor in seasonality. Since then, we've been growing quarter-on-quarter since then. And so, the underlying demand across all 3 products is really driving that growth. Yes, of course, X-Tack is incremental, and we're happy about that. But we're also seeing really strong performances with both OverStitch and with the blue franchise.\nMatt Hewitt: That's great. And then, I guess, pointing to X-Tack, obviously, a fantastic quarter of additions to the sites. And I'm curious, have you - is there a learning curve on getting through some of these hospital committees that you've kind of figured out, now it should enable you to get through the next 80 quicker? Or is it just every site is different and you kind of got to go through a different process with each of them?\nChas McKhann: It's a little bit of both, Matt. We certainly can learn some best practices as we've been through it now. But you are right, every hospital has their own processes. And some of them that we thought would go quickly, have taken longer and others have moved really rapidly. It's hard to predict. This is an area that it helps as we continue to build the team just to have more folks available to sort of shepherd that and manage the process. But I'd also reiterate, we also are very much focusing the team and we're happy to continue to take on additional customers and work through the process. But we're really focusing our sales team, especially with the new commercial leadership on depth of utilization. We want to make sure not only get the product on the shelf, but to make sure that we're targeting multiple users in each account and have it become part of the practice. And that takes some work, right? That's changing behavior in medicine and getting them used to using the product and incorporating in their day-today practice. But we're seeing positive examples of that, and that's going to be really our primary focus.\nMatt Hewitt: Okay. That's great. Maybe one last one and then I'll hop back in the queue. Regarding the new salespeople. So you added 4 domestic here in the quarter. It sounds like you've got a few more openings that you're going to be hopefully filling. Could you give us an update what is your current headcount for both the domestic sales team and then the international direct markets? Thank you.\nChas McKhann: For the domestic sales team, we have - with the four additions, we have 20 sales reps and then a total team of about 25 people, many account managers and another role. The\u2026\nStefanie Cavanaugh: OUS is similar.\nChas McKhann: Yeah, OUS is a similar size, would give you the exact number, but it's very similar in scale.\nMatt Hewitt: That's great. Thank you very much, and congratulations.\nChas McKhann: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Adam Maeder with Piper Sandler. Your line is live.\nAdam Maeder: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on the great quarter and echo Matt's comments. Jeff, welcome aboard. And congrats on the new role and Stef kudos to you on a job well done. Maybe just to start with one on the guidance. I was hoping you could kind of rehash that a little bit for us. Just walk through the different components there, assumptions for the different segments in the business. I think, Stefanie, you talked a little bit about seasonality in Q3 and maybe some conservatism around the delta variant or COVID. So, is it reasonable to assume that there's something baked in there for those items? And then just broad strokes, thinking about the cadence in the back half of the year, Q3 versus Q4, I would be curious in getting some color there as well. And I had a follow-up or two.\nChas McKhann: Sure. Thanks, Adam. As we look to the back half of the year, we don't break out the individual products, but as you can see from our results, we're seeing growth across all three product lines. So we're excited about that. We - as I said in the comments, we absolutely are expecting recepted a seasonal effect. I mean, last year is obviously a little bit of an outlier. But if you go back to 2019 and even before that, we have historically shown a seasonal impact. And if anything, it may be more pronounced this year, right? Think about just vacations and schedules. We have a big international business, as you know. And so, European holidays in August, all indications are, if they used to take two weeks, they might take three, right? Just - so the seasonal impact is real, and we're certainly planning for some of that I think the COVID piece, as I mentioned in my comments, I've been very impressed with how the team has managed through it, but we certainly see examples. And I think we used to talk about coming out of COVID. I'm not sure what the new norm will be in terms of COVID going forward, but we're certainly watching that carefully primarily outside the U.S., but occasional pockets here, so far, not a major impact in the U.S., but Louisiana, Florida are markets that all of us are watching for obvious reasons. And then just on the learning curve of X-Tack, it hadn't been in humans before six months ago. So we're still learning the uptake in both new accounts and utilization. So, all of those are factored into the range and certainly would see a seasonal impact in Q3. And historically, Q4 is a strong quarter for us.\nAdam Maeder: That's really helpful, Chas. Thanks for all the color there. And then if I can sneak in two more. There were a handful of positive updates given on the call today. So, maybe just starting with OverStitch and the MERIT study. I guess, the question here is, really on how do you think about a potential impact from a reimbursement or a payer perspective? When could that come to fruition? Is that a 2022 or 2023 event? And then you gave the update on the de novo submission for a weight loss indication. I think you said that's most likely a Q3 filing. I'm assuming that means ESG-specific label. Do I have that right? And is that potentially kind of a mid-2022 item? And then I'll sneak in one more, if that's okay, after that.\nChas McKhann: Sure. The - so ESG in the development, you're right, the two major milestones in front of us will be the presentation of the MERIT data itself and then using that towards an indication. And as I mentioned on the call, we are working feverishly and would hope to have that the submission for the novo potentially this quarter. That's a 6- to 12-month process depending on the level of questions. And so, in our investor deck, we have a kind of wide range of first half of next year, and we'll update it as we learn more on that. And I focus on the indication because I think it's an important part of the answer to your question about reimbursement. As I mentioned in my comments, we're already seeing examples of our customers. And again, we're not promoting it, right? This is our customers independently following two models, both a cash pay model as well as a case-by-case reimbursement model, prior authorizations using existing unlisted codes and do it quite successfully. And I would say, especially for revisions of bariatric surgeries. And so, we're in the learning stage right now to seeing what they are doing and where they're having success and then what actions we can then would be able to appropriately take if and when we have the indication. And those two models, both cash pay and the case-by-case reimbursement with an indication, we think can be very successful in driving a lot of growth. While we would have been working on, I think the basis of your question, the broader coding coverage and payment that will need to also take place. And so we have plans in place to pursue the procedural codes, so things like new APC codes and as well as inpatient, but it is primarily an outpatient procedure. So the new codes there. Those can happen pretty quickly in terms of the filing after the indications, but then often take a fair amount of time to again put into place, so probably more of a 2023 kind of event. And then the CPT coding, the societies drive that, and they're working through it, but that also will take some time. As you know, the balloon codes we just got approvals for, they don't go into place until 2023. And so, if anything, ESG will probably be at least a year later than that just because you need the data, we needed to work through the processes. But again, summarizing, I'd say we've got a lot of opportunities in hearing now even using the existing practices that our customers are already pursuing.\nAdam Maeder: That's a great update. Thanks for that. And if I can sneak in just one more. Maybe transitioning to ORBERA and the NASH indication. It sounds like the path forward there in terms of trial design is still a little bit in progress or development. Can you give us any flavor at this point in time in terms of kind of what you think will be required from a clinical trial standpoint in terms of number of patients or follow-up? Just trying to get some sort of rough sense for when this could be on label in the States. Thanks, again, and congrats on the strong performance.\nChas McKhann: Yeah. Thanks, Adam. The - not much of an update, honestly, on the NASH just because we're still working through - I think I mentioned on the last call, there are a lot of benefits to the breakthrough designation. But one of the elements we get is that we end up working with not one of the two agencies on the design of the trial because they both have a say in what it looks like. And so, we're working with them on the design, and I'm optimistic that we'll get that work through in a reasonable course. But it's hard to speculate on exactly what the trial will look like until we're a little further along in that process. And so we're working on it, and we'll provide an update once we have something tangible.\nAdam Maeder: Sounds good. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Frank Takkinen from Lake Street.\nFrank Takkinen: Hey, thanks for taking my questions. And I echo previous comments about welcome, Jeff, and thanks for everything you've done, Stef. It's been a fantastic run and glad to see you sticking on board for the remainder of the year at the minimum. Couple questions from me. I wanted to first start with X-Tack. I heard your comments about both new accounts as well as utilization. I was hoping, one, you could kind of help us frame the broader total account opportunity beyond the 200 - 120 plus 80 so far as well as some of the utilization trends you are seeing in the early days and how you believe utilization can trend over time and to what level some of your higher-level users may get to?\nChas McKhann: Yes. The - so first, on the account universe, one of the exercises that we've done with the new - since the new team has come on board is, we purchased very detailed level data on procedures and we get to by account and by physician of relevant procedures, for example, mucosal resection procedures that are being done in the goal. And from that, we can glean a pretty good understanding of where the procedure volumes are both within the hospital setting as well as within the ASC setting. And based off of those data, we've got a pretty good indication that there could be as many as 1,500 to 2,000 accounts in the U.S. Now that all remains to be seen, but that's based off of real data with - and with a pretty high cutoff in terms of how many procedures they're doing each year. So, we're still in the early days of this. And more importantly, we're going to focus, as I said, on the high - and even within that data, I mentioned the sort of broader universe at the top levels of that universe to get depth in those institutions. To the second question, the utilization, frankly, we're still learning on that. I mean, what we continue to hear is that X-Tack has applicability to a broader user base than OverStitch. It's pretty common for OverStitch to have, say, a couple of users within - even a pretty large account because of the learning curve involved with OverStitch. And - but in some of our early accounts with X-Tack, we see examples of the four or five physicians or more who are already interested and others who are learning about it. So, at an account level, the utilization potential will really be dependent on our ability to identify and train and engage multiple users who then incorporate into their practice. And so, as we get more data and more experience than we may be decision to give you sort of firmer numbers on that, but that's what we're focused on right now.\nFrank Takkinen: Got it. That makes sense. And then transitioning over to OverStitch, could you - or ESS in general, could you break out a little bit more the - some of the puts and takes driving the strength in the quarter? And specifically, could you maybe speak to ESG trends, growth rates, if you have anything of that nature you could share with us?\nChas McKhann: Well, what I said in the opening comments broadly is we have seen a growth in the number of accounts using in the quarter as well as the average per account. And so the number of accounts, which in the U.S. is now at 400 accounts who are actively using in Q3 - sorry, Q2. And that's driven by both our core GI, so call it non-bariatric. In fact, that's where a lot of people often start using OverStitch, especially if they are GIs. And I mentioned, we're doing a lot of training programs, you've seen bring people on there. And then we also are growing in the revenue per account, and that can be both from the core GI side as well as from the bariatric practices. I think we want to get a little bit more experience and certainly get into the zone of having a new indication to really be able to talk through the sort of endobariatric opportunity. But suffice it to say that we certainly have examples of a number of customers who have embraced that opportunity and being quite successful using both of the payment models that I mentioned before.\nFrank Takkinen: Got it. And then last one for me. OpEx is a little bit elevated. That makes sense with a strong quarter. I applaud spending to grow the business, establish as a standard of care. I was curious if we should look at Q2 as a run rate on a go-forward basis or if there is anything specific in the operating expense, we should know about that may not recur on a go-forward basis.\nStefanie Cavanaugh: No, I think you're right. It is indicative of the future moving forward. What I would point out, however, is a fair amount of the increase from Q1 to Q2 is a noncash stock comp related item. And when you get to our Q filing, you'll be able to see all that broken out in the footprint in our cash flow reports. But essentially, that went up quite a bit from Q1 to Q2 for all of the performance-related options and stock units given our good performance. So, we expect that trend to continue move into the moving forward quarters.\nFrank Takkinen: Perfect. Thank you for taking all my questions.\nOperator: We have no further questions from the lines at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back to Chas McKhann for closing remarks.\nChas McKhann: Thank you, Catherine, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. It's been a busy and rewarding second quarter, and we've got even more excitement for the second half of the year as we continue to energize the business and pursue attractive opportunities. If you have any questions you would like to arrange a call with us, please contact Matt Kreps from Darrow Associates. Thank you, and have a great evening.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect at this time, and a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Stefanie Cavanaugh",
            "content": "Thank you, Chas, and good afternoon, everyone. The second quarter of 2021 demonstrated strong growth, leading to record endoscopy revenue. This is indicative of our strong momentum as well as our recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, even with some U.S. states and OUS countries continuing to experience periodic COVID surges, which has continued to limit access in certain health care systems. Total revenue was $16.6 million, up 20% sequentially from the first quarter and 194% over the second quarter of 2020. ESS revenue increased 196% and IGB revenue increased 220% versus the prior year. Both product lines demonstrated large increases in both the U.S. and OUS markets, as demand for our products has continued to increase exiting the pandemic. As a reminder, X-Tack sales are included in our ESS results, which we don't intend to disclose separately at this time, but we did cross the $1 million mark in X-Tack sales since the launch in Q1. OUS markets performed well in the quarter as activity continued to increase as more of our markets recover from the effects of the pandemic. In particular, we are very pleased with performance of our direct markets in Europe. Despite COVID-related shutdowns in a number of countries in Q2, our European direct markets delivered 190% growth compared to the prior year quarter and 24% sequential growth as both OverStitch and ORBERA demand improved. This strong Q2 performance gives us confidence in the growing market opportunities for both product lines in key markets around the world. Gross margin also continued to improve, increasing to 55% due to higher sales and the accretive contribution from X-Tack, which was designed from the beginning to be accretive to our historical consolidated gross margin. In addition, we continue to make progress on our internal program of gross margin improvement projects. Operating expenses increased as we expanded investment in growth initiatives, including strategic hiring in our marketing and sales organization as well as higher stock-based compensation expense as compared to the cost controls we implemented during the pandemic in the prior year. Operating loss also increased to $5.2 million, primarily as a result of the non-cash stock compensation expense I just mentioned. We recorded a $2.9 million benefit on the forgiveness of the PPP loan this quarter, resulting in a net loss of $3 million or $0.11 per share. Excluding the non-cash stock compensation and loan forgiveness, our net loss improved 42% compared to the second quarter of 2020 and 14% on a sequential basis this year. Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash position remained strong at $31.2 million compared with $32.6 million at the end of the first quarter, a decline of just over $1 million as the $2 million used for operations this quarter was offset by $1 million of stock option proceeds. As Chas mentioned at the beginning, we are pleased to have delivered a solid first half and increased our full year revenue target from the $55 million to $57 million estimated on our last call to the $61 million to $63 million today, representing a $6 million increase and annual revenue growth of 45% to 50%. A number of continued uncertainties are reflected in that range. We continue to anticipate ongoing uncertainty around the impact of COVID-19 variance in certain markets, particularly OUS in the second half of 2021. We also anticipate a typical seasonal summer slowdown in procedure volumes in the third quarter. And finally, we are still in the early days of our X-Tack product launch and continue to learn about the likely growth in new accounts and X-Tack utilization over time. OUS is similar. No, I think you're right. It is indicative of the future moving forward. What I would point out, however, is a fair amount of the increase from Q1 to Q2 is a noncash stock comp related item. And when you get to our Q filing, you'll be able to see all that broken out in the footprint in our cash flow reports. But essentially, that went up quite a bit from Q1 to Q2 for all of the performance-related options and stock units given our good performance. So, we expect that trend to continue move into the moving forward quarters."

            "name": "Chas McKhann",
            "content": "Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. Our strong momentum continued into the second quarter, driving our fourth straight quarter of sales growth. In the release that just crossed the wire, we reported record sales for endoscopy products of $16.6 million for the second quarter, leading us to increase our revenue guidance for the full year from $55 million to $57 million to now $61 million to $63 million. You may remember that my first call with you in May, I laid out a growth strategy with three phases: to energize the business, accelerate growth and lead from the front. Our investor deck available online includes a slide describing the three phases in more detail. The results are reported a clearly aligned with the first phase, energize as we seek to deliver transformational growth at Apollo. The energized phase is all about building momentum by driving near-term performance and achieving strategic milestones that will lay the foundation for years of sustainable growth. Customer demand for our products is increasing around the world, and we are seeing that reflected in our performance despite ongoing challenges presented by the pandemic. In addition to delivering record revenue for our Endoscopic Suturing and Intragastric Balloon businesses, we made substantial progress on many key initiatives. These include: first, transforming our senior leadership team with the recent appointments of Kirk Ellis, our VP of U.S. Sales: Steve Bosrock, our VP of Marketing and Medical Education; and Jeff Black, our Incoming CFO, who started this week and is with us on today's call. Second, strengthen and expanding our sales team. In the U.S., we have hired back 4 experienced sales reps, all of whom are fully trained on our products and were previously top performers. In addition, we have recently opened 6 additional new U.S. sales positions and some key positions in our international team to further improve coverage and allow our sales team to focus on driving growth in high priority geographies. Third, announcing that the MERIT study investigators have reported that in a preliminary analysis, the trial has achieved its primary efficacy and safety endpoints. And fourth, continuing the successful launch of our novel X-Tack Helix Tacking System with more than 120 active sites at the end of Q2. Since starting at Apollo earlier this year, I've been engaging with customers continually as have many on our leadership team. We consistently are feedback that physicians love our products, and now they also show our excitement for the revitalization that is taking place in Apollo. Turning now to updates on each of our product lines, starting with OverStitch. We continue to see strong OverStitch demand from our core users. We are very pleased to see that in Q2, growth of OverStitch was driven by an increase in both the total number of accounts ordering and the average revenue per account. This tells me that we are successfully growing the base of physicians who are trained and using OverStitch while also increasing adoption among our experienced users. Our mobile learning lab is back on the road training physicians on our products and our training programs continue to evolve to best meet the needs of physicians. We work closely with physician societies, such as the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, the ASGE, who just last week, hosted an excellent training program focused on Endoscopic Suturing with OverStitch. Outside the U.S., we are seeing strong results despite periodic COVID flare-ups in various markets around the world. Mike Gutteridge and our international team have done a remarkable job navigating these complex market dynamics in the first half of the year and conditions continue to improve in most of our markets. We do anticipate the disruptions from COVID will continue to pop up, but we are seeing broad basis of improvements in both our direct and distributor markets that we expect will continue to build in the second half of the year. Perhaps one of the most significant OverStitch milestones to date came in June at the Surgical Disruptive Technology Summit, where the MERIT study investigators announced that based on a preliminary analysis, the study has achieved its primary endpoints for both efficacy and safety. I'm pleased to now report that the MERIT study results have been accepted for a presentation by the International Federation for the Surgery of Obesity and Metabolic Disorders, otherwise known as IFSO, at their annual meeting in Miami in October. Based on the positive announcement about the MERIT trial endpoints, we anticipate filing a de novo submission with the FDA for a new indication for weight loss, most likely in the third quarter. In addition, we are initiating preparation for a comprehensive launch of the ESG procedure at the time of a new indication. We are very excited about this milestone because we believe ESG has the potential to be transformative, not just for our business but also to the millions of patients worldwide looking for weight loss solution that better fits their needs. As a reminder, there are more than 100 million adults in the U.S. alone with a BMI greater than 30 and there is a vast unmet clinical need for new treatment options. Our sense of optimism for ESG stems directly from what we hear from our customers who are expressing rising enthusiasm on 2 dimensions: first, that the ESG value proposition resonates very well with patients. And second, that they have been experienced success offering both provider-driven cash pay solutions as well as some positive case-by-case reimbursement decisions by private payers. Turning to X-Tack. The customer response continues to be very promising. On our May call, we announced that we had added over 50 accounts in the first quarter, and I'm pleased to say that we are now more than 120 accounts in the U.S. We also have initiated our OUS launch in select countries, including Hong Kong, Chile and Israel and are making plans for additional markets. Our OUS X-Tack launch will be targeted to select markets initially, while we work through the new procedures to gain CE Mark in Europe, which we believe will be a 2022 event. Our U.S. X-Tack rollout initially targeted experienced OverStitch users, which made good sense and generated initial interest in the product. Awareness about X-Tack continues to build in the GI community. And at the end of the second quarter, we have a pipeline of approximately 80 additional prospective accounts worth approximately $650,000 of initial orders to be delivered upon completion. That said, under the direction of Kirk Ellis and Steve Bosrock, our new commercial leadership team in the U.S. is increasingly focusing sales activities on driving additional utilization with any key targeted institutions rather than simply opening up a large number of new accounts. We believe this approach can generate more sustainable success by having multiple users at each hospital, including many who are not existing OverStitch users and create highly experienced advocates who see X-Tack as a vital tool that they rely on frequently for their closure needs. We are also supporting multiple clinical evaluations of X-Tack with several papers in development based on initial cases that have already been completed, and we look forward to the first clinical publications in the months ahead. We anticipate that these studies will further document X-Tack unique benefits and ease of use in the closure applications for which it was specifically designed. In short, we are very pleased with the initial clinical performance of this highly differentiated and effective product, and we look forward to building on its initial success going forward. Recognizing that these are simply anecdotes allow me to share some additional comments that we've just recently received about X-Tack. A physician within a large VA hospital shared, \u201cX-Tack is going to be the new normal in endoscopic repairs.\u201d From a user at a major medical center said, \u201cX-Tack has good applications and can replace the need for a lot of endocrips.\u201d And finally, a message from another KOL physician after their first case. \u201cI absolutely love the X-Tack device. I used it last week for the first time on a very challenging case, the X-Tack system worked beautifully, I'm 100% obsessed.\u201d This enthusiasm from our customers, driven by delivering better patient care and real clinical success is very roto our entire team, but especially to our R&D engineers who develop this outstanding product. And completing the product update, ORBERA continues to demonstrate very compelling performance on a global basis, achieving the best revenue quarter since the very early days of the launch of the U.S. I continue to believe that this is a potentially underappreciated asset. We're seeing growing market adoption of IGB as a less invasive but effective weight loss solution for those needing something more effective than diet and exercise alone. ORBERA is the leading IGB the market leader globally with an unmatched body of clinical evidence, excellent weight loss results and excellent value for the patient. A recent publication of new clinical practice guidelines by the American Gastroenterology Association have been very well received, and there were many positive sessions about the lower balloon therapy at the 2021 Digestive Disease Week meeting in May. Looking ahead, we believe the recent positive announcement of new Category I CPT codes for IGB procedures and the FDA breakthrough designation for the treatment of NASH further bolster the potential value of this franchise. We are now seeing rapidly rising interest among physicians in building dedicated endobariatric practices, another development in favor of ORBERA. The ASGE has created a specialty group called the Association of Bariatric Endoscopy that is focused on developing this emerging field. In addition, there were multiple sessions of the DBL view meeting about developing successful endobariatric practices, which include the placement of Intragastric Balloon such as ORBERA as one of the cornerstone procedures offered to patients. Over time, we believe that Endoscopic Suturing, including both primary ESG procedures and endoscopic revisions of prior bariatric surgeries could become the second cornerstone. Apollo's product lines are uniquely positioned to support this emerging field. And briefly an update on our ORBERA for NASH. Recall that non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, is a debilitating condition that impacts millions of patients and is one of the leading conditions that cause the need for a liver transplant. In February, we received a breakthrough designation for ORBERA for this new indication of NASH. We continue to work on potential designs for a NASH pivotal trial, and we'll continue to make additional updates on this as it becomes in a better focus. FDA's breakthrough designation was a seminal event for us and an affirmation of IGB's full potential as a therapeutic solution. With this update, I hope to have conveyed the tremendous sense of excitement and momentum that permeates Apollo right now. In my first two quarters as CEO, I've had the pleasure of hearing directly from our customers how positively they view Apollo's products. And in addition, our team here at Apollo has a passion for improving patient care and a dedication to advancing the field of therapeutic endoscopy. We are well positioned to deliver continued growth with large opportunities across all 3 of our product lines. We continue to build our capabilities, including addition to our sales and marketing team, and we work to scale supply and expand our volumes across all 3 platforms and move towards the accelerate phase of our growth strategy. With that, I'll turn the call over to Stefanie to cover the second quarter financial results. Stef? Thanks, Stefanie. And before we move to Q&A, I would like to officially welcome and introduce Jeff Black, who joins Apollo as CFO this week. Jeff brings 30 years of experience to Apollo Endosurgery, most recently, he served as Chief Financial Officer at Alphatec Holdings, a medical technology company providing spinal fusion solutions. Jeff played a key role in the successful turnaround of the company, securing nearly $500 million in financing to support accelerated growth, transform the balance sheet and execute strategic acquisitions. Under his leadership, Alphatec grew from a market capitalization of $20 million to more than $1.5 billion. I would also like to thank Stefanie for an invaluable contribution to Apollo over the past 6 years, and I'm very pleased that Steph will be continuing on with us as we position the company for the next phase of growth. Stefanie, thank you, and Jeff, welcome to Apollo. Thanks, Matt. Yeah, Matt. We actually think this is real growth, right? As you recall, we had a little bit of a bounce back in Q3 of last year, and it had by our circular terms, a very strong Q3, especially when you factor in seasonality. Since then, we've been growing quarter-on-quarter since then. And so, the underlying demand across all 3 products is really driving that growth. Yes, of course, X-Tack is incremental, and we're happy about that. But we're also seeing really strong performances with both OverStitch and with the blue franchise. It's a little bit of both, Matt. We certainly can learn some best practices as we've been through it now. But you are right, every hospital has their own processes. And some of them that we thought would go quickly, have taken longer and others have moved really rapidly. It's hard to predict. This is an area that it helps as we continue to build the team just to have more folks available to sort of shepherd that and manage the process. But I'd also reiterate, we also are very much focusing the team and we're happy to continue to take on additional customers and work through the process. But we're really focusing our sales team, especially with the new commercial leadership on depth of utilization. We want to make sure not only get the product on the shelf, but to make sure that we're targeting multiple users in each account and have it become part of the practice. And that takes some work, right? That's changing behavior in medicine and getting them used to using the product and incorporating in their day-today practice. But we're seeing positive examples of that, and that's going to be really our primary focus. For the domestic sales team, we have - with the four additions, we have 20 sales reps and then a total team of about 25 people, many account managers and another role. The... Yeah, OUS is a similar size, would give you the exact number, but it's very similar in scale. Thanks, Matt. Sure. Thanks, Adam. As we look to the back half of the year, we don't break out the individual products, but as you can see from our results, we're seeing growth across all three product lines. So we're excited about that. We - as I said in the comments, we absolutely are expecting recepted a seasonal effect. I mean, last year is obviously a little bit of an outlier. But if you go back to 2019 and even before that, we have historically shown a seasonal impact. And if anything, it may be more pronounced this year, right? Think about just vacations and schedules. We have a big international business, as you know. And so, European holidays in August, all indications are, if they used to take two weeks, they might take three, right? Just - so the seasonal impact is real, and we're certainly planning for some of that I think the COVID piece, as I mentioned in my comments, I've been very impressed with how the team has managed through it, but we certainly see examples. And I think we used to talk about coming out of COVID. I'm not sure what the new norm will be in terms of COVID going forward, but we're certainly watching that carefully primarily outside the U.S., but occasional pockets here, so far, not a major impact in the U.S., but Louisiana, Florida are markets that all of us are watching for obvious reasons. And then just on the learning curve of X-Tack, it hadn't been in humans before six months ago. So we're still learning the uptake in both new accounts and utilization. So, all of those are factored into the range and certainly would see a seasonal impact in Q3. And historically, Q4 is a strong quarter for us. Sure. The - so ESG in the development, you're right, the two major milestones in front of us will be the presentation of the MERIT data itself and then using that towards an indication. And as I mentioned on the call, we are working feverishly and would hope to have that the submission for the novo potentially this quarter. That's a 6- to 12-month process depending on the level of questions. And so, in our investor deck, we have a kind of wide range of first half of next year, and we'll update it as we learn more on that. And I focus on the indication because I think it's an important part of the answer to your question about reimbursement. As I mentioned in my comments, we're already seeing examples of our customers. And again, we're not promoting it, right? This is our customers independently following two models, both a cash pay model as well as a case-by-case reimbursement model, prior authorizations using existing unlisted codes and do it quite successfully. And I would say, especially for revisions of bariatric surgeries. And so, we're in the learning stage right now to seeing what they are doing and where they're having success and then what actions we can then would be able to appropriately take if and when we have the indication. And those two models, both cash pay and the case-by-case reimbursement with an indication, we think can be very successful in driving a lot of growth. While we would have been working on, I think the basis of your question, the broader coding coverage and payment that will need to also take place. And so we have plans in place to pursue the procedural codes, so things like new APC codes and as well as inpatient, but it is primarily an outpatient procedure. So the new codes there. Those can happen pretty quickly in terms of the filing after the indications, but then often take a fair amount of time to again put into place, so probably more of a 2023 kind of event. And then the CPT coding, the societies drive that, and they're working through it, but that also will take some time. As you know, the balloon codes we just got approvals for, they don't go into place until 2023. And so, if anything, ESG will probably be at least a year later than that just because you need the data, we needed to work through the processes. But again, summarizing, I'd say we've got a lot of opportunities in hearing now even using the existing practices that our customers are already pursuing. Yeah. Thanks, Adam. The - not much of an update, honestly, on the NASH just because we're still working through - I think I mentioned on the last call, there are a lot of benefits to the breakthrough designation. But one of the elements we get is that we end up working with not one of the two agencies on the design of the trial because they both have a say in what it looks like. And so, we're working with them on the design, and I'm optimistic that we'll get that work through in a reasonable course. But it's hard to speculate on exactly what the trial will look like until we're a little further along in that process. And so we're working on it, and we'll provide an update once we have something tangible. Yes. The - so first, on the account universe, one of the exercises that we've done with the new - since the new team has come on board is, we purchased very detailed level data on procedures and we get to by account and by physician of relevant procedures, for example, mucosal resection procedures that are being done in the goal. And from that, we can glean a pretty good understanding of where the procedure volumes are both within the hospital setting as well as within the ASC setting. And based off of those data, we've got a pretty good indication that there could be as many as 1,500 to 2,000 accounts in the U.S. Now that all remains to be seen, but that's based off of real data with - and with a pretty high cutoff in terms of how many procedures they're doing each year. So, we're still in the early days of this. And more importantly, we're going to focus, as I said, on the high - and even within that data, I mentioned the sort of broader universe at the top levels of that universe to get depth in those institutions. To the second question, the utilization, frankly, we're still learning on that. I mean, what we continue to hear is that X-Tack has applicability to a broader user base than OverStitch. It's pretty common for OverStitch to have, say, a couple of users within - even a pretty large account because of the learning curve involved with OverStitch. And - but in some of our early accounts with X-Tack, we see examples of the four or five physicians or more who are already interested and others who are learning about it. So, at an account level, the utilization potential will really be dependent on our ability to identify and train and engage multiple users who then incorporate into their practice. And so, as we get more data and more experience than we may be decision to give you sort of firmer numbers on that, but that's what we're focused on right now. Well, what I said in the opening comments broadly is we have seen a growth in the number of accounts using in the quarter as well as the average per account. And so the number of accounts, which in the U.S. is now at 400 accounts who are actively using in Q3 - sorry, Q2. And that's driven by both our core GI, so call it non-bariatric. In fact, that's where a lot of people often start using OverStitch, especially if they are GIs. And I mentioned, we're doing a lot of training programs, you've seen bring people on there. And then we also are growing in the revenue per account, and that can be both from the core GI side as well as from the bariatric practices. I think we want to get a little bit more experience and certainly get into the zone of having a new indication to really be able to talk through the sort of endobariatric opportunity. But suffice it to say that we certainly have examples of a number of customers who have embraced that opportunity and being quite successful using both of the payment models that I mentioned before. Thank you, Catherine, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. It's been a busy and rewarding second quarter, and we've got even more excitement for the second half of the year as we continue to energize the business and pursue attractive opportunities. If you have any questions you would like to arrange a call with us, please contact Matt Kreps from Darrow Associates. Thank you, and have a great evening."

And the floor will be opened for your questions and comments following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Matt Kreps of Darrow Associates. Sir, the floor is yours.\nMatt Kreps: Thank you, Catherine and thanks everyone for participating in today's call to discuss Apollo's first quarter 2021 financial and operating results. Joining me on the call are Charles McKhann, our Chief Executive Officer; and Stefanie Cavanaugh, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to caution listeners that comments made by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, including Apollo's financial outlook and Apollo's plans and timing for product development and sales. In addition, there is uncertainty around the spread of the COVID-19 virus and the ultimate impact it may have on our operations, the demand for our products, global supply chains, and economic activity in general.  These forward-looking statements involve material risks and uncertainties and could cause actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of risk factors, I encourage you to review the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2020, filed previously with the Securities and Exchange Commission and our most recent form 10-Q. The content of this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the day of this live broadcast, May 4th, 2021. Except as required by law, Apollo undertakes no obligation to revise or update any statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Charles.\nCharles McKhann: Thanks Matt. Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. I'm pleased to speak with you today on my first quarterly conference call as Apollo CEO. We're off to a great start to the year. On the call, we will discuss Apollo's third straight quarter posting robust sales growth. But first, I'd like to take the time to share our strategy to transform the company into a market leader in the field of therapeutic endoscopy.  In recent weeks, many of you are asked me why I decided to join Apollo. I follow the company for many years. I know the founding CEO and some of the company's original venture capital investors. For years I've been impressed with Apollo's long held vision to build an entirely new field of therapeutic endoscopy as well as the company's remarkable technical innovation, most notably the OverStitch devices.  I'm also familiar with the ups and downs that the company has faced since its formation 15 years ago. And so with that understanding of the history that I'm thrilled to be joining Apollo at such a pivotal time as we transform into a market leading growth company. I believe that we have a distinctive, differentiated product portfolio that advances minimally invasive endoscopic surgery, and helps GI and bariatric professionals, enhance the standard-of-care, potentially for millions of patients around the world.  At times, the words pivotal and transformational can be so overused in the business community that they lose their meaning. When I was approached about the CEO role, I did my homework on the company's products, procedures, and prospects with three different product lines, all of which have very attractive growth opportunities. I believe that we can fundamentally change the trajectory of this business to delivering consistent, sustainable growth over the years ahead. And that is what I mean, when I use the word pivotal, though now we're at a pivotal point. To me, transformational reflects the impact that we can have on patient care, with continued advances in technology development, such as our recent clearance of X-Tack and more comprehensive market development efforts for ESG, and the use Orbera for patients with NASH, we have the opportunity to address very large market opportunities. More than 100 million people in the United States, 100 million adults in the United States are obese. More than 20 million colonoscopies are performed each year. More than 10 million patients suffer from NASH and have a BMI between 30 and 40. And these are only the US figures. We are a global company. By targeting these populations, we have the potential to increase the scale of patients who may benefit from our technologies from thousands per year to potentially hundreds of thousands per year or more. That is transformational. To achieve our goals, I envision three phases for Apollo to execute our strategy and deliver transformational growth. I call these three phases, energize, accelerate and lead from the front. We've included a new slide in our investor deck, describing these three phases. As you will see from our Q1 results that we announced today, the energize phase is well underway. The energize phase is all about building momentum, by driving near term growth over the next several quarters and achieving strategic milestones that, I believe, will lay the foundation for years of sustainable growth. Near term growth opportunities include continued development of our overseas franchise, scaling our X-Tack launch in the US, steady execution of our IGB franchise, and recovery in some of our OUS markets that continue to see impacts from COVID-19. Yesterday, we announced the appointment of two new commercial leaders, who will join Apollo next week. Kirk Ellis and Steve Bosrock rock are both experienced customer focused leaders, who will increase our capabilities and enhance our execution during this energize phase. In addition, we plan to make targeted additions to our sales team to support our growth aspirations. We anticipate several company milestones during the energize phase, starting with the release of the MERIT study results. MERIT is a randomized control trial of the ESG procedure and a cornerstone of our plans to pursue a new indication for ESG and develop it into a potentially market-leading weight-loss procedure. More on that in a minute. Another key milestone will be defining the clinical pathway required to take advantage of or Orbera\u2019s breakthrough designation to treat patients with NASH. The current standard of care, offers NASH patients very limited prospects for recovery. And that's a key reason why we received the breakthrough designation. A well designed clinical study, focused on achieving a new indication for Orbera for patients with NASH, offers great promise to these patients and our balloon franchise. Phase two is accelerate and it builds on the growth engines that, through continued expansion of X-TACK tech and increased OverStitch utilization, and then layers in the potential for more widespread adoption of the ESG procedure. In particular, following the release of the MERIT study results, and assuming that these results are in line with prior clinical studies of ESG, we will leverage them to pursue new indications -- the new ESG indication, as well as reimbursement in the US and in key markets around the world. And then, finally in phase three, lead from the front, I see Apollo as a market leader by: one, positioning X-Tack as the standard of care for a range of large closer needs across the GI tract; two, continue to develop ESG into a market leading weight-loss procedure; three, expanding the approval of Orbera to include the treatment of NASH; and four, continuing to innovate through a strong R&D pipeline that advances the field of therapeutic endoscopy. And I believe that delivering on these three phases will position Apollo for exciting sustainable growth over many years. The near-term opportunities will contribute in 2021 and 2022. The key priorities in Phase 2 and 3 that I've described will take some time to unfold. And we are putting the plans in place now to ensure we maximize the sizable market opportunities. And so allow me to elaborate more on the first phase of our transformation, the energized phase. And I want to share some of the things that I've learned in my first 60 days that have me so excited about the path ahead, starting with OverStitch and the growth in Endoscopic Suturing. In my travels, talking to customers, I've consistently heard that OverStitch is a one of a kind product that gets excellent reviews from our customers. A number of physicians have told me that OverStitch is the tool that they use to differentiate their clinical practice. And OverStitch sales have been growing at 25% to 30% per year, primarily based on two factors. Existing users continue to increase their use of the product, and new users who have gone through our medical education programs, and subsequently incorporate OverStitch into their clinical practice. OverStitch has a wide range of potential applications in therapeutic endoscopy, including stent fixation and repairs of dissections, resections and perforations. But the ESG procedure stands out as an application that can have the -- that can help and impact the greatest number of patients. ESG has the potential to offer a unique value proposition of efficacy, safety and convenience for patients. Clinical results to date have demonstrated clinically meaningful weight loss, via incisionless, reversible anatomy sparing procedure. Furthermore, ESG procedures require shorter hospital stays and have faster recovery times compared to typical bariatric surgeries. Importantly, only 1% of indicated patients currently undergo bariatric surgeries. Physicians tell us that ESGs are often performed on patients who are not good surgical candidates, or who already decided they don't want surgery. And as a result, ESG has the potential to address a major unmet clinical need for patients who are not well-served by existing approaches. The MERIT study is a key milestone in the path forward for ESG. Independent investigators have completed the 12-month follow-up, and they are working on the initial publication and presentation of the outcomes. We anticipate a publication of the study in the second half of 2021. Once MERIT is published and assuming these results are in line with previous studies of ESG, we intend to pursue a label expansion to cover real primary ESG procedures and bariatric revision procedures. If successful, a new indication would enable Apollo to promote the ESG procedure, provide physician education and training programs to a broader group of practitioners, and initiate programs to increase patient awareness of the benefits of ESG. The MERIT study will also be central in our efforts to secure reimbursement coding, coverage and payment, both in the U.S. and in markets around the world. The investment will likely be a multi-year process that will unfold the following the publication of MERIT results, which was essential for some pair benefit in 2022, and then continued progress in subsequent years. Building on the success of OverStitch, our ESS franchise now has a second growth driver an X-Tack, adding an adjacent new market opportunity that is a strong complement to our existing OverStitch business. X-Tack is unique with a wide range of applications in both the upper and the lower GI. Physicians are already applying it in a wide range of GI tract closures, ranging from relatively simple closures, such as polyp removal to highly complex irregular geometries or standard TTS clips, simply don't get the job done. Results from early cases using X-Tack, have been compelling and that is driving a lot of enthusiasm for the product. Our initial X-Tack customers are primarily current users of OverStitch. Given X-Tack shorter learning curve, ease of use and wide variety of both upper GI app \u2013 and lower GI applications, we anticipate that the user base for X-Tack will expand. At the end of Q1, we have introduced X-Tack, in almost 50 accounts, a nice increase from the nine accounts who participated in our initial limited launch. These accounts are providing important insights into how best to scale our launch and increase utilization. In March, we sponsor our first X-Tack educational webcast, hosted by Dr. Andrew Storm from the Mayo Clinic. More than 150 physicians joined the webcast and participated for a full two hours in discussions about the applications for X-Tack. The level of engagement from the participants was a great indication that this product is capturing the interest of our target audience. A recording of the webinar is now available on X-Tack.com.  We continue to advance our launch in the second quarter. We will continue to advance the launch in the second quarter, and the rest of 2021 with a keen eye for creating effective education tools, introducing X-Tack in a new centers, driving adoption in buildings sustainable use patterns. Our sales team has been focused on expanding access to X-Tack and we are managing a new account pipeline and potential orders that are working their way to hospital procurement processes and is worth a total of more than $1 million in potential sales. Turning to IGB, the Orbera Balloon has been a very solid franchise for Apollo, and it's potentially an underappreciated asset. IGB is still a very important customer need for weight loss solutions that are less invasive than current bariatric surgical options, but more effective than diet and exercise alone. The 41% year-on-year worldwide growth that we have seen with the IGB franchise is an excellent testament to the strength of this product line. That said, in a few years, I believe that, we will look back on Q1, 2021 and say that, the strategic positioning of Orbera was fundamentally changed based off events of this quarter. My very first day on the job, we announced FDA breakthrough designation for the treatment of patients with NASH and this is a validation of the strategies developed over the past several years to position IGB therapy as an effective clinical treatment options for medical conditions. We are working on the next steps to maximize the benefits of this designation, including designing a clinical trial that will be required to pursue label expansion. We are in discussions with FDA and CMS about the trial design and we hope to have an approved trial by the end of the year. We also receive notification that the American Medical Association assigned new Category I CPT Codes for IGB procedures. It was interesting to learn that 6 separate physician organizations supported the efforts, demonstrating widespread support in the community. In addition \u2013 we're pleased to see that the American Gastroenterological Association, the AGA has for the first time, issued practice guidelines, recommending the use of IGB for appropriate patients. Taking together, these three developments enhance the value of the IGB franchise. And then turning to Q1 performance, I'm very pleased with here \u2013 with the team here at Apollo, and their work that has resulted in a very positive start to 2021. Even with some lingering effects of COVID and a smaller team in place versus the prior year, we've achieved 29% revenue growth over Q1 2020, driven by 26% growth ESS and 41% growth in IGB. And we believe that our first quarter results provide a solid foundation for the year ahead. It's an exciting time at Apollo. I look forward to leveraging all three of our product lines to energize the business that accelerate growth over time, and ultimately lead the field of therapeutic endoscopy. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Stefanie to cover the first quarter financial results in greater detail. Stef?\nStefanie Cavanaugh: Thank you, Todd, and good afternoon, everyone. As Todd mentioned, the first quarter of 2021 overall, demonstrated strong growth against a relatively stable fourth quarter and a prior your first quarter that saw the first impacts of the COVID 19 shutdowns. Total revenue was $13.9 million, a 29% increase from the $10.7 million a year ago, as a result of 26% growth in our ESS franchise and 41% growth of IGB product sales. Geographically, revenue performance was driven by 43% growth in US sales and 18% growth OUS. In US, ESS sales increased 44% and IGB sales increased 64%. X-Tack sales are included in our ESS results, which we don't intend to disclose separately, but sales of our ESS products excluding X-Tack, increased greater than 30% over the prior year, which is evidencing a return of our OverStitch product sales growth to our pre-COVID historical experience. OUS markets also performed well in the quarter as distributor activity increased following the recovery of many of their markets from the effects of the pandemic, which helped to offset the impact of evolving COVID restrictions in certain direct European markets throughout the quarter. Overall, we generated a 5% increase in ESS sales and 33% increase in IGB sales for the quarter on a year-over-year basis. The low ESS growth primarily reflects the impact of those recent COVID waves in certain direct markets in Europe, which we believe will continue to pose some challenges in the near term, until the global recovery expands. Gross margin also continued to improve, increasing 2% over the prior year to 54% due to higher sales, and the benefit of our continuing gross margin improvement projects. The most important gross margin improvement project coming online this year is the X-Tack launch. X-Tack has been designed from the beginning to be accretive to our current consolidated gross margin. Operating expenses also compared favorably year-over-year, down $1.1 million, as a result of the long-term restructuring benefits of our 2020 cost reduction and operating efficiency program. As a result of all of these factors, higher revenue, improved gross margin and lower operating costs, operating loss declined by 44% to just $3.8 million for the quarter. Turning to the balance sheet, our cash balance remains strong at $32.6 million, reflecting the use of approximately $4.3 million dollars for the quarter, of which approximately 1.3 million was due to working capital changes associated with our increased revenue. We also further extended our balance sheet runway by achieving our financial targets necessary to qualify for an additional six month extension of the interest only period and are renegotiated and more favorable debt terms announced in December last year, meaning, we will have no principal payments due as of September 2022. Turning to the topic of 2021 outlook, we are pleased to have a solid start to the year in our first quarter results. Today, we are establishing a full year revenue target of $55 million to $57 million in 2021 or 30% to 35% growth over 2020. In arriving at this range, we have taken a cautious approach for several reasons. First, we continue to experience ongoing uncertainty around the impact of COVID-19, especially in our OUS markets. And this includes uncertainty around how the various lockdowns may influence traditional Q3 European holiday schedules this year. We are also still in the early days of our X-Tack product launch. And while the launch is going well and we are excited about continued growth in this line, we are still early in the process of learning how quickly we will grow new accounts and extract utilization. And finally, we are actively updating our execution plans for our existing business lines as part of our recent change in the future. We plan to revisit this outlook later in the year as we gain greater clarity and advance our plans on the items I just mentioned. So, this will conclude our prepared remarks and with that Catherine, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Certainly. Your first question is coming from Matt Hewitt. Your line is live.\nMatt Hewitt: Good afternoon. Congratulations on the strong quarter and welcome, Chas.\nCharles McKhann: Matt, you just cut out on us.\nMatt Hewitt: Can you hear me?\nCharles McKhann: Back now. You are back.\nMatt Hewitt: Okay, great. Well, congratulations on the strong start to the year and welcome Chas. Maybe the first question regarding X-Tack, obviously that was a pretty significant jump in just a couple months from nine sites to -- roughly 50. What kind of ramp should we be anticipating in the number of sites and doctors over the course of the year, or was this kind of, you want to get to this stage, kind of see how it plays out and then maybe add further later in the year?\nCharles McKhann: Yes. No great, great question Matt. And honestly we're still learning as we go, but as you know, the hospital group procurement processes are called value analysis committees typically. And there's a variable process right now. What I can say is that the value proposition for X-Tack is very favorable, and so when we go through those reviews, they've been very well-received. But some hospitals are quite slow right now in coming out of a COVID environment of how quickly they just even will put things through the process. I mentioned that we've got a very robust pipeline, valued at more than a $1 million. This potential -- is referencing. And -- but they'll take a number of months to unfold, we would anticipate, but the sales team has done a nice job of casting a wide net, but still focused primarily within an original group that was referred to in the prior calls of our existing overseas user. So, in a targeted way, but making sure we get the quotes out and into the processes and all those accounts.\nMatt Hewitt: Understood. And, I guess, maybe digging in a little bit deeper within the existing user group. What kind of feedback and kind of reorder patterns are you seeing from some of the initial users?\nCharles McKhann: Yes. No -- also great question. First, I mentioned it in the prepared remarks, but really to emphasize one of the things that we've seen is the range of uses of X-Tack. I know in the prior communication, there was a lot of focus on the lower GI because that is new for Apollo, right OverStitch primarily use the upper GI. But what we've seen is and there's a new slide in our investor deck that shows even from the limited launch, a whole wide range of uses across upper and lower GI. So we're really encouraged by that. It's still quite early in terms of hospitals that have a number of months of runway, but we are pleased to see that a number of those have already started to reorder monthly, and we have a little bit more history under our belts, we'll be able to provide more granularity about reorder patterns.\nMatt Hewitt: Okay. Okay. And then, shifting gears to Orbera. Obviously, it was a pretty remarkable quarter, and I think, as I look at the performance, given even some of the continued issues with COVID, it was a pretty strong quarter. As you look out, I would expect, as the vaccines are rolled out and maybe COVID subsides a little more, you should expect some more growth, both domestically and internationally, but as you start to think about next year, particularly with, I think, you mentioned the need for a trial. Help us think about that piece of it a little bit. So you've gotten feedback that you're going to be required to do a trial. How should we think about the size of that trial, the duration, cost? And I guess, the another piece is, can you use existing data? How much -- obviously, you've developed a long history of data, can you use that as part of any trial that the FDA requires?\nCharles McKhann: All really good questions and frankly, ones that we're still working through with not one, but two agencies, that's part of the benefit of having a breakthrough designation. You negotiate and ultimately agree on a trial with both FDA and CMS. I can tell you we are in active discussions with both agencies. And as we work through those, we\u2019ll get better direction from them about the size of the trial, but we do expect it's going to take a new trial to prospectively evaluate, specifically, in this patient population. But you're asking me great questions about the size of the trial, and number of patients, those sorts of things. And we just don't have that agreement yet with the agency. I did very intentionally, as I described my three phases. Think of the NASH opportunity in a third phase. I think it is going to take a few years to really work through. In the meantime, we are incredibly encouraged by what we're seeing with the balloons. And I think some of it, there's some factors that are more near term in nature, contributing that, the gene 15 associated with COVID is real. There have been articles published in the New York Times and a recent publication in JAMA, about how much weight gain we've seen, typically at a 1.5 pounds per month. So we think that is actually impacting end user demand. We are seeing some differences in site of service and bariatric practices embracing the balloon. And then I mentioned the age lines, which are very positive development and for the first time embracing the balloon. So I think we do have some opportunities in the near term with our existing balloon business, while we work on the strategic repositioning associated with that.\nMatt Hewitt : Got it. Yes. Actually that\u2019s perfect, you've kind of answered the next question, which was are you seeing a pickup in demand just because of the news earlier this year with breakthrough designation in CPT code, is that alone starting to drive some adoption, so it's good to hear that that is. Maybe one last one and then I'll hop back in the queue, regarding OverStitch, obviously, that has continued to be a strong performer for you, but it still is somewhat of early days. As the country and quite frankly, the world starts to reopen, how should we anticipate that the growth profile for that device, particularly as we think about it from an ESG perspective, but just in general, are you anticipating, maybe that growth accelerates as the country and world reopens? Thank you.\nCharles McKhann: Yeah. Matt, great questions, Let's take the outside of the U.S. part of that question first, because as Stef mentioned, the one area where we've some downsized from a COVID standpoint, mostly has been with Endoscopic Suturing, especially in our direct markets in Europe. And it's not surprising, right? Those cases typically are more impatient procedures. And if you go back to Q1, the U.K. was basically shutdown then other markets were shutdown. And we're still seeing some lingering effects of that. So, just in the month of April, again, not telling you anything you don't know about markets like France being closed down over the month of April. So, these are -- so we certainly see a recovery there overtime. And it's hard to predict exactly the pace. We need to remind ourselves even a lot of -- as a people in the U.S. are getting vaccinated. I think it's accurate to say that more people are currently suffering from the virus than any point during the pandemic when we look globally. So, we're watching it all very carefully. Having said all that, as we come out of it, I do think that the benefits of the medical education programs that the company has had in place for years will continue to pay dividends, meeting with new users who are embracing the technology. And then, as we start having additional information about ESG and then the MERIT results. And then an education will be a big deal for us, right? Because we do not -- we are very careful about how we promote and not promote this procedure. And having a new indication, which we're anticipating in the first half of next year, will allow us to do a lot of different things from a training standpoint, from education standpoint to physicians, from an education standpoint to patients. And we think that can be big accelerator as we move forward.\nMatt Hewitt: That's great. Thank you.\nStefanie Cavanaugh: Thanks Matt.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Adam Maeder. Your line is live.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi guys, this is actually Duran [ph] for Adam. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the really nice quarter. And Charles congrats on the new role, I'm looking forward to seeing what changes you have in place for Apollo. I was wondering, if you could just speak to a little bit on how you intend to deliver on some of those pieces, especially those lined-up on the Energize portion of the slide. What are the biggest factors or milestones that we need to see to be successful with some of those items in the initial phase? And then, as we start thinking about some of the recent commercial changes that you guys have announced over the last couple of weeks, maybe you could speak to how you see the new commercial team reshaping, how the organization operates today?\nCharles McKhann: Sure, Thanks, Duran. Yeah, so on the Energize phase. The way we're thinking about it, really is a combination of near-term growth. And then important milestones then lay the foundation for the next wave. And on the near-term growth, the good news, part of it is we're already seeing it, right? And so it's a matter of being able to extend it and continue so with OverStitch, for example, as I mentioned, we are starting to return, OverStitch have been growing a little bit under the radar, 25% or more per year. And putting aside a bit last year for COVID, we're getting back to that. And it's with new users, it's with existing users, finding additional uses for the devices. And it is starting to see the growth of some Endo-Bariatric practices, and there are a number of them as I've made my travels. And as I mentioned, we're not actively promoting that, but there are a number of physicians that have now embraced ESG and are starting to really feature that in their practices. So that'll be I think a big element here in \u2013 in that part of it. The second will X-Tack, X-Tack does not require \u2013 well, let me put in the positive. X-Tack has a relatively short learning curve. It can be used rather than one or two specialists in institution. We think it could be four or five or more physicians in some of our larger institutions. So for that, it's going to be continued account growth, and then a real focus on driving utilization \u2013 depth in it for me \u2013 in the product launches, depth of utilization is so important and we're going to really focus on that. And I'll come back to it in a minute. And then third, for Orbera, as I just mentioned, we've had really, really good results. And so, we are working in \u2013 which ones of those may be transient and related to COVID and which ones can be more sustainable to put Orbera on a \u2013 on a growth pathway. And we think there's possibility there. So more work to do, but we're excited about that. Excuse me, to answer your question about the commercial team. The change really started with my desire to separate out the marketing and sales functions and have \u2013 dedicated expertise at a leadership level with both of them. Excuse me \u2013 I'll give you an example. So for X-Tack, the team has done a nice job and it's focused primarily on our OverStitch customers, which is a great place to start. They're natural users of X-Tack. And we've gotten some good traction. But already, I've been working with some folks that I know on expanding, how we think about the launch. They see purchasing additional procedural data really being a little more sophisticated about exactly where the procedures are, and then we'll be targeting our launch based of that information, and it'll help us really get a deeper understanding of what our launch priorities will be overtime, and how we're going to expand it. And Steve Bosrock, who's coming in to lead marketing is well aware of that approach. He's done it before and I think we'll add another level of leadership there. And then on the sales side, very happy to have Kirk Ellis coming on board, a very strong leader with experience in GI, he's been in two different startups, with a lot of GI experience both of them are now part of established leaders in the field. So you've got an existing customer relationships and I think we'll be well placed. We'll work together then to decide what else we're going to do from a \u2013 building out the team element to that. We have a healthy tension within Apollo between driving growth, but also still keeping a very tight lid on costs. I can tell you, I've already approved less than a handful of some additional sales rep positions in key markets and we're going to fill those. And then we're going to be very smart in terms of how we continue to think about adding. But we've got great growth opportunities. We got to be smart about it and keep investing in the future.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Yes, that's obviously great to hear. And then as far as the guidance goes, I understand there's still a lot of uncertainty out there. But obviously, the guidance does look a little bit conservative from the normalized growth basis, just with a really strong Q1 here. So maybe you could kind of just help us understand what you're assuming as far as contribution from X-Tack and that number maybe what you're assuming for COVID US versus OUS? And then any other inputs we should really be thinking about there?\nStefanie Cavanaugh : So, it's a good question and it's fair and accurate to say that we are being careful in our guidance, for sure. X-Tack is in its early stages, and for competitive reasons, we're not going to break out X-Tack separately. And what we can share Chas has already spoken to from the previous questions. So today, we are remaining careful about what we are estimating for our organization, and as more information becomes available to us about X-Tack and utilization and account additions. We'll let that \u2013 as well as the other things we've talked about COVID recovery related items impact on OverStitch growth OUS in the areas where we're experiencing some disruptions. As well as, what might be transit with respect to our IGB revenue, once we pull all of that together, and as the recovery continues then we will look to improve upon what we are estimating today. But for today, we think that the prudent, wise position to be in is a more careful number.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Understand. And then last one for me just as far as MERIT goes, just wondering if you could speak to \u2013 assuming the data is positive, how quickly you expect the payer behavior to change? How compelling do you expect it to be to payers and then where would you expect pushback to be if at all?\nCharles McKhann: Sure. No, good question. First of all, we don't know the data is still being run independently by the investigators. We are optimistic, as it's been described on prior calls. Given the history of how much data has been already developed on X-Tack \u2013 I'm sorry on ESG. And so for those who you're new on the call to Apollo and we've got multiple studies encompassing thousands of patients, demonstrating the procedure. So, we're optimistic. So, in the data, once we get that -- reimbursement is a journey. I've lived that journey in other environments. We are working on specific strategies and it involves coding, coverage, and payment around both government CMS reimbursement, as well as with commercial payers. We are aware of already some examples of some of our customers who have coverage relationships with individual payers. And that's really good news. It's really exciting. So, some of the field is starting to be laid there. But to answer your question, I would expect some impact beginning of next year, but then I see that taking then a number of years after that to continue to build exactly what that pace will be. We're working through those plans and at some point, we will get to the point of doing things like reporting on number of covered lives and how fast that ramp is, but we're not there yet.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nStefanie Cavanaugh: Thanks Drew.\nOperator: I would now like to turn the floor back to Charles for closing remarks.\nCharles McKhann: Great. Thank you very much. It's been a busy and energizing first couple of months. And I do anticipate maintaining our positive momentum throughout 2021 and as we work across the many opportunities in front of us. I'm excited to see OverStitch emerging as a standard-of-care in multiple GI applications that call for full fitness suturing and in addition, we believe that physicians see the enormous potential of ESG as a primary weight loss procedure. X-Tack is off to a solid start and is receiving very positive feedback from physician users. And we are very enthusiastic about this new product, and the opportunity to expand our market with another truly innovative and flexible tool for various GI needs. And with Orbera breakthrough designation, the new CPT codes, and a recent AGA practice guidelines, the franchise is once again emerging as a strategic growth opportunity for Apollo. And so as we look forward, I said it before, I'll say it again. We look forward to leveraging all three of these exciting products to energize the business, then accelerate growth over time, and ultimately, lead the field of therapeutic endoscopy. If you have any questions or would like to arrange a call with us, please contact Matt Kreps from Darrow Associates. Matt\u2019s contact information is on our website and in today's press release. And thank you and have a great evening.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's event. You may disconnect at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Charles McKhann",
            "content": "Thanks Matt. Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. I'm pleased to speak with you today on my first quarterly conference call as Apollo CEO. We're off to a great start to the year. On the call, we will discuss Apollo's third straight quarter posting robust sales growth. But first, I'd like to take the time to share our strategy to transform the company into a market leader in the field of therapeutic endoscopy.  In recent weeks, many of you are asked me why I decided to join Apollo. I follow the company for many years. I know the founding CEO and some of the company's original venture capital investors. For years I've been impressed with Apollo's long held vision to build an entirely new field of therapeutic endoscopy as well as the company's remarkable technical innovation, most notably the OverStitch devices.  I'm also familiar with the ups and downs that the company has faced since its formation 15 years ago. And so with that understanding of the history that I'm thrilled to be joining Apollo at such a pivotal time as we transform into a market leading growth company. I believe that we have a distinctive, differentiated product portfolio that advances minimally invasive endoscopic surgery, and helps GI and bariatric professionals, enhance the standard-of-care, potentially for millions of patients around the world.  At times, the words pivotal and transformational can be so overused in the business community that they lose their meaning. When I was approached about the CEO role, I did my homework on the company's products, procedures, and prospects with three different product lines, all of which have very attractive growth opportunities. I believe that we can fundamentally change the trajectory of this business to delivering consistent, sustainable growth over the years ahead. And that is what I mean, when I use the word pivotal, though now we're at a pivotal point. To me, transformational reflects the impact that we can have on patient care, with continued advances in technology development, such as our recent clearance of X-Tack and more comprehensive market development efforts for ESG, and the use Orbera for patients with NASH, we have the opportunity to address very large market opportunities. More than 100 million people in the United States, 100 million adults in the United States are obese. More than 20 million colonoscopies are performed each year. More than 10 million patients suffer from NASH and have a BMI between 30 and 40. And these are only the US figures. We are a global company. By targeting these populations, we have the potential to increase the scale of patients who may benefit from our technologies from thousands per year to potentially hundreds of thousands per year or more. That is transformational. To achieve our goals, I envision three phases for Apollo to execute our strategy and deliver transformational growth. I call these three phases, energize, accelerate and lead from the front. We've included a new slide in our investor deck, describing these three phases. As you will see from our Q1 results that we announced today, the energize phase is well underway. The energize phase is all about building momentum, by driving near term growth over the next several quarters and achieving strategic milestones that, I believe, will lay the foundation for years of sustainable growth. Near term growth opportunities include continued development of our overseas franchise, scaling our X-Tack launch in the US, steady execution of our IGB franchise, and recovery in some of our OUS markets that continue to see impacts from COVID-19. Yesterday, we announced the appointment of two new commercial leaders, who will join Apollo next week. Kirk Ellis and Steve Bosrock rock are both experienced customer focused leaders, who will increase our capabilities and enhance our execution during this energize phase. In addition, we plan to make targeted additions to our sales team to support our growth aspirations. We anticipate several company milestones during the energize phase, starting with the release of the MERIT study results. MERIT is a randomized control trial of the ESG procedure and a cornerstone of our plans to pursue a new indication for ESG and develop it into a potentially market-leading weight-loss procedure. More on that in a minute. Another key milestone will be defining the clinical pathway required to take advantage of or Orbera's breakthrough designation to treat patients with NASH. The current standard of care, offers NASH patients very limited prospects for recovery. And that's a key reason why we received the breakthrough designation. A well designed clinical study, focused on achieving a new indication for Orbera for patients with NASH, offers great promise to these patients and our balloon franchise. Phase two is accelerate and it builds on the growth engines that, through continued expansion of X-TACK tech and increased OverStitch utilization, and then layers in the potential for more widespread adoption of the ESG procedure. In particular, following the release of the MERIT study results, and assuming that these results are in line with prior clinical studies of ESG, we will leverage them to pursue new indications -- the new ESG indication, as well as reimbursement in the US and in key markets around the world. And then, finally in phase three, lead from the front, I see Apollo as a market leader by: one, positioning X-Tack as the standard of care for a range of large closer needs across the GI tract; two, continue to develop ESG into a market leading weight-loss procedure; three, expanding the approval of Orbera to include the treatment of NASH; and four, continuing to innovate through a strong R&D pipeline that advances the field of therapeutic endoscopy. And I believe that delivering on these three phases will position Apollo for exciting sustainable growth over many years. The near-term opportunities will contribute in 2021 and 2022. The key priorities in Phase 2 and 3 that I've described will take some time to unfold. And we are putting the plans in place now to ensure we maximize the sizable market opportunities. And so allow me to elaborate more on the first phase of our transformation, the energized phase. And I want to share some of the things that I've learned in my first 60 days that have me so excited about the path ahead, starting with OverStitch and the growth in Endoscopic Suturing. In my travels, talking to customers, I've consistently heard that OverStitch is a one of a kind product that gets excellent reviews from our customers. A number of physicians have told me that OverStitch is the tool that they use to differentiate their clinical practice. And OverStitch sales have been growing at 25% to 30% per year, primarily based on two factors. Existing users continue to increase their use of the product, and new users who have gone through our medical education programs, and subsequently incorporate OverStitch into their clinical practice. OverStitch has a wide range of potential applications in therapeutic endoscopy, including stent fixation and repairs of dissections, resections and perforations. But the ESG procedure stands out as an application that can have the -- that can help and impact the greatest number of patients. ESG has the potential to offer a unique value proposition of efficacy, safety and convenience for patients. Clinical results to date have demonstrated clinically meaningful weight loss, via incisionless, reversible anatomy sparing procedure. Furthermore, ESG procedures require shorter hospital stays and have faster recovery times compared to typical bariatric surgeries. Importantly, only 1% of indicated patients currently undergo bariatric surgeries. Physicians tell us that ESGs are often performed on patients who are not good surgical candidates, or who already decided they don't want surgery. And as a result, ESG has the potential to address a major unmet clinical need for patients who are not well-served by existing approaches. The MERIT study is a key milestone in the path forward for ESG. Independent investigators have completed the 12-month follow-up, and they are working on the initial publication and presentation of the outcomes. We anticipate a publication of the study in the second half of 2021. Once MERIT is published and assuming these results are in line with previous studies of ESG, we intend to pursue a label expansion to cover real primary ESG procedures and bariatric revision procedures. If successful, a new indication would enable Apollo to promote the ESG procedure, provide physician education and training programs to a broader group of practitioners, and initiate programs to increase patient awareness of the benefits of ESG. The MERIT study will also be central in our efforts to secure reimbursement coding, coverage and payment, both in the U.S. and in markets around the world. The investment will likely be a multi-year process that will unfold the following the publication of MERIT results, which was essential for some pair benefit in 2022, and then continued progress in subsequent years. Building on the success of OverStitch, our ESS franchise now has a second growth driver an X-Tack, adding an adjacent new market opportunity that is a strong complement to our existing OverStitch business. X-Tack is unique with a wide range of applications in both the upper and the lower GI. Physicians are already applying it in a wide range of GI tract closures, ranging from relatively simple closures, such as polyp removal to highly complex irregular geometries or standard TTS clips, simply don't get the job done. Results from early cases using X-Tack, have been compelling and that is driving a lot of enthusiasm for the product. Our initial X-Tack customers are primarily current users of OverStitch. Given X-Tack shorter learning curve, ease of use and wide variety of both upper GI app \u2013 and lower GI applications, we anticipate that the user base for X-Tack will expand. At the end of Q1, we have introduced X-Tack, in almost 50 accounts, a nice increase from the nine accounts who participated in our initial limited launch. These accounts are providing important insights into how best to scale our launch and increase utilization. In March, we sponsor our first X-Tack educational webcast, hosted by Dr. Andrew Storm from the Mayo Clinic. More than 150 physicians joined the webcast and participated for a full two hours in discussions about the applications for X-Tack. The level of engagement from the participants was a great indication that this product is capturing the interest of our target audience. A recording of the webinar is now available on X-Tack.com.  We continue to advance our launch in the second quarter. We will continue to advance the launch in the second quarter, and the rest of 2021 with a keen eye for creating effective education tools, introducing X-Tack in a new centers, driving adoption in buildings sustainable use patterns. Our sales team has been focused on expanding access to X-Tack and we are managing a new account pipeline and potential orders that are working their way to hospital procurement processes and is worth a total of more than $1 million in potential sales. Turning to IGB, the Orbera Balloon has been a very solid franchise for Apollo, and it's potentially an underappreciated asset. IGB is still a very important customer need for weight loss solutions that are less invasive than current bariatric surgical options, but more effective than diet and exercise alone. The 41% year-on-year worldwide growth that we have seen with the IGB franchise is an excellent testament to the strength of this product line. That said, in a few years, I believe that, we will look back on Q1, 2021 and say that, the strategic positioning of Orbera was fundamentally changed based off events of this quarter. My very first day on the job, we announced FDA breakthrough designation for the treatment of patients with NASH and this is a validation of the strategies developed over the past several years to position IGB therapy as an effective clinical treatment options for medical conditions. We are working on the next steps to maximize the benefits of this designation, including designing a clinical trial that will be required to pursue label expansion. We are in discussions with FDA and CMS about the trial design and we hope to have an approved trial by the end of the year. We also receive notification that the American Medical Association assigned new Category I CPT Codes for IGB procedures. It was interesting to learn that 6 separate physician organizations supported the efforts, demonstrating widespread support in the community. In addition \u2013 we're pleased to see that the American Gastroenterological Association, the AGA has for the first time, issued practice guidelines, recommending the use of IGB for appropriate patients. Taking together, these three developments enhance the value of the IGB franchise. And then turning to Q1 performance, I'm very pleased with here \u2013 with the team here at Apollo, and their work that has resulted in a very positive start to 2021. Even with some lingering effects of COVID and a smaller team in place versus the prior year, we've achieved 29% revenue growth over Q1 2020, driven by 26% growth ESS and 41% growth in IGB. And we believe that our first quarter results provide a solid foundation for the year ahead. It's an exciting time at Apollo. I look forward to leveraging all three of our product lines to energize the business that accelerate growth over time, and ultimately lead the field of therapeutic endoscopy. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Stefanie to cover the first quarter financial results in greater detail. Stef? Matt, you just cut out on us. Back now. You are back. Yes. No great, great question Matt. And honestly we're still learning as we go, but as you know, the hospital group procurement processes are called value analysis committees typically. And there's a variable process right now. What I can say is that the value proposition for X-Tack is very favorable, and so when we go through those reviews, they've been very well-received. But some hospitals are quite slow right now in coming out of a COVID environment of how quickly they just even will put things through the process. I mentioned that we've got a very robust pipeline, valued at more than a $1 million. This potential -- is referencing. And -- but they'll take a number of months to unfold, we would anticipate, but the sales team has done a nice job of casting a wide net, but still focused primarily within an original group that was referred to in the prior calls of our existing overseas user. So, in a targeted way, but making sure we get the quotes out and into the processes and all those accounts. Yes. No -- also great question. First, I mentioned it in the prepared remarks, but really to emphasize one of the things that we've seen is the range of uses of X-Tack. I know in the prior communication, there was a lot of focus on the lower GI because that is new for Apollo, right OverStitch primarily use the upper GI. But what we've seen is and there's a new slide in our investor deck that shows even from the limited launch, a whole wide range of uses across upper and lower GI. So we're really encouraged by that. It's still quite early in terms of hospitals that have a number of months of runway, but we are pleased to see that a number of those have already started to reorder monthly, and we have a little bit more history under our belts, we'll be able to provide more granularity about reorder patterns. All really good questions and frankly, ones that we're still working through with not one, but two agencies, that's part of the benefit of having a breakthrough designation. You negotiate and ultimately agree on a trial with both FDA and CMS. I can tell you we are in active discussions with both agencies. And as we work through those, we'll get better direction from them about the size of the trial, but we do expect it's going to take a new trial to prospectively evaluate, specifically, in this patient population. But you're asking me great questions about the size of the trial, and number of patients, those sorts of things. And we just don't have that agreement yet with the agency. I did very intentionally, as I described my three phases. Think of the NASH opportunity in a third phase. I think it is going to take a few years to really work through. In the meantime, we are incredibly encouraged by what we're seeing with the balloons. And I think some of it, there's some factors that are more near term in nature, contributing that, the gene 15 associated with COVID is real. There have been articles published in the New York Times and a recent publication in JAMA, about how much weight gain we've seen, typically at a 1.5 pounds per month. So we think that is actually impacting end user demand. We are seeing some differences in site of service and bariatric practices embracing the balloon. And then I mentioned the age lines, which are very positive development and for the first time embracing the balloon. So I think we do have some opportunities in the near term with our existing balloon business, while we work on the strategic repositioning associated with that. Yeah. Matt, great questions, Let's take the outside of the U.S. part of that question first, because as Stef mentioned, the one area where we've some downsized from a COVID standpoint, mostly has been with Endoscopic Suturing, especially in our direct markets in Europe. And it's not surprising, right? Those cases typically are more impatient procedures. And if you go back to Q1, the U.K. was basically shutdown then other markets were shutdown. And we're still seeing some lingering effects of that. So, just in the month of April, again, not telling you anything you don't know about markets like France being closed down over the month of April. So, these are -- so we certainly see a recovery there overtime. And it's hard to predict exactly the pace. We need to remind ourselves even a lot of -- as a people in the U.S. are getting vaccinated. I think it's accurate to say that more people are currently suffering from the virus than any point during the pandemic when we look globally. So, we're watching it all very carefully. Having said all that, as we come out of it, I do think that the benefits of the medical education programs that the company has had in place for years will continue to pay dividends, meeting with new users who are embracing the technology. And then, as we start having additional information about ESG and then the MERIT results. And then an education will be a big deal for us, right? Because we do not -- we are very careful about how we promote and not promote this procedure. And having a new indication, which we're anticipating in the first half of next year, will allow us to do a lot of different things from a training standpoint, from education standpoint to physicians, from an education standpoint to patients. And we think that can be big accelerator as we move forward. Sure, Thanks, Duran. Yeah, so on the Energize phase. The way we're thinking about it, really is a combination of near-term growth. And then important milestones then lay the foundation for the next wave. And on the near-term growth, the good news, part of it is we're already seeing it, right? And so it's a matter of being able to extend it and continue so with OverStitch, for example, as I mentioned, we are starting to return, OverStitch have been growing a little bit under the radar, 25% or more per year. And putting aside a bit last year for COVID, we're getting back to that. And it's with new users, it's with existing users, finding additional uses for the devices. And it is starting to see the growth of some Endo-Bariatric practices, and there are a number of them as I've made my travels. And as I mentioned, we're not actively promoting that, but there are a number of physicians that have now embraced ESG and are starting to really feature that in their practices. So that'll be I think a big element here in \u2013 in that part of it. The second will X-Tack, X-Tack does not require \u2013 well, let me put in the positive. X-Tack has a relatively short learning curve. It can be used rather than one or two specialists in institution. We think it could be four or five or more physicians in some of our larger institutions. So for that, it's going to be continued account growth, and then a real focus on driving utilization \u2013 depth in it for me \u2013 in the product launches, depth of utilization is so important and we're going to really focus on that. And I'll come back to it in a minute. And then third, for Orbera, as I just mentioned, we've had really, really good results. And so, we are working in \u2013 which ones of those may be transient and related to COVID and which ones can be more sustainable to put Orbera on a \u2013 on a growth pathway. And we think there's possibility there. So more work to do, but we're excited about that. Excuse me, to answer your question about the commercial team. The change really started with my desire to separate out the marketing and sales functions and have \u2013 dedicated expertise at a leadership level with both of them. Excuse me \u2013 I'll give you an example. So for X-Tack, the team has done a nice job and it's focused primarily on our OverStitch customers, which is a great place to start. They're natural users of X-Tack. And we've gotten some good traction. But already, I've been working with some folks that I know on expanding, how we think about the launch.

So you've got an existing customer relationships and I think we'll be well placed. We'll work together then to decide what else we're going to do from a \u2013 building out the team element to that. We have a healthy tension within Apollo between driving growth, but also still keeping a very tight lid on costs. I can tell you, I've already approved less than a handful of some additional sales rep positions in key markets and we're going to fill those. And then we're going to be very smart in terms of how we continue to think about adding. But we've got great growth opportunities. We got to be smart about it and keep investing in the future. Sure. No, good question. First of all, we don't know the data is still being run independently by the investigators. We are optimistic, as it's been described on prior calls. Given the history of how much data has been already developed on X-Tack \u2013 I'm sorry on ESG. And so for those who you're new on the call to Apollo and we've got multiple studies encompassing thousands of patients, demonstrating the procedure. So, we're optimistic. So, in the data, once we get that -- reimbursement is a journey. I've lived that journey in other environments.

We're working through those plans and at some point, we will get to the point of doing things like reporting on number of covered lives and how fast that ramp is, but we're not there yet. Great. Thank you very much. It's been a busy and energizing first couple of months. And I do anticipate maintaining our positive momentum throughout 2021 and as we work across the many opportunities in front of us. I'm excited to see OverStitch emerging as a standard-of-care in multiple GI applications that call for full fitness suturing and in addition, we believe that physicians see the enormous potential of ESG as a primary weight loss procedure. X-Tack is off to a solid start and is receiving very positive feedback from physician users. And we are very enthusiastic about this new product, and the opportunity to expand our market with another truly innovative and flexible tool for various GI needs. And with Orbera breakthrough designation, the new CPT codes, and a recent AGA practice guidelines, the franchise is once again emerging as a strategic growth opportunity for Apollo. And so as we look forward, I said it before, I'll say it again. We look forward to leveraging all three of these exciting products to energize the business, then accelerate growth over time, and ultimately, lead the field of therapeutic endoscopy. If you have any questions or would like to arrange a call with us, please contact Matt Kreps from Darrow Associates. Matt's contact information is on our website and in today's press release. And thank you and have a great evening."

            "content": "Thank you, Todd, and good afternoon, everyone. As Todd mentioned, the first quarter of 2021 overall, demonstrated strong growth against a relatively stable fourth quarter and a prior your first quarter that saw the first impacts of the COVID 19 shutdowns. Total revenue was $13.9 million, a 29% increase from the $10.7 million a year ago, as a result of 26% growth in our ESS franchise and 41% growth of IGB product sales. Geographically, revenue performance was driven by 43% growth in US sales and 18% growth OUS. In US, ESS sales increased 44% and IGB sales increased 64%. X-Tack sales are included in our ESS results, which we don't intend to disclose separately, but sales of our ESS products excluding X-Tack, increased greater than 30% over the prior year, which is evidencing a return of our OverStitch product sales growth to our pre-COVID historical experience. OUS markets also performed well in the quarter as distributor activity increased following the recovery of many of their markets from the effects of the pandemic, which helped to offset the impact of evolving COVID restrictions in certain direct European markets throughout the quarter. Overall, we generated a 5% increase in ESS sales and 33% increase in IGB sales for the quarter on a year-over-year basis. The low ESS growth primarily reflects the impact of those recent COVID waves in certain direct markets in Europe, which we believe will continue to pose some challenges in the near term, until the global recovery expands. Gross margin also continued to improve, increasing 2% over the prior year to 54% due to higher sales, and the benefit of our continuing gross margin improvement projects. The most important gross margin improvement project coming online this year is the X-Tack launch. X-Tack has been designed from the beginning to be accretive to our current consolidated gross margin. Operating expenses also compared favorably year-over-year, down $1.1 million, as a result of the long-term restructuring benefits of our 2020 cost reduction and operating efficiency program. As a result of all of these factors, higher revenue, improved gross margin and lower operating costs, operating loss declined by 44% to just $3.8 million for the quarter. Turning to the balance sheet, our cash balance remains strong at $32.6 million, reflecting the use of approximately $4.3 million dollars for the quarter, of which approximately 1.3 million was due to working capital changes associated with our increased revenue. We also further extended our balance sheet runway by achieving our financial targets necessary to qualify for an additional six month extension of the interest only period and are renegotiated and more favorable debt terms announced in December last year, meaning, we will have no principal payments due as of September 2022. Turning to the topic of 2021 outlook, we are pleased to have a solid start to the year in our first quarter results. Today, we are establishing a full year revenue target of $55 million to $57 million in 2021 or 30% to 35% growth over 2020. In arriving at this range, we have taken a cautious approach for several reasons. First, we continue to experience ongoing uncertainty around the impact of COVID-19, especially in our OUS markets. And this includes uncertainty around how the various lockdowns may influence traditional Q3 European holiday schedules this year. We are also still in the early days of our X-Tack product launch. And while the launch is going well and we are excited about continued growth in this line, we are still early in the process of learning how quickly we will grow new accounts and extract utilization. And finally, we are actively updating our execution plans for our existing business lines as part of our recent change in the future. We plan to revisit this outlook later in the year as we gain greater clarity and advance our plans on the items I just mentioned. So, this will conclude our prepared remarks and with that Catherine, please open the line for questions. Thanks Matt. So, it's a good question and it's fair and accurate to say that we are being careful in our guidance, for sure. X-Tack is in its early stages, and for competitive reasons, we're not going to break out X-Tack separately. And what we can share Chas has already spoken to from the previous questions. So today, we are remaining careful about what we are estimating for our organization, and as more information becomes available to us about X-Tack and utilization and account additions. We'll let that \u2013 as well as the other things we've talked about COVID recovery related items impact on OverStitch growth OUS in the areas where we're experiencing some disruptions. As well as, what might be transit with respect to our IGB revenue, once we pull all of that together, and as the recovery continues then we will look to improve upon what we are estimating today. But for today, we think that the prudent, wise position to be in is a more careful number. Thanks Drew."

All participants will be in listen only mode [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Lauren Tengler, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nLauren Tengler: Thank you, Drew. Welcome, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q4 and full year '22 results, which includes reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financials and Filings. The duration of this morning's call will be approximately one hour. Mike and Dan will provide comments on Q4 and full year performance as well as the outlook for our business, including 2023 guidance, and then we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Ian Meredith and Dr. Ken Stein. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, operational revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, and organic revenue growth further excludes acquisitions and divestitures and for which there are less than a full period of comparable net sales. Relevant acquisitions excluded for organic growth or Preventice, FARAPULSE and Lumenis Surgical, which closed in March, August and September of 2021, respectively, as well as Baylis Medical, which closed on February 14, 2022. Divestitures include the BTG Specialty Pharmaceuticals business, which closed on March 1, 2021. Guidance excludes the previously announced agreements to purchase a majority stake in M.I. Tech and Aquatech as well as the acquisition of Apollo Endosurgery, which are all expected to close in the first half of 2023. For more information, please refer to our financial and operating highlights deck, which may be found on our Investor Relations website. On this call, all references to sales and revenue, unless otherwise specified, are organic. This call contains forward-looking statements within the meanings of the federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, may, believe, estimate and other similar words.  They include, among other things, statements about our growth and market share, new and anticipated product approvals and launches, acquisitions, clinical trials cost savings and growth opportunities, our cash flow and expected use, our financial performance, including sales, margins and earnings as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses. If our underlying assumptions turn out to be incorrect, or certain risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from the expectations and projections expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them.  At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike.\nMike Mahoney : Thanks, Lauren, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. 2022 represented a return to more durable and consistent procedural growth within the markets we serve, which provided a stronger base for our innovative portfolio. I'm very proud of the resiliency and winning spirit of our global team, delivering on our sales and EPS goals despite the ongoing macroeconomic and supply chain challenges. Importantly, we delivered strong performance across all geographic regions and believe that most all of our business units gained or maintained market share throughout the year. In fourth quarter '22, total company operational sales grew 9% and organic sales grew 7% versus fourth quarter '21, which was the low end of the guidance range. However, it's very important to note that these results include an unplanned sales reserve of $60 million, established for an Italian government payback provision which resulted in a headwind of approximately 200 basis points for the quarter. The underlying fourth quarter performance was strong on both sales; operating margin increases and earnings per share. And without the impact of the Italian sales reserve, we would have achieved the high end of our organic sales guidance range of 7% to 9%. Full year '22 operational sales grew 11% versus '21, while organic sales grew 9%, in line with our guidance of approximately 9%. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $0.45 declined minus 2% versus '21, and full year adjusted EPS of $1.71 grew 5% versus '21, both achieved in the low end of the guidance range. Once again, without the impact of the Italian sales reserve, we would achieve the high end of the guidance range for both fourth quarter and full year of $1.71 to $1.74. We generated full year free cash flow of $950 million and adjusted free cash flow of $2.1 billion, in line with our expectations. Now for outlook for 2023. We are guiding to organic growth of 6% to 8% for both first quarter '23 and full year '23, which excludes the acquisition of Apollo Endosurgery and the majority stake investments in M.I. Tech and all of which are expected to close in the first half of 2023. Our first quarter '23 adjusted EPS estimate is $0.42 to $0.44, and we expect our full year adjusted EPS to be $1.86 to $1.93. And despite the ongoing macroeconomic pressures and supply chain headwinds, we remain committed to our goal of plus 50 basis points of operating margin expansion and double-digit adjusted EPS growth in 2023. Dan will provide more details on our '22 performance, the Italian sales reserve and our '23 outlook. I'll now provide some additional highlights on '22 results along with comments on our '23 outlook. Regionally, on an operational basis, the U.S. grew 10% versus fourth quarter '21. Full year '22 grew 11%, inclusive of a 300 basis point tailwind from acquisitions, with particular strength in our WATCHMAN, Endo and urology business units. Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 11% on an operational basis versus fourth quarter '21 and 12% on a full year basis. This above-market growth was supported by ongoing investments in emerging markets, new and ongoing product launches across the portfolio, pricing discipline and strong commercial execution.  We're excited about the year ahead with ongoing momentum across the region, particularly with our innovative EP portfolio and further opportunity with Baylis in the Access Solutions franchise. Asia Pacific grew 10% operationally versus fourth quarter '21 and 12% for the full year. On a full year basis, six out of eight business units grew double digits, supported by ongoing innovation across the region. Full year Japan growth was driven by new products, including POLARx, which has approximately 50% share in open accounts. We look forward to 2023 with ongoing momentum from both new products and are excited about our recent approval and reimbursement received for AGENT DCB, which is a coronary drug-coated balloon for restenosis in small vessels. On a full year basis, China grew more than 20%, fueled by 13 new product launches, ongoing portfolio diversification and the team's resiliency and execution. We continue to expand our presence in the China market with the recently announced acquisition of a majority stake in Acotec. We believe this investment can create strategic value for both companies with opportunities to collaborate in R&D, manufacturing and commercial strategies. We also continue to expect China to be a double-digit grower in '23 despite ongoing VBP pressure and potential impact to procedure volumes in Q1 from COVID. In Latin America, the momentum continued with operational sales growth of 16% versus fourth quarter '21 and full year growth of 28%, with all business units growing double digits versus '21. On the business units, starting with urology. Urology sales grew 12%, both operationally and organically versus fourth quarter '21 and on a full year basis. They grew 15% operationally and 10% organically versus '21. Within the quarter, all franchises grew double digits, fueled by new and ongoing product launches and continued global expansion. On a full year basis, global growth was driven by key products such as LithoVue, Rezum and SpaceOAR as well as the acquisition of the Lumenis Moser laser technology, further complementing the urology portfolio. Endoscopy sales grew 7% organically in the quarter, and on a full year basis grew 8% organically versus '21. In '22, we had global success with innovative products such as AXIOS and Single-Use imaging, both growing over 20% and supporting strong growth across the globe. In the fourth quarter, we announced our intent to acquire Apollo Endosurgery, which will add a complementary and innovative endoluminal surgery portfolio. We look forward to closing this acquisition as well as our previously announced majority stake in M.I. Tech, which includes the innovative stent in the first half of '23. Neuromodulation sales grew 5% organically versus fourth quarter '21 and on a full year basis grew 3% organically versus '21. Globally, our spinal cord stimulation business grew 4% in the fourth quarter with continued physician enthusiasm for WaveWriter Alpha and FAST. We continue to invest in clinical evidence to expand indications and present three-month data from our nonsurgical back study, SOLIS, at NANS earlier this year.  The study comparing SCS to conventional medical management met its primary endpoints, and we anticipate FDA approval for nonsurgical back indication by the end of '23. Our Brain franchise grew double digits in the quarter and low double digits on a full year basis. This strong performance is aided by continued momentum from new product launches in '22 as well as the recent launch of the Vercise 2-in-1 lead extension. Peripheral Intervention sales grew 9% organically versus both fourth quarter '21 and full year '21. Within Arterial, we are pleased with the performance of our drug-eluting portfolio growing strong double digits for the full year and achieving the number one global position -- I'm sorry, the number one position within SFA in the U.S. On a full year basis, our venous franchise was flat versus prior year with Varithena, our market-leading varicose vein offering, growing over 20% in 2022. Our Interventional Oncology franchise performed well in '22, growing low double digits, led by our portfolio of innovative cancer therapies and suite of embolization tools. We continue to invest in expanding the potential applications of TheraSphere and enrolled our first patient in our early feasibility study, frontier the image of -- safety of image-guided intra-arterial delivery of TheraSphere GBM in patients with the reoccurring glioblastoma. Cardiology delivered another excellent quarter, with operational sales growing 13% and organic sales growing 10% versus fourth quarter '21. On a full year basis, sales grew 14% operationally and 10% organically. Our newly aligned cardiology group delivered strong growth across its four businesses, as we continue to invest in the higher growth segments and differentiated offerings for our customers that address the areas of greatest cardiac need for patients. Within Cardiology, Interventional Cardiology Therapy sales grew 5% organically in fourth quarter and on a full year basis grew 8% organically versus '21. On a full year basis, the Coronary Therapies' franchise, which includes both drug-eluting stents and complex PCI grew 7%, driven by strong performance in our international regions and our imaging franchise. Our structural Heart Valves franchise grew double digits in both fourth quarter and the full year basis, outpacing the market in Europe with our ACURATE neo2 aortic valve. Ongoing clinical evidence to support growth throughout '22 and in the fourth quarter. Data from the ACURATE neo2 PMCF study was presented as a late breaker at PCR London Valves, demonstrating positive safety and 30-day outcomes with low PVL rates and best-in-class pacemaker implantation rates. Additionally, we enrolled our first patient in the ACURATE Prime XL Nested Registry, assessing the safety and efficacy of the ACURATE Prime Aortic Valve XL to treat patients with severe aortic restenosis who need a larger valve size for the TAVR procedure. WATCHMAN sales grew 22% organically versus fourth quarter '21 and on a full year basis grew 24% organically versus '21. Q4 finished with record sales, strong utilization in the U.S. supported by the DAPT label expansion. Importantly, we completed the enrollment of our CHAMPION-AF trial way ahead of schedule. This head-to-head trial versus novel oral anticoagulation has the potential to more than triple the number of patients indicated for WATCHMAN FLEX in 2027 and beyond. We remain excited about this outlook for this business and expect double-digit growth in 2023, fueled by innovation, ongoing clinical evidence and strong commercial execution. CRM sales grew 6%, both operationally and organically versus fourth quarter '21 and on a full year basis grew 8% operationally and 7% organically. Our Diagnostics franchise had a strong year, growing double digits versus '21. In core CRM, on the full year basis, our high-voltage business grew low single digits, and our low voltage business grew mid-single digits, and we expect that all major markets were in line or slightly above the market. Electrophysiology sales grew 76% operationally and 25% organically versus fourth quarter '21 and on a full year basis grew 69% operationally and 18% organically versus '21. Importantly, our international EP business continues to outpace the market, growing over 40% organically versus fourth quarter '21. POLARx continues to perform well in both Europe and Japan has now been treated to treat over patients since launch. Momentum in FARAPULSE continues with another strong quarter of growth in Europe. And we continue to invest in clinical evidence and look forward to the readout of the randomized ADVENT U.S. IDE trial in the second half of '23 and are planning to initiate our ADVANTAGE AF trial these therapods patients with persistent AFib imminently. We've been very pleased with the performance of our Baylis acquisition and the innovative platform, which grew 2 times faster than the market in '22. We launched our VersaCross Connect in '22, improving efficiencies in our WATCHMAN procedure. Earlier this year, we shared our strategy consistent with years past. We continue to position ourselves to win in the markets we play through meaningful innovation by balancing our financial commitments. And in '22, we announced four acquisitions, invested 10% of our sales in internal R&D to fund sustainable growth and advance patient care. We're extremely excited about the year ahead and remain focused on our people and sustaining a culture that is motivated to drive differentiated performance and achieve our long-term goals, continuing to grow sales faster than markets, continuing to expand operating margins and delivering double-digit adjusted EPS growth and strong adjusted free cash flow generation. So, before I turn it over to Dan, I want to share that with the retirement of Dr. Ian Meredith, Dr. Ken Stein will assume some of the global responsibilities that previously fell under Ian, including total company investor engagement, in addition to a CRM, EP and WATCHMAN roles. Please join me in congratulating Ken, and thank Ian for his many contributions. With that, I'll pass it off to Dan to provide more details on the financials.\nDan Brennan : Thanks, Mike. Fourth quarter consolidated revenue of $3.242 billion represents a 3.7% reported revenue growth versus the fourth quarter 2021 and reflects a $158 million headwind from foreign exchange, slightly favorable to our expectations as the U.S. dollar weakened throughout the quarter. Excluding this 500 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, operational revenue growth was 8.7% in the quarter. Sales from the acquisition of Baylis contributed 160 basis points resulting in 7.1% organic revenue growth at the low end of our guidance range of 7% to 9% growth versus 2021, including an approximate 200 basis point impact associated with an unplanned sales reserve related to an Italian government payback provision, which was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022. With the goal of recovering spending above the government's medical device budgets, this payback provision requires companies that have supplied medical devices to public hospitals in Italy to pay back a portion of these overrun amounts. While we and others in our industry, have appealed and will continue to challenge the enforceability of the law through the Italian court system. We established a sales reserve of $60 million in the fourth quarter, representing our best estimates of amounts we could be required to pay back. Without the reserve, we would have achieved the high end of the organic revenue growth guidance range. Flow-through on the Italian sales reserve resulted in Q4 adjusted earnings per share of $0.45, at the low end of our range, representing a decline of 2% versus 2021. Without the reserve, we would have achieved the high end of our range for the quarter. Full year 2022 consolidated revenue of $12.682 billion represents 6.7% reported revenue growth versus full year 2021 and reflects a $524 million headwind from foreign exchange. Excluding this 440 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, operational revenue growth was 11.1% for the year. Sales from closed acquisitions contributed 240 basis points, resulting in 8.7% organic revenue growth, in line with expectations and inclusive of a 50 basis point impact associated with the Italian sales reserve. Full year 2022 adjusted earnings per share of $1.71 represents 4.8% growth versus 2021, achieving the low end of our guidance range of $1.71 to $1.74. Without the unplanned Italian sales reserve, we would have been at the high end of our full year guidance range. Adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter was 70.5%, resulting in full year 2022 adjusted gross margin also of 70.5%, in line with our expectations. Full year adjusted gross margin improved versus 2021, driven by an FX tailwind of approximately 100 basis points related to our hedging contracts, partially offset by continued macroeconomic headwinds. These headwinds were approximately $375 million versus 2019 and are predominantly from increased freight costs and unfavorable manufacturing variances primarily related to direct material cost and availability. Our 2023 guidance assumes macroeconomic and supply chain headwinds will be similar to 2022. Different from prior years, we expect first half 2023 gross margin to be higher than the second half, largely due to the timing of foreign exchange movements that occurred during 2022. Fourth quarter adjusted operating margin was 25.7% resulting in full year 2022 adjusted operating margin of 25.6%, improving 30 basis points versus 2021, inclusive of a 30 basis point negative impact from the unplanned Italian sales reserve. As we look to 2023, we continue to focus on our goal of annual operating margin expansion. And despite our expectation of continued macroeconomic headwinds, our goal is to achieve approximately 26.4% adjusted operating margin for the full year 2023, representing 80 basis points of improvement versus the 2022 adjusted operating margin of 25.6% and importantly, 50 basis points of expansion compared to the full year 2022 adjusted operating margin without the impact of the Italian sales reserve. On a GAAP basis, the fourth quarter operating margin was 12.4%, including $131 million in litigation-related expenses, which I'll provide detail on in a moment. Moving to below the line. Fourth quarter adjusted interest and other expense totaled $88 million, resulting in full year adjusted interest and other expense of $362 million, slightly higher than our expectations, driven in part by an FX loss from certain unhedged currencies. On an adjusted basis, our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 11.9% and 12.7% for the full year 2022 and including discrete tax items and the benefit from stock compensation accounting. Our operational tax rate was 12% for the fourth quarter and 13.5% for the full year, slightly favorable to our expectations of approximately 14%. Fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding ended at 1.442 billion in Q4 and 1.440 billion for the full year 2022. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $776 million, and free cash flow was $597 million with $807 million from operating activities less $210 million of net capital expenditures. Full year 2022 adjusted free cash flow was $2.1 billion, in line with expectations, and free cash flow was $949 million with $1.5 billion from operating activities less $576 million of net capital expenditures. For 2023, we expect adjusted free cash flow in excess of $2.3 billion.  As of December 31, 2022, we had cash on hand of $928 million. We continue to expect to close the acquisition of Apollo Endosurgery and the majority stake investments in M.I. Tech and Acotec with cash on hand or available credit lines in the first half of 2023. Our top priority for capital allocation remains high-quality tuck-in M&A, and we'll continue to assess opportunities in conjunction with our financial goals. As of December 31, our leverage was 2.57 times, in line with our expectations, and we were pleased to be upgraded to BBB+ with a stable outlook at both Fitch and Standard & Poor's within the quarter. Our legal reserve was $443 million as of December 31, an increase of $139 million from the prior quarter, primarily related to our mesh litigation. While our U.S. case count has remained materially the same over the past three years, we've increased our reserve to account for our latest estimates of the time and cost to resolve these claims as well as remaining probable and estimable global claims. I'll now walk through guidance for Q1 and the full year 2023. And as a reminder, guidance excludes any acquisitions that have not yet closed. We expect full year 2023 reported revenue growth to be in a range of 5% to 7% versus 2022. Excluding an approximate 100 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, based on current rates, and a 20 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect full year 2023 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 6% to 8% versus 2022. We expect first quarter 2023 reported revenue growth to be in a range of 3% to 5% versus Q1 2022. Excluding an approximate 350 basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates and a 70 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect first quarter 2023 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 6% to 8%. We expect our full year 2023 adjusted below the line expenses to be approximately $340 million. Under current legislation and forecasted geographic mix of sales, we forecast a full year 2023 operational tax rate of approximately 14%, with an adjusted tax rate of approximately 13% including the benefit of the accounting for stock compensation, which we expect will largely be recognized in the first quarter, resulting in a Q1 2023 adjusted tax rate of approximately 12%. We expect a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1.447 billion shares for Q1 2023 and 1.464 billion shares for full year 2023, which includes the shares we expect to issue on June 1 this year related to our May 2020 mandatory convertible preferred stock offering. We expect the impact to adjusted earnings per share to be neutral with the preferred stock dividend ending at the time of conversion. We expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.86 to $1.93, representing 9% to 13% growth versus 2022. At current rates and existing hedging contracts, we anticipate a neutral impact from FX on full year 2023 adjusted earnings per share.  We expect first quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.42 to $0.44. For more information, please check our Investor Relations website for Q4 2022 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more details on Q4 results and 2023 guidance. In closing, I'm very proud of the results that our global team achieved in 2022 with top-tier revenue performance and differentiated operating margin expansion despite a challenging macroeconomic environment, and I'm looking forward to continued momentum during 2023. With that, I'll turn it back to Lauren, who will moderate the Q&A.\nLauren Tengler: Thanks, Dan. Drew, let's open it up to questions for the next 30 minutes or so. In order for us to take as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question. Drew, please go ahead.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Rick Wise with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nRick Wise: Good morning everybody. Great to see another excellent year from Boston Scientific. I guess to focus on one question, I'll start with your 2023 guidance. Obviously, the 6% to 8% guide is right in line with your long-term philosophy. But you started in the same place in '22. You obviously, excluding the Italy issue, finished above 9% organically. Why again stick with the to 8%? Is this conservatism, respect for lingering macro pressures or both? And maybe just as part of that, why model macro headwinds similar to '22? The large-cap companies reporting to date, they're not Boston Scientific, but they're all in some way, shape or form highlighting the improving or less pressures from macro as they finish the year and start '23? Thank you very much.\nMike Mahoney: Good morning, Rick. It's Mike. Thanks for the compliments. Just to summarize your points, I guess. We're really happy with fourth quarter. Excluding that onetime Italy reserve grew plus 9%, basically high end of sales, high end of EPS. And as Dan said, really pleased that delivered top-tier revenue growth and I think one of the few companies that actually improved margins as well in '22. So, we have a lot of momentum and we're excited, very bullish on '23 in the future here. On guidance, you don't win the day in February here. So we think the 6% to 8% guidance for full year is appropriate. For the full year, we're coming off a 9% growth comp in 2022. And we obviously plan to grow as fast as we possibly can we continue to invest in the company. There are a couple of things that will be in -- there are pluses and minus. We're very bullish on the EP business, our momentum with WATCHMAN with There's a couple of headwinds. We do believe on the CRM side. We grew about 6% or 7%, I guess, last year, 7% in a market that's low single digits when you include diagnostics.  So, we expect a little bit of a headwind there based on comps China performed terrific for us in '22, and we expect them to deliver, again, excellent double-digit growth but potentially not quite as fast as they did in '22. Also, the underlying markets we compete at about 6%. So, we think coming off a 9% comp, 6% to 8% full year estimate. This time of year, is the smart prudent guidance to give, and we're going to push to beat it.\nDan Brennan: And then relative to the macroeconomic environment, Rick, the -- we kind of reiterated that 375 that we saw in 2022 as being a similar headwind in 2023. As you saw through 2022, we have a pretty high-performing global supply chain organization that has been on top of this all through it, and which is the reason that we've been giving the updates at the level of specs specificity that we have. So, as you would imagine, as we went through our annual operating plan process and guidance preparation process, they really dug in at a detailed level to try and understand what 2023 could bring. There are some elements that look better, right? Freight does work better. You see fuel prices and oil prices coming down. So, we're optimistic freight costs will be less. The supply of materials and the cost of materials is still a bit uncertain and choppy and that direct labor piece that we had that in 2022, you've got to annualize that in 2023. So, I think the prudent case right here, the prudent course for guidance in February is to assume that we don't get a lot of macroeconomic help in 2023, I'd love to be surprised as we go through the year that we get that help. But I think as we sit here in February, prudent to assume a similar headwind to what we saw last year.\nRick Wise: Thank you so much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRobbie Marcus: Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a nice quarter. Maybe to start, Mike, at our conference last month, you were really bullish on FARAPULSE, and we saw EP have a nice beat in the quarter, particularly outside the U.S., where you have FARAPULSE and POLARx going now. Maybe you could talk about your expectations what you saw in the quarter for FARAPULSE specifically and your expectations for it in 2023, especially after we get the data later in the back half of the year, assuming it looks good?\nMike Mahoney : Sure. Yes, our EP business in the quarter grew 25% and it grew 40 or 50, I think...\nLauren Tengler: 40% internationally.\nMike Mahoney : 40% internationally and poorly in the U.S. because we don't have these products approved in the U.S. So that really drove the growth down to 25. But I really look at the -- outside the U.S. growth as the key barometer for us. And we're continuing to see great pickup with both our cryo platform and FARAPULSE. Cryo is a platform that is competing against a product that hasn't changed in a decade. And so, physicians like the ease of use and the features of the cryo platform that we have in Japan and in Europe. So that's doing quite well, and we're hopeful to have approval for that second half of '23 in the U.S. here. And then FARAPULSE is doing extremely well for both cryo users who have adopted FARAPULSE and point to point RF users, Dr. Stein is on the phone, so he can make some comments. But the utilization enthusiasm for FARAPULSE is extremely high, and we're very bullish as we look at 2023 in terms of our EP performance and outlook, especially in Europe and Japan. And if we can get some -- the approval of the cryo platform in the second half, the U.S. will perform quite well as well. And then we expect to see a big impact from FARAPULSE in '24. So, the future of our EP business is very bright. We know it's a competitive field.  We believe we have unique platforms in both FARAPULSE and cryo that are differentiated and showing that clinically where they're launched and we have an excellent commercial team ready to bring these to the U.S. So, we don't give specific guidance for EP, but it's clearly a critical growth driver for us 23 and well beyond that. Dr. Stein, if you have any other comments?\nKen Stein : Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Mike. Thanks, Robbie. Again, just we do believe that FARAPULSE is differentiated relative to other PFA technologies out there. I think it's important to reiterate that all PSA is not created equal and because it's a field effect, the results that you're going to see with any of the technologies are highly dependent the way actual catheter design and FARAPULSE is the only system in evaluation right now that was designed from the ground up to deliver PFA dependent on the waveform that's delivered and dependent on the dosing strategy. And as you said, we are really looking forward to presenting the results of our randomized FARAPULSE trial, ADVENT in the second half of this year as well as to initiate our persistent AF trial advantage imminently. The only thing I'd add to what Mike said is I also think as you think about I think it's really important also to consider the really extraordinary momentum that we've got with our Transseptal access solutions from Baylis and continue to see above-market growth with that and continue to see increased use of the bales Transseptal access solutions, the energy needle and versus across access, both in ablation procedures and in WATCHMAN and other structural heart procedures.\nRobbie Marcus : Great. Thanks. And maybe just a quick follow-up. China has been an important growth driver for Boston Scientific, grew 22% in the year even with the difficult operating environment. So how should we be thinking about China coming out of the reopening here into first quarter? And what's your expectation for the year going forward? Thanks.\nMike Mahoney : Thank you. That team had a terrific '22 despite all the challenges with COVID and all the different pricing tenders that occur over there. So, for China, in '23, we are very bullish again -- we do expect double-digit growth out of the China team for the full year. There'll likely be some pressure in first quarter given the challenges that they've had in China with COVID. So, we expect potentially some sales growth challenges in Q1, but we do expect strong double digit for the full year, likely not at the same level as the 22% that we delivered in '22, but strong double digits nonetheless.\nOperator: The next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on a strong end to the year here. I wanted to ask a two-part question also on FARAPULSE. So maybe for Dr. Stein, you talked about your excitement for the ADVENT trial later this year. Can you help put the data into context? How did that compare to prior RF and cryo studies? And what would be a win for you in ADVENT for FARAPULSE? And we're going to see -- the second part is we're going to see the Medtronic Pulse select data at ACC, the J&J INSPIRE data at Boston AF, I guess, this weekend. You talked about how FARAPULSE is differentiated. What should we be looking for in those studies that would support your comments earlier? Thank for taking my question.\nKen Stein : Yes. Thanks, Larry. And let me just sort of begin by reiterating what I said to Robbie here. As we look at the data, everyone just needs to bear in mind that every PFA technology really needs to be evaluated on its own. It's very much unlike RF ablation. When you're doing RF ablation, if you've got the same size catheter tip and you've got the same back patch and the same power that you're putting through, you get the same lesion. PFA is very different. Again, because it's an electric field effect, what happens is just intimately related to actually the catheter design that tells you the shape of the field that you're generating; the waveform, which tells you very much what kind of impact you're going to have from that field and then your dosing strategy, how many applications of energy do you put in and where do you put them in. We're very confident that FARAPULSE is the industry leader in this. Again, based on having a catheter that was designed from the ground up to deliver PFA, based on a decade of preclinical and then really high-quality clinical data, validating the waveform and validating a dosing strategy with ReMAP studies that creates durable isolation. And I say, the proof of the pudding is in the eating, and we're really excited and looking forward to seeing the results of our randomized ADVENT trial. I'm glad that you mentioned MANIFEST, again, gives us a high degree of confidence in where we're going, right? So, MANIFEST is a registry study of the earliest commercial cases following our CE Mark approval in Europe. So, this is people's first experience climbing the learning curve and is reported out published initially on the first 1,700 cases and then some limited follow-up in about 1,400 of those patients. And really what those data show really proves the advantages of using a system like FARAPULSE. Certainly, 1,700 patients, the safety promise of FARAPULSE was realized. No cases of esophageal injury, no cases of persistent phrenic nerve injury, no cases of pulmonary vein stenosis, so certainly being able to avoid most feared complications of AF ablation. Seeing efficacy results that for paroxysmal AFib are at least as good as what's reported in high-quality trials with conventional thermal ablation and seeing remarkable procedure efficiency. Now -- in commercial clinical use, now sort of routinely seeing these cases being done on the order of 30 minutes. And that kind of procedural efficiency is, it's good for the system as a whole, right? There are a lot of patients who need to be treated dealing with staffing issues, et cetera, et cetera. Anything we can do an increased throughput is good. It's good for patients, though, too. The less time you're undergoing a procedure, the less number of things that can go wrong, honestly. And so basically, to some, right, the MANIFEST data validates what we see as all the differentiated advantages of FARAPULSE, a safer procedure avoiding the worst complications. A procedure that is at least as effective as what you see with thermal ablation and a really efficient procedure, which benefits physicians, hospitals and patients.\nLarry Biegelsen: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citibank. Please go ahead.\nJoanne Wuensch: Thank you very much for taking the question. And good morning. I want to spend just a minute or two on the Urology and Pelvic Prolapse business. I mean, that was up another 12% this quarter, 12.7% organically last quarter. What is driving that? And should we think of this more as a solid double-digit grower as we look forward?  And my follow-up question, I'm going to just put it out there now, 50 basis points of operating margin expansion or at least 50 basis points this year, where is that coming from? Thank you.\nMike Mahoney: Great, Mike here. Thanks for asking the endo, uro. You didn't asked about endo, but I'll throw it in there because they continue just to really outperform and are getting quite sizable within our portfolio and both accretive nicely to margins and growth rate. The urology results, I mentioned in the prepared words, it's a strong global performance around the world. This business has been predominantly a U.S.-oriented business that grows faster in the U.S. accretive to Boston Scientific. Outside the U.S. has been very underpenetrated. But now with all the investments that we've made, commercial and through R&D and through acquisitions is strengthening our outside the U.S. business in urology extensively. And the combination of that global performance and I would say, a highly differentiated portfolio. We talked about category leadership within a service line, and we really have that with urology and with endoscopy. So they have a very differentiated portfolio that's very comprehensive versus our competitive set and contracting capabilities with customers who want to work with us. And so urology continues to do quite well, and we expect similar results over the next few years here. And the integration of Lumenis has done well. So that's a terrific business. And I would say, along the same lines, most of the same words with endoscopy as well. In terms of margin improvement, Dan, do you want to hit that one?\nDan Brennan: I can do that. Yes, so the commentary again was 50 basis points on top of the 2022 results, excluding the Italian sales reserve. So that would be more like 25.6% was the actual, and then there was a 30 basis point impact. So then add 50 basis points to that is where you get the 26.4 just to give you the math there. And where does it come from? The short answer is, we believe all lines of the P&L. So gross margin will have a slight headwind from FX this year. Again, we said neutral to the EPS line, neutral to adjusted EPS for the year. But at the gross margin line, we're largely hedged for the year 2023. And with what we see with where rates are today, we think we'll have a slight headwind from FX in gross margin. But we still think gross margin itself can go north through a lot of the good activities that we have from our global supply chain team in terms of reducing cost and other volume improvement programs. And then tightly managing our discretionary spend within SG&A to ensure it's helping us achieve our strategic plan. And as we've always talked about, just really focused on R&D efficiencies and leverage. It all starts with a healthy top line. We think that 6% to 8% guidance versus that 9% comp last year is a good, solid, healthy top line, and that gives us leverage opportunities throughout the whole P&L. And we think each line of the P&L has the opportunity to contribute towards the goal in 2023.\nOperator: The next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. \nVijay Kumar: Thanks for taking my question. Just some cleanup questions here on the guidance assumptions. Mike, the 6% to 8% organic, it is what it is, but can you just remind us what are the incremental tailwinds -- positive tailwinds here in '23 and any incremental headwinds versus '22? Some things I can think of FARAPULSE becomes organic, maybe China has a little bit of a headwind, but can you just go through some of those drivers? And again, on share count up 20 million, that seems are just given how we've seen share count progress throughout the year. Curious why -- what's behind the share count assumption for the year?\nDan Brennan: Yes, sure. On the share count, just to take that clean up quickly and then Mike can take your revenue question. It's just a simple math of the converts that we have in -- during the year. So the increase is from the share count that will increase when we convert the mandatory preferreds. Recall, we then lose the preferred dividend. So it's neutral to EPS, but the share count increases as those preferred holders will get common shares. That makes sense, Vijay?\nVijay Kumar: That's helpful. Yes.\nDan Brennan: Yes. So I mean the takeaway should be neutral EPS impact from share count related to the mandatory preferred conversion this year.\nMike Mahoney: Sure. And the headwinds and tailwinds, maybe just some of the headwinds: we like the fact we did 9% growth in '22, but that's a bit of a tighter tougher comp than normal. So that's one.  I had mentioned China would be expect double-digit growth, but likely not the same growth as '22. And then also CRM coming off of a really exceedingly market growth quite a bit in '22, likely to grow more in line with the market in '23. So there's a couple of the headwinds, clearly, a bunch of tailwinds. The company performed -- continues to perform extremely well across the globe, Europe, LatAm, Asia-Pac and U.S. You saw really impressive growth across the company. WATCHMAN growing 24% for the year, Cardiology as a whole grouping grow 10%, PI grew 9%, Endo 8%, Euro 10%. So we have just very strong momentum across the businesses, which is obviously a bit of a tailwind given the momentum we have commercially. And we have incrementally to that some of the questions today on EP. We expect to have a very strong year in EP in outside in Europe and in Japan. Potential tailwind would be depending on when cryo gets approved in the U.S. So I'm sure how much of an impact that will have in the U.S. depends on the approval date there. Other products like WATCHMAN continue to do extremely well. We're really proud. We actually think we gained share in fourth quarter with WATCHMAN and ended the year just over 90% market share. So that business continues to do really well. And the one that gets very little discussion by analysts, but lots internally and by physicians is ACURATE neo2. We now have a large size. That business is doing extremely well in Europe, actually building momentum each quarter. And we're anxious to finish that U.S. trial shortly.\nVijay Kumar: That\u2019s helpful. Thanks guys.\nOperator: The next question comes from Travis Steed with Bank of America. Please go ahead. \nTravis Steed: Hi, good morning, everybody. And thanks for taking my question. I guess I'll ask a question on the Italy impact. Just curious why we're only hearing about this from Boston. I don't know if maybe it's -- you're taking a more conservative approach in taking a reserve. And it seems like a big number. I know it seems like Italy wouldn't be that big of a country, so maybe just calculated on more than a year of sales. And I just want to confirm no impact on 2023? And then I'll ask my follow-up now as well, which is on op margins. I think you mentioned gross margin first half higher, lower in the second half on currency. And I just want to make sure there's any puts and takes to consider on the op margin side first half versus second half? Thank you.\nDan Brennan: Sure, Travis. I'll take the Italy one first. I can't speak for other companies. I can speak for on behalf of Boston Scientific. It's been an evolving situation, particularly over the last few weeks here, because what you have is the Italian government passed a provision back in 2015 with regard to what I mentioned to trying to claw back some excess spending over the allocated budgets within the public hospitals in Italy. But for the last 7-plus years, there's really been -- it's been dormant. There's been limited implementation guidance, there's really been literally no activity around that. That changed, again, over the last few weeks, with some events that put a little more teeth into their desire to collect those monies. And so we booked that incremental reserve. We had a reserve on the books, we booked an incremental reserve to cover what we believe will be the amounts that we'll owe as part of that. We're obviously challenging it vehemently through the Italian court system as our other industry participants, we disagree with it. But that outcome will be uncertain, but we picked a reserve that we think is a reasonable reserve given the timeframe.\nMike Mahoney: He also mentioned do you see an issue in '23 with more reserves?\nDan Brennan: The '23 amounts are included in guidance. So the amount of the reserve relates to prior periods, 2015 to 2022, anything that's 2023 and beyond is included in guidance.  With respect to op margin, actually, I'm glad you asked that question because it's a bit of a juxtaposition with gross margin. So I mentioned that gross margin will be higher in the first half and lower in the second half, which is a bit of a buck the trend we normally have, which I wanted to make sure I got that point out there. Relative to operating margin, though, I think you'll see a similar trend where it builds throughout the year. So the gross margin higher in the first half, lower in the second half, but through the rest of the P&L and netting down to operating margin, I would expect you'd see a very similar trend starting in Q1 and building to higher amounts as you go first half, second half. So hopefully, that's clear, Travis.\nTravis Steed: Yes. Thank you. \nOperator: The next question comes from Cecilia Furlong with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. \nCecilia Furlong: Good morning. And thank you for taking the question. I wanted to ask on WATCHMAN, specifically what's underlying the double-digit growth outlook that you called out for '23? How you're thinking about market growth as well as Japan and China contributions? And then just a quick follow-up on ACURATE neo2 with the Prime XL registry. How are you thinking about approval time lines at this point in the U.S.?\nMike Mahoney: Sure. On WATCHMAN, we had a terrific year in '22. As I said, maintaining, call it, 90% share, potentially slightly above that, grew 24% for the full year. It's a very healthy market, so call it, 25% growth we expect in '23, two companies in the marketplace today.  Similar to previous comments, the success of WATCHMAN is really manyfold. The safety, consistency and proven effectiveness through clinical trial in everyday practice at WATCHMAN, physicians are extremely comfortable in using the device. They're very comfortable with the support team they have from Boston in the lab with them and the referring physician community is seeing such strong benefits from the LAs procedure that is helping to drive that market growth. So it's an excellent market. It's also a product that's -- a procedure that's profitable for hospitals. And the procedure time today continues to improve, which is really important for hospitals. So the overall market context is very good. We have the leading platform, and we have a new product, new steerable sheath coming this year and the next-gen WATCHMAN platform coming about a year from now. So we have a differentiated pipeline as well. Neo2 is doing extremely well in Europe. We just launched -- or just having some implementation of our XL valves. That's part of the U.S. trial. There was, I think, some -- a bit of inaccurate reporting on that one. We do not expect that XL to slow down the approval process for the U.S. So that does not have an impact on U.S. approval. And that XL valve is important because it's about a one-third of the procedures are using that size valve in Europe. So we're doing quite well, growing faster than market in Europe without that, and eventually, we'll be adding that to approval. So we're excited about that. ACURATE neo2, we expect it to be approved in 2024 in the U.S.\nCecilia Furlong: Great. Thank you for taking the question.\nOperator: And the next question, currently, I have is Josh Jennings with Cowen. Please go ahead. \nJoshJennings: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping to start off with just your Apollo acquisition and get you into the diabetes -- sorry, not diabetes, the obesity segment. And I just wanted to hear about your outlook for that portfolio but also just device-based intervention opportunities in obesity from a higher level and whether this portfolio could become a long-term growth driver for the endoscopy franchise? And then the follow-up is just on your neuromodulation business. Congratulations on SOLIS trial results. And I think three of the big competitors in the space have a peripheral diabetic neuropathy indication now with different levels of evidence. But I was hoping you could just review Boston's plan to generate clinical evidence for that indication going forward? Thanks a lot. \nMike Mahoney: Yes. So on Apollo Endosurgery overall, it's really consistent with our overall strategy of category leadership, which is driving above-market growth and continuing to advance new therapies where we can be the leader. When we look at endoluminal surgery, we think that is really the next frontier for our endo business. And you see a terrific uptake of endoluminal surgery, I would say, outside the U.S., particularly in Japan, a bit more so in Europe and less so in U.S. And so we think endoluminal surgery will really continue to build momentum over the next coming years and Apollo is a platform that's most used by physicians pick outside the U.S. to perform these procedures with a product called OverStitch and xTAC. So we think the addition of Apollo into our current platform will obviously make us the number one strongest endoluminal surgery portfolio, but also put us in a position, as Dr. Duncan would say, to help train the field because these are procedures that require significant physician training to get great outcomes, and we'll be able to do that with the Apollo platform.\nUnidentified Company Speaker : And then on Neuromod, I asked about SOLIS.\nMike Mahoney: On SOLIS with SCS, again, we did see some improvement in that overall SCS business in the fourth quarter, growing 4% in the quarter. SOLIS, we're pleased with the three-month results that we expected. We expect indication and approval for nonsurgical back by the year-end of 2023.\nUnidentified Company Speaker : And we're in early clinical work for PDN right now and haven't announced any timelines, but we'll look to invest in that space.  And that concludes our call for today. So thank you for joining us. We appreciate your interest in Boston Scientific. If we were unable to get to your question or if you have any follow-ups, please don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team.

            "name": "Dan Brennan",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Fourth quarter consolidated revenue of $3.242 billion represents a 3.7% reported revenue growth versus the fourth quarter 2021 and reflects a $158 million headwind from foreign exchange, slightly favorable to our expectations as the U.S. dollar weakened throughout the quarter. Excluding this 500 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, operational revenue growth was 8.7% in the quarter. Sales from the acquisition of Baylis contributed 160 basis points resulting in 7.1% organic revenue growth at the low end of our guidance range of 7% to 9% growth versus 2021, including an approximate 200 basis point impact associated with an unplanned sales reserve related to an Italian government payback provision, which was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022. With the goal of recovering spending above the government's medical device budgets, this payback provision requires companies that have supplied medical devices to public hospitals in Italy to pay back a portion of these overrun amounts. While we and others in our industry, have appealed and will continue to challenge the enforceability of the law through the Italian court system. We established a sales reserve of $60 million in the fourth quarter, representing our best estimates of amounts we could be required to pay back. Without the reserve, we would have achieved the high end of the organic revenue growth guidance range. Flow-through on the Italian sales reserve resulted in Q4 adjusted earnings per share of $0.45, at the low end of our range, representing a decline of 2% versus 2021. Without the reserve, we would have achieved the high end of our range for the quarter. Full year 2022 consolidated revenue of $12.682 billion represents 6.7% reported revenue growth versus full year 2021 and reflects a $524 million headwind from foreign exchange. Excluding this 440 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, operational revenue growth was 11.1% for the year. Sales from closed acquisitions contributed 240 basis points, resulting in 8.7% organic revenue growth, in line with expectations and inclusive of a 50 basis point impact associated with the Italian sales reserve. Full year 2022 adjusted earnings per share of $1.71 represents 4.8% growth versus 2021, achieving the low end of our guidance range of $1.71 to $1.74. Without the unplanned Italian sales reserve, we would have been at the high end of our full year guidance range. Adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter was 70.5%, resulting in full year 2022 adjusted gross margin also of 70.5%, in line with our expectations. Full year adjusted gross margin improved versus 2021, driven by an FX tailwind of approximately 100 basis points related to our hedging contracts, partially offset by continued macroeconomic headwinds. These headwinds were approximately $375 million versus 2019 and are predominantly from increased freight costs and unfavorable manufacturing variances primarily related to direct material cost and availability. Our 2023 guidance assumes macroeconomic and supply chain headwinds will be similar to 2022. Different from prior years, we expect first half 2023 gross margin to be higher than the second half, largely due to the timing of foreign exchange movements that occurred during 2022. Fourth quarter adjusted operating margin was 25.7% resulting in full year 2022 adjusted operating margin of 25.6%, improving 30 basis points versus 2021, inclusive of a 30 basis point negative impact from the unplanned Italian sales reserve. As we look to 2023, we continue to focus on our goal of annual operating margin expansion. And despite our expectation of continued macroeconomic headwinds, our goal is to achieve approximately 26.4% adjusted operating margin for the full year 2023, representing 80 basis points of improvement versus the 2022 adjusted operating margin of 25.6% and importantly, 50 basis points of expansion compared to the full year 2022 adjusted operating margin without the impact of the Italian sales reserve. On a GAAP basis, the fourth quarter operating margin was 12.4%, including $131 million in litigation-related expenses, which I'll provide detail on in a moment. Moving to below the line. Fourth quarter adjusted interest and other expense totaled $88 million, resulting in full year adjusted interest and other expense of $362 million, slightly higher than our expectations, driven in part by an FX loss from certain unhedged currencies. On an adjusted basis, our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 11.9% and 12.7% for the full year 2022 and including discrete tax items and the benefit from stock compensation accounting. Our operational tax rate was 12% for the fourth quarter and 13.5% for the full year, slightly favorable to our expectations of approximately 14%. Fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding ended at 1.442 billion in Q4 and 1.440 billion for the full year 2022. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $776 million, and free cash flow was $597 million with $807 million from operating activities less $210 million of net capital expenditures. Full year 2022 adjusted free cash flow was $2.1 billion, in line with expectations, and free cash flow was $949 million with $1.5 billion from operating activities less $576 million of net capital expenditures. For 2023, we expect adjusted free cash flow in excess of $2.3 billion.  As of December 31, 2022, we had cash on hand of $928 million. We continue to expect to close the acquisition of Apollo Endosurgery and the majority stake investments in M.I. Tech and Acotec with cash on hand or available credit lines in the first half of 2023. Our top priority for capital allocation remains high-quality tuck-in M&A, and we'll continue to assess opportunities in conjunction with our financial goals. As of December 31, our leverage was 2.57 times, in line with our expectations, and we were pleased to be upgraded to BBB+ with a stable outlook at both Fitch and Standard & Poor's within the quarter. Our legal reserve was $443 million as of December 31, an increase of $139 million from the prior quarter, primarily related to our mesh litigation. While our U.S. case count has remained materially the same over the past three years, we've increased our reserve to account for our latest estimates of the time and cost to resolve these claims as well as remaining probable and estimable global claims. I'll now walk through guidance for Q1 and the full year 2023. And as a reminder, guidance excludes any acquisitions that have not yet closed. We expect full year 2023 reported revenue growth to be in a range of 5% to 7% versus 2022. Excluding an approximate 100 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, based on current rates, and a 20 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect full year 2023 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 6% to 8% versus 2022. We expect first quarter 2023 reported revenue growth to be in a range of 3% to 5% versus Q1 2022. Excluding an approximate 350 basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates and a 70 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect first quarter 2023 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 6% to 8%. We expect our full year 2023 adjusted below the line expenses to be approximately $340 million. Under current legislation and forecasted geographic mix of sales, we forecast a full year 2023 operational tax rate of approximately 14%, with an adjusted tax rate of approximately 13% including the benefit of the accounting for stock compensation, which we expect will largely be recognized in the first quarter, resulting in a Q1 2023 adjusted tax rate of approximately 12%. We expect a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1.447 billion shares for Q1 2023 and 1.464 billion shares for full year 2023, which includes the shares we expect to issue on June 1 this year related to our May 2020 mandatory convertible preferred stock offering. We expect the impact to adjusted earnings per share to be neutral with the preferred stock dividend ending at the time of conversion. We expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.86 to $1.93, representing 9% to 13% growth versus 2022. At current rates and existing hedging contracts, we anticipate a neutral impact from FX on full year 2023 adjusted earnings per share.  We expect first quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.42 to $0.44. For more information, please check our Investor Relations website for Q4 2022 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more details on Q4 results and 2023 guidance. In closing, I'm very proud of the results that our global team achieved in 2022 with top-tier revenue performance and differentiated operating margin expansion despite a challenging macroeconomic environment, and I'm looking forward to continued momentum during 2023. With that, I'll turn it back to Lauren, who will moderate the Q&A. And then relative to the macroeconomic environment, Rick, the -- we kind of reiterated that 375 that we saw in 2022 as being a similar headwind in 2023. As you saw through 2022, we have a pretty high-performing global supply chain organization that has been on top of this all through it, and which is the reason that we've been giving the updates at the level of specs specificity that we have. So, as you would imagine, as we went through our annual operating plan process and guidance preparation process, they really dug in at a detailed level to try and understand what 2023 could bring. There are some elements that look better, right? Freight does work better. You see fuel prices and oil prices coming down. So, we're optimistic freight costs will be less. The supply of materials and the cost of materials is still a bit uncertain and choppy and that direct labor piece that we had that in 2022, you've got to annualize that in 2023. So, I think the prudent case right here, the prudent course for guidance in February is to assume that we don't get a lot of macroeconomic help in 2023, I'd love to be surprised as we go through the year that we get that help. But I think as we sit here in February, prudent to assume a similar headwind to what we saw last year. I can do that. Yes, so the commentary again was 50 basis points on top of the 2022 results, excluding the Italian sales reserve. So that would be more like 25.6% was the actual, and then there was a 30 basis point impact. So then add 50 basis points to that is where you get the 26.4 just to give you the math there. And where does it come from? The short answer is, we believe all lines of the P&L. So gross margin will have a slight headwind from FX this year. Again, we said neutral to the EPS line, neutral to adjusted EPS for the year. But at the gross margin line, we're largely hedged for the year 2023. And with what we see with where rates are today, we think we'll have a slight headwind from FX in gross margin. But we still think gross margin itself can go north through a lot of the good activities that we have from our global supply chain team in terms of reducing cost and other volume improvement programs. And then tightly managing our discretionary spend within SG&A to ensure it's helping us achieve our strategic plan. And as we've always talked about, just really focused on R&D efficiencies and leverage. It all starts with a healthy top line. We think that 6% to 8% guidance versus that 9% comp last year is a good, solid, healthy top line, and that gives us leverage opportunities throughout the whole P&L. And we think each line of the P&L has the opportunity to contribute towards the goal in 2023. Yes, sure. On the share count, just to take that clean up quickly and then Mike can take your revenue question. It's just a simple math of the converts that we have in -- during the year. So the increase is from the share count that will increase when we convert the mandatory preferreds. Recall, we then lose the preferred dividend. So it's neutral to EPS, but the share count increases as those preferred holders will get common shares. That makes sense, Vijay? Yes. So I mean the takeaway should be neutral EPS impact from share count related to the mandatory preferred conversion this year. Sure, Travis. I'll take the Italy one first. I can't speak for other companies. I can speak for on behalf of Boston Scientific. It's been an evolving situation, particularly over the last few weeks here, because what you have is the Italian government passed a provision back in 2015 with regard to what I mentioned to trying to claw back some excess spending over the allocated budgets within the public hospitals in Italy. But for the last 7-plus years, there's really been -- it's been dormant. There's been limited implementation guidance, there's really been literally no activity around that. That changed, again, over the last few weeks, with some events that put a little more teeth into their desire to collect those monies. And so we booked that incremental reserve. We had a reserve on the books, we booked an incremental reserve to cover what we believe will be the amounts that we'll owe as part of that. We're obviously challenging it vehemently through the Italian court system as our other industry participants, we disagree with it. But that outcome will be uncertain, but we picked a reserve that we think is a reasonable reserve given the timeframe. The '23 amounts are included in guidance. So the amount of the reserve relates to prior periods, 2015 to 2022, anything that's 2023 and beyond is included in guidance.  With respect to op margin, actually, I'm glad you asked that question because it's a bit of a juxtaposition with gross margin. So I mentioned that gross margin will be higher in the first half and lower in the second half, which is a bit of a buck the trend we normally have, which I wanted to make sure I got that point out there. Relative to operating margin, though, I think you'll see a similar trend where it builds throughout the year. So the gross margin higher in the first half, lower in the second half, but through the rest of the P&L and netting down to operating margin, I would expect you'd see a very similar trend starting in Q1 and building to higher amounts as you go first half, second half. So hopefully, that's clear, Travis."

            "name": "Mike Mahoney",
            "content": "Thanks, Lauren, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. 2022 represented a return to more durable and consistent procedural growth within the markets we serve, which provided a stronger base for our innovative portfolio. I'm very proud of the resiliency and winning spirit of our global team, delivering on our sales and EPS goals despite the ongoing macroeconomic and supply chain challenges. Importantly, we delivered strong performance across all geographic regions and believe that most all of our business units gained or maintained market share throughout the year. In fourth quarter '22, total company operational sales grew 9% and organic sales grew 7% versus fourth quarter '21, which was the low end of the guidance range. However, it's very important to note that these results include an unplanned sales reserve of $60 million, established for an Italian government payback provision which resulted in a headwind of approximately 200 basis points for the quarter. The underlying fourth quarter performance was strong on both sales; operating margin increases and earnings per share. And without the impact of the Italian sales reserve, we would have achieved the high end of our organic sales guidance range of 7% to 9%. Full year '22 operational sales grew 11% versus '21, while organic sales grew 9%, in line with our guidance of approximately 9%. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $0.45 declined minus 2% versus '21, and full year adjusted EPS of $1.71 grew 5% versus '21, both achieved in the low end of the guidance range. Once again, without the impact of the Italian sales reserve, we would achieve the high end of the guidance range for both fourth quarter and full year of $1.71 to $1.74. We generated full year free cash flow of $950 million and adjusted free cash flow of $2.1 billion, in line with our expectations. Now for outlook for 2023. We are guiding to organic growth of 6% to 8% for both first quarter '23 and full year '23, which excludes the acquisition of Apollo Endosurgery and the majority stake investments in M.I. Tech and all of which are expected to close in the first half of 2023. Our first quarter '23 adjusted EPS estimate is $0.42 to $0.44, and we expect our full year adjusted EPS to be $1.86 to $1.93. And despite the ongoing macroeconomic pressures and supply chain headwinds, we remain committed to our goal of plus 50 basis points of operating margin expansion and double-digit adjusted EPS growth in 2023. Dan will provide more details on our '22 performance, the Italian sales reserve and our '23 outlook. I'll now provide some additional highlights on '22 results along with comments on our '23 outlook. Regionally, on an operational basis, the U.S. grew 10% versus fourth quarter '21. Full year '22 grew 11%, inclusive of a 300 basis point tailwind from acquisitions, with particular strength in our WATCHMAN, Endo and urology business units. Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 11% on an operational basis versus fourth quarter '21 and 12% on a full year basis. This above-market growth was supported by ongoing investments in emerging markets, new and ongoing product launches across the portfolio, pricing discipline and strong commercial execution.  We're excited about the year ahead with ongoing momentum across the region, particularly with our innovative EP portfolio and further opportunity with Baylis in the Access Solutions franchise. Asia Pacific grew 10% operationally versus fourth quarter '21 and 12% for the full year. On a full year basis, six out of eight business units grew double digits, supported by ongoing innovation across the region. Full year Japan growth was driven by new products, including POLARx, which has approximately 50% share in open accounts. We look forward to 2023 with ongoing momentum from both new products and are excited about our recent approval and reimbursement received for AGENT DCB, which is a coronary drug-coated balloon for restenosis in small vessels. On a full year basis, China grew more than 20%, fueled by 13 new product launches, ongoing portfolio diversification and the team's resiliency and execution. We continue to expand our presence in the China market with the recently announced acquisition of a majority stake in Acotec. We believe this investment can create strategic value for both companies with opportunities to collaborate in R&D, manufacturing and commercial strategies. We also continue to expect China to be a double-digit grower in '23 despite ongoing VBP pressure and potential impact to procedure volumes in Q1 from COVID. In Latin America, the momentum continued with operational sales growth of 16% versus fourth quarter '21 and full year growth of 28%, with all business units growing double digits versus '21. On the business units, starting with urology. Urology sales grew 12%, both operationally and organically versus fourth quarter '21 and on a full year basis. They grew 15% operationally and 10% organically versus '21. Within the quarter, all franchises grew double digits, fueled by new and ongoing product launches and continued global expansion. On a full year basis, global growth was driven by key products such as LithoVue, Rezum and SpaceOAR as well as the acquisition of the Lumenis Moser laser technology, further complementing the urology portfolio. Endoscopy sales grew 7% organically in the quarter, and on a full year basis grew 8% organically versus '21. In '22, we had global success with innovative products such as AXIOS and Single-Use imaging, both growing over 20% and supporting strong growth across the globe. In the fourth quarter, we announced our intent to acquire Apollo Endosurgery, which will add a complementary and innovative endoluminal surgery portfolio. We look forward to closing this acquisition as well as our previously announced majority stake in M.I. Tech, which includes the innovative stent in the first half of '23. Neuromodulation sales grew 5% organically versus fourth quarter '21 and on a full year basis grew 3% organically versus '21. Globally, our spinal cord stimulation business grew 4% in the fourth quarter with continued physician enthusiasm for WaveWriter Alpha and FAST. We continue to invest in clinical evidence to expand indications and present three-month data from our nonsurgical back study, SOLIS, at NANS earlier this year.  The study comparing SCS to conventional medical management met its primary endpoints, and we anticipate FDA approval for nonsurgical back indication by the end of '23. Our Brain franchise grew double digits in the quarter and low double digits on a full year basis. This strong performance is aided by continued momentum from new product launches in '22 as well as the recent launch of the Vercise 2-in-1 lead extension. Peripheral Intervention sales grew 9% organically versus both fourth quarter '21 and full year '21. Within Arterial, we are pleased with the performance of our drug-eluting portfolio growing strong double digits for the full year and achieving the number one global position -- I'm sorry, the number one position within SFA in the U.S. On a full year basis, our venous franchise was flat versus prior year with Varithena, our market-leading varicose vein offering, growing over 20% in 2022. Our Interventional Oncology franchise performed well in '22, growing low double digits, led by our portfolio of innovative cancer therapies and suite of embolization tools. We continue to invest in expanding the potential applications of TheraSphere and enrolled our first patient in our early feasibility study, frontier the image of -- safety of image-guided intra-arterial delivery of TheraSphere GBM in patients with the reoccurring glioblastoma. Cardiology delivered another excellent quarter, with operational sales growing 13% and organic sales growing 10% versus fourth quarter '21. On a full year basis, sales grew 14% operationally and 10% organically. Our newly aligned cardiology group delivered strong growth across its four businesses, as we continue to invest in the higher growth segments and differentiated offerings for our customers that address the areas of greatest cardiac need for patients. Within Cardiology, Interventional Cardiology Therapy sales grew 5% organically in fourth quarter and on a full year basis grew 8% organically versus '21. On a full year basis, the Coronary Therapies' franchise, which includes both drug-eluting stents and complex PCI grew 7%, driven by strong performance in our international regions and our imaging franchise. Our structural Heart Valves franchise grew double digits in both fourth quarter and the full year basis, outpacing the market in Europe with our ACURATE neo2 aortic valve. Ongoing clinical evidence to support growth throughout '22 and in the fourth quarter. Data from the ACURATE neo2 PMCF study was presented as a late breaker at PCR London Valves, demonstrating positive safety and 30-day outcomes with low PVL rates and best-in-class pacemaker implantation rates. Additionally, we enrolled our first patient in the ACURATE Prime XL Nested Registry, assessing the safety and efficacy of the ACURATE Prime Aortic Valve XL to treat patients with severe aortic restenosis who need a larger valve size for the TAVR procedure. WATCHMAN sales grew 22% organically versus fourth quarter '21 and on a full year basis grew 24% organically versus '21. Q4 finished with record sales, strong utilization in the U.S. supported by the DAPT label expansion. Importantly, we completed the enrollment of our CHAMPION-AF trial way ahead of schedule. This head-to-head trial versus novel oral anticoagulation has the potential to more than triple the number of patients indicated for WATCHMAN FLEX in 2027 and beyond. We remain excited about this outlook for this business and expect double-digit growth in 2023, fueled by innovation, ongoing clinical evidence and strong commercial execution. CRM sales grew 6%, both operationally and organically versus fourth quarter '21 and on a full year basis grew 8% operationally and 7% organically. Our Diagnostics franchise had a strong year, growing double digits versus '21. In core CRM, on the full year basis, our high-voltage business grew low single digits, and our low voltage business grew mid-single digits, and we expect that all major markets were in line or slightly above the market. Electrophysiology sales grew 76% operationally and 25% organically versus fourth quarter '21 and on a full year basis grew 69% operationally and 18% organically versus '21. Importantly, our international EP business continues to outpace the market, growing over 40% organically versus fourth quarter '21. POLARx continues to perform well in both Europe and Japan has now been treated to treat over patients since launch. Momentum in FARAPULSE continues with another strong quarter of growth in Europe. And we continue to invest in clinical evidence and look forward to the readout of the randomized ADVENT U.S. IDE trial in the second half of '23 and are planning to initiate our ADVANTAGE AF trial these therapods patients with persistent AFib imminently. We've been very pleased with the performance of our Baylis acquisition and the innovative platform, which grew 2 times faster than the market in '22. We launched our VersaCross Connect in '22, improving efficiencies in our WATCHMAN procedure. Earlier this year, we shared our strategy consistent with years past. We continue to position ourselves to win in the markets we play through meaningful innovation by balancing our financial commitments. And in '22, we announced four acquisitions, invested 10% of our sales in internal R&D to fund sustainable growth and advance patient care. We're extremely excited about the year ahead and remain focused on our people and sustaining a culture that is motivated to drive differentiated performance and achieve our long-term goals, continuing to grow sales faster than markets, continuing to expand operating margins and delivering double-digit adjusted EPS growth and strong adjusted free cash flow generation. So, before I turn it over to Dan, I want to share that with the retirement of Dr. Ian Meredith, Dr. Ken Stein will assume some of the global responsibilities that previously fell under Ian, including total company investor engagement, in addition to a CRM, EP and WATCHMAN roles. Please join me in congratulating Ken, and thank Ian for his many contributions. With that, I'll pass it off to Dan to provide more details on the financials. Good morning, Rick. It's Mike. Thanks for the compliments. Just to summarize your points, I guess. We're really happy with fourth quarter. Excluding that onetime Italy reserve grew plus 9%, basically high end of sales, high end of EPS. And as Dan said, really pleased that delivered top-tier revenue growth and I think one of the few companies that actually improved margins as well in '22. So, we have a lot of momentum and we're excited, very bullish on '23 in the future here. On guidance, you don't win the day in February here. So we think the 6% to 8% guidance for full year is appropriate. For the full year, we're coming off a 9% growth comp in 2022. And we obviously plan to grow as fast as we possibly can we continue to invest in the company. There are a couple of things that will be in -- there are pluses and minus. We're very bullish on the EP business, our momentum with WATCHMAN with There's a couple of headwinds. We do believe on the CRM side. We grew about 6% or 7%, I guess, last year, 7% in a market that's low single digits when you include diagnostics.  So, we expect a little bit of a headwind there based on comps China performed terrific for us in '22, and we expect them to deliver, again, excellent double-digit growth but potentially not quite as fast as they did in '22. Also, the underlying markets we compete at about 6%. So, we think coming off a 9% comp, 6% to 8% full year estimate. This time of year, is the smart prudent guidance to give, and we're going to push to beat it. Sure. Yes, our EP business in the quarter grew 25% and it grew 40 or 50, I think... 40% internationally and poorly in the U.S. because we don't have these products approved in the U.S. So that really drove the growth down to 25. But I really look at the -- outside the U.S. growth as the key barometer for us. And we're continuing to see great pickup with both our cryo platform and FARAPULSE. Cryo is a platform that is competing against a product that hasn't changed in a decade. And so, physicians like the ease of use and the features of the cryo platform that we have in Japan and in Europe. So that's doing quite well, and we're hopeful to have approval for that second half of '23 in the U.S. here. And then FARAPULSE is doing extremely well for both cryo users who have adopted FARAPULSE and point to point RF users, Dr. Stein is on the phone, so he can make some comments. But the utilization enthusiasm for FARAPULSE is extremely high, and we're very bullish as we look at 2023 in terms of our EP performance and outlook, especially in Europe and Japan. And if we can get some -- the approval of the cryo platform in the second half, the U.S. will perform quite well as well. And then we expect to see a big impact from FARAPULSE in '24. So, the future of our EP business is very bright. We know it's a competitive field.  We believe we have unique platforms in both FARAPULSE and cryo that are differentiated and showing that clinically where they're launched and we have an excellent commercial team ready to bring these to the U.S. So, we don't give specific guidance for EP, but it's clearly a critical growth driver for us 23 and well beyond that. Dr. Stein, if you have any other comments? Thank you. That team had a terrific '22 despite all the challenges with COVID and all the different pricing tenders that occur over there. So, for China, in '23, we are very bullish again -- we do expect double-digit growth out of the China team for the full year. There'll likely be some pressure in first quarter given the challenges that they've had in China with COVID. So, we expect potentially some sales growth challenges in Q1, but we do expect strong double digit for the full year, likely not at the same level as the 22% that we delivered in '22, but strong double digits nonetheless. Great, Mike here. Thanks for asking the endo, uro. You didn't asked about endo, but I'll throw it in there because they continue just to really outperform and are getting quite sizable within our portfolio and both accretive nicely to margins and growth rate. The urology results, I mentioned in the prepared words, it's a strong global performance around the world. This business has been predominantly a U.S.-oriented business that grows faster in the U.S. accretive to Boston Scientific. Outside the U.S. has been very underpenetrated. But now with all the investments that we've made, commercial and through R&D and through acquisitions is strengthening our outside the U.S. business in urology extensively. And the combination of that global performance and I would say, a highly differentiated portfolio. We talked about category leadership within a service line, and we really have that with urology and with endoscopy. So they have a very differentiated portfolio that's very comprehensive versus our competitive set and contracting capabilities with customers who want to work with us. And so urology continues to do quite well, and we expect similar results over the next few years here. And the integration of Lumenis has done well. So that's a terrific business. And I would say, along the same lines, most of the same words with endoscopy as well. In terms of margin improvement, Dan, do you want to hit that one? Sure. And the headwinds and tailwinds, maybe just some of the headwinds: we like the fact we did 9% growth in '22, but that's a bit of a tighter tougher comp than normal. So that's one.  I had mentioned China would be expect double-digit growth, but likely not the same growth as '22. And then also CRM coming off of a really exceedingly market growth quite a bit in '22, likely to grow more in line with the market in '23. So there's a couple of the headwinds, clearly, a bunch of tailwinds. The company performed -- continues to perform extremely well across the globe, Europe, LatAm, Asia-Pac and U.S. You saw really impressive growth across the company. WATCHMAN growing 24% for the year, Cardiology as a whole grouping grow 10%, PI grew 9%, Endo 8%, Euro 10%. So we have just very strong momentum across the businesses, which is obviously a bit of a tailwind given the momentum we have commercially. And we have incrementally to that some of the questions today on EP. We expect to have a very strong year in EP in outside in Europe and in Japan. Potential tailwind would be depending on when cryo gets approved in the U.S. So I'm sure how much of an impact that will have in the U.S. depends on the approval date there. Other products like WATCHMAN continue to do extremely well. We're really proud. We actually think we gained share in fourth quarter with WATCHMAN and ended the year just over 90% market share. So that business continues to do really well. And the one that gets very little discussion by analysts, but lots internally and by physicians is ACURATE neo2. We now have a large size. That business is doing extremely well in Europe, actually building momentum each quarter. And we're anxious to finish that U.S. trial shortly. He also mentioned do you see an issue in '23 with more reserves? Sure. On WATCHMAN, we had a terrific year in '22. As I said, maintaining, call it, 90% share, potentially slightly above that, grew 24% for the full year. It's a very healthy market, so call it, 25% growth we expect in '23, two companies in the marketplace today.  Similar to previous comments, the success of WATCHMAN is really manyfold. The safety, consistency and proven effectiveness through clinical trial in everyday practice at WATCHMAN, physicians are extremely comfortable in using the device. They're very comfortable with the support team they have from Boston in the lab with them and the referring physician community is seeing such strong benefits from the LAs procedure that is helping to drive that market growth. So it's an excellent market. It's also a product that's -- a procedure that's profitable for hospitals. And the procedure time today continues to improve, which is really important for hospitals. So the overall market context is very good. We have the leading platform, and we have a new product, new steerable sheath coming this year and the next-gen WATCHMAN platform coming about a year from now. So we have a differentiated pipeline as well. Neo2 is doing extremely well in Europe. We just launched -- or just having some implementation of our XL valves. That's part of the U.S. trial. There was, I think, some -- a bit of inaccurate reporting on that one. We do not expect that XL to slow down the approval process for the U.S. So that does not have an impact on U.S. approval. And that XL valve is important because it's about a one-third of the procedures are using that size valve in Europe. So we're doing quite well, growing faster than market in Europe without that, and eventually, we'll be adding that to approval. So we're excited about that. ACURATE neo2, we expect it to be approved in 2024 in the U.S. Yes. So on Apollo Endosurgery overall, it's really consistent with our overall strategy of category leadership, which is driving above-market growth and continuing to advance new therapies where we can be the leader. When we look at endoluminal surgery, we think that is really the next frontier for our endo business. And you see a terrific uptake of endoluminal surgery, I would say, outside the U.S., particularly in Japan, a bit more so in Europe and less so in U.S. And so we think endoluminal surgery will really continue to build momentum over the next coming years and Apollo is a platform that's most used by physicians pick outside the U.S. to perform these procedures with a product called OverStitch and xTAC. So we think the addition of Apollo into our current platform will obviously make us the number one strongest endoluminal surgery portfolio, but also put us in a position, as Dr. Duncan would say, to help train the field because these are procedures that require significant physician training to get great outcomes, and we'll be able to do that with the Apollo platform. On SOLIS with SCS, again, we did see some improvement in that overall SCS business in the fourth quarter, growing 4% in the quarter. SOLIS, we're pleased with the three-month results that we expected. We expect indication and approval for nonsurgical back by the year-end of 2023."

At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments.\nMike Mahoney: Thanks, Lauren, and thank you, everyone, for joining us here today. We're very proud of our performance in the third quarter, particularly in light of the ongoing macroeconomic and supply chain headwinds. Our performance continues to be supported by the strength and diversification of our innovative portfolio and the winning spirit of our global team. Third quarter 2022 total company operational sales grew 14% versus prior year and organic sales grew 11.5%, which does exceed the high end of our guidance range of 8% to 10%. This performance is a testament to our category leadership strategy and focus on innovation with strong commercial execution. Six of eight of our business units grew double-digits organically and we believe that nearly all of our businesses and regions grew faster than their respective markets. Third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.43 grew 6.3% versus prior year at the low end of our guidance range of $0.43 to $0.45, attributable to increased FX headwinds and slightly higher spend within the quarter. We have grown 9.2% organically year-to-date through third quarter. And in light of this performance, we are increasing our full year 2022 guidance for operational growth to approximately 11.5% and organic growth to approximately 9%. For fourth quarter 2022 revenue, we're guiding to operational growth of 8.5% to 10.5% and organic growth of 7% to 9%. We're also updating our full year 2022 adjusted EPS guidance to $1.71 to $1.74, primarily related to the ongoing headwind from foreign exchange. Our fourth quarter 2022 adjusted EPS estimate is $0.45 to $0.48. Throughout 2022, we have maintained our goal to improve operating margins. While our goal remains, we feel it's prudent to provide an updated adjusted operating margin target of approximately 26% considering the continued macroeconomic pressures. On a full year basis, this does represent approximately 70 basis points of margin expansion versus our 2021 rate of 25.3%. I'll now provide additional third quarter highlights along with some comments on future outlook. Regionally, the US delivered operational growth of 12% versus prior year. Strong growth was realized across most all of our business units, particularly cardiovascular and endoscopy, and included an approximate 300 basis point tailwind from acquisitions. Middle East -- I'm sorry, Europe, Middle East, and Africa grew 15% on an operational basis versus prior year. We continue to see excellent execution fueled by our innovative portfolio with seven of the eight business units growing double-digits. Sales growth accelerated within our growth in emerging market countries within Europe, with notable strength across cardiology and peripheral interventions. In Asia-Pac, we grew 15% operationally with strong growth in China, India, and ASEAN countries. While our Japan results saw some impact from COVID within the quarter, we continue to see strength driven by new products, including POLARx, WATCHMAN, FLX and Rezum. Our team in China delivered excellent results in the third quarter with growth of 36%. Growth is primarily driven by our ICTx business within cardiovascular, PI and our CRM business units, supported by new and ongoing product launches across the portfolio. Turning to Latin America. The team executed another exceptional quarter, growing 29% operationally. All business units in major markets grew double-digits in the third quarter and across the portfolio. More than 10 new products were launched enabled by remote training and support. I'll now provide some thoughts on our business units, starting with Urology and Public Health, which grew organic sales 13% and 16% on an operational basis. The stone management, prosthetic urology, and prostate health franchises all grew double-digits in the third quarter, with balanced performance across the regions. We continue to focus on global expansion and are pleased to have received approval and commenced the launches of SpaceOAR in both Korea and Mexico and Rezum in Japan. Our Lumenis acquisition did turn organic in September and we remain excited about the global opportunity ahead with the Moses Laser Technology, LithoVue Single-Use Flexible Ureteroscopes, and our broad portfolio of stone management products. In Endoscopy, sales grew 10% organically. This category-leading business continues to focus on product innovations, enhanced by best-in-class physician education and training. Growth in the quarter was driven by our biliary and single-use imaging franchises with ongoing market development activities, enabling increased utilization of EXALT-D and other key products. In Neuromodulation, organic revenue grew 3%. Our pain franchise sales were flat year-over-year, below our expectations, with ongoing reimbursement challenges impacting US procedures for both Vertiflex and Spinal Cord Stimulation. In SCS, while international growth was very strong, with broad demand for WaveWriter Alpha, our US SCS sales were impacted by preauthorization denials despite strong patient demand and ongoing physician interest in our fast therapy. We have a team in place focused on supporting the preauthorization documentation requirements. However, we do anticipate that challenges will continue to persist in the fourth quarter. In Deep Brain Stimulation, the US, EMEA and LatAm regions grew double digits in the third quarter. Globally, we're seeing stable underlying DBS procedure growth, and we continue to see momentum in the US as we moved into full launch of our STIMVIEW XT integrated imaging and programming platforms. Cardiology delivered another excellent quarter, with organic sales growing 13% and operational sales growing 16%. Within cardiology, interventional cardiology therapies, organic sales grew 11%. This coronary therapies franchise performed well in third quarter, driven by strong performance in our international regions, particularly with our differentiated imaging franchise. Importantly, we recently completed enrollment in our AGENT IDE trial. This is the very first US trial for a coronary drug-coated balloon to treat in-stent restenosis. And we expect to launch in Japan in 2023, in the US in 2024. Our structural heart valves franchise did grow double digits in the third quarter again, with continued strength in Europe with our ACURATE neo2 TAVR platform. Additionally, results from the PROTECTED TAVR trial were presented as a late breaker at TCT. Recall the PROTECTED TAVR trial studied our cerebral embolic protection device, SENTINEL, with TAVR versus unprotected TAVR. With a reduction in the primary endpoint of overall stroke -- while the reduction in the primary endpoint of overall stroke did not reach statistical significance, a secondary analysis demonstrated a clinically meaningful 63% relative risk reduction in severe disabling stroke. Turning to WATCHMAN. Organic sales grew 26% in third quarter. Global growth continues to be very strong, further supported by the US FDA approval of an expanded label to include DAPT, giving physicians and patients choice of DAPT or OAC in the first 45 days post implant. We continue to focus on innovation in this space, with a Trusteer, which is our new steerable sheath and we also highlighted our next-generation FLX device, WATCHMAN FLX PRO at our TCT investor event in September. We expect FLX PRO to build on our second-generation FLX with additional sizes in the device coding designed to enhance healing. In Cardiac Rhythm Management, organic sales grew 7% versus prior year. We had another strong quarter of performance, as we continue to focus on lifetime patient management from diagnostics to implant with our broad portfolio. Within core CRM, our low-voltage franchise grew mid-single digits and high-voltage grew low single digits. Our diagnostics franchise continues to perform very well. We're pleased to have received CE Mark for our implantable cardiac monitor, LUX-Dx, and we have commenced our commercial launch. Electrophysiology sales grew 26% on an organic basis and 83% on an operational basis. We continue to see strength in our comprehensive international portfolio, which grew 45% organically. And this includes two months of contribution from FARAPULSE. Physician demand for POLARx in Japan and FARAPULSE and POLARx in Europe remains very strong, and we continue to see increased utilization at existing centers, while we are expanding into new accounts. In addition, we're pleased to have launched FARAPULSE in Australia and Singapore under special access, and we anticipate approval in 2023. The Baylis integration continues to go well with the differentiated Transseptal access portfolio growing double-digits in the quarter and remains on track to achieve our full year expectations. In Peripheral Interventions, organic sales grew 12% with broad growth across all major franchises and regions. In Arterial, our differentiated drug-eluting portfolio grew double-digits in the quarter and we received FDA approval for a line extension of ELUVIA and commenced launch of the longest length of drug eluting stent for peripheral arterial disease in the US. The Interventional Oncology business had another very strong quarter with great growth and continued strength in our cancer therapies, ICX and TheraSphere. We're pleased to have closed on the acquisition of Obsidio and the gel embolic material technology. Obsidio is the first gel embolic with an indication for the peripheral vasculature and a complementary addition to our portfolio. We look forward to launching this technology within the US in 2023. In alignment with our overall commitment to progress our environment, social and governance efforts, the PI division announced collaboration with a healthcare data platform, TruVida, aiming to provide insights to help better address healthcare disparities within various PI disease states. We remain committed to driving sustainable innovation to Boston Scientific. And despite the persistent macroeconomic pressures, we continue to invest for the long-term in R&D, execute strategic tuck-in M&A with a focus on improving patient outcomes today and into the future. We're also excited about the opportunities ahead and remain focused on our long-term financial goals, continuing to grow sales faster than the markets, operating margin expansion, double-digit adjusted EPS growth and strong adjusted free cash flow generation. Before I turn it over to Dan, I do want to take a moment to share that our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Ian Meredith, will be retiring in April of 2023. We're extremely grateful for his strong contributions, particularly as dedication to patients, clinical science and meaningful innovation. And it's a great sense of humor. With that, I'll now turn things over to Dan to review our financial performance in more detail.\nDan Brennan: Thanks, Mike. Third quarter consolidated revenue of $3,170 million, represents 8.1% reported revenue growth versus third quarter 2021 and reflects a $162 million headwind from foreign exchange, higher than our expectations due to the continued strength of the US dollar. Excluding this 550 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, operational revenue growth was 13.7% in the quarter. Sales from the acquisitions of FARAPULSE through July, Lumenis through August and Baylis contributed 220 basis points resulting in 11.5% organic revenue growth, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of 8% to 10% growth versus 2021. Continued foreign exchange headwinds and slightly higher spend on R&D investment across the portfolio largely offset our top line outperformance, resulting in Q3 adjusted earnings per share of $0.43, achieving the low end of our guidance range, representing 6.3% growth versus 2021. Adjusted gross margin for the third quarter was 70.7% in line with our expectations. The macroeconomic environment continues to be challenging, particularly related to inflationary pressures and availability of materials, which have largely offset a slight improvement in freight costs. For full year 2022, we continue to expect adjusted gross margin to be slightly below 70.8%, which includes $375 million in macroeconomic headwinds versus 2019. These headwinds are predominantly from increased freight costs and unfavorable manufacturing variances, primarily related to direct material cost and availability with a smaller portion attributable to increased labor costs. Recall, unfavorable manufacturing variances are recognized over approximately six months, in line with our inventory turns. Third quarter adjusted operating margin was 25.5%, slightly lower than our expectations. We continue to focus on our global goal of operating margin expansion, but believe it is prudent to update our operating margin target to allow for the flexibility to weigh near-term spend discipline with investments to continue to fuel top line growth. We now expect full year adjusted operating margin to be approximately 26%. One-time charges within the quarter's results included a minor write-off related to the discontinuation of our SAVAL program. In addition, we recognized a GAAP charge attributable to an intangible asset impairment of $125 million primarily related to Vertiflex as the business continues to face reimbursement challenges impacting the revenue outlook for the product. On a GAAP basis, the third quarter operating margin was 11.3%. Moving to below the line. Adjusted interest and other expense totaled $91 million in Q3, higher than our expectations driven in part by FX losses from certain unhedged currencies. Our tax rate for the third quarter was 11.9% on an adjusted basis, including discrete tax items and the benefit from stock compensation accounting. Excluding these items, our operational tax rate was 14%, in line with expectations. We ended Q3 with 1,440 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $626 million and free cash flow $320 million, with $470 million from operating activities less $150 million net capital expenditures. We now expect our full year 2022 adjusted free cash flow to be approximately $2 billion. Our total legal reserve as of September 30th was $304 million, a decrease of $210 million versus June 30th, primarily related to mesh and certain IP litigation payments. As of September 30, 2022, we had cash on hand of $338 million. Our top priority for capital allocation remains high quality tuck-in M&A and we'll continue to assess opportunities in conjunction with our financial goals. As of September 30th, our leverage was 2.5 times, and we now expect year-end leverage to be at or slightly below 2.5 times. I'll now walk through guidance for Q4 and the full year 2022. We expect full year 2022 operational revenue growth to be approximately 11.5% versus 2021, which excludes an approximate 500 basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates, 100 basis points higher than our previous expectations. Excluding a 250 basis point contribution from the acquisitions of Preventice, FARAPULSE, Lumenis and Baylis, and $13 million of pre-divestiture specialty pharmaceutical sales in 2021, we now expect full year 2022 organic revenue growth to be approximately 9% versus 2021, reflecting our strong Q4 performance and confidence in continued consistent procedural growth. We expect fourth quarter 2022 operational revenue growth to be in a range of 8.5% to 10.5% versus 2021, which excludes an approximate 650 basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates. Excluding a 150 basis point contribution from the acquisition of Baylis, we expect fourth quarter 2022 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 7% to 9%. We continue to expect our full year 2022 adjusted below-the-line expenses to be approximately $350 million. Full year 2022 operational tax rate expectations remain unchanged at approximately 14%, with an adjusted tax rate of approximately 13%, including the benefit of the accounting standard for stock compensation and discrete tax items recognized year-to-date. Our tax rate expectations reflect current legislation, including a provision on the treatment of R&D expenditures. We continue to believe there's bipartisan support to reverse this provision. And if such legislation were to be enacted, we would expect our full year tax rate to revert to its historical range of approximately 11% operational and 10% adjusted. We expect a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1,443 million shares for Q4 2022 and 1,440 million shares for the full year 2022. Our long-term hedging strategy continues to be effective at minimizing FX impact on EPS, and we are largely hedged through 2023. At current rates, we now anticipate FX headwinds on our full year 2022 adjusted earnings per share of $0.06, which is $0.03 unfavorable versus previous expectations due to the continued strengthening of the US dollar. As a result, we are updating our full year adjusted earnings per share range to $1.71 to $1.74, representing 5% to 7% growth versus 2021. We expect fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.45 to $0.48. One quick housekeeping item before I turn it back over to Lauren. We continue to expect full year 2022 preferred stock dividend expense of approximately $55 million related to our May 2020 mandatory convertible preferred stock offering using the if-converted method. These shares will mature on June 1st, 2023, at which point the dividend expense will retire and our share count will increase based on our share price at the time of conversion. In each of the conversion scenarios, the resulting impact to EPS should be immaterial. For more information, please check our Investor Relations website for Q3 2022 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more details on Q3 results and the MCPS share conversion. In closing, I'm proud of the results we've achieved year-to-date with continued revenue momentum. And despite a challenging macroeconomic environment, we remain focused on operating margin expansion balanced with investment in our innovative portfolio to drive continued above-market top line growth. And with that, I'll turn it back to Lauren, who will moderate the Q& A.\nLauren Tengler: Thank you, Dan. Andrew, let's open it up to questions for the next 35 minutes or so. [Operator Instructions] Andrew, please go ahead.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Please, go ahead.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a great top line quarter. I'll also add congratulations to Dr. Meredith on a very well-deserved retirement. Maybe for my question, it really was a strong top line, double digits organic. Fourth quarter continues to look good in guidance. I think the one area where we've seen a little pressure is on margins. So, Dan, I was hoping you might be able to give us an early look into next year, how elevated is the spending. There's a lot of moving pieces with OpEx and currency and the share count. Do you think the Street's generally in a decent spot for next year with returning to more normalized margin expansion, or do you think it's still going to be a pressured year in 2023? Thanks.\nDan Brennan: Sure, Robbie. I think, obviously, early to comment on 2023 specifically. But I think I can probably give you some commentary that would be helpful. First, you mentioned share count. That shouldn't really be a driving factor, because I mentioned on the conversion of the MCPS, that, that shouldn't really impact next year's EPS once converted. Let me look at Q3 first, though. If you look at EPS for the quarter, given the reported revenue at the high end of the range, it's probably reasonable to expect that we would have been at the high end of the EPS range, which was $0.43 to $0.45. We achieved $0.43, which is $0.02 lower than the 45. $0.01 of that is from the incremental FX headwind and $0.01 is from lower operating income percentage versus expectations in the quarter. I think the FX impact, I think, is well understood, given the strengthening of the US dollar, so not a lot of additional commentary there. Relative to our operating income percentage, the goal is to be 26% for the full year. And this involves balancing certain initiatives to reduce expenses in the short term to offset the supply chain and inflation headwinds, while at the same time, continuing to fuel our top line, which has been performing very well. If you look at the P&L components of a 26% adjusted margin scenario in 2022, it would likely have gross margin higher than 2021, SG&A lower than 2021 and R&D slightly higher than 2021. And we think this is appropriate. And keep in mind, as Mike said, this would be 70 basis points higher than the 2021 adjusted operating income margin full year of 25.3% and in line with the 2021 second half and importantly, in line with 2019 full year while absorbing $375 million of supply chain and inflation headwinds compared to 2019. So I feel very good about how we're balancing that and looking at that 26% as a very successful number for the year. Specific to 2023, again, our goal is always to continue to increase operating margin, long-standing goal of doing that 50 basis points per year. If you look at the 25.3 last year, we'll be 70 basis points, as I said, advanced on that in 2022 if we hit that 26. And then even with where we were in 2019 and the second half. So more to come as we evolve and deliver guidance likely in that February timeframe, but I feel good where we are in 2022 and look forward to continuing the journey in 2023 and beyond.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Appreciate the color. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please, go ahead.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask about Neuromodulation. Mike, could you talk a little bit more about the reimbursement challenges there? What channels are you seeing that in? And it seems like all your businesses are consistently growing around the corporate growth rate except Neuromodulation. So what's the plan to accelerate the growth in that business? And let me just also extend my congratulations to Dr. Meredith, and I wholeheartedly agree with your comments earlier, especially about his sense of humor. Thanks for taking the questions.\nMike Mahoney: Larry, yes, we're quite proud of the performance nearly every business grew double-digits and faster than the peer group and every region as well. You saw the growth in Europe and China all over. So we're quite proud of the results in the quarter and really through the year. Neuromod, they're really broken down in two pieces. The deep brain stimulation franchise is doing extremely well, growing strong double-digits, US, Europe, and a nice pipeline. And we're not seeing really some of the macro headwinds in the DBS business. On the spinal cord stimulation business, as you know, this market has been tough to call. Really over the past few years during the pandemic. And now as we're essentially hopefully getting out of the pandemic. The markets, we think, in the low single-digits to potentially mid-single-digit range now. So it has come down a bit in terms of the overall market growth rate, we believe. What's hurting the market, not necessarily Boston Scientific as you've seen some competitive results already, and you've seen this trend throughout the year, has been in the spinal cord stimulation market in the US. And we're seeing more preauthorization denials in the US. We are seeing strong patient funnels. So our team is essentially really focused on building additional capabilities to help our physician customers manage those preauthorization trials. These patients need the products. The products obviously work. I think it's more of an industry challenge right now. And we're working with them to streamline that authorization process to get patients through the funnel and position to get paid. So we do anticipate that headwind will persist in fourth quarter. Hopefully, it will get better in 2023. Us, like our competitors, will have easy comps in 2023 based on this so that helps mathematically. But fundamentally, we need to improve the -- help our patients and customers with this preauthorization hiccups and some of the capabilities we're building into the system with that. But I think it's more a class issue right now than a Boston Scientific issue.\nLarry Biegelsen: Thank you so much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citi. Please go ahead.\nJoanne Wuensch: Sorry, Thank you very much for taking the questions. Can we spend a little bit of time on WATCHMAN franchise? You've had over the last 12 months, increased competition but an improved label and sort of broader geographic reach. Can you pick apart how those segments are going or how those headwinds and maybe not headwinds are impacting the franchise? Thanks.\nMike Mahoney: Sure. The WATCHMAN business had a terrific quarter. It grew 26%. The bulk of that growth coming from the US. We have launched recently in Japan, albeit a bit slower given the COVID situation there and the need for more proctoring, but that should have a bigger impact for us in 2023. Similar results in China, I would say same commentary. A bit slower out of the gate given some of the COVID restrictions, but should get better in 2023. We've also continued to gain share in Europe, which I think is important. But by far, the most important market is the US and the team there has done an excellent job. It's really a comment similar to previous calls. You did call out the DAPT label. That did have some additional momentum for us in third quarter as some physicians, kind of, converted back to WATCHMAN FLX now that we've had that label. And really, it's the consistent ease of use, the safety benefits, and the support that the implanting cardiologist or EP is receiving from the refer. The referring community is getting more and more confident in WATCHMAN, in particular, each quarter. And so we expect the market to continue to be quite healthy. We're calling it roughly 30% growth. We're investing in the clinical trials that you're aware of with option and champion to further widen the market opportunity for it. And we have a very strong pipeline of new products coming behind what is already differentiated from our competitor WATCHMAN FLX product. So, we think we're in a really good position here and we're going to continue to grow the market and invest to have this be one of our top growth drivers.\nJoanne Wuensch: Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nVijay Kumar: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Dan, maybe 1 for you on the financial side here. I think the 26% operating margin for the year, that would imply Q4, the pretty steep ramp in Q4. Are we thinking about margins the right way? And when you think about those margins, what should FX impact be for next year at current rates? Anything to think about balance sheet inventories, which have been capitalized that flowing through the P&L for next year, any impact for 2022? Thank you.\nDan Brennan: Relative to -- say that again, Vijay?\nVijay Kumar: I meant the inventory impact for 2023, sorry. Not 2022.\nDan Brennan: Yes, right, got that. Specific to Q4, so your math is right, right? We're 25.5% year-to-date adjusted operating margin. So it implies a 27.5% for the fourth quarter to get to the full year 26%. We believe we have the plans in place to do that. There's a bit of a seasonality that helps if you look back over the past few years, Q4 is usually the highest margin quarter we have, both gross and operating. So, we're looking for that trend to continue here in Q4. So -- but yes, it requires a strong Q4, but we believe we have the plans in place to deliver that. Specific to 2023, I probably can be a little bit helpful on that. I think somewhat unique to us in our hedging program, we do hedge out multiple years in that program. So, as I mentioned in my commentary, we are largely hedged for 2023. So, if rates were to stay where they are today, I think you'd likely see an impact in 2023 of pretty similar to what you see this year on earnings per share. Recall, at the operating margin percentage level, you don't see much benefit from FX. You see that in the gross margin. But then because our -- the majority of our OpEx dollars are dollar-denominated, you lose that in the OpEx section of the P&L. So, the operating margin contribution from FX is very minor. So, not much to talk about there. But relative to EPS impact, I would say, likely similar to what you see this year, assuming rates remain constant.\nVijay Kumar: Thanks guys.\nDan Brennan: Thanks Vijay\nOperator: The next question comes from Travis Steed with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nTravis Steed: Hey for the question. Also congrats to Ian Meredith. So I might have missed it earlier, but can you remind us again the moving parts on what drove the higher OpEx and the lower op margin guide for 2022 versus three months ago? Just as a quick clarification. And then the question I was going to ask was more on the Analyst Day last year. You were committed to a double-digit EPS growth CAGR. This year, you're closer to 7%. Is that double-digit EPS CAGR still good? And in the starting point for 2023 and still be in that double-digit range, given the macro pressures that we're in?\nDan Brennan: Yes, on the double-digit earnings per share, that's always been our growth goal, and we've achieved that many years. The issue this year is a change in tax legislation that went into effect in January. And that is about $0.06 overall for the year. So if that were the old legislation, we'd be solidly double digits. It's a provision on the amortization of R&D within tax. And so, that's really the kind of the stick and the spokes of getting to double digits this year. Double digit remains our goal going forward as we talked about at Investor Day. And then your first question was...?\nMike Mahoney: I'll just comment. There's a lot of focus on with AdvaMed society and others on advocating for that R&D amortization to reverse. So that is a one-timer that will annualize in 2023. And if you neutralize that and some of the FX were strong double digits for the year.\nTravis Steed: That\u2019s helpful. And if you could just remind us the moving parts on the 2022 margin guide, exactly what the higher OpEx and what drove the change in op margin again. I may have missed that earlier.\nDan Brennan: Yes, it's really. It's really just a balance within the P&L. So if you think of where we are versus 2021, you'll see higher gross margin, you'll see lower SG&A and you'll see slightly higher R&D. So we're balancing the P&L to try and offset the $375 million of headwinds that we have versus 2019. And just maintaining the appropriate level of spend in that R&D line to continue to fuel the top line. So that's really the only tweak within there. So making sure that we fuel the top line, while still trying to offset the supply chain and inflationary headwinds.\nTravis Steed: Great. And congrats on another good top line.\nDan Brennan: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Cecilia Furlong with Morgan Stanley. Please, go ahead.\nCecilia Furlong: Great. Good morning and thank you for taking the questions. Just wanted to ask a bit more color on what you saw exiting September versus July and August across your portfolio. And then, looking at the 4Q guide, if you could just walk through your expectations, either US, OUS, what you're looking at for China. And then just expected either seasonality. Any impact from deductibles. Anything you would call out specifically that you incorporated in the 4Q guide. And thanks for taking the question.\nDan Brennan: Yes. I don't think we're going to get into the specifics of the quarter. I mean, we're -- I think the revenue results stand on their own. We're super proud of the 11.5% organic growth in the quarter. So I think that speaks for itself. Relative to Q4, obviously, we're giving guidance today. We know where we are through October through -- where we are in October. And Neuromod, as Mike said, Neuromod is probably a bit challenged in Q4 versus what we might have expected 90 days ago. But the rest of the business has tremendous momentum. And again, super proud of the 11.5% that we delivered in Q3, again, with most of those businesses in double digits.\nMike Mahoney: Yes. You asked about the regions. You saw the US performance in third quarter and for the full year is quite strong, but also a particular strength in Europe and Asia-Pac. And our China business grew over 30% in the quarter. It's done extremely well this year based on the diversification of the portfolio and the product launches. And really the innovation of the team in China. And also shout out to the European team in a very mature market, continues to grow double-digits in the kind of Western more established markets and very strong double-digits in the emerging markets there. So, you're seeing really balanced growth across each region throughout the year. And many of those products, as I mentioned in the script, in Europe, particularly in EP, we're working on clinical trials to get these products through and improved in the US.\nCecilia Furlong: Great. Thanks for taking the question.\nMike Mahoney: You are welcome.\nOperator: The next question comes from Rick Wise with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nRick Wise: Hi Mike, hi Dan. Two questions. Maybe just on the recovery, just one large picture and one product question. On the recovery, I'm very -- obviously, FX is a notable factor that's going to continue. But I'm curious to what extent are some of the other macro headwinds stabilizing or even improving particularly staffing. I keep saying myself if staffing were less of an issue, maybe you would have grown even more rapidly. Is staffing still an issue? Are things stabilizing in general on the freight and cost side are getting worse? And then I have a product follow-up question.\nMike Mahoney: Sure. On the hospital staffing, you've seen some of the big public companies, hospital change report. Maybe it's gotten incrementally better, but certainly still quite a challenge for hospitals. Despite that, the procedure volumes are quite healthy. Despite some of the staffing shortages, could they be a little bit better. If the shortage were improved likely. But they're doing a nice job of managing it. And it's forcing us to be innovative with them on reducing procedure times, which we continue to do, find ways through our portfolio. So, staffing may be slightly better, but still a very tough environment for hospitals. It might provide some upside over time as that gets better, but it's going to get better, more slowly, not overnight. And the other headwinds we talked about I think the $375 million-ish of incremental supply chain, bucketed supply chain costs versus 2019. And the biggest -- we are seeing some slight improvement in some of the freight areas, and we expect some slight improvements ongoing there in 2023. The bigger bucket that's most impactful is the product cost. The material cost, the supplies and raw materials that we purchase. And due to some of the shortages there we have tied up some longer term contracts to ensure supply, but those have come at more hefty price increases. So that bucket, we don't see getting better in 2023. So, we think we'll carry that forward in 2023 as you annualize those contracts. Some of the other areas will get more efficient the productivity of our manufacturing plants and so forth. So, as Dan mentioned, we expect to carry many of the supply chain headwinds primarily for material cost into our 2023 plans. But similar to this year, we did improve margins 70 bps versus 2021. Our goal will be to continue to improve margins in 2023 and manage through that.\nRick Wise: That's great, Mike. And just -- it's hard to resist asking about FARAPULSE. It sounds like things are going extremely well. Can you talk about drivers of the demand for FARAPULSE in Europe, maybe any incremental color on centers opened? And just maybe update us, remind us if everything is still on track for data -- US data readout in 2023 and approval in 2024? Thank you again.\nMike Mahoney: Thanks, Rick. I'll have Dr. Stein cover that one.\nKen Stein: Yes, sure, thanks, Mike, and thanks, Rick, for the question. We're very pleased with the commercial rollout in Europe to date, both in terms of continued procedure growth at the centers where we have opened and being able to open new centers as we continue the product launch. And I think that the drivers are really, what we've always said is the promise of the FARAPULSE technology, right? It's enhanced safety as compared to thermal ablation, it's proving to be at least as efficacious, if not more effective. And certainly, as Mike mentioned in terms of the issue with headwinds with staffing, it's a much more efficient procedure and really just couldn't be happier with what we're seeing in terms of outcomes in Europe to date. We have completed enrollment in our US IDE trial that was the ADVENT trial, and again, still on track to finish follow-up for the primary endpoint of that data in, sort of, midterm next year and then submit to the FDA and then it's all in the hands of the regulators.\nRick Wise: Thank you, very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Matthew O'Brien with Piper Jaffray. Please, go ahead.\nMatthew O'Brien: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. And let me offer my congratulations to Dr. Meredith as well on his retirement. Mike, it seems like you're taking a little bit of near-term pain right now to continue your spending in these growth areas, because you continue to be one of the faster growth, diversified med tech names out there. So I'm just curious, if you feel like that momentum is going to continue into 2023, where you can stay one of the faster growth, large-cap med tech names out there. And if it's going to be more of a broad-based level of improvement across all the different franchises where you can keep kind of growing in this double-digit range in some areas, or if it's going to be a little bit more focal than what we've seen historically. I don't know if it's specifically in cardiology or other areas. Thank you.\nMike Mahoney: Sure. What you've seen in the performance this year is pretty consistent across all of our divisions, six of eight grew double digits in the quarter. And you've seen similar performance throughout the year because of the innovation and commercial teams that we have. And our -- each quarter, as we mentioned many times, the lower growth markets, the mix of those businesses get smaller each quarter and we layer on M&A and new innovation to grow faster. So that's kind of our formula, and it's proven to work pretty well. As we look in some of the decisions that we make, we're very excited about the portfolio of significant launches that we have. Most of the significant -- very significant, move the needle launches are more in the 2024, 2025 period, and that's where you're seeing the great growth in Europe, whether it be our ACURATE neo valve, the Agent balloon that we're excited about, which we think will change really the script in coronary and that will launch next year in Japan. And as Dr. Stein just mentioned, our EP portfolio with FARAPULSE and cryo is doing exceptionally well outside the US, and we have other launches. So that does require quite a bit of R&D and clinical work. We'll be starting a persistent trial with FARAPULSE in the coming months here. So we think our R&D spend is appropriate to fuel that consistent above peer market growth over the LRP. In 2023, we'll give guidance in February. We will have a bit tougher comps in 2023 based on the performance of the estimated 9% growth this year. But if you look at -- we're excited what 2023 will bring, and we'll give more guidance there. But if you look at the company, and what we have for the future based on what we're seeing in Europe and the clinical science that we're delivering, whether it be in our Interventional Oncology business or EP business, we're quite confident in the next LRP that will consistently grow above peer group.\nOperator: The next question comes from Matt Taylor with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nMatt Taylor: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Can you hear me okay?\nDan Brennan: Yes, hear you fine Matt.\nMatt Taylor: Thanks Dan. Okay, so I wanted to circle back and just ask 1 about Q4. Just on the 7% to 9% organic versus the 11% plus that you did this quarter. Obviously, the comp is tougher. But is there anything else you call out there? Are you seeing anything slow down? Are you being conservative? Any highlights on just kind of the delta quarter-over-quarter?\nDan Brennan: I think it's really just the comp, which is the better part of 250 basis points more difficult. And Neuromod is lower than the average of the rest of the businesses. But as we've continued to say, six of eight double-digits in Q3, continued momentum with a lot of the good new product launches we have, both in the US and internationally. So, I think the business has great momentum. And I think once you clear for the comp, it's a great Q4. And if we delivered 9% organic revenue growth for the full year versus 2021, I think that will be a great year for the company.\nMatt Taylor: Great. Can I ask 1 follow-up? I just wanted to know, we heard more about pent-up demand signs from some of the other peers that have reported. Would you found that -- are you seeing signs of that start to come due? And how do you square that, I guess, with staffing getting slightly better? What are the things that, I guess, could release over the next couple of quarters to help with the volumes?\nDan Brennan: We think the volume is pretty good. And there is certainly pent-up demand, but it's been in the system for a while. You look at your typical backlog, whether it be a knee replacement or a Afib product or whatever, a men's health implant. Oftentimes, you're getting a 60 to 120-day wait in the US. And so there's certainly pent-up demand. But I don't see that getting cured in the near-term. I think there's just a very strong patient demand. There is a bit of a staffing shortage -- there's only so many labs that a hospital has to do procedures. And so we see pretty strong volume, which I guess is a good sign for the future here despite some of the staffing shortages and just hospitals extremely busy, lab time very busy and demand that outstrips their supply in many cases that drive the waitlist. But we don't see that waitlist dramatically changing in the coming months.\nMatt Taylor: Thanks Mike, thanks Dan.\nOperator: The next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nPito Chickering: Hey good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. Now, it's been a while since the last COVID spike. Have you seen the funnel for patients to get procedures normalize across your product portfolio versus pre COVID levels? Are you seeing any bottlenecks within that funnel as you think about your organic growth? And just to be clear, this isn't about necessarily nurse staffing and hospitals, but all the touch points across health care systems.\nMike Mahoney: Yes, I think -- thank you. I think it's similar to the last response. It depends on the region of the world. We did see a slowdown in third quarter in Japan. And you see pockets in China and sometimes pockets all over the world depending on what happens with COVID. But overall, that's been smoothed out with the underlying pretty good procedure growth and us doing a bit better. And so again, I think as you look to fourth quarter and 2023 here, staffing shortage still is an issue. It's not going to be resolved in 2023. Hospitals are being very innovative to try to shore that up. But a strong patient demand, common to see longer wait list. So, we do see pretty consistent demand, but we don't see a quick fix for the staffing shortage. But the underlying demand still strong despite that.\nPito Chickering: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Pasquale with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nChris Pasquale: I wanted to follow up on the increased prior of denials in Neuromod. You talked about helping physicians with documentation, but what about addressing the underlying payer reticence to allow access to those therapies? Do you think more clinical data can help? And what had you had planned on that front?\nMike Mahoney: I'm really much more to comment on. The team does quite a bit with our clinical studies that we do for product approvals. It's a well-accepted therapy across -- it's been -- it's a pretty mature market in terms of number of competitors and clinical science that's actually increased quite a bit the last few years. Part of it is the payers. We certainly work with our hema teams to contact those payers directly and reemphasize that clinical evidence. But it's really a bit of just some of the recent preauthorization denials that just need to be worked through in terms of their efficiency. And we aim to improve that process.\nChris Pasquale: Got you. Okay.\nMike Mahoney: I don't think it's related to any -- it's not related -- the slowdown is not related to any poor clinical data. There's good clinical data at Boston Scientific and our peer group and it's well established by the implanter, whether it be a pain physician or an orthopedic physician. It's well proven out. I think it's working through some of the mechanics of these preauthorization denials is the issue. But I also think overall, the market is a bit slower, even excluding that than it was historically.\nChris Pasquale: And then renal innovation is going to be a hot topic at AHA. Boston had a program there at one time with Vasix [ph]. How are you thinking about the potential of that therapy and Boston's ability to participate there as it does become a new growth driver in cardiology?\nMike Mahoney: Dr. Meredith, take that one.\nIan Meredith: Yes, thanks, Chris. It's a good question. Yes, we will see Medtronic hypertension study come out of AHA, and we just saw the RADIANCE II trial results come out the TCT with Ultrasound. This is a real therapy, and hypertension is an enormous cardiovascular problem globally, and we follow this space very carefully. This is a significant opportunity. Obviously, the results still could be improved. If you look, there's significant variability in the treated arm effect. And that probably reflects that we've got more to do to understand in whom we should be using this form of therapy. But it's a real opportunity. Hypertension is a massive cardiovascular problem. We follow the field very closely. It's one that we have to pay attention to.\nChris Pasquale: Thanks, and congrats, Dr. Meredith.\nIan Meredith: Thank you.\nOperator: And I understand there is time for one last question, and that would be from Matt Miksic with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMatt Miksic: Hey thanks so much for squeezing me in.\nMike Mahoney: Good morning Matt.\nMatt Miksic: Hey how are you? So, congrats on a really strong quarter, and Dr. Meredith, we'll certainly miss your insights and your cheerful disposition. And I guess I'm thankful to that we've got about six months to get to know this humorous side that everyone is referring to. So, I look forward to that. Just one follow-up, if I could, on margins. Dan, you talked about the impact of FX, and it seems like that explains pretty much the $0.03 reduction in EPS guide for the year. Just maybe one question on trajectory. It's such a strong Q3 here. You're adjusting Q4 for EPS and top end of the range for organic growth. That strikes me as a little bit conservative just given the strength, but I love your comment on that. And then maybe you're not talking much about 2023, but the shape of margins. I know there's been a lot of questions around how far into 2023 some of the higher costs will go. And if we were to think about -- is this sort of a front half, back half that we should be thinking about for 2023 at this point. Or I'm sure it's too early to say, but any insight you can give on how we should think about costs as they roll through inventory and P&L and so on? Thanks so much.\nDan Brennan: Sure, Matt. A lot to chew on in that question. So, the -- first, I agree with your assertion. The $1.71 to $1.74 from the $1.74 to $1.77 adjusted earnings per share guidance for the year, that is FX. That's down $0.03. FX is the FX impact on EPS was $0.03, it is now $0.06. So that is the difference for the $1.71 to $1.74 change in guidance. On the revenue for Q4, your comment that it appears conservative. I think it's appropriate. I think we've looked at all the different variables that are there, the momentum in the business and we think that the guidance we gave is appropriate. And I think for 2023, I think it's just a bit early. I mean I gave you a little bit of a teaser there on FX, given where we are with our hedging program. But I think other than that -- and obviously, that our goal is to continue to expand operating margin over time. But other than that, I'll probably just let you wait until we give guidance officially on all the specifics. But super excited about how the company has performed this year and look forward to continuing that trend in 2023 and beyond.\nLauren Tengler: All right. Thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Boston Scientific. If we were unable to get to your question or if you have any follow-ups, please don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team.

            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Third quarter consolidated revenue of $3,170 million, represents 8.1% reported revenue growth versus third quarter 2021 and reflects a $162 million headwind from foreign exchange, higher than our expectations due to the continued strength of the US dollar. Excluding this 550 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, operational revenue growth was 13.7% in the quarter. Sales from the acquisitions of FARAPULSE through July, Lumenis through August and Baylis contributed 220 basis points resulting in 11.5% organic revenue growth, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of 8% to 10% growth versus 2021. Continued foreign exchange headwinds and slightly higher spend on R&D investment across the portfolio largely offset our top line outperformance, resulting in Q3 adjusted earnings per share of $0.43, achieving the low end of our guidance range, representing 6.3% growth versus 2021. Adjusted gross margin for the third quarter was 70.7% in line with our expectations. The macroeconomic environment continues to be challenging, particularly related to inflationary pressures and availability of materials, which have largely offset a slight improvement in freight costs. For full year 2022, we continue to expect adjusted gross margin to be slightly below 70.8%, which includes $375 million in macroeconomic headwinds versus 2019. These headwinds are predominantly from increased freight costs and unfavorable manufacturing variances, primarily related to direct material cost and availability with a smaller portion attributable to increased labor costs. Recall, unfavorable manufacturing variances are recognized over approximately six months, in line with our inventory turns. Third quarter adjusted operating margin was 25.5%, slightly lower than our expectations. We continue to focus on our global goal of operating margin expansion, but believe it is prudent to update our operating margin target to allow for the flexibility to weigh near-term spend discipline with investments to continue to fuel top line growth. We now expect full year adjusted operating margin to be approximately 26%. One-time charges within the quarter's results included a minor write-off related to the discontinuation of our SAVAL program. In addition, we recognized a GAAP charge attributable to an intangible asset impairment of $125 million primarily related to Vertiflex as the business continues to face reimbursement challenges impacting the revenue outlook for the product. On a GAAP basis, the third quarter operating margin was 11.3%. Moving to below the line. Adjusted interest and other expense totaled $91 million in Q3, higher than our expectations driven in part by FX losses from certain unhedged currencies. Our tax rate for the third quarter was 11.9% on an adjusted basis, including discrete tax items and the benefit from stock compensation accounting. Excluding these items, our operational tax rate was 14%, in line with expectations. We ended Q3 with 1,440 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $626 million and free cash flow $320 million, with $470 million from operating activities less $150 million net capital expenditures. We now expect our full year 2022 adjusted free cash flow to be approximately $2 billion. Our total legal reserve as of September 30th was $304 million, a decrease of $210 million versus June 30th, primarily related to mesh and certain IP litigation payments. As of September 30, 2022, we had cash on hand of $338 million. Our top priority for capital allocation remains high quality tuck-in M&A and we'll continue to assess opportunities in conjunction with our financial goals. As of September 30th, our leverage was 2.5 times, and we now expect year-end leverage to be at or slightly below 2.5 times. I'll now walk through guidance for Q4 and the full year 2022. We expect full year 2022 operational revenue growth to be approximately 11.5% versus 2021, which excludes an approximate 500 basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates, 100 basis points higher than our previous expectations. Excluding a 250 basis point contribution from the acquisitions of Preventice, FARAPULSE, Lumenis and Baylis, and $13 million of pre-divestiture specialty pharmaceutical sales in 2021, we now expect full year 2022 organic revenue growth to be approximately 9% versus 2021, reflecting our strong Q4 performance and confidence in continued consistent procedural growth. We expect fourth quarter 2022 operational revenue growth to be in a range of 8.5% to 10.5% versus 2021, which excludes an approximate 650 basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates. Excluding a 150 basis point contribution from the acquisition of Baylis, we expect fourth quarter 2022 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 7% to 9%. We continue to expect our full year 2022 adjusted below-the-line expenses to be approximately $350 million. Full year 2022 operational tax rate expectations remain unchanged at approximately 14%, with an adjusted tax rate of approximately 13%, including the benefit of the accounting standard for stock compensation and discrete tax items recognized year-to-date. Our tax rate expectations reflect current legislation, including a provision on the treatment of R&D expenditures. We continue to believe there's bipartisan support to reverse this provision. And if such legislation were to be enacted, we would expect our full year tax rate to revert to its historical range of approximately 11% operational and 10% adjusted. We expect a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1,443 million shares for Q4 2022 and 1,440 million shares for the full year 2022. Our long-term hedging strategy continues to be effective at minimizing FX impact on EPS, and we are largely hedged through 2023. At current rates, we now anticipate FX headwinds on our full year 2022 adjusted earnings per share of $0.06, which is $0.03 unfavorable versus previous expectations due to the continued strengthening of the US dollar. As a result, we are updating our full year adjusted earnings per share range to $1.71 to $1.74, representing 5% to 7% growth versus 2021. We expect fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.45 to $0.48. One quick housekeeping item before I turn it back over to Lauren. We continue to expect full year 2022 preferred stock dividend expense of approximately $55 million related to our May 2020 mandatory convertible preferred stock offering using the if-converted method. These shares will mature on June 1st, 2023, at which point the dividend expense will retire and our share count will increase based on our share price at the time of conversion. In each of the conversion scenarios, the resulting impact to EPS should be immaterial. For more information, please check our Investor Relations website for Q3 2022 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more details on Q3 results and the MCPS share conversion. In closing, I'm proud of the results we've achieved year-to-date with continued revenue momentum. And despite a challenging macroeconomic environment, we remain focused on operating margin expansion balanced with investment in our innovative portfolio to drive continued above-market top line growth. And with that, I'll turn it back to Lauren, who will moderate the Q& A. Sure, Robbie. I think, obviously, early to comment on 2023 specifically. But I think I can probably give you some commentary that would be helpful. First, you mentioned share count. That shouldn't really be a driving factor, because I mentioned on the conversion of the MCPS, that, that shouldn't really impact next year's EPS once converted. Let me look at Q3 first, though. If you look at EPS for the quarter, given the reported revenue at the high end of the range, it's probably reasonable to expect that we would have been at the high end of the EPS range, which was $0.43 to $0.45. We achieved $0.43, which is $0.02 lower than the 45. $0.01 of that is from the incremental FX headwind and $0.01 is from lower operating income percentage versus expectations in the quarter. I think the FX impact, I think, is well understood, given the strengthening of the US dollar, so not a lot of additional commentary there. Relative to our operating income percentage, the goal is to be 26% for the full year. And this involves balancing certain initiatives to reduce expenses in the short term to offset the supply chain and inflation headwinds, while at the same time, continuing to fuel our top line, which has been performing very well. If you look at the P&L components of a 26% adjusted margin scenario in 2022, it would likely have gross margin higher than 2021, SG&A lower than 2021 and R&D slightly higher than 2021. And we think this is appropriate. And keep in mind, as Mike said, this would be 70 basis points higher than the 2021 adjusted operating income margin full year of 25.3% and in line with the 2021 second half and importantly, in line with 2019 full year while absorbing $375 million of supply chain and inflation headwinds compared to 2019. So I feel very good about how we're balancing that and looking at that 26% as a very successful number for the year. Specific to 2023, again, our goal is always to continue to increase operating margin, long-standing goal of doing that 50 basis points per year. If you look at the 25.3 last year, we'll be 70 basis points, as I said, advanced on that in 2022 if we hit that 26. And then even with where we were in 2019 and the second half. So more to come as we evolve and deliver guidance likely in that February timeframe, but I feel good where we are in 2022 and look forward to continuing the journey in 2023 and beyond. Relative to -- say that again, Vijay? Yes, right, got that. Specific to Q4, so your math is right, right? We're 25.5% year-to-date adjusted operating margin. So it implies a 27.5% for the fourth quarter to get to the full year 26%. We believe we have the plans in place to do that. There's a bit of a seasonality that helps if you look back over the past few years, Q4 is usually the highest margin quarter we have, both gross and operating. So, we're looking for that trend to continue here in Q4. So -- but yes, it requires a strong Q4, but we believe we have the plans in place to deliver that. Specific to 2023, I probably can be a little bit helpful on that. I think somewhat unique to us in our hedging program, we do hedge out multiple years in that program. So, as I mentioned in my commentary, we are largely hedged for 2023. So, if rates were to stay where they are today, I think you'd likely see an impact in 2023 of pretty similar to what you see this year on earnings per share. Recall, at the operating margin percentage level, you don't see much benefit from FX. You see that in the gross margin. But then because our -- the majority of our OpEx dollars are dollar-denominated, you lose that in the OpEx section of the P&L. So, the operating margin contribution from FX is very minor. So, not much to talk about there. But relative to EPS impact, I would say, likely similar to what you see this year, assuming rates remain constant. Thanks Vijay Yes, on the double-digit earnings per share, that's always been our growth goal, and we've achieved that many years. The issue this year is a change in tax legislation that went into effect in January. And that is about $0.06 overall for the year. So if that were the old legislation, we'd be solidly double digits. It's a provision on the amortization of R&D within tax. And so, that's really the kind of the stick and the spokes of getting to double digits this year. Double digit remains our goal going forward as we talked about at Investor Day. And then your first question was...? Yes, it's really. It's really just a balance within the P&L. So if you think of where we are versus 2021, you'll see higher gross margin, you'll see lower SG&A and you'll see slightly higher R&D. So we're balancing the P&L to try and offset the $375 million of headwinds that we have versus 2019. And just maintaining the appropriate level of spend in that R&D line to continue to fuel the top line. So that's really the only tweak within there. So making sure that we fuel the top line, while still trying to offset the supply chain and inflationary headwinds. Thanks. Yes. I don't think we're going to get into the specifics of the quarter. I mean, we're -- I think the revenue results stand on their own. We're super proud of the 11.5% organic growth in the quarter. So I think that speaks for itself. Relative to Q4, obviously, we're giving guidance today. We know where we are through October through -- where we are in October. And Neuromod, as Mike said, Neuromod is probably a bit challenged in Q4 versus what we might have expected 90 days ago. But the rest of the business has tremendous momentum. And again, super proud of the 11.5% that we delivered in Q3, again, with most of those businesses in double digits. Yes, hear you fine Matt. I think it's really just the comp, which is the better part of 250 basis points more difficult. And Neuromod is lower than the average of the rest of the businesses. But as we've continued to say, six of eight double-digits in Q3, continued momentum with a lot of the good new product launches we have, both in the US and internationally. So, I think the business has great momentum. And I think once you clear for the comp, it's a great Q4. And if we delivered 9% organic revenue growth for the full year versus 2021, I think that will be a great year for the company. We think the volume is pretty good. And there is certainly pent-up demand, but it's been in the system for a while. You look at your typical backlog, whether it be a knee replacement or a Afib product or whatever, a men's health implant. Oftentimes, you're getting a 60 to 120-day wait in the US. And so there's certainly pent-up demand. But I don't see that getting cured in the near-term. I think there's just a very strong patient demand. There is a bit of a staffing shortage -- there's only so many labs that a hospital has to do procedures. And so we see pretty strong volume, which I guess is a good sign for the future here despite some of the staffing shortages and just hospitals extremely busy, lab time very busy and demand that outstrips their supply in many cases that drive the waitlist. But we don't see that waitlist dramatically changing in the coming months. Sure, Matt. A lot to chew on in that question. So, the -- first, I agree with your assertion. The $1.71 to $1.74 from the $1.74 to $1.77 adjusted earnings per share guidance for the year, that is FX. That's down $0.03. FX is the FX impact on EPS was $0.03, it is now $0.06.

            "content": "Thanks, Lauren, and thank you, everyone, for joining us here today. We're very proud of our performance in the third quarter, particularly in light of the ongoing macroeconomic and supply chain headwinds. Our performance continues to be supported by the strength and diversification of our innovative portfolio and the winning spirit of our global team. Third quarter 2022 total company operational sales grew 14% versus prior year and organic sales grew 11.5%, which does exceed the high end of our guidance range of 8% to 10%. This performance is a testament to our category leadership strategy and focus on innovation with strong commercial execution. Six of eight of our business units grew double-digits organically and we believe that nearly all of our businesses and regions grew faster than their respective markets. Third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.43 grew 6.3% versus prior year at the low end of our guidance range of $0.43 to $0.45, attributable to increased FX headwinds and slightly higher spend within the quarter. We have grown 9.2% organically year-to-date through third quarter. And in light of this performance, we are increasing our full year 2022 guidance for operational growth to approximately 11.5% and organic growth to approximately 9%. For fourth quarter 2022 revenue, we're guiding to operational growth of 8.5% to 10.5% and organic growth of 7% to 9%. We're also updating our full year 2022 adjusted EPS guidance to $1.71 to $1.74, primarily related to the ongoing headwind from foreign exchange. Our fourth quarter 2022 adjusted EPS estimate is $0.45 to $0.48. Throughout 2022, we have maintained our goal to improve operating margins. While our goal remains, we feel it's prudent to provide an updated adjusted operating margin target of approximately 26% considering the continued macroeconomic pressures. On a full year basis, this does represent approximately 70 basis points of margin expansion versus our 2021 rate of 25.3%. I'll now provide additional third quarter highlights along with some comments on future outlook. Regionally, the US delivered operational growth of 12% versus prior year. Strong growth was realized across most all of our business units, particularly cardiovascular and endoscopy, and included an approximate 300 basis point tailwind from acquisitions. Middle East -- I'm sorry, Europe, Middle East, and Africa grew 15% on an operational basis versus prior year. We continue to see excellent execution fueled by our innovative portfolio with seven of the eight business units growing double-digits. Sales growth accelerated within our growth in emerging market countries within Europe, with notable strength across cardiology and peripheral interventions. In Asia-Pac, we grew 15% operationally with strong growth in China, India, and ASEAN countries. While our Japan results saw some impact from COVID within the quarter, we continue to see strength driven by new products, including POLARx, WATCHMAN, FLX and Rezum. Our team in China delivered excellent results in the third quarter with growth of 36%. Growth is primarily driven by our ICTx business within cardiovascular, PI and our CRM business units, supported by new and ongoing product launches across the portfolio. Turning to Latin America. The team executed another exceptional quarter, growing 29% operationally. All business units in major markets grew double-digits in the third quarter and across the portfolio. More than 10 new products were launched enabled by remote training and support. I'll now provide some thoughts on our business units, starting with Urology and Public Health, which grew organic sales 13% and 16% on an operational basis. The stone management, prosthetic urology, and prostate health franchises all grew double-digits in the third quarter, with balanced performance across the regions. We continue to focus on global expansion and are pleased to have received approval and commenced the launches of SpaceOAR in both Korea and Mexico and Rezum in Japan. Our Lumenis acquisition did turn organic in September and we remain excited about the global opportunity ahead with the Moses Laser Technology, LithoVue Single-Use Flexible Ureteroscopes, and our broad portfolio of stone management products. In Endoscopy, sales grew 10% organically. This category-leading business continues to focus on product innovations, enhanced by best-in-class physician education and training. Growth in the quarter was driven by our biliary and single-use imaging franchises with ongoing market development activities, enabling increased utilization of EXALT-D and other key products. In Neuromodulation, organic revenue grew 3%. Our pain franchise sales were flat year-over-year, below our expectations, with ongoing reimbursement challenges impacting US procedures for both Vertiflex and Spinal Cord Stimulation. In SCS, while international growth was very strong, with broad demand for WaveWriter Alpha, our US SCS sales were impacted by preauthorization denials despite strong patient demand and ongoing physician interest in our fast therapy. We have a team in place focused on supporting the preauthorization documentation requirements. However, we do anticipate that challenges will continue to persist in the fourth quarter. In Deep Brain Stimulation, the US, EMEA and LatAm regions grew double digits in the third quarter. Globally, we're seeing stable underlying DBS procedure growth, and we continue to see momentum in the US as we moved into full launch of our STIMVIEW XT integrated imaging and programming platforms. Cardiology delivered another excellent quarter, with organic sales growing 13% and operational sales growing 16%. Within cardiology, interventional cardiology therapies, organic sales grew 11%. This coronary therapies franchise performed well in third quarter, driven by strong performance in our international regions, particularly with our differentiated imaging franchise. Importantly, we recently completed enrollment in our AGENT IDE trial. This is the very first US trial for a coronary drug-coated balloon to treat in-stent restenosis. And we expect to launch in Japan in 2023, in the US in 2024. Our structural heart valves franchise did grow double digits in the third quarter again, with continued strength in Europe with our ACURATE neo2 TAVR platform. Additionally, results from the PROTECTED TAVR trial were presented as a late breaker at TCT. Recall the PROTECTED TAVR trial studied our cerebral embolic protection device, SENTINEL, with TAVR versus unprotected TAVR. With a reduction in the primary endpoint of overall stroke -- while the reduction in the primary endpoint of overall stroke did not reach statistical significance, a secondary analysis demonstrated a clinically meaningful 63% relative risk reduction in severe disabling stroke. Turning to WATCHMAN. Organic sales grew 26% in third quarter. Global growth continues to be very strong, further supported by the US FDA approval of an expanded label to include DAPT, giving physicians and patients choice of DAPT or OAC in the first 45 days post implant. We continue to focus on innovation in this space, with a Trusteer, which is our new steerable sheath and we also highlighted our next-generation FLX device, WATCHMAN FLX PRO at our TCT investor event in September. We expect FLX PRO to build on our second-generation FLX with additional sizes in the device coding designed to enhance healing. In Cardiac Rhythm Management, organic sales grew 7% versus prior year. We had another strong quarter of performance, as we continue to focus on lifetime patient management from diagnostics to implant with our broad portfolio. Within core CRM, our low-voltage franchise grew mid-single digits and high-voltage grew low single digits. Our diagnostics franchise continues to perform very well. We're pleased to have received CE Mark for our implantable cardiac monitor, LUX-Dx, and we have commenced our commercial launch. Electrophysiology sales grew 26% on an organic basis and 83% on an operational basis. We continue to see strength in our comprehensive international portfolio, which grew 45% organically. And this includes two months of contribution from FARAPULSE. Physician demand for POLARx in Japan and FARAPULSE and POLARx in Europe remains very strong, and we continue to see increased utilization at existing centers, while we are expanding into new accounts. In addition, we're pleased to have launched FARAPULSE in Australia and Singapore under special access, and we anticipate approval in 2023. The Baylis integration continues to go well with the differentiated Transseptal access portfolio growing double-digits in the quarter and remains on track to achieve our full year expectations. In Peripheral Interventions, organic sales grew 12% with broad growth across all major franchises and regions. In Arterial, our differentiated drug-eluting portfolio grew double-digits in the quarter and we received FDA approval for a line extension of ELUVIA and commenced launch of the longest length of drug eluting stent for peripheral arterial disease in the US. The Interventional Oncology business had another very strong quarter with great growth and continued strength in our cancer therapies, ICX and TheraSphere. We're pleased to have closed on the acquisition of Obsidio and the gel embolic material technology. Obsidio is the first gel embolic with an indication for the peripheral vasculature and a complementary addition to our portfolio. We look forward to launching this technology within the US in 2023. In alignment with our overall commitment to progress our environment, social and governance efforts, the PI division announced collaboration with a healthcare data platform, TruVida, aiming to provide insights to help better address healthcare disparities within various PI disease states. We remain committed to driving sustainable innovation to Boston Scientific. And despite the persistent macroeconomic pressures, we continue to invest for the long-term in R&D, execute strategic tuck-in M&A with a focus on improving patient outcomes today and into the future. We're also excited about the opportunities ahead and remain focused on our long-term financial goals, continuing to grow sales faster than the markets, operating margin expansion, double-digit adjusted EPS growth and strong adjusted free cash flow generation. Before I turn it over to Dan, I do want to take a moment to share that our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Ian Meredith, will be retiring in April of 2023. We're extremely grateful for his strong contributions, particularly as dedication to patients, clinical science and meaningful innovation. And it's a great sense of humor. With that, I'll now turn things over to Dan to review our financial performance in more detail. Larry, yes, we're quite proud of the performance nearly every business grew double-digits and faster than the peer group and every region as well. You saw the growth in Europe and China all over. So we're quite proud of the results in the quarter and really through the year. Neuromod, they're really broken down in two pieces. The deep brain stimulation franchise is doing extremely well, growing strong double-digits, US, Europe, and a nice pipeline. And we're not seeing really some of the macro headwinds in the DBS business. On the spinal cord stimulation business, as you know, this market has been tough to call. Really over the past few years during the pandemic. And now as we're essentially hopefully getting out of the pandemic. The markets, we think, in the low single-digits to potentially mid-single-digit range now. So it has come down a bit in terms of the overall market growth rate, we believe. What's hurting the market, not necessarily Boston Scientific as you've seen some competitive results already, and you've seen this trend throughout the year, has been in the spinal cord stimulation market in the US. And we're seeing more preauthorization denials in the US. We are seeing strong patient funnels. So our team is essentially really focused on building additional capabilities to help our physician customers manage those preauthorization trials. These patients need the products. The products obviously work. I think it's more of an industry challenge right now. And we're working with them to streamline that authorization process to get patients through the funnel and position to get paid. So we do anticipate that headwind will persist in fourth quarter. Hopefully, it will get better in 2023. Us, like our competitors, will have easy comps in 2023 based on this so that helps mathematically. But fundamentally, we need to improve the -- help our patients and customers with this preauthorization hiccups and some of the capabilities we're building into the system with that. But I think it's more a class issue right now than a Boston Scientific issue. Sure. The WATCHMAN business had a terrific quarter. It grew 26%. The bulk of that growth coming from the US. We have launched recently in Japan, albeit a bit slower given the COVID situation there and the need for more proctoring, but that should have a bigger impact for us in 2023. Similar results in China, I would say same commentary. A bit slower out of the gate given some of the COVID restrictions, but should get better in 2023. We've also continued to gain share in Europe, which I think is important. But by far, the most important market is the US and the team there has done an excellent job. It's really a comment similar to previous calls. You did call out the DAPT label. That did have some additional momentum for us in third quarter as some physicians, kind of, converted back to WATCHMAN FLX now that we've had that label. And really, it's the consistent ease of use, the safety benefits, and the support that the implanting cardiologist or EP is receiving from the refer. The referring community is getting more and more confident in WATCHMAN, in particular, each quarter. And so we expect the market to continue to be quite healthy. We're calling it roughly 30% growth. We're investing in the clinical trials that you're aware of with option and champion to further widen the market opportunity for it. And we have a very strong pipeline of new products coming behind what is already differentiated from our competitor WATCHMAN FLX product. So, we think we're in a really good position here and we're going to continue to grow the market and invest to have this be one of our top growth drivers. I'll just comment. There's a lot of focus on with AdvaMed society and others on advocating for that R&D amortization to reverse. So that is a one-timer that will annualize in 2023. And if you neutralize that and some of the FX were strong double digits for the year. Yes. You asked about the regions. You saw the US performance in third quarter and for the full year is quite strong, but also a particular strength in Europe and Asia-Pac. And our China business grew over 30% in the quarter. It's done extremely well this year based on the diversification of the portfolio and the product launches. And really the innovation of the team in China. And also shout out to the European team in a very mature market, continues to grow double-digits in the kind of Western more established markets and very strong double-digits in the emerging markets there. So, you're seeing really balanced growth across each region throughout the year. And many of those products, as I mentioned in the script, in Europe, particularly in EP, we're working on clinical trials to get these products through and improved in the US. You are welcome. Sure. On the hospital staffing, you've seen some of the big public companies, hospital change report. Maybe it's gotten incrementally better, but certainly still quite a challenge for hospitals. Despite that, the procedure volumes are quite healthy. Despite some of the staffing shortages, could they be a little bit better. If the shortage were improved likely. But they're doing a nice job of managing it. And it's forcing us to be innovative with them on reducing procedure times, which we continue to do, find ways through our portfolio. So, staffing may be slightly better, but still a very tough environment for hospitals. It might provide some upside over time as that gets better, but it's going to get better, more slowly, not overnight. And the other headwinds we talked about I think the $375 million-ish of incremental supply chain, bucketed supply chain costs versus 2019. And the biggest -- we are seeing some slight improvement in some of the freight areas, and we expect some slight improvements ongoing there in 2023. The bigger bucket that's most impactful is the product cost. The material cost, the supplies and raw materials that we purchase. And due to some of the shortages there we have tied up some longer term contracts to ensure supply, but those have come at more hefty price increases. So that bucket, we don't see getting better in 2023. So, we think we'll carry that forward in 2023 as you annualize those contracts. Some of the other areas will get more efficient the productivity of our manufacturing plants and so forth. So, as Dan mentioned, we expect to carry many of the supply chain headwinds primarily for material cost into our 2023 plans. But similar to this year, we did improve margins 70 bps versus 2021. Our goal will be to continue to improve margins in 2023 and manage through that. Thanks, Rick. I'll have Dr. Stein cover that one. Sure. What you've seen in the performance this year is pretty consistent across all of our divisions, six of eight grew double digits in the quarter. And you've seen similar performance throughout the year because of the innovation and commercial teams that we have. And our -- each quarter, as we mentioned many times, the lower growth markets, the mix of those businesses get smaller each quarter and we layer on M&A and new innovation to grow faster. So that's kind of our formula, and it's proven to work pretty well. As we look in some of the decisions that we make, we're very excited about the portfolio of significant launches that we have. Most of the significant -- very significant, move the needle launches are more in the 2024, 2025 period, and that's where you're seeing the great growth in Europe, whether it be our ACURATE neo valve, the Agent balloon that we're excited about, which we think will change really the script in coronary and that will launch next year in Japan. And as Dr. Stein just mentioned, our EP portfolio with FARAPULSE and cryo is doing exceptionally well outside the US, and we have other launches. So that does require quite a bit of R&D and clinical work. We'll be starting a persistent trial with FARAPULSE in the coming months here. So we think our R&D spend is appropriate to fuel that consistent above peer market growth over the LRP. In 2023, we'll give guidance in February. We will have a bit tougher comps in 2023 based on the performance of the estimated 9% growth this year. But if you look at -- we're excited what 2023 will bring, and we'll give more guidance there. But if you look at the company, and what we have for the future based on what we're seeing in Europe and the clinical science that we're delivering, whether it be in our Interventional Oncology business or EP business, we're quite confident in the next LRP that will consistently grow above peer group. Yes, I think -- thank you. I think it's similar to the last response. It depends on the region of the world. We did see a slowdown in third quarter in Japan. And you see pockets in China and sometimes pockets all over the world depending on what happens with COVID. But overall, that's been smoothed out with the underlying pretty good procedure growth and us doing a bit better. And so again, I think as you look to fourth quarter and 2023 here, staffing shortage still is an issue. It's not going to be resolved in 2023. Hospitals are being very innovative to try to shore that up. But a strong patient demand, common to see longer wait list. So, we do see pretty consistent demand, but we don't see a quick fix for the staffing shortage. But the underlying demand still strong despite that. I'm really much more to comment on. The team does quite a bit with our clinical studies that we do for product approvals. It's a well-accepted therapy across -- it's been -- it's a pretty mature market in terms of number of competitors and clinical science that's actually increased quite a bit the last few years. Part of it is the payers. We certainly work with our hema teams to contact those payers directly and reemphasize that clinical evidence. But it's really a bit of just some of the recent preauthorization denials that just need to be worked through in terms of their efficiency. And we aim to improve that process. I don't think it's related to any -- it's not related -- the slowdown is not related to any poor clinical data. There's good clinical data at Boston Scientific and our peer group and it's well established by the implanter, whether it be a pain physician or an orthopedic physician. It's well proven out. I think it's working through some of the mechanics of these preauthorization denials is the issue. But I also think overall, the market is a bit slower, even excluding that than it was historically. Dr. Meredith, take that one. Good morning Matt."

We're very pleased with the commercial rollout in Europe to date, both in terms of continued procedure growth at the centers where we have opened and being able to open new centers as we continue the product launch. And I think that the drivers are really, what we've always said is the promise of the FARAPULSE technology, right? It's enhanced safety as compared to thermal ablation, it's proving to be at least as efficacious, if not more effective. And certainly, as Mike mentioned in terms of the issue with headwinds with staffing, it's a much more efficient procedure and really just couldn't be happier with what we're seeing in terms of outcomes in Europe to date. We have completed enrollment in our US IDE trial that was the ADVENT trial, and again, still on track to finish follow-up for the primary endpoint of that data in, sort of, midterm next year and then submit to the FDA and then it's all in the hands of the regulators."

This is a real therapy, and hypertension is an enormous cardiovascular problem globally, and we follow this space very carefully. This is a significant opportunity. Obviously, the results still could be improved. If you look, there's significant variability in the treated arm effect. And that probably reflects that we've got more to do to understand in whom we should be using this form of therapy. But it's a real opportunity. Hypertension is a massive cardiovascular problem. We follow the field very closely. It's one that we have to pay attention to. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to Apollo Endosurgery Second Quarter 2022 Results. At this time all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode and we will open the floor for your questions and comments after the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Matt Kreps. Sir, the floor is yours.\nMatt Kreps: Thank you, Matthew and thanks, everyone, for participating in today's call to discuss Apollo's second quarter 2022 financial and operating results. Joining me on the call are Chas McKhann, Chief Executive Officer; and Jeff Black, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will include slides to accompany the audio presentation. For those of you joining us by telephone only, you can download a copy of the slides at our Investor Relations site, ir.apolloendo.com, under Events and Presentations. Before we begin, I'd like to caution listeners that comments made by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, including Apollo's major outlook and Apollo's plans for timing -- for product development and sales. In addition, there is uncertainty about the continued spread of the COVID-19 virus and the ongoing impact it may have on our operations, the demand for our products, global supply chains and economic activity in general. These forward-looking statements involve material risks and uncertainties and Apollo's actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of risk factors, I encourage you to review the company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and our most recent Form 10-Q. The content of this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, August 2, 2022. Except as required by law, Apollo undertakes no obligation to, revise or update any statements to reflect events or circumstances after the day of this call. Additionally, today's discussion will include certain non-GAAP financial measures which we believe provide an additional tool for evaluating the company's core performance. Management uses these metrics on its own in its own evaluation of continuing operating performance and as a baseline for assessing the future earnings potential of the company. Included in the press release today with our financial results and corresponding 8-K filing are supplemental tables reconciling non-GAAP figures to their closest GAAP comparable. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Chas.\nChas McKhann: Thanks, Matt and good afternoon thank you, everyone, for joining us. On today's call, I'll cover highlights of our Q2 performance. Jeff will then cover our financial results and I'll come back and talk to you in more detail about our recent milestones and launch plans for the Apollo ESG and the Apollo REVISE devices. So starting on Page 3 of our deck, our strategy has been to pursue large market opportunities and build an organization that is primed to capitalize on them. And I'm pleased to say that our recent performance has been good validation of this approach. Q2 was a solid quarter for us. We demonstrated revenue of $19.3 million in reported sales and just under $20 million in constant currency. This performance represents a really nice step-up compared to our recent sales levels and the growth has come ahead of two very recent and important catalysts that we've just announced in the last month, the FDA market authorization for the Apollo ESG and Apollo REVISE devices and publication just last week of the MERIT study in The Lancet. So turning to Page 5, where we've listed both constant currency growth on the left and then GAAP growth on the right. In Q2, we achieved 20% growth in constant currency and 16% year-on-year growth on a GAAP basis. Once again, our growth has been well balanced across both products and geographies. On a GAAP basis, ESS grew 23%, with strong growth in the U.S. of 22% and international growth of 24%. Our IGB franchise grew 6% on a reported basis, 7% in the U.S., 5% outside the U.S. so again, nice balance across the business and across geographies. As with any U.S.-based company that has a significant presence in Europe, foreign exchange has presented a headwind, it's important to note that Apollo unusual for a med tech company of our size has just under 45% of our sales from outside the U.S. and more than half of that is in Europe. Many of you will know that a year ago, the euro is at $1.20, it's now at $1.02. And so it is a significant impact. But again, we're pleased with the reported 16% and the 20% year-on-year growth from a constant currency standpoint. So again, I'll come back to you with an update from a business and strategic standpoint but let's allow Jeff to walk through the financials. Jeff?\nJeff Black: Thank you, Chas and thank you, everybody, for joining us today. I'll spend a few minutes with a financial update give a little commentary on the rest of the year guidance and some discussion about some medium-term targets. First off on Slide 7, just starting off of revenue today again, as Chas said, we reported another quarter of strong year-over-year growth across the whole product portfolio. It's our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. This was the largest revenue quarter on record for Apollo on book of GAAP on a constant currency basis. We grew 18% in the U.S. We're continuing to see the impact of our planned investments. Growth is led by adoption in our endobariatric accounts which Chas will dive into later. We're seeing the benefits of sales force expansion, increased sales force productivity, the continued strength in Orbera on the heels of enhanced marketing efforts. We saw procedural volumes improved throughout the second quarter. There have been some lingering COVID effects but nowhere near to the extent that we saw at the beginning of Q1. We're still seeing some staffing shortages in some hospitals, particularly in academic hospitals, where the -- core GI business is typically very strong. We grew 9% OUS on a constant currency basis again, strong demand in both direct and distributor markets and some competitive wins for both OverStitch and Orbera in some key accounts. We also saw foreign currency headwinds, as Chas mentioned, particularly for the euro which had a nearly $600,000 impact on our year-over-year Q2 growth. And as Chas mentioned, because international sales represent more than 40% of our overall sales we're disproportionately impacted by negative foreign currency impacts compared to similarly sized med tech companies that typically do not have such a large OUS footprint. In other revenue, while not material, was impacted by our planned wind down of our Apollo Care program for Orbera which was outsourced to third-party beginning in 2022. Overall, we're again pleased with our revenue performance in the second quarter and our ability to continue to expand adoption across the portfolio. Moving to revenue guidance on Slide 8, we continue to expect 2022 revenue in the $73 million to $75 million range, cognizant of potential global recessionary impacts lingering pandemic headwinds and most significantly foreign currency pressures from the strengthened dollar, particularly for the euro which currently represents nearly half of our OUS revenue. Our guidance implies fiscal year 2022 growth of 16% and 19% and second half year-over-year growth of about 17% which is essentially flat sequential growth against first half on a GAAP basis. Some of this can be attributed to Q3 seasonality which is typical in our business and we're seeing some of it play out in July. But the biggest impact is foreign currency headwinds. To put this in perspective, the euro foreign currency rate is down 11% since the beginning of 2022 and we've seen similar pressures in most of our OUS geographies. So, on a full year basis we expect foreign currency headwinds of up to $2.1 million in the second half of the year and $3 million on a full year basis. And guidance then on a constant currency basis now implies fiscal year '22 growth and second half '22 growth in the low to mid-20% range. Moving to Slide 10 on non-GAAP OpEx as we look at our -- my apologies, gross margin on Slide 9. As you can see, we're on track with our margin expansion targets. Gross margin improved by 190 basis points versus the first quarter -- of the second quarter of last year. On a constant currency basis, our gross margin improved by 320 basis points to just over 58%. Sequentially, gross margin improved 50 basis points over the first quarter. We saw gross margin expansion on our ESS product line from the impact of 2021 OverStitch COGS improvement projects. We saw improved overhead efficiencies. We also saw some price increase impact for both OverStitch and X-Tack. Major drivers of overall gross margin expansion will continue to be product mix, improved overhead absorption and direct COGS improvement programs focused primarily on OverStitch. We continue to navigate supply chain and manufacturing scale up complexities but we remain confident in our ability to drive blended gross margin to the mid-60% range in the medium term. Now moving to Slide 10 on OpEx as we look at operating spend profile, we think it's important to exclude non-cash stock-based compensation to get a clearer picture of our non-GAAP core operating expense run rate. As we previously said, 2022 is an investment year. In the near term, we're focused on building capabilities following historical underinvestment in the business, the most significant area being sales and marketing in the U.S. For example, in the second quarter, our non-GAAP sales and marketing OpEx ran about 45% of revenue which reflects our planned investments and growth initiatives, primarily in building out our sales channel as we prepare for the launch of Apollo ESG and REVISE products. Our other focused areas of planned investment are in R&D, medical education, clinical reimbursement, product development and again, COGS improvement. And on the G&A side, we'll continue to thoughtfully invest in infrastructure and staff to properly support the business. As we stated, 2022 is an investment year for us with a primary focus on building out our commercial infrastructure in the U.S. to support growing interest and demand for our technologies, especially Apollo ESG and REVISE. But that said, we are modulating spend in light of the changing environment. The more future focused initiatives are now a lower priority. We're setting a very high bar for these kind of investments. For example, we're taking a much more conservative view of investments in longer-term clinical and R&D pipeline initiatives that may not be necessary to support our core business today. While these are all elements that are ultimately critical for longer-term prospects, we have significant flexibility as to how much and when we fund these initiatives. So far in 2022, we've not made any long-term commitments to fund these types of initiatives. In fact, in the first half of 2022, we are well below our OpEx and CapEx spend plans while still on target with our revenue plan. Importantly, we have the ability to modulate spend as appropriate and we're well positioned from a balance sheet perspective to make these investments. With that on Slide 11, addressing our balance sheet in the fourth quarter of last year, we reinforced our balance sheet with $75 million in equity issuance and a new credit facility that will provide up to an additional $65 million in available capital over the next few years. At the end of Q2, we had $140 million in cash and committed cash, including $75 million in cash and equivalents and access to another $40 million over 2023 and '24 based on revenue milestones which are well below our base case expectations. We saw total cash use in the second quarter down by more than $2 million compared to the first quarter which is indicative of our disciplined use of capital even as we continue to make growth investments. We have a multiyear run rate at [indiscernible] our plan with an eye toward investments to take advantage of near-term opportunities in front of us. In terms of 2022 outlook, we expect to end the year with $125 million in cash and committed cash, including more than $60 million in cash and cash equivalents. This implies 2022 cash use of around $30 million which we anticipate is our high watermark for annual burn based upon our base case model. And that brings us to our medium-term business targets and commentary on our path to breakeven. Moving to Slide 12 -- as we've highlighted today in the past quarters, we have the OpEx and CapEx flexibility to greatly enhance our EBITDA and cash burn profile once we've built our organization to scale. And as you can see from the illustrative targets based upon our current base case model, we have a line of sight to positive EBITDA and cash flow breakeven business by the time we reach $150 million in annual revenue. We'll be in a position to make strategic decisions as to whether we enhance investment for accelerating top line growth or more future-focused noncore initiatives or to more aggressively position the company for profitability. But most importantly, based on our current base case model, we have the balance sheet and committed capital today to get us there. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Chas for our business and strategic update.\nChas McKhann: Thanks, Jeff. So in 2022, we have four overall strategic priorities. I'm going to spend the majority of our time today talking about the launch of Apollo ESG and Apollo REVISE given our recent announcements. But before I do that, let me comment on the other three. First, around expanding our core GI defect closure and fixation business that's our OverStitch and our X-Tack products in that area. We've had a good quarter and good progress. Many of you know that in May, we had a very productive Digestive Disease Week meeting and that I think it included more than 100 different presentations about our products and that the X-Tack device was featured very prominently in that. And some of the first data that's come out on X-Tack after just one study that was published last year. And so building on that, we saw a 16% sequential growth in the quarter with X-Tack and we do anticipate that the awareness generated at DDW and that those presentations are then published and that will continue to help support continued interest and adoption of X-Tack. And then furthermore, that there are lots of opportunities still for OverStitch across a whole range of applications in defect closure and fixation. On Orbera, Orbera continues to perform well and has been a meaningful growth driver in our business for the last 18 months. We have successfully implemented co-marketing programs for Orbera in a number of our target accounts and MESA [ph] provided significant incremental growth for Orbera. And we also view these as essentially pilot programs where learnings from what's worked and what's been most successful can be applied to Apollo ESG and Apollo REVISE and I'll come back to that. And we've also observed that Orbera has done particularly well in integrated practices that are offering a range of both Orbera, ESG and revision procedures. And we believe that has a sustainable element to it. And then on advancing the organization and Jeff already talked about this, right we are building the right capabilities that we think we need to really take advantage of these opportunities. We're doing it in a very targeted way. We're reviewing every addition in headcount, line item detail and only investing in the ones that we think are critical but we are making great progress in building our key capabilities in the organization. I am very pleased also to welcome Sharon O'Keefe to the Apollo Board of Directors which we announced just about a month ago. Sharon has extensive experience in leading large medical centers and for nine years served as the President of the University of Chicago Medical Center. She is a thoughtful, experienced healthcare executive and she will bring a new perspective to Apollo Board and we are very excited to have her. So moving now to the launch of Apollo ESG and Apollo REVISE, first, let's start with the news that we've announced over the last month, two important milestones that literally have been years in the making. On July 12, Apollo received marketing authorization from the FDA for the Apollo ESG and Apollo REVISE products it was via the de novo process. A couple of things to highlight 1 is the BMI range for the clearance of 30 to 50. That is a wide range and helps us allow us to treat potentially many, many patients who suffer from obesity. And so we're very pleased with that. Also, this de novo decision came even faster than we anticipated and we are very grateful to our reviewers at the FDA for their responsiveness and an interactive process throughout the process. And then on Thursday, just this past week, the MERIT study, a randomized controlled trial of ESG procedure was published in The Lancet. And I think the quote on the right side of the page which comes directly from the publication, is an excellent summary. For those who don't have the slides in front of you, I'll read it and the implications of all the available evidence. The MERIT study proves that ESG is scalable and can be offered in outpatient -- endoscopy practices by surgeons or gastroenterologists with an excellent safety profile without mortality and with predictable conservatively managed adverse events. And so the publication in Lancet is a big deal and one that we're very excited about. Many of you may know that recently, The Lancet was -- basically took over the leadership position as the highest impact factor journal in the world and so it's an honor to be published in it and all due credit to the investigators in the study. As you see on this page, there are some quotes from Dr. Abu Dayyeh [ph] from the Mayo Clinic and Dr. Wilson from UT in Houston really highlighting some of the overall benefits that were observed in the study and of the ESG procedure. Dr. Abu Dayyeh highlights not only the weight loss benefits but the study also highlighted meaningful improvements in comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension and metabolic syndrome. And Dr. Wilson highlights the fact that we now have a safe, effective and durable procedure that can be performed by both GIs and surgeons. We are very grateful to both Dr. Abu Dayyeh and Dr. Wilson and the entire clinical investigator group who works on MERIT. This was not an easy study to complete. Most of it was performed during the height of the COVID pandemic just a few years ago and we congratulate them on their publication and we are very, very thankful for the work that went into it. So I'd like to take a step back and put into context now these two announcements. For more than two decades, engineers, researchers, venture capitalists have been working on developing new endoscopic approaches for weight loss. It's not an exaggeration to say that 100s of millions of dollars have been invested in pursuit of a less invasive, safe, effective and durable treatment for weight loss. And as you can see on Slide 18, ESG is the first and only procedure that fully delivers on this promise. Let me say a word about the Orbera intragastric balloon because it's an outstanding product and it continues to play a growing role in the treatment of weight loss. And Orbera's role is increasingly important in an integrated setting of care within an integrated endobariatric practice. But that being said, when you think about a full package of -- and the value proposition, only ESG offers what you see on the page. That being an FDA authorization in this case, for both primary and revision procedures, Level 1 evidence with the MERIT study in The Lancet, an endoscopic approach that same day, no incisions and with a fast recovery period, proven effectiveness with 49% excess body weight loss in MERIT. And 15% to 20% total body weight loss in a global published literature which by the way, now has more than 10,000 patients that have been studied in ESG procedures. A very good track record of safety with consistently around the 2% rate of adverse events, serious adverse events -- and as highlighted in The Lancet publication, these events typically can be managed very conservatively and in durability, two years in MERIT and up to five years in the published literature. And so again, that's why there's so much excitement now about the authorization and the study back-to-back. And physicians who've been working on this, as I said, for literally a decade or more, are incredibly excited by these two developments. So if anyone on the call isn't familiar with ESG, it is a suturing procedure in -- on the stomach, reducing the stomach volume as well as delaying gastric emptying which results in the benefits I just mentioned. We're going after and addressing a large patient population, more than 100 million people in the U.S. have a BMI over 30. But importantly, there are only about 200,000 primary bariatric procedures, traditional bariatric procedures performed in the U.S. each year. That result -- that translates, sorry, into a 0.2% treatment rate. We recently conducted market research with more than 1,100 people and confirm something that would seem intuitively pretty obvious. The biggest reason people don't consider bariatric surgeries is fear, fear of side effects, fear of complications. But the value proposition of ESG is fundamentally different. In the same survey we presented information about the ESG procedure and approximately 2/3 of patients are interested in the procedure and you can see the reasons why in terms of no surgical cuts, significant weight loss, durability. 57% would likely see a doctor to talk more about it. And the preference and overall participants expressed a clear preference for ESG over traditional surgeries. These surveys findings are consistent with the experience of physicians who are already early adopters. And what they tell us is that when patients are treated with both options, ESG or traditional surgeries, there is a true benefit for the ESG procedure. But furthermore and probably even more importantly, many patients who would not even consider a traditional surgery are now contacting these practices and wanting to learn more about ESG. And so with ESG, there's a substantial opportunity to grow the size of the pie of people who seek intervention. I'd like to directly address recent questions about the potential impact of weight loss medications on our endobariatric business. Recently, there have been important developments in new weight loss medications, including first semaglutide for Novo Nordisk which has the brand name of Wegovy as well as trazefetide from Eli Lilly which is currently only approved for diabetes but we do expect that in the coming months, it will be a clear for weight loss as well. These new medications are a substantial step-up compared to traditional weight loss drugs. And they are widely anticipated to become blockbusters. But as with any treatment, there are some downsides. The new drugs are expensive -- well more than $1,000 per month and they often are not covered by insurance. They can have tolerability issues and side effects. And we know from decades of experience, the compliance on long-term medication is often very challenging for patients. But again, we do expect them to have a major impact but recall the size of the problem. More than 100 million people and 40% of the adult population in the U.S. have a BMI over 30, having new treatment options, including these medications as well as ESG is a big step forward. And we also anticipate that the increased focus on obesity provided by companies like Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly will prompt many people to consider whether to take action and to evaluate their treatment options. And when they do, they're going to learn more about ESG as well. The potential of combination therapy of ESG plus one of these new medications is very exciting. The study shown on Slide 21 was presented at DDW 2021, so a little more than a year ago and was just recently published. It was a randomized controlled trial for one arm with CDSG [ph] and the second arm received a combination of ESG and a short course of semaglutide. The ESG arm alone performed very well with 18.7% total body weight loss. In combination, the total body weight loss was 25.2%. That's comparable to what is achieved typically with a traditional bariatric surgery without all of the downsides of undergoing a full surgical -- traditional surgical procedure. We are already aware of other physicians who are conducting similar studies of combination therapy for both ESG and revision procedures and so we'd expect to see more data in the future. And also, some of our customers are already incorporating GLP-1 medications into their treatment paradigms of patients who receive an ESG. Turning now to revision procedures, this also represents a big opportunity for us. Over a 10-year period, 1.4 million people in the U.S. underwent a primary bariatric surgery in the U.S. And over time, the body accommodates and studies have shown that up to 1/3 of people who receive a bariatric surgery may be candidates -- for a revision procedure. Traditionally, this has involved another invasive surgical procedure with all of the costs and risks associated with the primary procedure. But despite this, revision surgical procedures are the fastest-growing segment of the traditional laparoscopic surgical market. Now with the Apollo REVISE device, physicians will be able to alter the anatomy using a suturing technique and be able to regain many of the original benefits in an incision-less and typically same-day procedure. In a study published last year out of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, an endoscopic approach to revision procedures demonstrated similar effectiveness to a surgical procedures and this was studied by the way, up to five years but showed substantial improvements on adverse events and especially serious adverse events. So the potential value proposition is very clear. So turning now to Slide 23, so we've just recently received the FDA market authorizations but early adopting physicians have already started to embrace the procedures and prove their viability in real-world clinical settings. What you see on Slide 24, the top 10 private practices in the U.S. that are focused on endobariatrics and the top 10 academic centers where the majority or the entirety of their procedures are endobariatric. As you can see, the growth in these practices in the past 18 months has been substantial as both surgeons and GIs begin to incorporate endobariatric procedures into their clinical practice. The academic centers have grown by 28% in the last year. The private practices have grown their volumes by over -- by 60%. And furthermore, if you look at the average annualized sales across these 20 accounts in the first half of 2022, the annualized sales is about $600,000. As we look at this group, we see that there are numerous recipes for success, private practice and academic, surgeon or GI or a combination of both. Some are primarily cash pay. Some are using prior authorizations which I'll come back to as we talk about market access in a minute. So there are multiple potential models for success going forward. I will say replicating these successes will take some time. Many factors need to come together to create a successful practice, a skilled and well-trained physician. Staff who can provide excellent patient care both before and after the procedure and a practice infrastructure that is effective in identifying and managing patients in all of the key requirements for success. These 20 institutions and others like them in our key international markets already provide an excellent starting point and give us the confidence as we move forward. Slide 25 shows visual examples of some of the accounts that are already beginning to educate patients about endobariatric procedures, including ESG and revisions. These are publicly available screen shots from their websites but many of these practices are already using sophisticated marketing efforts using channels like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, YouTube as well as traditional radio and print ads. Through these collective efforts as well as co-marketing programs from Apollo, patients will be -- have an opportunity to learn and become increased awareness of ESG and endoscopic procedures and awareness and understanding will continue to grow. Slide 26 shows a summary of the different activities associated with our launch plans, including our marketing and medical education initiatives, training for physicians, readying our sales team and targeting them from a sales effort and then a range of reimbursement and market access initiatives -- that are ongoing. These activities are well underway and we do anticipate them contributing to our growth both later this year and into 2023 and beyond. Highlighting some of the key activities among our sales organization, one of the big changes that we've made is we've now added a new role into our sales team that we call regional endobariatric managers. This is a group that now complements our existing market development managers -- sorry, traditional sales reps. And the REM role really complements the traditional sales rep role by focusing on supporting new and emerging practices and that can incorporate Orbera ESG and revision procedures. And they're really focused on all of the different aspects of market development, of identifying patients, how to share best practices and helping grow and develop which is a different set of skill sets but one that's incredibly important in terms of how we will develop this over time. And then we're also enhancing our sales team effectiveness through enhanced training, customer relationship management and marketing support. Moving on to reimbursement and just market access, incredibly important to sustaining growth, importantly, we have already had existing models that are working as you see in the growth on the prior slide. Among the top 20 accounts, some exclusively use a cash pay model and their substantial growth is very good evidence of the high interest level and willingness to pay among patients. And we've been making channel checks with these accounts, especially in light of the broader macroeconomic environment and we continue to hear reports of strong interest and demand even in today's uncertain economic environment. Something we're watching closely but we're getting good feedback from the people who are talking to patients every single day. Other accounts also pursue prior authorizations with insurance companies for both ESG and revisions and often are getting coverage on a case-by-case basis. Achieving broader coding coverage and payment will take time. We have three primary areas of engagement, especially now with the both MERIT study and the FDA authorization and SAM [ph] first is the facility coding and payment. There are potential opportunities for new technology codes with Medicare and we will be pursuing those and we'll provide an update as we move forward. CPT codes are how physicians get paid and we are engaging the leading GI and surgical societies in the CPT coding process. Our objective is to have a successful Category 1 CPT code during the upcoming annual cycle which will result in a new Category 1 CPT code being effective January 1, 2025. But again, still work to do with the societies because I think we've mentioned this before, the AMA-CPT panel in the surgical and GI societies will really drive that process. And then thirdly engaging payers, coverage will build over time. As I mentioned, we already have seen success in some cases on a case-by-case basis. With the new market authorizations as well as with The Lancet publication, we will engage in efforts now to improve the coverage of both ESG and revisions. In the meantime, moving on to Slide 29 -- pardon me, we do still have a very viable cash pay model. And we just try to showing on this slide that it really is a win-win for both patients and physicians. Patients have very good treatment options that can be tailored to their needs with Orbera, with ESG or with revision procedures. And again, these can be in the context of both, a dedicated GI-based endobariatric practice or an integrated program that's offered by surgeons. For physicians, it is a chance to differentiate their practice, a chance to grow their practice and the practice economics can be very attractive as well. So in summary, with the recent market authorization and The Lancet publication, we are reiterating our medium-term growth outlook and adding a line of sight to cash flow positive business in the years ahead. And we are very excited about the impact that our products can have in improving patient care going forward. So with that, let me turn it back to Matthew and we'll open the call to Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Chris Cooley from Stephens.\nChris Cooley: Congratulations on the solid quarter just a couple of quick ones for me. First Chas, just curious if you could help us maybe look into your crystal ball. And as we think about in particular, the Lilly results, how do you see this affecting the market from a channel perspective. I guess, not only from a provider but also if we just think about the patient funnel, does this bring more patients into the patient funnel than over time, basically source from that for the surgical procedure? Does this -- I'm just kind of curious how you're thinking about that because in that study, the mean percentage weight loss was approximately 15% in six months. So just kind of curious how you think that may or may not play out? And then secondly, maybe just -- I'll ask both my questions upfront for Jeff. I appreciate the focus on achieving profitability on the hand the plan that you've outlined here on today's call? Just curious, though, if you've kind of changed your views on the rep adds. I think at DDW, you talked about getting upwards of 45 by calendar year-end. I noticed on Slide 27 and maybe this is just semantics, approximately 40 reps by year-end. I'm just curious if you're thinking about maybe modulating your headcount there a little bit. I know -- in your prepared remarks at the outset you talked about more closely evaluating incremental hires going forward, just trying to triangulate that a little bit as well?\nChas McKhann: Appreciate it. So on the weight loss medications, both semaglutide and then the Lilly results with tirzepatide, I think we're all speculating a little bit in terms of conversations of how this will play out. But as we talk to physicians who again, are treating a lot of patients already, I think from a channel standpoint, it could play out at a couple of different time points. As I mentioned, I do think you're going to see more people who are overweight to obese are going to revisit should I do something, right? And you're going to have the weight of very large pharmaceutical companies talking about that. And someone will get medications but someone will also learn about their options overall. And we've already seen some examples of that our customers have. The second part that I did mention in my comments is patient compliance. Staying on a long-term injectable medication isn't easy. And we've just seen that across categories in -- for decades. So we absolutely expect they're going to have an impact, no question. But on a relative scale of the number of patients, right now, our fraction of procedures is such a small fraction of the overall market that the opportunity to get even some lift out of a net effect of increased interest and then some patients who try these medications and -- look for something more effective, we think actually creates some really good opportunities relative to our scale. Jeff?\nJeff Black: Sure yes Chris, thank you. And to your question on headcount and OpEx modulation, I think it's a combination of two things. It's just being very critical about every dollar of spend and every head count that we add. But on the sales channel and on the commercial organization, it's really less about expense control, to be honest with you and more about the strategy around what is the right mix in the sales force, right. And so, we're really -- we're in many areas, we're really doubling down on this REM role and piloting some REM roles and how they best interplay with the sales reps. And so, that may differ on a geography by geography basis. We may have situations where a sales rep has a broader coverage territory because they have an REM to support them. We may have situations where because of geographic distance, we may have to add more sales reps to cover a more expansive geography and then supplement with more or less REMs. And so it's really more of a piloting around what's the right mix. And so it's less about, hey, let's say, five heads but let's get the mix right. Anything to add to that, Chas?\nChas McKhann: No, I think you summarized it well.\nChris Cooley: And if I could maybe just squeeze one other quick one in. I know during the first quarter, you received OverStitch. I'm sorry you received clearance in Japan for OverStitch. And we're going to -- obviously, you're working on timing and the dollar value there for reimbursement. Are there any new updates that you can provide at this time for the Japanese market and I'll get back in the queue?\nChas McKhann: No, so we got the clearance in January -- sorry in Q1, you're right. We've still -- as you may well know, Chris, from other companies you cover, having the right distributor in Japan is critical and thinking long-term how you approach it. And so, we are actually still finalizing our distributor relationships in Japan which will end up impacting than what we expect on the growth trajectory.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Adam Maeder from Piper Sandler.\nSimran Kaur: This is Simran on for Adam. Congrats on a great quarter and for the fulsome update on the business. So I know it's very early days but what impact, if any, have you seen on ESG and OverStitch volumes since the FDA approval of the labeling change for ESG and REVISE? And then maybe as a follow-up there, how do we think about the adoption over the remainder of 2022 and maybe even '23 in both existing endobariatric accounts and then now new accounts kind of coming into the funnel?\nChas McKhann: Yes, no I appreciate the question. I think there'll be a time -- let me back up. The interest level following the authorizations and especially -- and then the publication last week has been extremely high. There's a lot of excitement. But there'll be a time lag from that to cases and people being treated, right? I mean if you think about the different elements I mentioned that come together through accelerating their practice, they take some time. And so, we do see that factoring into later in the year and then certainly, our momentum heading into 2023. And so that's kind of the timeframe and we would expect to see an impact of moving from, as I said, a lot of interest to a real impact. And then it's also been offset -- the announcements have just come in the last month. And as Jeff mentioned, we have seen some summer seasonality. And if any of you have traveled recently, airports are extremely busy, people are taking vacations. And we've seen that both with a number of our key customers. And so that's normal at this time of the year but I think maybe even a little bit more so this year. And that might cloud any immediate impact relative to putting the pieces together. We really are thinking about this for the long-term as well. One of the things I meant to mention in my upfront comments is speed is not our most important thing in this next phase quality is, right? We want to make sure we get very good customers getting excellent outcomes because that will result in the most long-term sustainable growth.\nSimran Kaur: Okay, perfect. And then -- maybe as my second question, can you expand on the international performance of the business? And I know both -- and Jeff had mentioned the FX headwinds. And even despite that, we saw pretty strong growth coming from that business. So maybe talk about some of the underlying trends offsetting that foreign currency dynamic and even the trends that you saw in the direct versus distributor channel?\nChas McKhann: Sure no, happy to. Yes overall, we had a really good quarter outside the U.S. And the ESS business which is primarily OverStitch outside the U.S., we only have X-Tack in a few countries cleared. We reported 24% on a GAAP basis and 35% year-on-year growth so just good continued adoption of OverStitch. Most of our business outside the U.S. is for OverStitch is endobariatric but we are having a focus on also expanding core GI as well and the team is doing a nice job with that. Pretty good balanced growth between distributor and direct markets. And so, we're pleased with that. We also see good growth on the IGB side as well. We've had some share wins on -- we're much more competitive outside the U.S. and Orbera really does have a great track record of tried and true. And so we continue to do well there. So we had a nice balance in our business and are pleased with how the performance went again, despite the FX piece. And so, I don't over -- get too wrapped up in that it is what it is. The underlying fundamentals, we think, on the international side are very good. And then we are looking forward to X-Tack. No real changes on updates on that from an international CE mark. We're still working through the MDR processes for regulatory and that's probably a 2023 event like versus 2022.\nJeff Black: And Simran, just to add to that, just to give a little more color when you see our international performance, what you're seeing is growth in predominantly existing geographies. So we really haven't done a lot of expansion into new geographies and are yet seeing growth in new geographies. So we're very encouraged by that because it is predominantly organic growth.\nSimran Kaur: Got it. And then, if I could squeeze one quick one in there. Maybe any update on the NASH strategy? I know Jeff, you were talking about modulating spend -- in your efforts to do that. Some of the more longer-term priorities are kind of being put on the back burner for now. So just what are your latest thoughts there any updates?\nChas McKhann: Yes, I know that Jeff did allude to the fact that we really are focused on driving the core businesses. And we now are really looking at NASH as one of the key comorbidities associated with improvements in weight loss as well as things like diabetes and hypertension. And so, we're really trying to look at -- as part of the integrated strategy that's going to maximize the utilization of our products. And originally, the NASH strategy started with Orbera but we really are looking at it in the context of ESG as well and especially ESG now with the clearance. And so that is an area where we absolutely are doing a lot of homework working with thought leaders and hepatology community but also in the diabetology community and others to say which will have the greatest impact and therefore, what the clinical strategy would need to be. So it's one that we're not rushing into a new clinical trial right now, especially given the broader economic environment.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Frank Takkinen, Lake Street Capital.\nFrank Takkinen: Congrats on the quarter and all the progress, I wanted to start off with reimbursement around ESG. More specifically, just if there's any opportunity and apologies if I missed it, around establishing a temporary C code for the outpatient setting a little bit quicker than some of those other time lines that you can start generating data and maybe start to see some partial or one-off reimbursement in the outpatient setting while you await final coverage in the multiyear process?\nChas McKhann: Yes, no, it's an insightful question, Frank and it's one that our reimbursement team is working through as part of the overall facility payment side of things. So I mentioned things like new technology codes but you're right, C codes could be part of that strategy as well. And we're working through those details right now.\nFrank Takkinen: Okay, helpful. And then just back to the marketing authorization. My sense there was a couple last things to complete like developing some new SKUs specific to ESG and REVISE. One, can you provide an update on that? And then two, as it relates to that, can you talk to any potential pricing power for the weight loss indications and how that could impact gross margins over time?\nChas McKhann: Sure, yes. So on the new -- there are new devices that were cleared the Apollo ESG and the Apollo REVISE devices. There is still some, frankly, kind of logistical elements that go into the packaging around those and being ready to ship that we would expect will still take a few months and probably be early in Q4 when we're shipping the new devices. And that just aligns with what we expected the original time line would have been unusually FDA beat us to it but we were more than happy. So we can still train physicians. We can still speak to the procedure but the actual SKUs being available will be a few months. And then we are also still finalizing the pricing strategy but we do expect they will be opportunity for some premium pricing that would help. But we're still working through the final pieces of that strategy because it will have long-term implications for things like reimbursement and others. And as we get further along, we'll provide an update on that.\nFrank Takkinen: Okay. And then just -- the second half of that, any comments on how it could impact gross margins over time?\nChas McKhann: Well just that, I mean, the ability to have some pricing leverage would absolutely improve and help that and then as Jeff mentioned, the OverStitch and the components OverStitch are our primary focus areas of reducing costs as well. So we've factored that into kind of our overall plans of getting into the mid-60s on gross margin but we'll work that as part of the overall mix as we go forward.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Matt Hewitt from Craig-Hallum.\nMatt Hewitt: Maybe first one and you touched on this a little bit in your prepared remarks but obviously, there was a ton of buzz around DDW for both OverStitch and X-Tack now that we're three months removed. I'm just curious, how has that kind of played out? Obviously, you've gotten the big approvals since then as well as the publication last week. So maybe it's difficult to pull those two pieces apart. But follow-through post DDW would be helpful?\nChas McKhann: Yes, no, you're right, Matt. The interest level has been very high, increased awareness, especially for X-Tack as a new product and having podium presentations about it really for the first time in a big meeting just because it was one of the first really large in-person meetings has been exciting. And that has played well and helps support the 16% sequential growth that I mentioned. And so our sales team is very much focused on building on that momentum and continuing going forward. And we have a balance, right, of now needing to be able to do that while also focusing on the endobariatric side as well. So that will be an important thing that we're going to need to balance that is part of the rationale for the dedicated endobariatric manager roles. And so, we have a certain subset of our sales force that is 100% focused on the endobariatric side, while our reps are carrying the full bag.\nMatt Hewitt: Got it. And then maybe my second question, I think it was Slide 24, where you were talking about your top 10 private practice groups as well as your top 10 academic groups and the growth that they're seeing. I guess that was one of the things that came up at DDW was that some of your top accounts are figuring out ways to navigate the reimbursement with preauthorization? As they get more adopt at doing so until you've got more formal coverage in place, is that something that kind of a road map that your other accounts can follow, especially now that you've got the formal labels. But is that something where they can follow that road map and kind of get reimbursement kind of precharged even ahead of formal coverage?\nChas McKhann: The short answer is yes, right. That is something -- that has -- what you heard in some of your conversations at DDW, people have been able to do that on a case-by-case basis really is some of the more sophisticated accounts who know how to do this, right and have been able to effectively navigate those conversations. And they've been doing that independent of Apollo. We didn't have the labeling. So, we didn't have a team in place supporting those kinds of efforts. With the labeling, we can implement a team that can help support that and, for example, share best practices. It can even vary by payer, right. Some payers will respond to certain things that really will make a difference in terms of whether a patient gets covered and learning that documenting it and helping people navigate it will be part of our strategy going forward.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Jeff [ph] from Cowen.\nUnidentified Analyst: Chas, I wanted to just ask about the label for OverStitch ESG and just the BMI range of 30 to 50, how do you see your customer base and the future customers, physicians utilizing ESG and to BMI patients in between 40 and 50?\nChas McKhann: I think it's a really interesting question of how it will play out. I think people, for the most part, currently assume that the sweet spot will be in the 30 to 40 range, i.e., the MERIT population and that's probably where we will start for the most part. But there were data presented at DDW, as you may recall, by one of our customers that showed very good results in patients with the BMI over 40. I think it was consistently a 20% or more total body weight loss. And that was independent of any medications. So one of the big speculative questions is whether combination therapies will really play a bigger role in that 40-plus range. And I certainly know some surgeons who think that it may well -- but I do think it will kind of go in that sequence. There still is a belief that ESG is typically a little bit lower on the efficacy side but a really good safety profile and a lot of patient benefits will probably start more of a sweet spot in that 30 to 40 range and then maybe migrate up over time.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. I mean what will be sub utilization that may already be of ESG in patients as a preliminary procedure to make a patient a better candidate for maybe a surgical sleeve?\nChas McKhann: We have seen people think about a kind of bridge to surgery approach at times as well. I'm not sure how common that is. I mean we certainly have heard it a bit more anecdotally. And could that play out over time, possibly. I mean one of the benefits of ESG as you aren't cutting off future treatment options. It's something that surgeons are very interested and know that they can do a sleeve in the future or do a bypass in the future if they choose to -- but I don't expect necessarily a bridge approach will be that widespread at least initially.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, okay. And then just wanted to ask about how your team is planning on marketing durability of the ESG -- I think MERIT after two years there other publications provide a signal durability to be less longer -- up to five years. How are you playing on marking them and just in the -- thinking about ESG revisions and how you see a path to potentially the potential for an ESG revision with an ESG procedure?\nChas McKhann: Sure, yes. No, I appreciate the question. We have a lot of data out to two years. There was just a patient -- a study with 3,000 patients out of the Middle East with very good data out to three years and then there's limited data but some out to five years. So we're in that range. I think our experienced customers who've already been doing this in advance of us talking about it, are careful not to promise it as a panacea and really emphasize the importance of the patient follow-up and patient management in the programs that they do and if they -- how they engage in that can really impact the durability. But then, also, obesity is a chronic disease. And if people understand and expect that, then setting up the possible expectation that, yes, down the line, you need a retightening procedure. And we've got experience with that and good success with it. Or in the future, you may be a candidate for a surgical procedure. These are often part of the conversations and I think we'll be part of how we market it as well.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Matthew Blackman from Stifel.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Colin on for Matt, just one quick one for me today, first of all congratulations on the recent approval and the strong quarter. I had a question on the midterm growth target of 20%. Is that step-up largely ESG driven or do you also contemplate potential halo effect from ESG on the rest of the broader portfolio pull-through?\nChas McKhann: Yes, no Colin, I appreciate that. As we've done our strategic plans, we like, as I mentioned on the call and what we've seen so far, a good balance across both products and geographies. And so I think there is a potential halo effect on -- from ESG and revisions on the balloon. And I mentioned that in terms of sustainable endobariatric practices. We do still continue to see very good traction and growth with X-Tack and that is before the CE mark. So that can be an important growth driver outside the U.S., or especially the economic value proposition of X-Tack is very -- it fits very well with the medical systems. But then having said all of that, I have said before, I think there is an opportunity, given the value proposition I mentioned for ESG to become a market-leading weight loss procedure -- that's not baked in -- I mean, that level of optimism isn't fully baked into that 20% number. I mean if we get to that, we'll be well ahead of that. Just a matter of how long does it take to really put all the pieces together and untapped the opportunity. But given what we're already seeing in people connecting the dots and having good success with growth, we're excited about it. So it's a little bit mix, very good opportunities with ESG and revisions but also balanced growth with other products as well.\nOperator: That concludes our Q&A session. I will now hand the conference back to Chas McKhann for closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nChas McKhann: Just want to reiterate our thanks to everybody for joining us today and we look forward to further updates as the year progresses.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Chas McKhann",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt and good afternoon thank you, everyone, for joining us. On today's call, I'll cover highlights of our Q2 performance. Jeff will then cover our financial results and I'll come back and talk to you in more detail about our recent milestones and launch plans for the Apollo ESG and the Apollo REVISE devices. So starting on Page 3 of our deck, our strategy has been to pursue large market opportunities and build an organization that is primed to capitalize on them. And I'm pleased to say that our recent performance has been good validation of this approach. Q2 was a solid quarter for us. We demonstrated revenue of $19.3 million in reported sales and just under $20 million in constant currency. This performance represents a really nice step-up compared to our recent sales levels and the growth has come ahead of two very recent and important catalysts that we've just announced in the last month, the FDA market authorization for the Apollo ESG and Apollo REVISE devices and publication just last week of the MERIT study in The Lancet. So turning to Page 5, where we've listed both constant currency growth on the left and then GAAP growth on the right. In Q2, we achieved 20% growth in constant currency and 16% year-on-year growth on a GAAP basis. Once again, our growth has been well balanced across both products and geographies. On a GAAP basis, ESS grew 23%, with strong growth in the U.S. of 22% and international growth of 24%. Our IGB franchise grew 6% on a reported basis, 7% in the U.S., 5% outside the U.S. so again, nice balance across the business and across geographies. As with any U.S.-based company that has a significant presence in Europe, foreign exchange has presented a headwind, it's important to note that Apollo unusual for a med tech company of our size has just under 45% of our sales from outside the U.S. and more than half of that is in Europe. Many of you will know that a year ago, the euro is at $1.20, it's now at $1.02. And so it is a significant impact. But again, we're pleased with the reported 16% and the 20% year-on-year growth from a constant currency standpoint. So again, I'll come back to you with an update from a business and strategic standpoint but let's allow Jeff to walk through the financials. Jeff? Thanks, Jeff. So in 2022, we have four overall strategic priorities. I'm going to spend the majority of our time today talking about the launch of Apollo ESG and Apollo REVISE given our recent announcements. But before I do that, let me comment on the other three. First, around expanding our core GI defect closure and fixation business that's our OverStitch and our X-Tack products in that area. We've had a good quarter and good progress. Many of you know that in May, we had a very productive Digestive Disease Week meeting and that I think it included more than 100 different presentations about our products and that the X-Tack device was featured very prominently in that. And some of the first data that's come out on X-Tack after just one study that was published last year. And so building on that, we saw a 16% sequential growth in the quarter with X-Tack and we do anticipate that the awareness generated at DDW and that those presentations are then published and that will continue to help support continued interest and adoption of X-Tack. And then furthermore, that there are lots of opportunities still for OverStitch across a whole range of applications in defect closure and fixation. On Orbera, Orbera continues to perform well and has been a meaningful growth driver in our business for the last 18 months. We have successfully implemented co-marketing programs for Orbera in a number of our target accounts and MESA [ph] provided significant incremental growth for Orbera. And we also view these as essentially pilot programs where learnings from what's worked and what's been most successful can be applied to Apollo ESG and Apollo REVISE and I'll come back to that. And we've also observed that Orbera has done particularly well in integrated practices that are offering a range of both Orbera, ESG and revision procedures. And we believe that has a sustainable element to it. And then on advancing the organization and Jeff already talked about this, right we are building the right capabilities that we think we need to really take advantage of these opportunities. We're doing it in a very targeted way. We're reviewing every addition in headcount, line item detail and only investing in the ones that we think are critical but we are making great progress in building our key capabilities in the organization. I am very pleased also to welcome Sharon O'Keefe to the Apollo Board of Directors which we announced just about a month ago. Sharon has extensive experience in leading large medical centers and for nine years served as the President of the University of Chicago Medical Center. She is a thoughtful, experienced healthcare executive and she will bring a new perspective to Apollo Board and we are very excited to have her. So moving now to the launch of Apollo ESG and Apollo REVISE, first, let's start with the news that we've announced over the last month, two important milestones that literally have been years in the making. On July 12, Apollo received marketing authorization from the FDA for the Apollo ESG and Apollo REVISE products it was via the de novo process. A couple of things to highlight 1 is the BMI range for the clearance of 30 to 50. That is a wide range and helps us allow us to treat potentially many, many patients who suffer from obesity. And so we're very pleased with that. Also, this de novo decision came even faster than we anticipated and we are very grateful to our reviewers at the FDA for their responsiveness and an interactive process throughout the process. And then on Thursday, just this past week, the MERIT study, a randomized controlled trial of ESG procedure was published in The Lancet. And I think the quote on the right side of the page which comes directly from the publication, is an excellent summary. For those who don't have the slides in front of you, I'll read it and the implications of all the available evidence. The MERIT study proves that ESG is scalable and can be offered in outpatient -- endoscopy practices by surgeons or gastroenterologists with an excellent safety profile without mortality and with predictable conservatively managed adverse events. And so the publication in Lancet is a big deal and one that we're very excited about. Many of you may know that recently, The Lancet was -- basically took over the leadership position as the highest impact factor journal in the world and so it's an honor to be published in it and all due credit to the investigators in the study. As you see on this page, there are some quotes from Dr. Abu Dayyeh [ph] from the Mayo Clinic and Dr. Wilson from UT in Houston really highlighting some of the overall benefits that were observed in the study and of the ESG procedure. Dr. Abu Dayyeh highlights not only the weight loss benefits but the study also highlighted meaningful improvements in comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension and metabolic syndrome. And Dr. Wilson highlights the fact that we now have a safe, effective and durable procedure that can be performed by both GIs and surgeons. We are very grateful to both Dr. Abu Dayyeh and Dr. Wilson and the entire clinical investigator group who works on MERIT. This was not an easy study to complete. Most of it was performed during the height of the COVID pandemic just a few years ago and we congratulate them on their publication and we are very, very thankful for the work that went into it. So I'd like to take a step back and put into context now these two announcements. For more than two decades, engineers, researchers, venture capitalists have been working on developing new endoscopic approaches for weight loss. It's not an exaggeration to say that 100s of millions of dollars have been invested in pursuit of a less invasive, safe, effective and durable treatment for weight loss. And as you can see on Slide 18, ESG is the first and only procedure that fully delivers on this promise. Let me say a word about the Orbera intragastric balloon because it's an outstanding product and it continues to play a growing role in the treatment of weight loss. And Orbera's role is increasingly important in an integrated setting of care within an integrated endobariatric practice. But that being said, when you think about a full package of -- and the value proposition, only ESG offers what you see on the page. That being an FDA authorization in this case, for both primary and revision procedures, Level 1 evidence with the MERIT study in The Lancet, an endoscopic approach that same day, no incisions and with a fast recovery period, proven effectiveness with 49% excess body weight loss in MERIT. And 15% to 20% total body weight loss in a global published literature which by the way, now has more than 10,000 patients that have been studied in ESG procedures. A very good track record of safety with consistently around the 2% rate of adverse events, serious adverse events -- and as highlighted in The Lancet publication, these events typically can be managed very conservatively and in durability, two years in MERIT and up to five years in the published literature. And so again, that's why there's so much excitement now about the authorization and the study back-to-back. And physicians who've been working on this, as I said, for literally a decade or more, are incredibly excited by these two developments. So if anyone on the call isn't familiar with ESG, it is a suturing procedure in -- on the stomach, reducing the stomach volume as well as delaying gastric emptying which results in the benefits I just mentioned. We're going after and addressing a large patient population, more than 100 million people in the U.S. have a BMI over 30. But importantly, there are only about 200,000 primary bariatric procedures, traditional bariatric procedures performed in the U.S. each year. That result -- that translates, sorry, into a 0.2% treatment rate. We recently conducted market research with more than 1,100 people and confirm something that would seem intuitively pretty obvious. The biggest reason people don't consider bariatric surgeries is fear, fear of side effects, fear of complications. But the value proposition of ESG is fundamentally different. In the same survey we presented information about the ESG procedure and approximately 2/3 of patients are interested in the procedure and you can see the reasons why in terms of no surgical cuts, significant weight loss, durability. 57% would likely see a doctor to talk more about it. And the preference and overall participants expressed a clear preference for ESG over traditional surgeries. These surveys findings are consistent with the experience of physicians who are already early adopters. And what they tell us is that when patients are treated with both options, ESG or traditional surgeries, there is a true benefit for the ESG procedure. But furthermore and probably even more importantly, many patients who would not even consider a traditional surgery are now contacting these practices and wanting to learn more about ESG. And so with ESG, there's a substantial opportunity to grow the size of the pie of people who seek intervention. I'd like to directly address recent questions about the potential impact of weight loss medications on our endobariatric business. Recently, there have been important developments in new weight loss medications, including first semaglutide for Novo Nordisk which has the brand name of Wegovy as well as trazefetide from Eli Lilly which is currently only approved for diabetes but we do expect that in the coming months, it will be a clear for weight loss as well. These new medications are a substantial step-up compared to traditional weight loss drugs. And they are widely anticipated to become blockbusters. But as with any treatment, there are some downsides. The new drugs are expensive -- well more than $1,000 per month and they often are not covered by insurance. They can have tolerability issues and side effects. And we know from decades of experience, the compliance on long-term medication is often very challenging for patients. But again, we do expect them to have a major impact but recall the size of the problem. More than 100 million people and 40% of the adult population in the U.S. have a BMI over 30, having new treatment options, including these medications as well as ESG is a big step forward. And we also anticipate that the increased focus on obesity provided by companies like Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly will prompt many people to consider whether to take action and to evaluate their treatment options. And when they do, they're going to learn more about ESG as well. The potential of combination therapy of ESG plus one of these new medications is very exciting. The study shown on Slide 21 was presented at DDW 2021, so a little more than a year ago and was just recently published. It was a randomized controlled trial for one arm with CDSG [ph] and the second arm received a combination of ESG and a short course of semaglutide. The ESG arm alone performed very well with 18.7% total body weight loss. In combination, the total body weight loss was 25.2%. That's comparable to what is achieved typically with a traditional bariatric surgery without all of the downsides of undergoing a full surgical -- traditional surgical procedure. We are already aware of other physicians who are conducting similar studies of combination therapy for both ESG and revision procedures and so we'd expect to see more data in the future. And also, some of our customers are already incorporating GLP-1 medications into their treatment paradigms of patients who receive an ESG. Turning now to revision procedures, this also represents a big opportunity for us. Over a 10-year period, 1.4 million people in the U.S. underwent a primary bariatric surgery in the U.S. And over time, the body accommodates and studies have shown that up to 1/3 of people who receive a bariatric surgery may be candidates -- for a revision procedure. Traditionally, this has involved another invasive surgical procedure with all of the costs and risks associated with the primary procedure. But despite this, revision surgical procedures are the fastest-growing segment of the traditional laparoscopic surgical market. Now with the Apollo REVISE device, physicians will be able to alter the anatomy using a suturing technique and be able to regain many of the original benefits in an incision-less and typically same-day procedure. In a study published last year out of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, an endoscopic approach to revision procedures demonstrated similar effectiveness to a surgical procedures and this was studied by the way, up to five years but showed substantial improvements on adverse events and especially serious adverse events. So the potential value proposition is very clear. So turning now to Slide 23, so we've just recently received the FDA market authorizations but early adopting physicians have already started to embrace the procedures and prove their viability in real-world clinical settings. What you see on Slide 24, the top 10 private practices in the U.S. that are focused on endobariatrics and the top 10 academic centers where the majority or the entirety of their procedures are endobariatric. As you can see, the growth in these practices in the past 18 months has been substantial as both surgeons and GIs begin to incorporate endobariatric procedures into their clinical practice. The academic centers have grown by 28% in the last year. The private practices have grown their volumes by over -- by 60%. And furthermore, if you look at the average annualized sales across these 20 accounts in the first half of 2022, the annualized sales is about $600,000. As we look at this group, we see that there are numerous recipes for success, private practice and academic, surgeon or GI or a combination of both. Some are primarily cash pay. Some are using prior authorizations which I'll come back to as we talk about market access in a minute. So there are multiple potential models for success going forward. I will say replicating these successes will take some time. Many factors need to come together to create a successful practice, a skilled and well-trained physician. Staff who can provide excellent patient care both before and after the procedure and a practice infrastructure that is effective in identifying and managing patients in all of the key requirements for success. These 20 institutions and others like them in our key international markets already provide an excellent starting point and give us the confidence as we move forward. Slide 25 shows visual examples of some of the accounts that are already beginning to educate patients about endobariatric procedures, including ESG and revisions. These are publicly available screen shots from their websites but many of these practices are already using sophisticated marketing efforts using channels like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, YouTube as well as traditional radio and print ads. Through these collective efforts as well as co-marketing programs from Apollo, patients will be -- have an opportunity to learn and become increased awareness of ESG and endoscopic procedures and awareness and understanding will continue to grow. Slide 26 shows a summary of the different activities associated with our launch plans, including our marketing and medical education initiatives, training for physicians, readying our sales team and targeting them from a sales effort and then a range of reimbursement and market access initiatives -- that are ongoing. These activities are well underway and we do anticipate them contributing to our growth both later this year and into 2023 and beyond. Highlighting some of the key activities among our sales organization, one of the big changes that we've made is we've now added a new role into our sales team that we call regional endobariatric managers. This is a group that now complements our existing market development managers -- sorry, traditional sales reps. And the REM role really complements the traditional sales rep role by focusing on supporting new and emerging practices and that can incorporate Orbera ESG and revision procedures. And they're really focused on all of the different aspects of market development, of identifying patients, how to share best practices and helping grow and develop which is a different set of skill sets but one that's incredibly important in terms of how we will develop this over time. And then we're also enhancing our sales team effectiveness through enhanced training, customer relationship management and marketing support. Moving on to reimbursement and just market access, incredibly important to sustaining growth, importantly, we have already had existing models that are working as you see in the growth on the prior slide. Among the top 20 accounts, some exclusively use a cash pay model and their substantial growth is very good evidence of the high interest level and willingness to pay among patients. And we've been making channel checks with these accounts, especially in light of the broader macroeconomic environment and we continue to hear reports of strong interest and demand even in today's uncertain economic environment. Something we're watching closely but we're getting good feedback from the people who are talking to patients every single day. Other accounts also pursue prior authorizations with insurance companies for both ESG and revisions and often are getting coverage on a case-by-case basis. Achieving broader coding coverage and payment will take time. We have three primary areas of engagement, especially now with the both MERIT study and the FDA authorization and SAM [ph] first is the facility coding and payment. There are potential opportunities for new technology codes with Medicare and we will be pursuing those and we'll provide an update as we move forward. CPT codes are how physicians get paid and we are engaging the leading GI and surgical societies in the CPT coding process. Our objective is to have a successful Category 1 CPT code during the upcoming annual cycle which will result in a new Category 1 CPT code being effective January 1, 2025. But again, still work to do with the societies because I think we've mentioned this before, the AMA-CPT panel in the surgical and GI societies will really drive that process. And then thirdly engaging payers, coverage will build over time. As I mentioned, we already have seen success in some cases on a case-by-case basis. With the new market authorizations as well as with The Lancet publication, we will engage in efforts now to improve the coverage of both ESG and revisions. In the meantime, moving on to Slide 29 -- pardon me, we do still have a very viable cash pay model. And we just try to showing on this slide that it really is a win-win for both patients and physicians. Patients have very good treatment options that can be tailored to their needs with Orbera, with ESG or with revision procedures. And again, these can be in the context of both, a dedicated GI-based endobariatric practice or an integrated program that's offered by surgeons. For physicians, it is a chance to differentiate their practice, a chance to grow their practice and the practice economics can be very attractive as well. So in summary, with the recent market authorization and The Lancet publication, we are reiterating our medium-term growth outlook and adding a line of sight to cash flow positive business in the years ahead. And we are very excited about the impact that our products can have in improving patient care going forward. So with that, let me turn it back to Matthew and we'll open the call to Q&A. Appreciate it. So on the weight loss medications, both semaglutide and then the Lilly results with tirzepatide, I think we're all speculating a little bit in terms of conversations of how this will play out. But as we talk to physicians who again, are treating a lot of patients already, I think from a channel standpoint, it could play out at a couple of different time points. As I mentioned, I do think you're going to see more people who are overweight to obese are going to revisit should I do something, right? And you're going to have the weight of very large pharmaceutical companies talking about that. And someone will get medications but someone will also learn about their options overall. And we've already seen some examples of that our customers have. The second part that I did mention in my comments is patient compliance. Staying on a long-term injectable medication isn't easy. And we've just seen that across categories in -- for decades. So we absolutely expect they're going to have an impact, no question. But on a relative scale of the number of patients, right now, our fraction of procedures is such a small fraction of the overall market that the opportunity to get even some lift out of a net effect of increased interest and then some patients who try these medications and -- look for something more effective, we think actually creates some really good opportunities relative to our scale. Jeff? No, I think you summarized it well. No, so we got the clearance in January -- sorry in Q1, you're right. We've still -- as you may well know, Chris, from other companies you cover, having the right distributor in Japan is critical and thinking long-term how you approach it. And so, we are actually still finalizing our distributor relationships in Japan which will end up impacting than what we expect on the growth trajectory. Yes, no I appreciate the question. I think there'll be a time -- let me back up. The interest level following the authorizations and especially -- and then the publication last week has been extremely high. There's a lot of excitement. But there'll be a time lag from that to cases and people being treated, right? I mean if you think about the different elements I mentioned that come together through accelerating their practice, they take some time. And so, we do see that factoring into later in the year and then certainly, our momentum heading into 2023. And so that's kind of the timeframe and we would expect to see an impact of moving from, as I said, a lot of interest to a real impact. And then it's also been offset -- the announcements have just come in the last month. And as Jeff mentioned, we have seen some summer seasonality. And if any of you have traveled recently, airports are extremely busy, people are taking vacations. And we've seen that both with a number of our key customers. And so that's normal at this time of the year but I think maybe even a little bit more so this year. And that might cloud any immediate impact relative to putting the pieces together. We really are thinking about this for the long-term as well. One of the things I meant to mention in my upfront comments is speed is not our most important thing in this next phase quality is, right? We want to make sure we get very good customers getting excellent outcomes because that will result in the most long-term sustainable growth. Sure no, happy to. Yes overall, we had a really good quarter outside the U.S. And the ESS business which is primarily OverStitch outside the U.S., we only have X-Tack in a few countries cleared. We reported 24% on a GAAP basis and 35% year-on-year growth so just good continued adoption of OverStitch. Most of our business outside the U.S. is for OverStitch is endobariatric but we are having a focus on also expanding core GI as well and the team is doing a nice job with that. Pretty good balanced growth between distributor and direct markets. And so, we're pleased with that. We also see good growth on the IGB side as well. We've had some share wins on -- we're much more competitive outside the U.S. and Orbera really does have a great track record of tried and true. And so we continue to do well there. So we had a nice balance in our business and are pleased with how the performance went again, despite the FX piece. And so, I don't over -- get too wrapped up in that it is what it is. The underlying fundamentals, we think, on the international side are very good. And then we are looking forward to X-Tack. No real changes on updates on that from an international CE mark. We're still working through the MDR processes for regulatory and that's probably a 2023 event like versus 2022. Yes, I know that Jeff did allude to the fact that we really are focused on driving the core businesses. And we now are really looking at NASH as one of the key comorbidities associated with improvements in weight loss as well as things like diabetes and hypertension. And so, we're really trying to look at -- as part of the integrated strategy that's going to maximize the utilization of our products. And originally, the NASH strategy started with Orbera but we really are looking at it in the context of ESG as well and especially ESG now with the clearance. And so that is an area where we absolutely are doing a lot of homework working with thought leaders and hepatology community but also in the diabetology community and others to say which will have the greatest impact and therefore, what the clinical strategy would need to be. So it's one that we're not rushing into a new clinical trial right now, especially given the broader economic environment. Yes, no, it's an insightful question, Frank and it's one that our reimbursement team is working through as part of the overall facility payment side of things. So I mentioned things like new technology codes but you're right, C codes could be part of that strategy as well. And we're working through those details right now. Sure, yes. So on the new -- there are new devices that were cleared the Apollo ESG and the Apollo REVISE devices. There is still some, frankly, kind of logistical elements that go into the packaging around those and being ready to ship that we would expect will still take a few months and probably be early in Q4 when we're shipping the new devices. And that just aligns with what we expected the original time line would have been unusually FDA beat us to it but we were more than happy. So we can still train physicians. We can still speak to the procedure but the actual SKUs being available will be a few months. And then we are also still finalizing the pricing strategy but we do expect they will be opportunity for some premium pricing that would help. But we're still working through the final pieces of that strategy because it will have long-term implications for things like reimbursement and others. And as we get further along, we'll provide an update on that. Well just that, I mean, the ability to have some pricing leverage would absolutely improve and help that and then as Jeff mentioned, the OverStitch and the components OverStitch are our primary focus areas of reducing costs as well. So we've factored that into kind of our overall plans of getting into the mid-60s on gross margin but we'll work that as part of the overall mix as we go forward. Yes, no, you're right, Matt. The interest level has been very high, increased awareness, especially for X-Tack as a new product and having podium presentations about it really for the first time in a big meeting just because it was one of the first really large in-person meetings has been exciting. And that has played well and helps support the 16% sequential growth that I mentioned. And so our sales team is very much focused on building on that momentum and continuing going forward. And we have a balance, right, of now needing to be able to do that while also focusing on the endobariatric side as well. So that will be an important thing that we're going to need to balance that is part of the rationale for the dedicated endobariatric manager roles. And so, we have a certain subset of our sales force that is 100% focused on the endobariatric side, while our reps are carrying the full bag. The short answer is yes, right. That is something -- that has -- what you heard in some of your conversations at DDW, people have been able to do that on a case-by-case basis really is some of the more sophisticated accounts who know how to do this, right and have been able to effectively navigate those conversations. And they've been doing that independent of Apollo. We didn't have the labeling. So, we didn't have a team in place supporting those kinds of efforts. With the labeling, we can implement a team that can help support that and, for example, share best practices. It can even vary by payer, right. Some payers will respond to certain things that really will make a difference in terms of whether a patient gets covered and learning that documenting it and helping people navigate it will be part of our strategy going forward. I think it's a really interesting question of how it will play out. I think people, for the most part, currently assume that the sweet spot will be in the 30 to 40 range, i.e., the MERIT population and that's probably where we will start for the most part. But there were data presented at DDW, as you may recall, by one of our customers that showed very good results in patients with the BMI over 40. I think it was consistently a 20% or more total body weight loss. And that was independent of any medications. So one of the big speculative questions is whether combination therapies will really play a bigger role in that 40-plus range. And I certainly know some surgeons who think that it may well -- but I do think it will kind of go in that sequence. There still is a belief that ESG is typically a little bit lower on the efficacy side but a really good safety profile and a lot of patient benefits will probably start more of a sweet spot in that 30 to 40 range and then maybe migrate up over time. We have seen people think about a kind of bridge to surgery approach at times as well. I'm not sure how common that is. I mean we certainly have heard it a bit more anecdotally. And could that play out over time, possibly. I mean one of the benefits of ESG as you aren't cutting off future treatment options. It's something that surgeons are very interested and know that they can do a sleeve in the future or do a bypass in the future if they choose to -- but I don't expect necessarily a bridge approach will be that widespread at least initially. Sure, yes. No, I appreciate the question. We have a lot of data out to two years. There was just a patient -- a study with 3,000 patients out of the Middle East with very good data out to three years and then there's limited data but some out to five years. So we're in that range. I think our experienced customers who've already been doing this in advance of us talking about it, are careful not to promise it as a panacea and really emphasize the importance of the patient follow-up and patient management in the programs that they do and if they -- how they engage in that can really impact the durability. But then, also, obesity is a chronic disease. And if people understand and expect that, then setting up the possible expectation that, yes, down the line, you need a retightening procedure. And we've got experience with that and good success with it. Or in the future, you may be a candidate for a surgical procedure. These are often part of the conversations and I think we'll be part of how we market it as well. Yes, no Colin, I appreciate that. As we've done our strategic plans, we like, as I mentioned on the call and what we've seen so far, a good balance across both products and geographies. And so I think there is a potential halo effect on -- from ESG and revisions on the balloon. And I mentioned that in terms of sustainable endobariatric practices. We do still continue to see very good traction and growth with X-Tack and that is before the CE mark. So that can be an important growth driver outside the U.S., or especially the economic value proposition of X-Tack is very -- it fits very well with the medical systems. But then having said all of that, I have said before, I think there is an opportunity, given the value proposition I mentioned for ESG to become a market-leading weight loss procedure -- that's not baked in -- I mean, that level of optimism isn't fully baked into that 20% number. I mean if we get to that, we'll be well ahead of that. Just a matter of how long does it take to really put all the pieces together and untapped the opportunity. But given what we're already seeing in people connecting the dots and having good success with growth, we're excited about it. So it's a little bit mix, very good opportunities with ESG and revisions but also balanced growth with other products as well. Just want to reiterate our thanks to everybody for joining us today and we look forward to further updates as the year progresses."

            "name": "Jeff Black",
            "content": "Thank you, Chas and thank you, everybody, for joining us today. I'll spend a few minutes with a financial update give a little commentary on the rest of the year guidance and some discussion about some medium-term targets. First off on Slide 7, just starting off of revenue today again, as Chas said, we reported another quarter of strong year-over-year growth across the whole product portfolio. It's our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. This was the largest revenue quarter on record for Apollo on book of GAAP on a constant currency basis. We grew 18% in the U.S. We're continuing to see the impact of our planned investments. Growth is led by adoption in our endobariatric accounts which Chas will dive into later. We're seeing the benefits of sales force expansion, increased sales force productivity, the continued strength in Orbera on the heels of enhanced marketing efforts. We saw procedural volumes improved throughout the second quarter. There have been some lingering COVID effects but nowhere near to the extent that we saw at the beginning of Q1. We're still seeing some staffing shortages in some hospitals, particularly in academic hospitals, where the -- core GI business is typically very strong. We grew 9% OUS on a constant currency basis again, strong demand in both direct and distributor markets and some competitive wins for both OverStitch and Orbera in some key accounts. We also saw foreign currency headwinds, as Chas mentioned, particularly for the euro which had a nearly $600,000 impact on our year-over-year Q2 growth. And as Chas mentioned, because international sales represent more than 40% of our overall sales we're disproportionately impacted by negative foreign currency impacts compared to similarly sized med tech companies that typically do not have such a large OUS footprint. In other revenue, while not material, was impacted by our planned wind down of our Apollo Care program for Orbera which was outsourced to third-party beginning in 2022. Overall, we're again pleased with our revenue performance in the second quarter and our ability to continue to expand adoption across the portfolio. Moving to revenue guidance on Slide 8, we continue to expect 2022 revenue in the $73 million to $75 million range, cognizant of potential global recessionary impacts lingering pandemic headwinds and most significantly foreign currency pressures from the strengthened dollar, particularly for the euro which currently represents nearly half of our OUS revenue. Our guidance implies fiscal year 2022 growth of 16% and 19% and second half year-over-year growth of about 17% which is essentially flat sequential growth against first half on a GAAP basis. Some of this can be attributed to Q3 seasonality which is typical in our business and we're seeing some of it play out in July. But the biggest impact is foreign currency headwinds. To put this in perspective, the euro foreign currency rate is down 11% since the beginning of 2022 and we've seen similar pressures in most of our OUS geographies. So, on a full year basis we expect foreign currency headwinds of up to $2.1 million in the second half of the year and $3 million on a full year basis. And guidance then on a constant currency basis now implies fiscal year '22 growth and second half '22 growth in the low to mid-20% range. Moving to Slide 10 on non-GAAP OpEx as we look at our -- my apologies, gross margin on Slide 9. As you can see, we're on track with our margin expansion targets. Gross margin improved by 190 basis points versus the first quarter -- of the second quarter of last year. On a constant currency basis, our gross margin improved by 320 basis points to just over 58%. Sequentially, gross margin improved 50 basis points over the first quarter. We saw gross margin expansion on our ESS product line from the impact of 2021 OverStitch COGS improvement projects. We saw improved overhead efficiencies. We also saw some price increase impact for both OverStitch and X-Tack. Major drivers of overall gross margin expansion will continue to be product mix, improved overhead absorption and direct COGS improvement programs focused primarily on OverStitch. We continue to navigate supply chain and manufacturing scale up complexities but we remain confident in our ability to drive blended gross margin to the mid-60% range in the medium term. Now moving to Slide 10 on OpEx as we look at operating spend profile, we think it's important to exclude non-cash stock-based compensation to get a clearer picture of our non-GAAP core operating expense run rate. As we previously said, 2022 is an investment year. In the near term, we're focused on building capabilities following historical underinvestment in the business, the most significant area being sales and marketing in the U.S. For example, in the second quarter, our non-GAAP sales and marketing OpEx ran about 45% of revenue which reflects our planned investments and growth initiatives, primarily in building out our sales channel as we prepare for the launch of Apollo ESG and REVISE products. Our other focused areas of planned investment are in R&D, medical education, clinical reimbursement, product development and again, COGS improvement. And on the G&A side, we'll continue to thoughtfully invest in infrastructure and staff to properly support the business. As we stated, 2022 is an investment year for us with a primary focus on building out our commercial infrastructure in the U.S. to support growing interest and demand for our technologies, especially Apollo ESG and REVISE. But that said, we are modulating spend in light of the changing environment. The more future focused initiatives are now a lower priority. We're setting a very high bar for these kind of investments. For example, we're taking a much more conservative view of investments in longer-term clinical and R&D pipeline initiatives that may not be necessary to support our core business today. While these are all elements that are ultimately critical for longer-term prospects, we have significant flexibility as to how much and when we fund these initiatives. So far in 2022, we've not made any long-term commitments to fund these types of initiatives. In fact, in the first half of 2022, we are well below our OpEx and CapEx spend plans while still on target with our revenue plan. Importantly, we have the ability to modulate spend as appropriate and we're well positioned from a balance sheet perspective to make these investments. With that on Slide 11, addressing our balance sheet in the fourth quarter of last year, we reinforced our balance sheet with $75 million in equity issuance and a new credit facility that will provide up to an additional $65 million in available capital over the next few years. At the end of Q2, we had $140 million in cash and committed cash, including $75 million in cash and equivalents and access to another $40 million over 2023 and '24 based on revenue milestones which are well below our base case expectations. We saw total cash use in the second quarter down by more than $2 million compared to the first quarter which is indicative of our disciplined use of capital even as we continue to make growth investments. We have a multiyear run rate at [indiscernible] our plan with an eye toward investments to take advantage of near-term opportunities in front of us. In terms of 2022 outlook, we expect to end the year with $125 million in cash and committed cash, including more than $60 million in cash and cash equivalents. This implies 2022 cash use of around $30 million which we anticipate is our high watermark for annual burn based upon our base case model. And that brings us to our medium-term business targets and commentary on our path to breakeven. Moving to Slide 12 -- as we've highlighted today in the past quarters, we have the OpEx and CapEx flexibility to greatly enhance our EBITDA and cash burn profile once we've built our organization to scale. And as you can see from the illustrative targets based upon our current base case model, we have a line of sight to positive EBITDA and cash flow breakeven business by the time we reach $150 million in annual revenue. We'll be in a position to make strategic decisions as to whether we enhance investment for accelerating top line growth or more future-focused noncore initiatives or to more aggressively position the company for profitability. But most importantly, based on our current base case model, we have the balance sheet and committed capital today to get us there. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Chas for our business and strategic update. Sure yes Chris, thank you. And to your question on headcount and OpEx modulation, I think it's a combination of two things. It's just being very critical about every dollar of spend and every head count that we add. But on the sales channel and on the commercial organization, it's really less about expense control, to be honest with you and more about the strategy around what is the right mix in the sales force, right. And so, we're really -- we're in many areas, we're really doubling down on this REM role and piloting some REM roles and how they best interplay with the sales reps. And so, that may differ on a geography by geography basis. We may have situations where a sales rep has a broader coverage territory because they have an REM to support them. We may have situations where because of geographic distance, we may have to add more sales reps to cover a more expansive geography and then supplement with more or less REMs. And so it's really more of a piloting around what's the right mix. And so it's less about, hey, let's say, five heads but let's get the mix right. Anything to add to that, Chas? And Simran, just to add to that, just to give a little more color when you see our international performance, what you're seeing is growth in predominantly existing geographies. So we really haven't done a lot of expansion into new geographies and are yet seeing growth in new geographies. So we're very encouraged by that because it is predominantly organic growth."

At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode, and we will open the floor for your questions and comments after the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Matt Kreps. Sir, the floor is yours.\nMatt Kreps: Thank you, John. And thanks everyone for participating in today's call to discuss Apollo's first quarter 2022 financial and operating results. Joining me on the call are Chas McKhann, Chief Executive Officer and Jeff Black, our Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will include slides to accompany the audio presentation. For those of you joining us by telephone-only, you can download a copy of the slides at our investor relations site, ir.apolloendo.com and choosing Events and Presentations. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to caution listeners that comments made by management during this conference call today will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, including Apollo's financial outlook and Apollo's plans and timing for product development and sales. In addition, there is uncertainty about the continued spread of COVID-19 virus and the ongoing impact it may have on our operations, the demand for our products, global supply chains, and economic activity in general. These forward-looking statements involve material risks and uncertainties, and Apollo's actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of risk factors, I encourage you to review the company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and our most recent Form 10-Q. The content of this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, May 3, 2022. Except as required by law, Apollo undertakes no obligation to revise or update any statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call. Additionally, today's discussion will include certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide an additional tool for evaluating the company's core performance. Management uses these metrics in its own evaluation of continuing operating performance, and a baseline for assessing the future earnings potential of the company. Included in our press release issued today is our financial results and corresponding 8-K filing, our supplemental tables reconciling non-GAAP figures to their closest GAAP comparable. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Chas.\nChas McKhann: Thank you, Matt, and thank you, everybody, for joining us here today. We really appreciate it. So look, we are about a year into a new strategy to transform Apollo. And I'm really excited about the progress that we've made in a relatively short period of time. We've repositioned the company to go after larger market opportunities, and we're building a much stronger organization that's poised to capitalize on those opportunities as we focus on energizing the business and then over the course of this year, moving into an acceleration mode and eventually building leadership positions in the markets we serve. This afternoon, we reported solid performance for the first quarter of the year with sales of $16.7 million, and that was even in the face of the Omicron wave that impacted a lot of companies and procedures around the world really, and then other global macroeconomic challenges, which we'll refer to over the course of the call. But despite that, and I'll -- some of the highlights for the quarter, we achieved 20% year-on-year growth. And it was well-balanced growth. It was 24% in our ESS franchise. That's our OverStitch device and our X-Tack product. And we also achieved 16% growth with our intragastric balloon franchise, and so again, nice balance across our products. This quarter, our growth was primarily driven by the US with 33% growth in the US, 40% for IGB franchise, 34% for ESS, so really nice performance here in the US. An interesting fact here over what we've observed, and this is an extension of what we reported on our prior call. Our top 10 accounts grew by 63% year-on-year. And these are not distributors, these are individual accounts. And the average sales in those top 10 accounts, is right around $1 million annualized. So it gives you a sense of what we can achieve, when our customers really incorporate Apollo's products into their clinical practice and really make it a focus of patient care. And then in addition, we achieved 14% sequential growth in the number of ordering accounts for X-Tack here in the US. And we also achieved sequential sales growth in terms of -- so ordering accounts up 14% as well as sequential growth in X-Tack sales quarter-on-quarter. And so while delivering on a strong quarter, we also remain very focused on a broader set of priorities for the overall year, both delivering on the near term but also building the foundation for the growth in years to come. And so, our four main priorities. First is to expand our core GI business and defect closure and fixation. And that's inclusive of both OverStitch and X-Tack. It involves training new users, continue to build adoption and preparing for the approval of X-Tack, the CE mark approval outside the US. Second priority is leveraging a resurgence in ORBERA. The intragastric balloon franchise has done very well since I've gotten here, and it's been a big important part of our business, continues to grow. We want to make sure that's sustainable growth, and we're putting a lot of focus and energy behind that. And that fits part and parcel with our third priority, which is preparing for the launch of Apollo ESG and Apollo REVISE. We're working through the process with the FDA for a new regulatory clearance and preparing for the new product launch associated with that. And all the while building the organization. We need to have the right capabilities in place to make sure that we can go after those opportunities, and we've been making very important ads really top to bottom, and I will come back to that. So, Jeff is going to provide some updates on the financial results in the quarter, and then I will come back and talk through each of these four priorities to give you updates on how we're doing against each of them. Jeff?\nJeff Black: Thank you, Chas, and thank you, everybody, for joining the call today. As Chas said, I'll spend a few minutes here on a little bit of a deeper dive into the financials and then turn it back over to Chas for a more detailed business update. Starting with slide 7 on revenue, again, a strong year-over-year growth across the product portfolio. It was our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. And excluding the legacy Lap-Band business, this was the largest revenue quarter on record for Apollo. 33% growth in the US, so we are beginning to see the impact of our planned investments, specifically the expansion of the sales force, while still early stages, we're beginning to see traction and increased productivity. We saw a continued strength in ORBERA on the heels of enhanced marketing efforts. And again, still some lingering effects of COVID on hospital access and staffing, particularly in academic hospitals, where core GI business is typically very strong. We saw 6% growth outside the US, strong demand in distributor markets, offset by continued pressure in the quarter in concentrated direct markets, particularly Western Europe, where we also believe to be lingering pandemic effects. Significant foreign currency impacts, particularly for the euro, which had a nearly $300,000 impact on year-over-year growth. On a constant currency basis, our OUS growth was 10%. Global growth was 22%. And just as a reminder, because international sales represent more than 40% of our overall revenue, we're disproportionately impacted by negative foreign currency impacts compared to similarly sized Medtech companies that typically don't have such a large OUS footprint. Other revenue, while it's not material, it was impacted by our planned wind down of Apollo Care for Orbera, which we outsourced to a third-party beginning in 2022. This will ensure we can properly scale support for Orbera, as that business continues to expand without a material financial impact to Apollo. Overall, we're again pleased with our revenue performance in the first quarter and our ability to successfully navigate a generally slow start for Medtech. In terms of outlook for 2022, we continue to expect 2022 revenue of $73 million to $75 million, while we're cognizant of potential global recessionary impacts, lingering pandemic headwinds and foreign currency pressures from a strengthened dollar, particularly for the euro, which currently represents nearly half of our OUS revenue. Moving to gross margin on Slide 8. Gross margin improved by 210 basis points over a year ago. In the US, our margin increased from a higher Orbera mix as well as margin expansion on our ESS product lines. We're seeing the impact of 2021 OverStitch COGS improvement projects. We're seeing improved overhead efficiencies, and we also saw some price increase impact for both OverStitch and X-Tack. The margin expansion that we saw in the US was offset by a higher mix of distributor sales, OUS, which have a lower gross margin profile. We remain focused on continued gross margin improvements, particularly with OverStitch, which has a lower gross margin profile than the Orbera and X-Tack. So major drivers continue to be in gross margin expansion in the future will be product mix, improved overhead absorption, direct COGS improvement programs, like I said, focused primarily on OverStitch. And at the same time, we're navigating supply chain and manufacturing scale-up complexities, but we remain confident that we'll drive blended gross margin to the mid-60% range in the next three to five years. Moving to OpEx on Slide 9. As we look at operating spend profile, as we've done in the past, we think it's important to exclude non-cash stock-based compensation to get just a clearer picture of what our non-GAAP core operating run rate is. And as we previously said, 2022 is an investment year for us. In the near-term, we remain focused on building capabilities following historical underinvestment in the business. The most significant area of increased investment is in sales and marketing in the United States. For example, in the fourth quarter, you'll see our non-GAAP sales and marketing OpEx ran at about 48% of revenue. This reflects our planned investments in growth initiatives, primarily building out the channel, marketing programs as we prepare for the anticipated launch of our ESG products. As we've said before, in the US, we still have a very small commercial team relative to the size of our opportunities. We made substantial progress a year ago or last year, expanding our footprint. We continue to do so. At the end of 2021, we had a commercial team of just under 30 in the field. We grew that to 30 territory managers and two regional Endobariatric managers at the end of the first quarter. This team is ramping up. We anticipate further improvements in rep productivity as they gain additional time and territory and experience with our products and customers. Going forward, we continue to evaluate the appropriate scale of our commercial team and we'll invest as necessary. Other focused area of our planned investments, are in R&D, medical education, clinical reimbursement, product development and gross margin improvement. And on the G&A side, we will continue to thoughtfully invest in infrastructure and staff to properly support the business, but we expect to see the heaviest investment in both sales and marketing and R&D. Importantly, that we have the ability to modulate spend as appropriate. And we're well positioned from a balance sheet perspective to make these investments. So with that said, before I turn it over to Ted, just a couple of comments on cash use and burn. Moving to our balance sheet, slide 10, as you may recall, last year, we secured over $175 million in new capital and borrowing capacity, enabling us to begin making investments required to capitalize on the opportunities in front of us without really creating a concern about cash runway. This positions us very well, with a multiyear runway to execute the business, which is especially important now in what has turned out to be an uncertain and volatile capital markets environment. As we expected, we saw a planned up-tick in cash burn in the first quarter relative to 2021. Of particular note, nearly 1/3 of that burn was $2.9 million in working capital, which represents the pay down of 2021 year-end accruals as well as inventory builds to support the expected growth in demand for our products. Even with our planned increase in average quarterly burn, we're extremely well positioned to execute on our planned growth initiatives with nearly $150 million in cash and committed cash at the end of the first quarter. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Chas.\nChas McKhann: Thank you, Jeff. So turning to slide 12, just a quick reminder for those who are new to Apollo, we've got our three different product lines, our X-Tack product, OverStitch and the ORBERA intragastric balloon and that's really focused across two different therapeutic areas: our advanced GI focus as well as endobariatric or endoscopic weight loss. And as you'll see on slide 13, we continue to be focused on large market opportunities and developing from a product standpoint, but also clinical development and reimbursement otherwise, all the different elements that we think will be required to go after these opportunities. I mentioned our four priorities across the business for the year. And so let's provide an update here on each of them. First, on the core GI, the defect closure and fixation side of our business. We've got OverStitch, which really is a unique one-of-a-kind product, primarily focused on full thickness suturing in the upper GI. We are continuing to work to build and develop the defect closure side of the business with OverStitch. That involves training new users as well as expanding the different applications that users -- that our customers use OverStitch and making sure that they're familiar with and really apply the product in such a wide range of opportunities, which we know it can in fact positively impact patient care. That's true also in the -- outside the U.S. where the core GI has been a lower percentage of our overall business for OverStitch, and we've got plans in place that we're executing to build that part of the business outside the U.S. We then add in X-Tack, which as you can see on the chart, is a really nice complement OverStitch. It fills an important therapeutic gap between Through-the-scope clips and OverStitch in terms of complexity of the defect and size of the defect and the durability of the fixation. And again, we continue to make very good progress. We just launched X-Tack right around this time last year. And so we're seeing still very good progress with customers. We continue to refine our targeting and focus on high-volume centers. We continue to develop our sales training. As Jeff mentioned, we have a relatively new sales force with more than half the reps in the US hired within the last year. We continue to build the supporting body of clinical evidence and I'm going to come back in a minute to the upcoming DDW Meeting, which is the Digestive Disease Week Meeting. It's the largest GI meeting in the world and we expect both OverStitch and X-Tack to be very well represented at that meeting. We're expanding our peer-to-peer marketing programs, both through things like webcast. We just did an outstanding one with Dr. Darin Dufault from Duke University as well as old-fashioned face-to-face meetings where colleagues can hear from each other in terms of how they're applying this new device into their clinical practices. And then finally, we are absolutely working on preparing for the OUS launch of X-Tack. We already have a presence in a few select markets outside the US. The most recent one has been Australia, which we are just getting going here as of this month. But the key one will be getting CE Mark clearance for X-Tack, and we're still working through that regulatory process and -- but preparing commercially for when that occurs, and we'll be excited when it does. The next slide just shows some of the -- just the complements around OverStitch and X-Tack. You can see the kind of blue dots on the page, and for those of you who aren't -- don't have the slides in front of you, basically, what it's showing is that X-Tack opens up the right side of the colon, the lower GI for us. And that's where the predominant of procedures are in the lower GI and these are polyp-removal procedures. So, think about when you're in your colonoscopy and they find a large polyp defect that needs to be removed. If it's over about two centimeters, there's a lot of evidence that those are the defects that need to be prophylactically closed. And that's an important target market for X-Tack. But in addition, our customers are finding many other core applications for the device, which is great to see and many of them are listed on the page. So, fistulas and perforations, a POEM procedure, which is more of an upper GI procedure, mucosal tear, there's a whole range. And so we're pleased to see the progress there and continue to build and capitalize on that. Next slide. So, next up is ORBERA. Again, we want to continue to maintain the momentum with ORBERA and really ensure that it's sustainable because it's been a tremendous turnaround for a product and a category that frankly struggled for a number of years, but we've seen very nice growth with ORBERA. We've seen it globally. We continue to capitalize on some macro factors in terms of weight gain during the pandemic and coming out of the pandemic, I think, has been favorable to a product that has a lot of evidence of at least a 10% total body weight loss. Right around this time last year, we have the new AGA Clinical Practice guidelines. First time ever that a major society endorsed intragastric balloon therapy and that's kind of a seal of approval as it were for intragastric balloon therapy. We are proud of the fact that ORBERA has, by far, the most clinical evidence of any intragastric balloon in the market and it's an important element to a safety and trust element around the product. We've seen an increase in physician interest. We've done more training for ORBERA in the US in the past few months than we've done in a number of years. And we're putting more focus on it from a sales and marketing standpoint, which is helping to contribute to the sustainability of those results. And then importantly, we're seeing some very important competitive wins outside the US. In the US, we are primarily the main product available for intragastric balloons. There's a recent market entrant that's still in the very early stages of having to do a post-approval trial. So we're really in the US. Outside the US, it is a very competitive market, but we are seeing nice wins outside the US that are helping to contribute to our ongoing growth. And it comes back to you that we've got a really good product with a long track record of safety and efficacy. And then that ties right into our broader strategy around endobariatric, and our preparation for the launch of Apollo ESG and Apollo REVISE. So we showed this slide on the last earnings call, and I'll just use this as an opportunity to provide some important updates as we are working across a broad comprehensive launch plan for these products. We are still working through the De Novo 510(k) clearance with the FDA and we'll look forward to providing input an update on that as things progress. We are actively engaging with leading physician societies on both the GI and the surgery side. On the GI side, there's groups like the American Gastroenterology Association and the ASGE, two of the leading societies as well as ACG, so a lot of GI societies. There's also major surgical societies. So SAGES and then the ASMBS, which is the metabolic Surgery Society. And we've been spending a lot of time with them describing our plans around the new indications, talking to them about where we see endoscopic therapies fitting within the broader continuum of care and making sure that we've got good alignment across, again, both GIs and surgeons. And then talking about ways we can best work together on important elements of things like training and education and support on efforts on things like reimbursement and market access. And those have been very productive discussions. And I think a big part of a broader market development process that we're working on. We are aware of efforts that a number of these societies already have underway on things like clinical practice guidelines. Now those processes take time. There's a lot that goes into a new set of practice skylines. But the fact that they're already working on those efforts is a really good sign that the societies are looking towards where these new procedures will fit in the broader continuum of care. We are also actively learning from our early adopters. There are a number of customers, both in -- outside the US as well as in the US that are already incorporating ESG and revisions into their clinical practice. We are very careful from a promotional standpoint, but physicians can use OverStitch for these procedures. And so, we are already kind of learning from those customers. And we call them internally the waven accounts. And it's really interesting because what we're seeing is a really nice mix of different models. We see some models that are in academic medical centers, some of the leading centers in the world. We see others that are individual private practice physicians or small groups of physicians, and we're seeing success in either case. We're seeing some models that are surgeon led. We're seeing some models that are GI led. We've seen some that are integrated, GIS and surgeons working together. There are commonalities though. The ones that are most successful have a laser focus on clinical outcomes and how they're working to make sure before the procedure, during the procedure and after the procedure and patient follow-up that they're doing everything necessary to achieve the best possible outcomes for patients. And so we're kind of going to school on those initial set of customers. We're developing the playbooks that we will be using with the next waves of accounts as they move forward once we get a new indication. In the meantime, we can gain a lot of practical experience with ORBERA. I mentioned the renewed marketing efforts around ORBERA. I'll give you an example. We are doing co-marketing programs with some of these Wave 1 accounts, frankly, who offer the intragastric balloon, as well as some other accounts that have demonstrated the ability to attract patients and talk to them about the procedures and ensure that if you're doing marketing, patient marketing, that it results in actual procedures. And so, we've been able to do that with ORBERA. We initiated this late last year and had been moving forward here and having really good outcomes and experience and measurable results that we can both obviously support the ORBERA business, but also learn in terms of how this will play ultimately in a broader endobariatric world. So we're excited by those early learnings, and we're going to keep building on them. And then last, but certainly not least, we are absolutely building out our reimbursement and market access team. We, in January, announced the hiring of a new VP of Reimbursement and Market Access. Chas since added a Director of Payer Engagement, who has already joined and is a full-time employee focused specifically on how we will work with payers. And we are strengthening our capabilities in areas like health economics and others. So this is a critically important area and a broader market development and a set of skills and capabilities that we are really building here at Apollo. So a few times now, I've already mentioned the upcoming Digestive Disease Week meeting, and we're really excited about it. So this is the largest gastroenterology meeting in the world. This is the first time the meeting will be taking place in person for three years. It's been gone to virtual in the last couple of years. And so, as we talk to people in the medical community, they're really excited to get back together. I think the fact that it's in San Diego doesn't hurt. But as part of that, what we're really looking forward to is that, simply put, we expect DDW to be an excellent showcase of Apollo's products and procedures. They've only, at this point, released the preliminary agenda. More details will be coming out in the next week or two. So even based off of these preliminary information from the organizers, we are already aware of over 40 posters and video presentations about Apollo products and procedures and more than 60 lectures and podium presentations. So there's going to be a lot of discussion about Apollo products at the meeting, and including some important new clinical data and new clinical studies. So let me highlight a few there. And again, this is a preliminary list, before the meeting, we will likely do a press release informing you of others to be on a lookout for DDW. First is the MERIT study. Many of you know, MERIT is the randomized controlled trial that Apollo sponsored, testing the ESG procedure compared to diet and exercise. The preliminary results were presented at the IPSO meeting, a surgery meeting in a virtual session in October. And I'm pleased to report that, at DDW, the full results of MERIT will be released by Dr. Barham Abu Dayyeh in two sessions, both in a plenary session on Saturday, May 21, and then again in more detail in a full session on Tuesday at the meeting. So very excited for the full results for MERIT. It will just be additive to the information we've already -- that's already been presented. Another really interesting presentation will come from Dr. Chris McGowan. Chris is -- Dr. McGowan is based out of Cary, North Carolina, private practice position at True You Weight Loss. He does an excellent job of following up all his patients, and he's going to be presenting data on patients with Class III obesity, meaning patients with a BMI of more than 40. And so we're looking forward to those data and the presentation of Dr. McGowan. Dr. Reem Sharaiha from Cornell is going to be presenting a five-year follow-up data with comorbidity information and the impact on comorbidities, and Dr. Beran is also going be presenting systematic review, pardon me \u2013 and meta-analysis comparing ESG to laparoscopic sleeves. And again, this is just a cross-section of some of the data that will be presented. On the revision side, Dr. Anna Carolina Hoff has a oral presentation focused on combination therapy of revisional procedures along with GLP-1 inhibitors. As many of you may recall that last year at the DDW meeting, Dr. Hoff had one of the top papers at DDW focused on combination therapy of ESG plus semaglutide. It was a randomized controlled trial and the headline was basically that when you combine ESG plus semaglutide, which has the brand name Wegovy, you get essentially surgical level of outcomes. It was more than 25% total body weight loss in that study. And so we're excited to see the new presentation from Dr. Hoff. And we are well aware that some of the newer medications, including semaglutide and the recent results from a new medication from Eli Lilly and Company. We expect will have an important impact in addressing the global obesi epidemic, but we see a really interesting role in combination therapies, and so more data on that will be coming at DDW. Not to be outdone, the defect closure side of our business will also be very well represented at the meeting. There is a session, I think, this is on Saturday that Dr. Christopher Gostout, who is our Chief Medical Officer, is co-chairing with Dr. Harry Aslanian from Yale University that's going to be talking about defect closure in everyday practice. And that will include discussions around suturing with OverStitch and case studies with X-Tack. There is new data from a multicenter experience on X-Tack. There is a new another study looking specifically at X-Tack in colonic EMR defects. There's another paper involved with ESD closure. So again, this is just a summary of what we expect to be a significant amount of information at the meeting, so we're excited about that. Speaking of clinical data, a study that was released in Q1 that I'll draw your attention to. And I'm on slide 20 for those who are following along. This was in GIE -- Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, which is one of the leading journals in the field. So the study was authored by Dr. Alqahtani out of Saudi Arabia. And one of the most impressive element -- one element is just the scale of the study. It is -- it involves more than 3,000 patient pairs. It's a propensity match study of ESG compared to patients who received laparoscopic sleeve. So that's more than a 6,000 patient study, which is really unusual in the device world. Some of the headlines is that it showed durable results with ESG out to three years with a 14% total body weight loss at sustained out to three years. In addition, the comorbidity remission in this study with ESG was very similar to what was found in LSG patients. And, in fact, was slightly better in the areas of dyslipidemia and hypertension. Showed an excellent safety profile for the procedures. We're just showing that in real-world clinical practice, ESG is a very safe procedure. And then also provides good evidence that, if patients needed it, they could either get a repeat ESG basically a retightening, or they could revert to an LSG. And that's important. It's an important element to be able to leave all options open to patients. And we've known that about ESG, but to have additional clinical data that shows the feasibility of that, important, especially to a surgical audience who like to know that they can still have different options available to them. Turning now to the organization side of our business and things we're developing. On the left is a summary of the core values of Apollo that we've really focused on. We're very focused on building a strong culture of the company, a winning culture that's customer-focused, it's patient-focused, and it's a big part of who we are. So we've been introducing these internally. It's becoming a big part of how we manage our business. And all the while, we are adding to the organization really from top to bottom as it were. We are very pleased to announce just a few weeks ago, having announced the hiring of Jeannette Bankes to join our Board of Directors. Jeannette is the President and General Manager of the Global Surgical franchise at Alcon. And she brings tremendous experience in developing and commercializing new technologies, including in markets around the world. So really good global experience and so we are thrilled to have Jeanette join our Board of Directors. I mentioned new hires in the reimbursement and market access side. We've promoted a new Head of VP of R&D to really renew and reengage our efforts on the pipeline development. And then as Jeff mentioned, we are selectively and very targeted making additions throughout the organization to make sure that we've got the right scale to grow. One of the biggest areas that we are focusing on, and you saw it in the financial numbers, has been on our commercial team and so just an update of where we are. We are \u2013 as Jeff mentioned, we've grown \u2013 added a few positions here over the first part of the year in the US and plan to continue to grow over the course of the year. We are adding new training capabilities as we do have a relatively new team. And we've seen increased productivity as we brought people on board, but we absolutely expect that to continue going forward. We're improving our sales and analytics. And as I described in some of the launch planning for ESG, we really are building out our marketing capabilities as well. Importantly, on the OUS side of our business, as Jeff mentioned, it is more than 40% of our business, and we're making important additions there as well. Again, selective adds in key markets to drive growth, especially on the ESS side and preparing for the X-Tack launch. We really have reignited our physician training programs outside the US. They did struggle for a while during the COVID period, and even into next year because many of those trading programs do require travel. And as we all know, international travel has had its challenges. But when they are fully running again, we've had great participation. And we're also developing plans to expand into large untapped market opportunities. Just today in the earnings release, we announced in Japan. So we've had some access into Japan through some limited use kind of pathways, but we've just received clearance for OverStitch Sx in Japan, which is a nice opportunity for us. We still have some work to do on the reimbursement front, but this will allow us to continue to build and grow there. We've got initial footholds into the Chinese market that also can build and grow and expand over time. And somewhat ironically, given the sale of our international business in Canada, we currently have clearances for the Intragastric Balloon, but do not have yet clearances for X-Tack and OverStitch, and we're working to address those as well. So continued significant growth opportunities outside the US while we grow and develop in the US as well. And by the way, when I mentioned the prelaunch planning around ESG and Apollo REVISE, many of the elements that we're working on in the US have broad applicability outside the US as well, because we are able to really -- for example, the reimbursement efforts that we focus on here in other markets, we will focus on as well. And so to wrap up, we delivered a solid quarter in Q1 despite some of the macroeconomic headwinds, and we also have made substantial progress across each of our priorities for the year, and we remain very excited about the prospects for our products and our procedures and the impact that we can have in markets around the world. And so with that, let me turn it back over to John for the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Okay. And the first question here is coming from Matt Hewitt with Craig-Hallum Capital. Your line is live\nQ \u2013 Matt Hewitt: Thank you. And congratulations on the strong quarter, kind of bucking the normal seasonal pattern, especially given the headwinds you faced in January from COVID. I guess my first question is regarding progress with X-Tack, I think last quarter, you really started to focus on your desire to drive utilization. I think during your prepared remarks, you mentioned 14% growth, if I heard you correctly. Do you have kind of a target that you're hoping to hit from a utilization standpoint, or how should we be looking at that over the remainder of this year and going forward?\nA \u2013 Chas McKhann: Yes. No, Matt, thank you. Appreciate the question. We were pleased with sequential growth, both in new accounts as well as in overall utilization with X-Tack. That was despite what often we do see some seasonal patterns as well as there was a pretty significant COVID impact here in the first part of the quarter. It improved as the quarter progressed. I think that's a very consistent theme with other med tech companies as well. And so we will look to continue to build on that same kind of quarter-on-quarter additional growth as we -- as our newer reps get up to speed as it were as new data comes out, all the different elements I mentioned. And so we feel good about a prime continued sequential growth quarter-to-quarter, and that's what we'll be looking for from our US sales team. And then over time, we'll add on the US side of that as well.\nQ \u2013 Matt Hewitt: Understood. Okay. And then one of the questions that I get a lot, especially here over the past couple of weeks when others from -- on the device side have been reporting is this question about how much of Q1, were you seeing a rebound in just getting back to normal, or was there some backlog to kind of work through? And maybe if you could walk through what you're seeing even now through April, are we getting back to a normal that it's not so much a backlog. This is a normal growth rate for the business and what we should be expecting going forward?\nA \u2013 Chas McKhann: Yes, it's a good question and one that's a little hard to tease out, except to say that we certainly saw an impact in late last year and early this year. We did see a nice improvement over the course of the quarter. But I think it varies by different segments and different markets. We didn't see a sort of snapback rebound that, I think, for example, orthopedics, some did. Because where we saw the biggest impacts were in some of the larger academic medical centers and the equivalents in places like Europe, and those have come back, but a bit more gradually because you have a combination of both COVID, but also -- and I'm sure you guys have all heard about various staffing-related issues that impact a lot of those same institutions. So we're seeing an improvement, but we haven't really felt it as a snapback rebound more just a good gradual improvement and I think we're tracking in the right direction.\nMatt Hewitt: Got it. And then maybe one last one for me, and I'll hop back in the queue and it kind of touches on what you're just saying there, as far as staffing issues and some of that, I think, at least on the hospital side, as we're reading it is some doctors are just transferring from one hospital to another. In other cases, they are leaving the market. But does that -- I would imagine that, that actually can represent an opportunity for you as well, a doctor that's familiar with OverStitch and Orbera and X-Tack and leaving one practice and going to another, bringing you along gives you a new in a new group to train or bring up to speed. Are you seeing some of that with some of the issues that healthcare has been seeing on the hiring side, or what could -- what do you think is going to drive that next leg of adoption, or is it just hitting the payment and introducing the products.\nChas McKhann: Yes. Now let me separate out two things. I think the bigger constraint we've seen has been more on the nurse side than on the physician side. And again, these have been well documented and just in the types of settings I've mentioned. And I think the situation is improving, but that's been coming out of COVID, just a challenge for certain institutions. And I think, like I said, they're starting to get a handle on it and it's improving. On the physician side, there is some movement, but mostly for us, it really is just a matter of continuing to train new users for -- across our products. And then doing, as you said, the leg work once someone is trained, making sure they become totally comfortable with the devices and the procedures and expanding the different kinds of procedures they can use it for in the case of both OverStitch and X-Tack. And in the case of the Orbera side of things, understanding how to really develop their practices and patient marketing some of those other areas where we're doing some of the co-marketing elements.\nMatt Hewitt: Got it. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Okay. The next question is coming from Adam Maeder with Piper Sandler. Your line is live.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, Charles and Jeff, this is Simran on for Adam. Congrats on a great quarter, guys. I guess I'll start off asking about just kind of your business and exiting Q1, you said there's some momentum with recovery. So how should we think about models in Q2 and quarterly cadence throughout the duration of the year?\nChas McKhann: Sure. We've -- we've been investing, as Jeff mentioned, in different aspects of growth. And so certainly are looking to continue to see that. We saw a good evidence of results of that in Q1, but I do expect to see that progress. And certainly to achieve our guidance range for the year, we expect that to continue to step up and are focused on delivering on that. And that will be globally based to get things like some order patterns outside the US with some of our distributors as well. And so we feel good about a nice progression here and reiterating our guidance even with -- and Jeff alluded to this, but just to be really clear, we do have a bit of a headwind on the FX side, more than most companies our size, but are still focused on the guidance we've delivered and internally, we want to exceed that.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Perfect. Should we be seeing any meaningful impact from the cadence of new product launches that you could potentially be having this year in terms of ESG revised as well as OverStitch in Japan, just kind of what can you say about the impact of these launches and approvals?\nChas McKhann: Sure. Yeah. No, so for ESG and revise, when we submitted to the FDA, which was back in -- late in Q3 of last year, we said that on average, de novo 510(k) take about a year. That is average. There is -- there are wide error bars in those data because de novo 510(k) almost by definition, have a little bit more uncertainty than a traditional 510(k). So it's a little hard to pinpoint. We are preparing for it, and we hope to see that in the second half of the year and doing everything we can to support that process. The -- another big launch that we are working on, clearly, is the X-Tack launch outside the US. We have spoken on previous calls about there's a regulatory change in paradigm going on in Europe. There's a transition to the medical device regulations MDR. You guys may be familiar with your other med tech companies you follow as well. The net result of that is just things are taking longer. And so if we do see an impact, it would be later in the year that we expect, and we said that throughout that it's going to take a while. And then the Japan side for OverStitch, we're very pleased to get the clearance. As I mentioned in my comments, there's still some regulatory work to be done to really open up the market around OverStitch, but it will, I think, on the margin, have some positive impacts on our US business.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Perfect. And then if I could squeeze in one more. Anything to call out from a supply chain standpoint? And just going off of that, how should we think about gross margin trajectory this year with those gross margin improvement projects that you guys are working on for OverStitch in particular?\nJeff Black: Yeah, Serena [ph], this is Jeff. Yeah, I think as we've said in the past, I think -- we don't expect that we'll see any sort of step change in margin. It will be a gradual improvement. And a lot of what you saw in -- or what you saw in Q1 was really a mix of a number of factors, overhead efficiency. And as we improve the top line, we'll start to see even better efficiencies on overhead absorption. We did start to see the impact of the cost improvement projects that we executed last year. We'll continue to see those. So I would say expect more of a gradual improvement as opposed to any step change in any single quarter. Your question on supply chain, I would characterize our supply chain complexity is less about supply and more about just ensuring that we are working closely with our contract manufacturers on capacity and staffing. But we've not run into any situations where we're overly concerned about either incremental costs that we're not expecting or significant capacity constraints that we're not able to address.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Perfect. Thank you for taking my questions.\nChas McKhann: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Up next, we have Chris Cooley with Stephens. Your line is live.\nChris Cooley: Good afternoon and congratulations on a great start to the year. Just two quick ones for me, if I may. First, when you think about your top 10 accounts, that was very impressive when we think about the sequential dollar or the implied annual run rate growth coming from about $600,000 at the end of last year to approximately $1 million now. Could you help us better understand the characterization of these accounts? I'm assuming these are primarily endobariatric practices, but what's leading to that kind of step-up in growth? And then how do you scale that beyond those top 10? I've got one quick follow-up after that. Thank you.\nChas McKhann: Yes, Chris. We're excited to see the traction that some of these larger accounts are getting. And it's a mix in terms of the nature of the accounts. Some of them are not endobariatric. I mean they're just kind of broad-based users of across the portfolio, some of the larger academic centers. But I would say the majority -- and this is -- it's a global list, so inclusive of both the US and internationally are some of these early adopters are really embracing the endobariatric side of things. And so for that group, that goes back to a bit of the homework we're doing on how they're approaching the markets, right? They are seeing a really good response to, frankly, the procedures they're offering, right, between intragastric balloons and being a part of that for many of them, not all, but for most. But then also with the ESG and endoscopic revisions, it's a nice affirmation for us that the value proposition resonates with patients. And that's true today even in a primarily cash pay environment or as I've mentioned before, in the kind of case-by-case reimbursement situations that some have access to. But it's been really nice to see. And we will be excited at a time when we do have indication to say how do we support that or look to ways that others can follow in their footsteps.\nChris Cooley: Appreciate the additional color there. And then you touched on this a little bit in a prior question, but I just want to make sure we fully appreciate the underlying kind of trends here. But when we think about X-Tack, I realize it's still very early days there. But just going back to the third quarter of last year and in the fourth quarter, and then now, we've had a fairly decent deceleration sequentially in the growth rate. And you touched on COVID, obviously, as we started the calendar year, some seasonality there and I'm assuming heightened focus on OverStitch post the MERIT study. But can you just kind of help us unpack a little bit that sequential deceleration in the growth rate from the 4Q to the 1Q? I think it was 40 to 14, if I have my math correct and 70 back in the third quarter, which I would assume would be arbitrarily high as you were ramping up. But just help us kind of understand that trend and then how we should think about that going forward here throughout calendar 2022? Thank you.\nChas McKhann: Yes, I think there are a number of factors going on, Chris. One is there is some things around, for example, both seasonality and some COVID impacts, which impacts a bit of what you see in terms of those numbers. We also see, as you move from an environment early on in the launch where a lot of it has to do with some stocking of new accounts and moving to true utilization. And so I think our utilization -- our underlying growth in utilization is probably a little higher from that standpoint. And then we're continuing, I think, in the kind of focus with our sales team of building that sustainable growth. And certainly, we'd like to see continued and even improved quarter-on-quarter growth. And some of that is just some of the newer folks fully getting up to speed and delivering it and producing at the level we expect them to. So, it's a big focus area for us to make sure we continue to sustain it. And I do think that additional clinical information and critical validation around X-Tack, for example, at DDW meeting, will help a lot.\nChris Cooley: Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. The next question is coming from Matthew Blackman with Stifel. Your line is live.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Colin on for Matt. I wanted to focus on X-Tack for a minute. As you guys mentioned, it's currently underweight in that lower GI use segment, which is really a much broader market opportunity. What are sort of the next steps in addressing that opportunity? Are you focused on education as the first priority, or is it really access to practices with a different focus than your new overage practices, you use OverStitch and ORBERA a lot, or is it really adding that clinical data, which you guys plan to present at DDW? Thanks.\nChas McKhann: Yeah. Thanks, Colin. It's a little bit of all the above. You've kind of touched on a number of the things that we are in the process of doing and have been, but I think are really emphasizing here. One, it's not surprising that we have an established customer base that is more familiar in the upper GI, and so really pushing our reps to move beyond kind of the established customers into a broader set. That is easier to do as we expand our team and they've got kind of smaller territories. And so we're absolutely doing that. We also have better targeting data with more recent clinical procedure numbers that allows them to be able to really focus on where the volumes are and make sure they're engaging the right physicians there. We're doing more in terms of engaging some of the key KOLs that really are the experts in the lower GI and having good -- very good experiences with some of them. But I do think the last piece around clinical data does matter. And so some of the data sets in colonic EMRs, that I mentioned in my opening comments, will be important. We don't know the outcomes of those studies, but we -- anecdotally, we've heard very good things about how people have done. So again, once we certainly know the outcomes of what is presented and both presentations and posters at DDW, being able to leverage that in those conversations. And a lot of the peer-to-peer kind of marketing is really important. I mentioned doing webcast and face-to-face, just making sure people are hearing from their colleagues about how they are incorporating this new approach into their clinical practice. Inertia is a powerful thing in medicine, and we're looking to change that.\nUnidentified Analyst: I appreciate that. And then on the new hires in the U.S. at late 2022 and -- a late 2021 and during the first quarter, I was wondering if they're focused on preparing for either the X-Tack U.S. launches or the ESG revised releases and approvals or if they're really focused on selling the full bag of the three products? Any color there would be helpful? Thanks.\nChas McKhann: Sure. So we're kind of doing two things simultaneously. We've got our territory managers that typically are focused on selling each of the products. And especially as a new hire getting up to speed on the training around them, the procedures, supporting the accounts and focusing across all three products. In parallel, Jeff and his comments on one of the slides we've mentioned, this newer role of what we're calling a regional endobariatric manager. These are folks that are either been hired or in some cases, rehired or come back to Apollo, who understand all of the different components that will be required to really have a successful practice kind of from a patient standpoint, before the procedure, during the procedure and after the procedure and can really help support and develop those efforts. For now, it's very much focused on ORBERA, because it's on label for us, and they can kind of focus on those efforts while getting to know the practice is involved. And right now, as Jeff mentioned, at the end of the quarter, we have two of those roles very much was a pilot phase to make sure it's delivering the way we think it can. And then assuming, it does and as we move forward with the indication, that's an area that we would plan to enhance and grow. So you have not a splitting of the sales force, but kind of a layering of different capabilities.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: I would now like to turn the floor back to Chas McKhann for closing remarks.\nChas McKhann: Well, listen, thank you all very much for joining us today. We appreciate your time and your support. On this slide, we have upcoming activities, and you're welcome to join of them. And then otherwise, we really appreciate your time today. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

And I'm really excited about the progress that we've made in a relatively short period of time. We've repositioned the company to go after larger market opportunities, and we're building a much stronger organization that's poised to capitalize on those opportunities as we focus on energizing the business and then over the course of this year, moving into an acceleration mode and eventually building leadership positions in the markets we serve. This afternoon, we reported solid performance for the first quarter of the year with sales of $16.7 million, and that was even in the face of the Omicron wave that impacted a lot of companies and procedures around the world really, and then other global macroeconomic challenges, which we'll refer to over the course of the call. But despite that, and I'll -- some of the highlights for the quarter, we achieved 20% year-on-year growth. And it was well-balanced growth. It was 24% in our ESS franchise. That's our OverStitch device and our X-Tack product. And we also achieved 16% growth with our intragastric balloon franchise, and so again, nice balance across our products. This quarter, our growth was primarily driven by the US with 33% growth in the US, 40% for IGB franchise, 34% for ESS, so really nice performance here in the US. An interesting fact here over what we've observed, and this is an extension of what we reported on our prior call. Our top 10 accounts grew by 63% year-on-year. And these are not distributors, these are individual accounts. And the average sales in those top 10 accounts, is right around $1 million annualized. So it gives you a sense of what we can achieve, when our customers really incorporate Apollo's products into their clinical practice and really make it a focus of patient care. And then in addition, we achieved 14% sequential growth in the number of ordering accounts for X-Tack here in the US. And we also achieved sequential sales growth in terms of -- so ordering accounts up 14% as well as sequential growth in X-Tack sales quarter-on-quarter. And so while delivering on a strong quarter, we also remain very focused on a broader set of priorities for the overall year, both delivering on the near term but also building the foundation for the growth in years to come. And so, our four main priorities. First is to expand our core GI business and defect closure and fixation. And that's inclusive of both OverStitch and X-Tack. It involves training new users, continue to build adoption and preparing for the approval of X-Tack, the CE mark approval outside the US. Second priority is leveraging a resurgence in ORBERA. The intragastric balloon franchise has done very well since I've gotten here, and it's been a big important part of our business, continues to grow. We want to make sure that's sustainable growth, and we're putting a lot of focus and energy behind that. And that fits part and parcel with our third priority, which is preparing for the launch of Apollo ESG and Apollo REVISE. We're working through the process with the FDA for a new regulatory clearance and preparing for the new product launch associated with that. And all the while building the organization. We need to have the right capabilities in place to make sure that we can go after those opportunities, and we've been making very important ads really top to bottom, and I will come back to that. So, Jeff is going to provide some updates on the financial results in the quarter, and then I will come back and talk through each of these four priorities to give you updates on how we're doing against each of them. Jeff? Thank you, Jeff. So turning to slide 12, just a quick reminder for those who are new to Apollo, we've got our three different product lines, our X-Tack product, OverStitch and the ORBERA intragastric balloon and that's really focused across two different therapeutic areas: our advanced GI focus as well as endobariatric or endoscopic weight loss. And as you'll see on slide 13, we continue to be focused on large market opportunities and developing from a product standpoint, but also clinical development and reimbursement otherwise, all the different elements that we think will be required to go after these opportunities. I mentioned our four priorities across the business for the year. And so let's provide an update here on each of them. First, on the core GI, the defect closure and fixation side of our business. We've got OverStitch, which really is a unique one-of-a-kind product, primarily focused on full thickness suturing in the upper GI. We are continuing to work to build and develop the defect closure side of the business with OverStitch. That involves training new users as well as expanding the different applications that users -- that our customers use OverStitch and making sure that they're familiar with and really apply the product in such a wide range of opportunities, which we know it can in fact positively impact patient care. That's true also in the -- outside the U.S. where the core GI has been a lower percentage of our overall business for OverStitch, and we've got plans in place that we're executing to build that part of the business outside the U.S. We then add in X-Tack, which as you can see on the chart, is a really nice complement OverStitch. It fills an important therapeutic gap between Through-the-scope clips and OverStitch in terms of complexity of the defect and size of the defect and the durability of the fixation. And again, we continue to make very good progress. We just launched X-Tack right around this time last year. And so we're seeing still very good progress with customers. We continue to refine our targeting and focus on high-volume centers. We continue to develop our sales training. As Jeff mentioned, we have a relatively new sales force with more than half the reps in the US hired within the last year. We continue to build the supporting body of clinical evidence and I'm going to come back in a minute to the upcoming DDW Meeting, which is the Digestive Disease Week Meeting. It's the largest GI meeting in the world and we expect both OverStitch and X-Tack to be very well represented at that meeting. We're expanding our peer-to-peer marketing programs, both through things like webcast. We just did an outstanding one with Dr. Darin Dufault from Duke University as well as old-fashioned face-to-face meetings where colleagues can hear from each other in terms of how they're applying this new device into their clinical practices. And then finally, we are absolutely working on preparing for the OUS launch of X-Tack. We already have a presence in a few select markets outside the US. The most recent one has been Australia, which we are just getting going here as of this month. But the key one will be getting CE Mark clearance for X-Tack, and we're still working through that regulatory process and -- but preparing commercially for when that occurs, and we'll be excited when it does. The next slide just shows some of the -- just the complements around OverStitch and X-Tack. You can see the kind of blue dots on the page, and for those of you who aren't -- don't have the slides in front of you, basically, what it's showing is that X-Tack opens up the right side of the colon, the lower GI for us. And that's where the predominant of procedures are in the lower GI and these are polyp-removal procedures. So, think about when you're in your colonoscopy and they find a large polyp defect that needs to be removed. If it's over about two centimeters, there's a lot of evidence that those are the defects that need to be prophylactically closed. And that's an important target market for X-Tack. But in addition, our customers are finding many other core applications for the device, which is great to see and many of them are listed on the page. So, fistulas and perforations, a POEM procedure, which is more of an upper GI procedure, mucosal tear, there's a whole range. And so we're pleased to see the progress there and continue to build and capitalize on that. Next slide. So, next up is ORBERA. Again, we want to continue to maintain the momentum with ORBERA and really ensure that it's sustainable because it's been a tremendous turnaround for a product and a category that frankly struggled for a number of years, but we've seen very nice growth with ORBERA. We've seen it globally. We continue to capitalize on some macro factors in terms of weight gain during the pandemic and coming out of the pandemic, I think, has been favorable to a product that has a lot of evidence of at least a 10% total body weight loss. Right around this time last year, we have the new AGA Clinical Practice guidelines. First time ever that a major society endorsed intragastric balloon therapy and that's kind of a seal of approval as it were for intragastric balloon therapy. We are proud of the fact that ORBERA has, by far, the most clinical evidence of any intragastric balloon in the market and it's an important element to a safety and trust element around the product. We've seen an increase in physician interest. We've done more training for ORBERA in the US in the past few months than we've done in a number of years. And we're putting more focus on it from a sales and marketing standpoint, which is helping to contribute to the sustainability of those results. And then importantly, we're seeing some very important competitive wins outside the US. In the US, we are primarily the main product available for intragastric balloons. There's a recent market entrant that's still in the very early stages of having to do a post-approval trial. So we're really in the US. Outside the US, it is a very competitive market, but we are seeing nice wins outside the US that are helping to contribute to our ongoing growth. And it comes back to you that we've got a really good product with a long track record of safety and efficacy. And then that ties right into our broader strategy around endobariatric, and our preparation for the launch of Apollo ESG and Apollo REVISE. So we showed this slide on the last earnings call, and I'll just use this as an opportunity to provide some important updates as we are working across a broad comprehensive launch plan for these products. We are still working through the De Novo 510(k) clearance with the FDA and we'll look forward to providing input an update on that as things progress. We are actively engaging with leading physician societies on both the GI and the surgery side. On the GI side, there's groups like the American Gastroenterology Association and the ASGE, two of the leading societies as well as ACG, so a lot of GI societies. There's also major surgical societies. So SAGES and then the ASMBS, which is the metabolic Surgery Society. And we've been spending a lot of time with them describing our plans around the new indications, talking to them about where we see endoscopic therapies fitting within the broader continuum of care and making sure that we've got good alignment across, again, both GIs and surgeons. And then talking about ways we can best work together on important elements of things like training and education and support on efforts on things like reimbursement and market access. And those have been very productive discussions. And I think a big part of a broader market development process that we're working on. We are aware of efforts that a number of these societies already have underway on things like clinical practice guidelines. Now those processes take time. There's a lot that goes into a new set of practice skylines. But the fact that they're already working on those efforts is a really good sign that the societies are looking towards where these new procedures will fit in the broader continuum of care. We are also actively learning from our early adopters. There are a number of customers, both in -- outside the US as well as in the US that are already incorporating ESG and revisions into their clinical practice. We are very careful from a promotional standpoint, but physicians can use OverStitch for these procedures. And so, we are already kind of learning from those customers. And we call them internally the waven accounts. And it's really interesting because what we're seeing is a really nice mix of different models. We see some models that are in academic medical centers, some of the leading centers in the world. We see others that are individual private practice physicians or small groups of physicians, and we're seeing success in either case. We're seeing some models that are surgeon led. We're seeing some models that are GI led. We've seen some that are integrated, GIS and surgeons working together. There are commonalities though. The ones that are most successful have a laser focus on clinical outcomes and how they're working to make sure before the procedure, during the procedure and after the procedure and patient follow-up that they're doing everything necessary to achieve the best possible outcomes for patients. And so we're kind of going to school on those initial set of customers. We're developing the playbooks that we will be using with the next waves of accounts as they move forward once we get a new indication. In the meantime, we can gain a lot of practical experience with ORBERA. I mentioned the renewed marketing efforts around ORBERA. I'll give you an example. We are doing co-marketing programs with some of these Wave 1 accounts, frankly, who offer the intragastric balloon, as well as some other accounts that have demonstrated the ability to attract patients and talk to them about the procedures and ensure that if you're doing marketing, patient marketing, that it results in actual procedures. And so, we've been able to do that with ORBERA. We initiated this late last year and had been moving forward here and having really good outcomes and experience and measurable results that we can both obviously support the ORBERA business, but also learn in terms of how this will play ultimately in a broader endobariatric world. So we're excited by those early learnings, and we're going to keep building on them. And then last, but certainly not least, we are absolutely building out our reimbursement and market access team. We, in January, announced the hiring of a new VP of Reimbursement and Market Access. Chas since added a Director of Payer Engagement, who has already joined and is a full-time employee focused specifically on how we will work with payers. And we are strengthening our capabilities in areas like health economics and others. So this is a critically important area and a broader market development and a set of skills and capabilities that we are really building here at Apollo. So a few times now, I've already mentioned the upcoming Digestive Disease Week meeting, and we're really excited about it. So this is the largest gastroenterology meeting in the world. This is the first time the meeting will be taking place in person for three years. It's been gone to virtual in the last couple of years. And so, as we talk to people in the medical community, they're really excited to get back together. I think the fact that it's in San Diego doesn't hurt. But as part of that, what we're really looking forward to is that, simply put, we expect DDW to be an excellent showcase of Apollo's products and procedures. They've only, at this point, released the preliminary agenda. More details will be coming out in the next week or two. So even based off of these preliminary information from the organizers, we are already aware of over 40 posters and video presentations about Apollo products and procedures and more than 60 lectures and podium presentations. So there's going to be a lot of discussion about Apollo products at the meeting, and including some important new clinical data and new clinical studies. So let me highlight a few there. And again, this is a preliminary list, before the meeting, we will likely do a press release informing you of others to be on a lookout for DDW. First is the MERIT study. Many of you know, MERIT is the randomized controlled trial that Apollo sponsored, testing the ESG procedure compared to diet and exercise. The preliminary results were presented at the IPSO meeting, a surgery meeting in a virtual session in October. And I'm pleased to report that, at DDW, the full results of MERIT will be released by Dr. Barham Abu Dayyeh in two sessions, both in a plenary session on Saturday, May 21, and then again in more detail in a full session on Tuesday at the meeting. So very excited for the full results for MERIT. It will just be additive to the information we've already -- that's already been presented. Another really interesting presentation will come from Dr. Chris McGowan. Chris is -- Dr. McGowan is based out of Cary, North Carolina, private practice position at True You Weight Loss. He does an excellent job of following up all his patients, and he's going to be presenting data on patients with Class III obesity, meaning patients with a BMI of more than 40. And so we're looking forward to those data and the presentation of Dr. McGowan. Dr. Reem Sharaiha from Cornell is going to be presenting a five-year follow-up data with comorbidity information and the impact on comorbidities, and Dr. Beran is also going be presenting systematic review, pardon me \u2013 and meta-analysis comparing ESG to laparoscopic sleeves. And again, this is just a cross-section of some of the data that will be presented. On the revision side, Dr. Anna Carolina Hoff has a oral presentation focused on combination therapy of revisional procedures along with GLP-1 inhibitors. As many of you may recall that last year at the DDW meeting, Dr. Hoff had one of the top papers at DDW focused on combination therapy of ESG plus semaglutide. It was a randomized controlled trial and the headline was basically that when you combine ESG plus semaglutide, which has the brand name Wegovy, you get essentially surgical level of outcomes. It was more than 25% total body weight loss in that study. And so we're excited to see the new presentation from Dr. Hoff. And we are well aware that some of the newer medications, including semaglutide and the recent results from a new medication from Eli Lilly and Company. We expect will have an important impact in addressing the global obesi epidemic, but we see a really interesting role in combination therapies, and so more data on that will be coming at DDW. Not to be outdone, the defect closure side of our business will also be very well represented at the meeting. There is a session, I think, this is on Saturday that Dr. Christopher Gostout, who is our Chief Medical Officer, is co-chairing with Dr. Harry Aslanian from Yale University that's going to be talking about defect closure in everyday practice. And that will include discussions around suturing with OverStitch and case studies with X-Tack. There is new data from a multicenter experience on X-Tack. There is a new another study looking specifically at X-Tack in colonic EMR defects. There's another paper involved with ESD closure. So again, this is just a summary of what we expect to be a significant amount of information at the meeting, so we're excited about that. Speaking of clinical data, a study that was released in Q1 that I'll draw your attention to. And I'm on slide 20 for those who are following along. This was in GIE -- Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, which is one of the leading journals in the field. So the study was authored by Dr. Alqahtani out of Saudi Arabia. And one of the most impressive element -- one element is just the scale of the study. It is -- it involves more than 3,000 patient pairs. It's a propensity match study of ESG compared to patients who received laparoscopic sleeve. So that's more than a 6,000 patient study, which is really unusual in the device world. Some of the headlines is that it showed durable results with ESG out to three years with a 14% total body weight loss at sustained out to three years. In addition, the comorbidity remission in this study with ESG was very similar to what was found in LSG patients. And, in fact, was slightly better in the areas of dyslipidemia and hypertension. Showed an excellent safety profile for the procedures. We're just showing that in real-world clinical practice, ESG is a very safe procedure. And then also provides good evidence that, if patients needed it, they could either get a repeat ESG basically a retightening, or they could revert to an LSG. And that's important. It's an important element to be able to leave all options open to patients. And we've known that about ESG, but to have additional clinical data that shows the feasibility of that, important, especially to a surgical audience who like to know that they can still have different options available to them. Turning now to the organization side of our business and things we're developing. On the left is a summary of the core values of Apollo that we've really focused on. We're very focused on building a strong culture of the company, a winning culture that's customer-focused, it's patient-focused, and it's a big part of who we are. So we've been introducing these internally. It's becoming a big part of how we manage our business. And all the while, we are adding to the organization really from top to bottom as it were. We are very pleased to announce just a few weeks ago, having announced the hiring of Jeannette Bankes to join our Board of Directors. Jeannette is the President and General Manager of the Global Surgical franchise at Alcon. And she brings tremendous experience in developing and commercializing new technologies, including in markets around the world. So really good global experience and so we are thrilled to have Jeanette join our Board of Directors. I mentioned new hires in the reimbursement and market access side. We've promoted a new Head of VP of R&D to really renew and reengage our efforts on the pipeline development. And then as Jeff mentioned, we are selectively and very targeted making additions throughout the organization to make sure that we've got the right scale to grow. One of the biggest areas that we are focusing on, and you saw it in the financial numbers, has been on our commercial team and so just an update of where we are. We are \u2013 as Jeff mentioned, we've grown \u2013 added a few positions here over the first part of the year in the US and plan to continue to grow over the course of the year. We are adding new training capabilities as we do have a relatively new team. And we've seen increased productivity as we brought people on board, but we absolutely expect that to continue going forward. We're improving our sales and analytics. And as I described in some of the launch planning for ESG, we really are building out our marketing capabilities as well. Importantly, on the OUS side of our business, as Jeff mentioned, it is more than 40% of our business, and we're making important additions there as well. Again, selective adds in key markets to drive growth, especially on the ESS side and preparing for the X-Tack launch. We really have reignited our physician training programs outside the US. They did struggle for a while during the COVID period, and even into next year because many of those trading programs do require travel. And as we all know, international travel has had its challenges. But when they are fully running again, we've had great participation. And we're also developing plans to expand into large untapped market opportunities. Just today in the earnings release, we announced in Japan. So we've had some access into Japan through some limited use kind of pathways, but we've just received clearance for OverStitch Sx in Japan, which is a nice opportunity for us. We still have some work to do on the reimbursement front, but this will allow us to continue to build and grow there. We've got initial footholds into the Chinese market that also can build and grow and expand over time. And somewhat ironically, given the sale of our international business in Canada, we currently have clearances for the Intragastric Balloon, but do not have yet clearances for X-Tack and OverStitch, and we're working to address those as well. So continued significant growth opportunities outside the US while we grow and develop in the US as well. And by the way, when I mentioned the prelaunch planning around ESG and Apollo REVISE, many of the elements that we're working on in the US have broad applicability outside the US as well, because we are able to really -- for example, the reimbursement efforts that we focus on here in other markets, we will focus on as well. And so to wrap up, we delivered a solid quarter in Q1 despite some of the macroeconomic headwinds, and we also have made substantial progress across each of our priorities for the year, and we remain very excited about the prospects for our products and our procedures and the impact that we can have in markets around the world. And so with that, let me turn it back over to John for the Q&A. Yes. Now let me separate out two things. I think the bigger constraint we've seen has been more on the nurse side than on the physician side. And again, these have been well documented and just in the types of settings I've mentioned. And I think the situation is improving, but that's been coming out of COVID, just a challenge for certain institutions. And I think, like I said, they're starting to get a handle on it and it's improving. On the physician side, there is some movement, but mostly for us, it really is just a matter of continuing to train new users for -- across our products. And then doing, as you said, the leg work once someone is trained, making sure they become totally comfortable with the devices and the procedures and expanding the different kinds of procedures they can use it for in the case of both OverStitch and X-Tack. And in the case of the Orbera side of things, understanding how to really develop their practices and patient marketing some of those other areas where we're doing some of the co-marketing elements. Sure. We've -- we've been investing, as Jeff mentioned, in different aspects of growth. And so certainly are looking to continue to see that. We saw a good evidence of results of that in Q1, but I do expect to see that progress. And certainly to achieve our guidance range for the year, we expect that to continue to step up and are focused on delivering on that. And that will be globally based to get things like some order patterns outside the US with some of our distributors as well. And so we feel good about a nice progression here and reiterating our guidance even with -- and Jeff alluded to this, but just to be really clear, we do have a bit of a headwind on the FX side, more than most companies our size, but are still focused on the guidance we've delivered and internally, we want to exceed that. Sure. Yeah. No, so for ESG and revise, when we submitted to the FDA, which was back in -- late in Q3 of last year, we said that on average, de novo 510(k) take about a year. That is average. There is -- there are wide error bars in those data because de novo 510(k) almost by definition, have a little bit more uncertainty than a traditional 510(k). So it's a little hard to pinpoint. We are preparing for it, and we hope to see that in the second half of the year and doing everything we can to support that process. The -- another big launch that we are working on, clearly, is the X-Tack launch outside the US. We have spoken on previous calls about there's a regulatory change in paradigm going on in Europe. There's a transition to the medical device regulations MDR. You guys may be familiar with your other med tech companies you follow as well. The net result of that is just things are taking longer. And so if we do see an impact, it would be later in the year that we expect, and we said that throughout that it's going to take a while. And then the Japan side for OverStitch, we're very pleased to get the clearance. As I mentioned in my comments, there's still some regulatory work to be done to really open up the market around OverStitch, but it will, I think, on the margin, have some positive impacts on our US business. Thank you. Yes, Chris. We're excited to see the traction that some of these larger accounts are getting. And it's a mix in terms of the nature of the accounts. Some of them are not endobariatric. I mean they're just kind of broad-based users of across the portfolio, some of the larger academic centers. But I would say the majority -- and this is -- it's a global list, so inclusive of both the US and internationally are some of these early adopters are really embracing the endobariatric side of things. And so for that group, that goes back to a bit of the homework we're doing on how they're approaching the markets, right? They are seeing a really good response to, frankly, the procedures they're offering, right, between intragastric balloons and being a part of that for many of them, not all, but for most. But then also with the ESG and endoscopic revisions, it's a nice affirmation for us that the value proposition resonates with patients. And that's true today even in a primarily cash pay environment or as I've mentioned before, in the kind of case-by-case reimbursement situations that some have access to. But it's been really nice to see. And we will be excited at a time when we do have indication to say how do we support that or look to ways that others can follow in their footsteps. Yes, I think there are a number of factors going on, Chris. One is there is some things around, for example, both seasonality and some COVID impacts, which impacts a bit of what you see in terms of those numbers. We also see, as you move from an environment early on in the launch where a lot of it has to do with some stocking of new accounts and moving to true utilization. And so I think our utilization -- our underlying growth in utilization is probably a little higher from that standpoint. And then we're continuing, I think, in the kind of focus with our sales team of building that sustainable growth. And certainly, we'd like to see continued and even improved quarter-on-quarter growth. And some of that is just some of the newer folks fully getting up to speed and delivering it and producing at the level we expect them to. So, it's a big focus area for us to make sure we continue to sustain it. And I do think that additional clinical information and critical validation around X-Tack, for example, at DDW meeting, will help a lot. Yeah. Thanks, Colin. It's a little bit of all the above. You've kind of touched on a number of the things that we are in the process of doing and have been, but I think are really emphasizing here. One, it's not surprising that we have an established customer base that is more familiar in the upper GI, and so really pushing our reps to move beyond kind of the established customers into a broader set. That is easier to do as we expand our team and they've got kind of smaller territories. And so we're absolutely doing that. We also have better targeting data with more recent clinical procedure numbers that allows them to be able to really focus on where the volumes are and make sure they're engaging the right physicians there. We're doing more in terms of engaging some of the key KOLs that really are the experts in the lower GI and having good -- very good experiences with some of them. But I do think the last piece around clinical data does matter. And so some of the data sets in colonic EMRs, that I mentioned in my opening comments, will be important. We don't know the outcomes of those studies, but we -- anecdotally, we've heard very good things about how people have done. So again, once we certainly know the outcomes of what is presented and both presentations and posters at DDW, being able to leverage that in those conversations. And a lot of the peer-to-peer kind of marketing is really important. I mentioned doing webcast and face-to-face, just making sure people are hearing from their colleagues about how they are incorporating this new approach into their clinical practice. Inertia is a powerful thing in medicine, and we're looking to change that. Sure. So we're kind of doing two things simultaneously. We've got our territory managers that typically are focused on selling each of the products. And especially as a new hire getting up to speed on the training around them, the procedures, supporting the accounts and focusing across all three products. In parallel, Jeff and his comments on one of the slides we've mentioned, this newer role of what we're calling a regional endobariatric manager. These are folks that are either been hired or in some cases, rehired or come back to Apollo, who understand all of the different components that will be required to really have a successful practice kind of from a patient standpoint, before the procedure, during the procedure and after the procedure and can really help support and develop those efforts. For now, it's very much focused on ORBERA, because it's on label for us, and they can kind of focus on those efforts while getting to know the practice is involved. And right now, as Jeff mentioned, at the end of the quarter, we have two of those roles very much was a pilot phase to make sure it's delivering the way we think it can. And then assuming, it does and as we move forward with the indication, that's an area that we would plan to enhance and grow. So you have not a splitting of the sales force, but kind of a layering of different capabilities. Well, listen, thank you all very much for joining us today. We appreciate your time and your support. On this slide, we have upcoming activities, and you're welcome to join of them. And then otherwise, we really appreciate your time today. Thank you very much."

            "content": "Thank you, Chas, and thank you, everybody, for joining the call today. As Chas said, I'll spend a few minutes here on a little bit of a deeper dive into the financials and then turn it back over to Chas for a more detailed business update. Starting with slide 7 on revenue, again, a strong year-over-year growth across the product portfolio. It was our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. And excluding the legacy Lap-Band business, this was the largest revenue quarter on record for Apollo. 33% growth in the US, so we are beginning to see the impact of our planned investments, specifically the expansion of the sales force, while still early stages, we're beginning to see traction and increased productivity. We saw a continued strength in ORBERA on the heels of enhanced marketing efforts. And again, still some lingering effects of COVID on hospital access and staffing, particularly in academic hospitals, where core GI business is typically very strong. We saw 6% growth outside the US, strong demand in distributor markets, offset by continued pressure in the quarter in concentrated direct markets, particularly Western Europe, where we also believe to be lingering pandemic effects. Significant foreign currency impacts, particularly for the euro, which had a nearly $300,000 impact on year-over-year growth. On a constant currency basis, our OUS growth was 10%. Global growth was 22%. And just as a reminder, because international sales represent more than 40% of our overall revenue, we're disproportionately impacted by negative foreign currency impacts compared to similarly sized Medtech companies that typically don't have such a large OUS footprint. Other revenue, while it's not material, it was impacted by our planned wind down of Apollo Care for Orbera, which we outsourced to a third-party beginning in 2022. This will ensure we can properly scale support for Orbera, as that business continues to expand without a material financial impact to Apollo. Overall, we're again pleased with our revenue performance in the first quarter and our ability to successfully navigate a generally slow start for Medtech. In terms of outlook for 2022, we continue to expect 2022 revenue of $73 million to $75 million, while we're cognizant of potential global recessionary impacts, lingering pandemic headwinds and foreign currency pressures from a strengthened dollar, particularly for the euro, which currently represents nearly half of our OUS revenue. Moving to gross margin on Slide 8. Gross margin improved by 210 basis points over a year ago. In the US, our margin increased from a higher Orbera mix as well as margin expansion on our ESS product lines. We're seeing the impact of 2021 OverStitch COGS improvement projects. We're seeing improved overhead efficiencies, and we also saw some price increase impact for both OverStitch and X-Tack. The margin expansion that we saw in the US was offset by a higher mix of distributor sales, OUS, which have a lower gross margin profile. We remain focused on continued gross margin improvements, particularly with OverStitch, which has a lower gross margin profile than the Orbera and X-Tack. So major drivers continue to be in gross margin expansion in the future will be product mix, improved overhead absorption, direct COGS improvement programs, like I said, focused primarily on OverStitch. And at the same time, we're navigating supply chain and manufacturing scale-up complexities, but we remain confident that we'll drive blended gross margin to the mid-60% range in the next three to five years. Moving to OpEx on Slide 9. As we look at operating spend profile, as we've done in the past, we think it's important to exclude non-cash stock-based compensation to get just a clearer picture of what our non-GAAP core operating run rate is. And as we previously said, 2022 is an investment year for us. In the near-term, we remain focused on building capabilities following historical underinvestment in the business. The most significant area of increased investment is in sales and marketing in the United States. For example, in the fourth quarter, you'll see our non-GAAP sales and marketing OpEx ran at about 48% of revenue. This reflects our planned investments in growth initiatives, primarily building out the channel, marketing programs as we prepare for the anticipated launch of our ESG products. As we've said before, in the US, we still have a very small commercial team relative to the size of our opportunities. We made substantial progress a year ago or last year, expanding our footprint. We continue to do so. At the end of 2021, we had a commercial team of just under 30 in the field. We grew that to 30 territory managers and two regional Endobariatric managers at the end of the first quarter. This team is ramping up. We anticipate further improvements in rep productivity as they gain additional time and territory and experience with our products and customers. Going forward, we continue to evaluate the appropriate scale of our commercial team and we'll invest as necessary. Other focused area of our planned investments, are in R&D, medical education, clinical reimbursement, product development and gross margin improvement. And on the G&A side, we will continue to thoughtfully invest in infrastructure and staff to properly support the business, but we expect to see the heaviest investment in both sales and marketing and R&D. Importantly, that we have the ability to modulate spend as appropriate. And we're well positioned from a balance sheet perspective to make these investments. So with that said, before I turn it over to Ted, just a couple of comments on cash use and burn. Moving to our balance sheet, slide 10, as you may recall, last year, we secured over $175 million in new capital and borrowing capacity, enabling us to begin making investments required to capitalize on the opportunities in front of us without really creating a concern about cash runway. This positions us very well, with a multiyear runway to execute the business, which is especially important now in what has turned out to be an uncertain and volatile capital markets environment. As we expected, we saw a planned up-tick in cash burn in the first quarter relative to 2021. Of particular note, nearly 1/3 of that burn was $2.9 million in working capital, which represents the pay down of 2021 year-end accruals as well as inventory builds to support the expected growth in demand for our products. Even with our planned increase in average quarterly burn, we're extremely well positioned to execute on our planned growth initiatives with nearly $150 million in cash and committed cash at the end of the first quarter. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Chas. Yeah, Serena [ph], this is Jeff. Yeah, I think as we've said in the past, I think -- we don't expect that we'll see any sort of step change in margin. It will be a gradual improvement. And a lot of what you saw in -- or what you saw in Q1 was really a mix of a number of factors, overhead efficiency. And as we improve the top line, we'll start to see even better efficiencies on overhead absorption. We did start to see the impact of the cost improvement projects that we executed last year. We'll continue to see those. So I would say expect more of a gradual improvement as opposed to any step change in any single quarter. Your question on supply chain, I would characterize our supply chain complexity is less about supply and more about just ensuring that we are working closely with our contract manufacturers on capacity and staffing. But we've not run into any situations where we're overly concerned about either incremental costs that we're not expecting or significant capacity constraints that we're not able to address."

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Lauren Tengler, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nLauren Tengler: Thank you, Drew. Welcome, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q4 and full year 2023 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release, as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financials & Filings. The duration of this morning's call will be approximately one hour. Mike and Dan will provide comments on Q4 and full year performance, as well as the outlook for the business including 2024 guidance, and then we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Ken Stein. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on this call, operational revenue growth, excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, and organic revenue growth further excludes acquisitions and divestitures for which there are less than a full period of comparable net sales. Relevant acquisitions and divestitures excluded for organic growth are Baylis Medical, which closed on February 14th, 2022; the majority stake investment in Acotec Scientific Holdings Limited, Apollo Endosurgery and Relievant Medical, which closed in February, April, November 2023, respectively. Divestitures include the Endoscopy Pathology business, which closed in April 2023. Guidance excludes the previously announced agreement to acquire Axonics, Inc., which is expected to close in the first half of 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. For more information, please refer to our financial and operating highlights deck, which may be found on our Investor Relations website. On this call, all references to sales and revenue, unless otherwise specified, are organic. This call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, may, believe, estimate, and other similar words. They include among other things, statements about our growth in market share, new and anticipated product approvals and launches, acquisitions, clinical trials, cost savings and growth opportunities, our cash flow and expected use, our financial performance, including sales, margins and earnings as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses. If our underlying assumptions turn out to be incorrect, or if certain risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from the expectations and projections expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them. At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike.\nMichael Mahoney: Thanks, Lauren, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. 2023 results were excellent, and our global performance represented one of the strongest years in company history, exceeding our financial goals that we set for the year. This performance is fueled by innovation and clinical evidence generation, commercial execution, and the winning spirit of our global teams. In fourth quarter '23, total company operational sales grew 15%. Our organic sales grew 14% versus fourth quarter '22, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of 8% to 10%. Full-year '23 operational sales growth of 13% versus 2022, while organic sales grew 12%, exceeding our guidance of approximately 11% for the full year. Importantly, six of our eight business units grew sales double-digit in the fourth quarter and double-digits for the full year 2023. And all of our regions also grew double-digits in the fourth quarter and double-digits full year 2023. This performance is a testament to our category leadership strategy and our focus on innovation bolstered by commercial excellence. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS at $0.55 grew 24% versus 2022, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.49 to $0.52. Full year adjusted EPS of $2.05, grew 20% versus 2022, also exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $1.99 to $2.02. Q4 adjusted operating margin was 26.6% and full year '23 was 26.3%, which is exciting because it exceeds pre-pandemic levels. We generated a full year cash flow of $1.8 billion and adjusted free cash flow of $2.5 billion in line with our expectations. Now for our 2024 outlook. We expect healthy procedure volumes to continue and our guidance to organic growth of seven to nine for the first quarter of '24, and eight to nine for the full year of 2024. Our Q1'24 adjusted EPS estimate is $0.50 to $0.52. We expect our full year adjusted EPS to be $2.23 to $2.27, representing growth of 9% to 11%. This guidance excludes the acquisition of Axonics, which is expected to close in the first half of '24. Despite pressures on margins in '24 from FX headwinds, as well as investments in manufacturing capacity and selling expenses to fuel our exciting launches, we remain committed to improving operating income margins in 2024 and to our goal of improving adjusted operating margin by 150 basis points in '24 to '26. Now, Dan will provide more details on those financials for both 2023 and 2024. I'll now provide additional highlights on '23 results along with comments on our outlook. Regionally on an operational basis, the US grew 11% for the fourth quarter of '22. Full year 2023 grew 10% with particular strength in our Watchman, EP, Endo and Uro business units. Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 12% on an operational basis versus Q4 '22 and 13% on a full year basis. This above-market growth is supported by new and ongoing product launches across the portfolio, price discipline and strong commercial execution. We're excited about the year ahead with ongoing momentum across the region, particularly with our innovative EP portfolio and further opportunity in our growth in emerging markets within the EMEA region. Asia Pacific grew 17% operationally versus Q1 in '19 versus the full year 2022 with all major markets growing strong double-digits. Japan had a strong year growing double-digits for '22 with ongoing momentum from new products, most notably AGENT, DCB, Rez\u016bm, POLARx FIT and WATCHMAN FLX. And on a full-year basis, China grew approximately 20% versus 2022. This consistent growth is fueled by the diverse portfolio, focus on innovation and strong commercial execution. Looking ahead, we expect China to be an accretive mid-teens grower over our '24 to '26 LRP. And to achieve over $1 billion in sales in '24, supported by new product launches, supply chain agility and sustained investments in our talents and capabilities. The team Latin America grew 17% operationally versus both Q4 and full year '22, with seven of eight business units growing double-digits on a full year basis. I'll now provide some additional commentary on our BUs. Urology had an excellent quarter, 10% organic growth versus Q4 '22, and on a full year basis grew 11% organically. Full year growth was led by our Stone Management and Prosthetic Urology globally. And in 2023, we re-launched our direct-to-patient campaign driving therapy awareness for erectile dysfunction and supporting double-digit growth within our Prosthetic Urology franchise. We're excited about the opportunities ahead in Urology, including our recently announced agreement to acquire Axonics, a medical technology company that offers innovative devices, treat urinary and bowel dysfunction. We look forward to bringing these complementary portfolios together and expanding access to differentiated technologies for physicians and patients. Endoscopy sales were also excellent in the quarter, growing 12% operationally and 11% organically versus fourth quarter of '22, on a full year basis, growing 12% operationally and 11% organically. Within the quarter, strong results were led by AXIOS and single-use scopes, both growing double-digits. On a full year basis, all regions grew double-digits, supported by the broad and deep portfolio, new product innovation and focus on commercial excellence. Neuromodulation sales grew 7% operationally and 3% organically versus fourth quarter '22, on a full-year basis, 7% operationally and 5% organically versus '22. Our Brain franchise grew double-digits both in the quarter and on a full-year basis, driven by the Vercise Genus portfolio and our innovative Image Guided Programming, which is designed to improve the precision and efficiency of the deep brain stimulation procedure. In the fourth quarter, on an organic basis, our Pain franchise was flat year-over-year, which was in line with our expectations. We expect our performance to improve in 2024 with the recent launch of our US WaveWriter Alpha DPN indication and the strong and real-world data on FAST recently presented at NANS. Furthermore, with the completion of our Relievant Medsystems acquisition in the fourth quarter, we're excited about our ability to offer an expanded Pain portfolio that supports a comprehensive treatment algorithm now included a novel Intracept system for the treatment of chronic low back pain. Peripheral Interventions sales were excellent, also growing 12% operationally and 10% organically versus Q4, on a full-year basis, growing 13% operationally and 11% organically versus '22. Arterial growth was led by the performance of our Drug-Eluting portfolio both in Q4 and on a full year. This market remains underpenetrated with more than half the procedure is still being used with bare-metal devices, underscoring the importance of our ongoing commitment to innovation and clinical evidence. In Venous, Q4 and full year growth was led by Varithena, our market-leading varicose vein technology. Additionally, in fourth quarter, EKOS growth was supported by REAL-PE, the largest real-world and near real-time dataset evaluating advanced therapies for pulmonary embolism patients. Our Interventional Oncology franchise performed extremely well in the fourth quarter and in 2023, growing low double-digits with strength across our portfolio of robust embolization technologies and cancer therapies We continue to look to expand our clinical evidence and are pleased to have commenced enrollment in the ROWAN trial, which will assess the safety and efficacy of using TheraSphere in combination with immunotherapy to treat HCC, the most common type of primary liver cancer. Cardiology delivered tremendous quarter -- delivered tremendous fourth quarter and year with both operational and organic sales growing 14% versus fourth quarter and for the full year 2022. Within Cardiology, Interventional Cardiology Therapies sales grew 10% for the full year and -- for the fourth quarter and full year. On a full-year basis, the Coronary Therapies franchise growth was driven by strong performance in our international regions and our Imaging franchise globally. AGENT Drug-Coated Balloon continues to perform very well in Japan. We now expect approval of AGENT in the US in the first half of 2024. AGENT DCB will be the first coronary drug-eluting balloon in the US indicated for in-stent restenosis, providing physicians and their patients a solution for this unmet clinical need. Our Structural Heart Valves franchise grew double-digits in both fourth quarter and in a full year basis, led by the performance of ACURATE Neo2 in Europe. And we now have treated more than 70,000 patients to date with our ACURATE technology globally. As we look ahead, we anticipate approval of ACURATE Prime in Europe in 2025. However, after reviewing a planned interim analysis of the US ACURATE IDE data, we will now wait for the full one-year data from the RCT cohort of 100 patients to determine our regulatory strategy. Therefore, we no longer anticipate the approval of ACURATE Prime in the US in 2024. Additionally in alignment with the FDA, we are suspending enrollment in the Single-arm Continued Access study, while continuing to enroll in the randomized extended durability cohorts. We expect to have more information in the second half of 2024, following the full data review. WATCHMAN sales grew 23% organically versus fourth quarter '22 and 25% on a full year basis. Q4 finished with record sales and strong utilization in all major markets. We have now treated over 400,000 patients globally with the WATCHMAN technology. US Q4 growth of 23% was supported by the breadth of the portfolio and the initial launch of WATCHMAN FLX Pro, which we expect to move into full launch in the first quarter. We continue to expand the breadth of clinical evidence supporting this technology and are pleased with the pace of enrollment within our post-market HEAL-LAA trial, including our newly added cohort, which is studying WATCHMAN FLX Pro, an underrepresented patient population. We also look forward to initiating our Monotherapy trial, SIMPLIFY trial later this year, which will study WATCHMAN FLX Pro with the simplified post-implant drug regimen. Cardiac Rhythm Management sales grew 5% organically versus Q4 '22, and on a full year basis grew 6% organically versus '22. On a full year basis, our Diagnostics franchise grew double-digits outpacing market growth, driven by broad portfolio and ongoing investments in innovation. In Core CRM, in both fourth quarter and on a full year basis, our high-voltage business grew low-single digits and our low-voltage business grew mid-single-digits. 2023 performance was driven by our differentiated high-voltage portfolio and shock polarity options. As we look ahead, we expect our Core CRM growth to be in line with the market performance in '24. Turning to Electrophysiology, sales grew 43%, both operationally and organically versus fourth quarter '22, and on a full year basis grew 37% operationally and 33% organically versus '22. US fourth quarter sales grew 40% organically, driven by our POLARx launch and ongoing momentum with our Access Solutions portfolio. Our international EP growth accelerated in the fourth quarter, growing 46% organically, fueled by improved FARAPULSE console supply. We now treated over 40,000 patients globally with the FARAPULSE technology to-date. And with the news this morning that we received FDA approval for FARAPULSE, we are thrilled to enter the US market immediately. We continue to invest in ClinicalEVIDENCE to study new indications and support access to our FARAPULSE technology. Late last year, we initiated the AVANT GUARD trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the system. It's a first-line treatment for Persistent AF compared to antiarrhythmic drug therapy. Additionally, real-world data was presented at AHA for more than 17,000 patients treated with the FARAPULSE from the MANIFEST-17K registry, which reinforced the real-world safety profile of the FARAPULSE platform with no reports of permanent phrenic nerve palsy or pulmonary vein stenosis or esophageal injury and an overall major adverse rate event rate of less than 1%. We're excited to bring this innovative technology to more markets and expect approval of FARAPULSE in Japan -- China and Japan likely in the second half of this year. In closing, I'm very proud of our global team what we were able to accomplish in '23, resulting in a full year organic sales growth of 12% and adjusted EPS growth of 20%. We're excited about the year ahead and remain focused on our talent, sustaining a culture that's motivated to drive differentiated performance and achieve our long-range plan goals. Those goals, as a reminder, are sales an average of 8% to 10% over the three-year period, while expanding adjusted operating margin by 150 basis points, including double-digit adjusted EPS growth, an improvement of our free cash flow conversion to approximately 70% in 2026. With all of that, I'll pass it over to Dan to provide more details on the financials.\nDaniel Brennan: Thanks, Mike. Fourth quarter 2023 consolidated revenue of $3,725 million, represents 14.9% reported growth versus fourth quarter of 2022 and includes a 40 basis point tailwind from foreign exchange, in line with our expectations. Excluding this $12 million tailwind from foreign exchange, operational revenue growth was 14.5% in the quarter. Sales from closed acquisitions and divestitures contributed 90 basis points resulting in 13.6% organic revenue growth, exceeding our guidance range of 8% to 10%. Q4 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $0.55 grew 24% versus 2022, exceeding the high-end of our guidance range of $0.49 to $0.52, primarily driven by our strong sales performance. Full year 2023 consolidated revenue of $14,240 million represents 12.3% reported revenue growth versus full year 2022 and includes an 80 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, again in line with our expectations. Excluding this $104 million headwind from foreign exchange, operational revenue growth for the year was 13.1%. Sales from closed acquisitions and divestitures contributed 80 basis points, resulting in 12.3% organic revenue growth, exceeding our guidance range of approximately 11%. Full year 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $2.05, grew 20% versus 2022, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $1.99 to $2.02. Adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter was 70.4%, resulting in full year 2023 adjusted gross margin of 70.7%, in line with our expectations and representing a 20 basis point improvement versus full year 2022, inclusive of a 220 basis point headwind from foreign exchange. In 2024, we expect a mixed benefit from our new launches with offsetting headwinds from FX and the incremental investment in our manufacturing capacity. And as a result, we anticipate our full year 2024 adjusted gross margin will be at or slightly below our full-year 2023 rate. Fourth quarter adjusted operating margin was 26.6%, resulting in a full year 2023 adjusted operating margin of 26.3%, improving 70 basis points versus 2022. We expect to expand adjusted operating margin in 2024 by another 30 basis points to 50 basis points, balancing progress towards our long-range plan goal of 150 basis points over the three years, 2024 to 2026, with flexibility for critical investments to support key launches. On a GAAP basis, the fourth quarter operating margin was 15.7%, resulting in a full year reported operating margin of 16.5%. Moving to below the line, fourth quarter adjusted interest and other expenses totaled $79 million, resulting in full year adjusted interest and other expenses of $331 million in line with our expectations. On an adjusted basis, our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 10% and 11.2% for the full year 2023, including favorable discrete tax items and the benefit from stock compensation accounting. Our operational tax rate was 14.6% for the fourth quarter and 13.9% for the full year, again in line with expectations. Fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding ended at 1,477 million shares in Q4 and 1,464 million shares for full year 2023. Free cash flow for the quarter was $718 million with $984 million of operating activities, less $267 million of net capital expenditures. Excluding special items, adjusted free cash flow was $913 million. Full year 2023 cash flow was $1.8 billion and adjusted free cash flow was $2.5 billion, both in line with expectations. For 2024, we expect full year free cash flow to be in excess of $2 billion, which includes approximately $800 million of expected payments related to acquisitions, restructuring, litigation and other special items. As of December 31st, 2023, we had cash on hand, $865 million, and our gross debt leverage was 2.3 times. We expect to fund the Axonics acquisition through a mix of cash on hand and new debt, which will be determined prior to or at the time of close. Our top capital allocation priority remains strategic tuck-in M&A, followed by annual share repurchases to offset dilution from employee stock grants. Our legal reserve was $377 million as of December 31st, a decrease of $30 million versus the prior quarter, $108 million of this reserve is already funded through our qualified settlement funds. Now I'll walk through guidance for the first quarter and the full year 2024. We expect full year 2024 reported revenue growth to be in a range of 8.5% to 9.5% versus 2023. Excluding an approximate 50 basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates, we expect full year 2024 operational revenue growth to be 9% to 10%, excluding a 100 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect full year 2024 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 8% to 9% versus 2023. We expect first quarter 2024 reported revenue growth to be in a range of 7.5% to 9.5% versus first quarter 2023. Excluding an approximate 100 basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates, we expect first quarter 2024 operational growth to be 8.5% to 10.5%, excluding a 150 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect first quarter 2024 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 7% to 9% versus Q1 2023. We expect our full year 2024 adjusted below the line expenses to be approximately $330 million. Under current legislation, including enacted laws and issued guidance under OECD Pillar Two rules, we forecast a full year 2024 operational tax rate of approximately 14% and an adjusted tax rate of approximately 13%. We continue to monitor tax legislation globally, including the currently drafted law to partially repeal US R&D capitalization. If the law were to be passed as currently proposed, we would expect a tailwind of approximately 100 basis points to our operational tax rate in 2024. We expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.23 to $2.27, representing 9% to 11% growth versus 2023, including an approximate $0.04 headwind from foreign exchange at current rates and existing hedging contracts, which will be recognized ratably through the year. We expect first quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.50 to $0.52. For more information, please check our investor relations website for Q4 2023 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more details on Q4 and full year results and 2024 guidance. In closing, I'm very proud of our 2023 performance and look forward to executing on our 2024 guidance of 8% to 9% organic revenue growth, 30 basis points to 50 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and adjusted EPS growth of 9% to 11%. Before I turn it back over to Lauren for the Q&A, I wanted to provide a quick update. A key part of our talent strategy is moving high-potential individuals throughout the company to give them a broad set of experiences. As part of this, effective March 1st, Lauren Tengler will become the Global Controller for our Urology business unit, providing financial leadership to the global business and importantly, playing a key role in the integration of the Axonics business. Lauren previously spent many years within our Urology business, making her uniquely qualified for this opportunity. Following Lauren's transition, Jon Monson, currently our Chief Accounting Officer, will move to our Investor Relations function, leading Ally DeVoe and the rest of the team. I know the investment community will join me in thanking Lauren for her leadership and contributions and in welcoming Jon to the role. With that, I'll turn it back to Lauren, who will moderate the Q&A.\nLauren Tengler: Thanks so much, Dan. Drew, let's open it up to questions for the next 30 minutes or so. In order for us to take as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question. Drew, please go ahead.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRobert Marcus: Oh, great. Congrats on a really good quarter and congratulations, Lauren, on the promotion. Wanted to ask on two of the biggest product drivers in 2024, WATCHMAN and FARAPULSE. FARAPULSE got approval today. Wanted to see what's included in guidance for this year and how to think about phasing over the year. How long will it take to get into hospitals and approved on formularies? And then second on WATCHMAN, look, still had a very good quarter and fourth quarter, but growth slowed a little bit. How should we be thinking about the potential for WATCHMAN and 20% plus growth in 2024? Thanks a lot.\nMichael Mahoney: Sure. Thanks, Robbie, for the comments. I'll start with the WATCHMAN, just an excellent platform with the growth of 23% for the quarter, 25% for the full year. Terrific work. And as you know, that product gets larger and larger for us. I had to cut the script back because the clinical investments we're making with WATCHMAN will go on for a while, and we can touch on those if interested. But as you know, we continue to exceed likely 90% share in the US. We'll be rolling out WATCHMAN Flex Pro, you know, more as a percent of our total mix in the US in the first quarter and throughout the year. So you'll continue to see that, which is a differentiated platform. So with the clinical work that we're doing and the WATCHMAN Flex Pro and the Steerable Sheath likely to be in the market in 2024 as well, we continue to expect to gain share, and we aim to significantly widen the market opportunity through these clinical trials. So full steam ahead with WATCHMAN. On FARAPULSE, maybe the most exciting day I've had in my career at Boston Scientific with this platform that we have, based on the results that we've seen in Europe and the enthusiasm globally for our PFA platform. And to receive approval today was really exciting. We did anticipate a first-quarter approval for FARAPULSE. And as you might expect, we expect the impact of FARAPULSE to be, you know, somewhat in the first quarter and much more significant as the year goes on as we work with contracting with hospitals, getting on contract and getting the capital approved and rolling it out. But we have a lot of experience in doing that through our European success that we've enjoyed. Our team is trained. We have installation team. We continue to invest in it. So we're really excited about aiming to disrupt the EP market with what we think is the premier PFA platform.\nRobert Marcus: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: The next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citi. Please go ahead.\nJoanne Wuensch: Thank you and good morning. I don't want to leave FARAPULSE quite yet, and I suspect there'll be a lot of questions on it this call. But if you're looking for China and Japan approval in the second half of '24, could you sort of outline what you think those opportunities maybe? And then can you just give a quick highlight on some of the other sort of higher profile cardiology companies such as POLARx and AGENT? Thank you.\nMichael Mahoney: Yeah, so Ken can help me out. But obviously China and Japan represent significant opportunities in the EP market. They're the largest markets that we compete in -- in those countries and we currently are under-scaled, particularly in China. In Japan, we built a lot of momentum over the last, call it, 18 months with our POLARx launch. So in Japan, you know, that grew, I don't know, I think over 40%, our EP business. And so we have a more scaled commercial team capabilities in Japan. And the eventual approval in the second half of this year in Japan with FARAPULSE will really be, you know, the next leg of the growth stool in Japan for us. So a lot of confidence there. The market in China may be even bigger. We're a bit more under-scaled in China, so we'll be making a lot of investments there. We have a brand new leader. We're excited about in China to run our EP business under June Chang. So we'll be making additional commercial investments, clinical investments, and hope to have approval in the second half of the year in China. So those will be nice growth drivers for us in '24, more significant in 2025. And AGENT, Ken, do you want to comment a bit more on FARAPULSE? Dr. Stein?\nKenneth Stein: I mean, I love to comment on FARAPULSE. Again it is a very exciting day. Joanne, in terms of the questions specifically about Japan and China, right. I think we got to realize I mean, AFib is a global disease. I hate to use the word pandemic, but it is pandemic. Now and we're really pleased about the strength of the clinical trial data that we have as well as the commercial experience in Europe with, as Mike said, you know, greater than 40,000 patients already treated to-date. And it's that strength of the clinical data, right, that led us to the really, I think, rapid approval that we got from the FDA, and that has led us to update our anticipated approval times both in Japan and China. Again, I think having said that, you know, we look to those approvals in the second half. So I don't think we're going to expect to really see too much material out of that until we get into 2025. But they are both large and important markets and large and important patient populations that are currently really very much underserved in terms of access to Ablation technology.\nJoanne Wuensch: AGENT.\nMichael Mahoney: Thanks, Joanne\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Congrats on a strong finish here and the approval of FARAPULSE in the US. On FARAPULSE, can you talk about the manufacturing capacity for the catheter and console upon launch? And expectations for the EP business this year? You know you grew 43% in Q4'23. Any reason why growth would be lower in '24? And I have to ask you to please clarify your comments around ACURATE Neo2. It sounds like something happened with Prime, which is the larger size. What are the implications for the other sizes of Neo2 in Europe and the US? Thank you.\nMichael Mahoney: Thanks, Larry. Starting with FARAPULSE, really very proud of the global supply chain team and what they've done over the past 18 months in the FARAPULSE Group that we originally acquired a while ago. But they've done a tremendous job in building capabilities to supply this for the US launch and to expand in Europe, and eventually Asia, as we just highlighted. So we are now significantly improved our catheter and console supply. We opened numerous centers in Europe in the fourth quarter and we're ready to go. So we, at this point, don't anticipate supply being an issue to continue to support Europe or to facilitate the US launch, given the capabilities and investments that we've made in approvals to manufacture in multiple locations. So great work by the supply chain team. And we're ready to launch this in the US. On ACURATE Neo2, as I mentioned in the earnings script, maybe just two overall points. We continue to do very well with ACURATE Neo2 in Europe, implanting, I think, the number 70,000, and continuing to grow faster than the market in Europe. And we are on track for what we have is called Prime in Europe in 2025. So that continues to move forward as planned. With respect to the trial, as I mentioned in the script, based on the interim analysis, we now need to wait for the full one year follow up of the 1,500 patients. And as a result of that, we don't -- we will not be receiving approval for ACURATE Neo2 in 2024. And we will wait until likely near the end of 2024 for the full readout of the ACURATE IDE study to determine our path forward.\nLarry Biegelsen: Thank you, and congrats, Lauren.\nLauren Tengler: Thanks, Larry.\nOperator: The next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nVijay Kumar: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a really strong finish here. Maybe just one on the guidance here perhaps for Dan. Dan, the 8% to 9%, it looks like FARAPULSE, the prior guided, I'd assume, a back half launch. It's coming in a little bit ahead. Can you just, you know, walk us through the 8% to 9%. Is that right that FARAPULSE, perhaps, assumptions have changed? Any impact from VBP or base impact that we should be aware of? And what is -- what are you assuming for pricing in fiscal '24? Thank you.\nDaniel Brennan: Sure. So the VBP assumptions are the same as they've always been, really no change there. As you saw, in December, when we issued the press release on AVANT GUARD, we moved up the timing of expected FARAPULSE launch to Q1. So we've been anticipating Q1 launch. And that 8% to 9% full year and the 7% to 9% for the first quarter in terms of revenue growth contemplated a Q1 approval of FARAPULSE, as Mike said, you know, there's probably some contribution in Q1, but more of that contribution comes in Q2 to Q4. So the 8% to 9% has that contemplated in the overall guide. And then pricing, so I would say on pricing is, we were basically flat in 2023 and the goal is to be flat again in 2024. So likely no impact would be the goal in 2024 versus 2023.\nVijay Kumar: Fantastic. Sorry, on days, Dan? Any days impact here?\nDaniel Brennan: No, all the days -- there's a lot of, obviously, a lot of noise in days around the world through the year. It's all contemplated in the guidance. All in the 8% to 8% for the full year.\nVijay Kumar: Fantastic. Thank you guys.\nMichael Mahoney: Sure, Vijay. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDanielle Antalffy: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. Just a follow-up question on ACURATE Neo2, Mike, if I could. So appreciate the comments that you did provide. Just curious, I mean, obviously, you're giving pretty strong guidance here for 2024. I mean, is the right read here that regardless of what happens with ACURATE Neo2 and timing there, you're sticking to your long-term sales growth guidance that you provided back in September. And sort of how do we think about this as a long-term growth contributor now, given this little wrinkle here? And Lauren, we will miss you very much. Thanks so much.\nMichael Mahoney: Lauren is not leaving the company. She will be around. She'll be around. We're still going to see her.\nDanielle Antalffy: But we won't get to see her, so.\nMichael Mahoney: Okay, well.\nDanielle Antalffy: I'll work my way in.\nMichael Mahoney: We'll work our way in, right, once in a while. So we're excited for John to come in and Lauren to move out. No, excited for Lauren to go to Urology. Yes. So to answer your question, we are fully committed to the 8% to 10% organic growth CAGR over the '24 to '26 period that we provided in Investor Day. Absolutely no change in that outlook. And pleased with the '23 performance, as you know, where we grew 12%. So absolutely no change to those financial goals. You know, ACURATE continues to do well in Europe. It's a product that's used every day by many European physicians and we're excited about getting the larger size approved there. We are disappointed that we didn't get ACURATE over the goal line for approval in 2024. So at this point, we need to wait until the full data sets been followed up for a year and read out likely before the end of this year in 2024. And we'll take it from there in terms of the US launch. But we are disappointed we're not going to launch that really very end of this year and into next, but absolutely no change to our financial guidance that we gave at Investor Day.\nDanielle Antalffy: Okay. Great. And also welcome, Jon. Sorry, I didn't mean to leave you out. Thanks so much guys.\nJon Monson: Thanks, Danielle.\nOperator: The next question comes from Travis Steed with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nTravis Steed: Hey, thanks for taking the question. Maybe one more follow-up on TAVR. Can you just remind us what the interim look was? Was that just like a six-month look at the data? Now you need to wait for one-year data for the line to separate. And curious if you think what you saw in the interim look. Are you still pretty confident that at one year? We could have a US TAVR launch? Or does this put the whole US TAVR launch at risk?\nMichael Mahoney: Janar, Are you able to hear us okay?\nJanarthanan Sathananthan: Yes, I can hear you loud and clear.\nMichael Mahoney: Great. Dr. Sathananthan is our Chief Medical Officer, as you know, for ICT and Structural Heart. Maybe he could comment a bit.\nJanarthanan Sathananthan: Yeah. I'll take the comment just about the data. So essentially what happened in the trial was that as part of a planned interim analysis, we made the decision to await the full one-year data. It is important just to note that the accurate IDE study is still an active clinical study with active clinical follow-up. And so as a result, we cannot disclose any data related to the trial at this time. We will expect, as Mike said, a readout of the study in the second half of 2024, following a full data review.\nTravis Steed: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Josh Jennings with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJosh Jennings: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations for a strong end of the year. Wanted to ask about the international cardiac ablation market. Boston, incredible fourth quarter, 40% plus growth. Some of your competitors delivered really strong international growth in their electrophysiology businesses as well. What's going on in the international market? I mean, are we seeing the promise of PFA driving market expansion this early? Or is there any pricing dynamics going on? But I think it's 20% almost market growth in internationally for cardiac ablation this year. Just wanted to get some details there and whether that could translate to PFA launches in the United States, driving market expansion, which I think you guys detailed in your Investor Day. Thanks for taking the question.\nMichael Mahoney: Dr. Stein, do you want to take a shot on it?\nKenneth Stein: Yes, Josh, and thanks, Mike. I think it's a couple of factors here, and I don't know that I can parse out for you, you know, how much is getting contributed from each. But again, I think we just begin with the fact, right, that atrial fibrillation is an incredibly common arrhythmia. Again, as I said earlier, it is literally pandemic worldwide. I know, for instance, in the US, right, a quarter of adults over the age of 40 will experience Afib at some point in our lives. And ablation, even with legacy thermal technologies, things for us, like stable point or POLARx is incredibly effective. It's more effective than drugs. But on a global scale, it is still really incredibly underpenetrated as a market. And much of the growth that you see, really just reflects, I think, you know, increasing realization in the cardiology community, the referring physician community, about the relative efficacy and safety of all ablation technologies. And then you layer on top of that the promise and the data of FARAPULSE, right? And FARAPULSE, again, it takes a procedure that's already effective. It is at least as effective. It is clearly safer. And it's also much more efficient than thermal ablation. And so that, right, enables docs and medical centers to scale this out much better, right, and start to get into this underpenetratrated population. So maybe a long-winded answer, but the short answer is, right, it's both a dramatically underpenetrated population to begin with, and then on top of that, you have the accelerated impact of FARAPULSE.\nJosh Jennings: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Richard Newitter with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nRichard Newitter: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on a really strong finish to the year.\nMichael Mahoney: Thanks.\nRichard Newitter: My first question is just going back to TAVR. You know, at your Analyst Day, you had talked to, you know, an expectation and a level of confidence that you could disrupt that market in the US relatively quickly out of the gate. I'm just curious with, you know, and get something approaching 20% share of the market over time, which is what you've done, you know, in other markets with your disruption capabilities. I'm just curious, does anything change there with the indeterminate kind of view of what the next steps are for the US? I'm just trying to focus on that commentary a bit. You know, does your outlook for the franchise in the US change in TAVR? And then I have a follow-up.\nKenneth Stein: Yeah. Just a few clarifying points. Again, in Europe, where we set 70,000 valves and physicians use it routinely on an everyday basis. We continue to grow faster than the market there and have continued to done that for, I don't know, 10 quarters in a row. So we make nice progress. And we're excited about getting the large valve size approved in Europe. I believe in 2025 is the time period. In the US, you know, honestly, first of all, I would state that we've never quoted a market share goal for TAVR in the US. So we never said 20. I'm not sure if that was what you put in your models or not. But based on the results that we've seen in Europe, we've always been confident in our ability to have ACURATE be a meaningful growth driver in the US, as we stated in Investor Day. You know, as a result of this, we are disappointed that, you know, we're not going to have this launched in 2024. As we talked about, based on the data that we just highlighted in the script, and as Janar mentioned, we now need to wait for the full year data, the full one-year follow-up on the 1,500 patients, and then working with the FDA and submitting that and having a data readout by year-end 2024. And we'll take it from there. So we -- as Janar said, the trial is still active. So we do not expect any of this news to alter our 8% to 10% organic growth over the three-year period. We're coming off of 12%. We continue to grow faster than most all of our peers and drop EPS faster than our peer group. And we're still very committed to those financial targets. And we're hopeful that ACURATE will continue to be a big growth driver for us. But a lot of it depends on that data readout in fourth quarter '24.\nRichard Newitter: Okay. Thanks for that. And then maybe just on M&A, you know, you've been active in 2023 and congrats on Relievant and more recently Axonics early this year. I'm just curious on kind of how we should think about, you know, how aggressive and opportunistic you'll be over the next twelve months. You mentioned, obviously your first priority remains deploying capital for tuck-ins. You know, but do we kind of think of you guys in a little bit of a digestion period or kind of steady she goes just as aggressive and opportunistic as you have been in the past?\nDaniel Brennan: Sure, I can take that one. So as you mentioned, Axonics, the most recent deal we did. Super pleased with that. I think that is a classic tuck-in for Boston Scientific. It's one, I think, we -- as you look back, these types of deals, we really do well with and we're super excited to have that close and welcome the Axonics team into the BSE family. As you said, we've been remarkably consistent over a long period of time. Tuck-in M&A is still the number one capital allocation priority for us and will continue to be active. In terms of how active over the near-to medium-term. This is not a major event like a major delevering event that we need to do. This is -- take on a little bit of additional debt over a period of time. And then over a very reasonable period of time, we'll be right back to where we are today relative to our leverage goal. So I look us -- I look for us to continue to be active in the tuck-in M&A space in '24 and beyond.\nRichard Newitter: Okay. Again, congrats on an outstanding 4Q.\nMichael Mahoney: Thank you.\nDaniel Brennan: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Patrick Wood with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Wood: Amazing. Thank you for taking the question and congrats, Lauren. I'd like to stick with Axonics, if that's all right. I appreciate it hasn't closed yet. But I'm just kind of curious, you know, Urology in Boston has a very sizable distribution network across, I guess, primarily Stone Management, but a whole bunch of different areas. How are you thinking about, you know, the ability to drive adoption in OAB faster and like really push that asset? I'm guessing, you know, having just played with the numbers, and correct me if I'm wrong, but there's some assumption of slightly faster growth once you've acquired Axonics and the Street previously had in there. At least that's where I end up with the numbers. Feel free to correct me. But how are you thinking about the commercialization really pushing that through the distribution network? Thanks.\nMichael Mahoney: Sure. Well, we haven't closed it yet. We hope to first half this year. You know, the team at Axonics done an amazing job with this platform since starting the company years ago and taking significant share and what is a strong double-digit growth market. The team at Axonics, you know, can't speak too much for them. It hasn't closed yet, has also done a remarkable job in a few areas. One at just the core technology where they gain -- leveraged that to gain share, the clinical data that they have, the commercial excellence that they possess, and also expanding the market through their direct-to-patient marketing and awareness. So this is a significant global opportunity. And the patient awareness of this treatment is still early days. And so that's one reason why we acquired the company was the momentum they have the technology and the long-term market cater that we see based on the global opportunity. The market today is reasonable nearly all US. That's something we'll evaluate more in the future here as to would it make sense for us to bring this to select markets outside the US, given the data that we have? As you mentioned, we have a significant commercial channel in our Urology business through all of our different business units within Urology. So this is an ideal fit. It is an adjacency for us. We don't have any competitive product in this area. So it's a nice adjacency for us that will allow us to compete more comprehensively with Urology customers. But we aim to, you know, take Axonics to the next level, but that team has done a terrific job to date.\nPatrick Wood: Amazing. Thanks for taking the question.\nMichael Mahoney: Sure.\nOperator: And just to verify, do we have time for one more question?\nLauren Tengler: Yes. One last question, please.\nOperator: Okay. That question will come from Michael Polark with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nMichael Polark: Good morning. Thanks for sneaking me in. I'll ask a gross margin question. Dan, I heard in the script for '24 flat to maybe slightly down year-on-year in the guide. The world seems to be calmer on price cost, but as we all know, the Middle East is flaring. And so, I'm curious, one, have you built in any cushion for kind of cost-push from those events? And two, in real-time, are you seeing any impact in the field? And if so, what does that look like?\nDaniel Brennan: Yeah, I can give you the short answer and a little bit longer answer. So the short one is that we've contemplated all that. Our team is super close to everything relative to our global supply chain network. And so there -- everything that we have in the guidance that we gave contemplates what we know today and what -- and the guidance that they're giving us on that, which -- the impact is minimal. Overall on gross margin, the little bit longer answer. You know, if you look at '23, we came in pretty much right where we expected at that 70.7%. And then, as we said at the Investor Day in September, we said it would be a challenge to contribute to our margin expansion goals in '24, right, which that's probably going to prove out to be true because we're saying we'll be either at or slightly below. But that's okay, as there are many other areas of the P&L, and as you know, we have a pretty solid track record over time of managing all those lines of the P&L to drive margin expansion, most recently that 70 basis points last year. So for '24, I'd kind of point to two headwinds and two tailwinds that will play out, and, again, have us at that kind of at or slightly below the 70.7% we put up last year. And one is inflation. And that's probably a little bit of a tailwind, right? So the macro factors are improving, in general, relative to inflation and other things. But as a reminder, we entered into, you know, contracts for many elements of materials for 2024 already last year. So we don't see that full benefit. But in '25 and '26, I'd like to believe there's even more benefit there, not only from the macro side of inflation, but also for gross margin in total. And then our mix, so you know, getting the FARAPULSE approval today, that's exciting because that's a great mix thing for the company, and many of our other launches are as well. And then on the headwind side, foreign exchange was a headwind in '23, that continue in '24. And as I said, at Investor Day, good problem to have, but we also need to make investments in manufacturing capacity to support the sales growth, you know, growing 12% last year and then 8% to 9% this year. But we're absolutely committed to the 150 basis points over three years. Gross margin probably won't pay a lot of bills for us in '24, but I think it certainly will in '25 and '26. Recall, we used to be north of 72% back in 2019. And we are maniacally focused to get there and then to get the overall operating margin kind of, you know, on the doorstep of 28 when we get to 2026. And that puts that 30% long-term goal that we've had kind of right in our line of sight as we're in 2026.\nMichael Polark: Thank you.\nMichael Mahoney: Thank you.\nLauren Tengler: Thanks for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Boston Scientific. If we were unable to get to your question or if you have any follow-ups, please don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team.

            "content": "Thanks, Lauren, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. 2023 results were excellent, and our global performance represented one of the strongest years in company history, exceeding our financial goals that we set for the year. This performance is fueled by innovation and clinical evidence generation, commercial execution, and the winning spirit of our global teams. In fourth quarter '23, total company operational sales grew 15%. Our organic sales grew 14% versus fourth quarter '22, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of 8% to 10%. Full-year '23 operational sales growth of 13% versus 2022, while organic sales grew 12%, exceeding our guidance of approximately 11% for the full year. Importantly, six of our eight business units grew sales double-digit in the fourth quarter and double-digits for the full year 2023. And all of our regions also grew double-digits in the fourth quarter and double-digits full year 2023. This performance is a testament to our category leadership strategy and our focus on innovation bolstered by commercial excellence. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS at $0.55 grew 24% versus 2022, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.49 to $0.52. Full year adjusted EPS of $2.05, grew 20% versus 2022, also exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $1.99 to $2.02. Q4 adjusted operating margin was 26.6% and full year '23 was 26.3%, which is exciting because it exceeds pre-pandemic levels. We generated a full year cash flow of $1.8 billion and adjusted free cash flow of $2.5 billion in line with our expectations. Now for our 2024 outlook. We expect healthy procedure volumes to continue and our guidance to organic growth of seven to nine for the first quarter of '24, and eight to nine for the full year of 2024. Our Q1'24 adjusted EPS estimate is $0.50 to $0.52. We expect our full year adjusted EPS to be $2.23 to $2.27, representing growth of 9% to 11%. This guidance excludes the acquisition of Axonics, which is expected to close in the first half of '24. Despite pressures on margins in '24 from FX headwinds, as well as investments in manufacturing capacity and selling expenses to fuel our exciting launches, we remain committed to improving operating income margins in 2024 and to our goal of improving adjusted operating margin by 150 basis points in '24 to '26. Now, Dan will provide more details on those financials for both 2023 and 2024. I'll now provide additional highlights on '23 results along with comments on our outlook. Regionally on an operational basis, the US grew 11% for the fourth quarter of '22. Full year 2023 grew 10% with particular strength in our Watchman, EP, Endo and Uro business units. Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 12% on an operational basis versus Q4 '22 and 13% on a full year basis. This above-market growth is supported by new and ongoing product launches across the portfolio, price discipline and strong commercial execution. We're excited about the year ahead with ongoing momentum across the region, particularly with our innovative EP portfolio and further opportunity in our growth in emerging markets within the EMEA region. Asia Pacific grew 17% operationally versus Q1 in '19 versus the full year 2022 with all major markets growing strong double-digits. Japan had a strong year growing double-digits for '22 with ongoing momentum from new products, most notably AGENT, DCB, Rezu\u0304m, POLARx FIT and WATCHMAN FLX. And on a full-year basis, China grew approximately 20% versus 2022. This consistent growth is fueled by the diverse portfolio, focus on innovation and strong commercial execution. Looking ahead, we expect China to be an accretive mid-teens grower over our '24 to '26 LRP. And to achieve over $1 billion in sales in '24, supported by new product launches, supply chain agility and sustained investments in our talents and capabilities. The team Latin America grew 17% operationally versus both Q4 and full year '22, with seven of eight business units growing double-digits on a full year basis. I'll now provide some additional commentary on our BUs. Urology had an excellent quarter, 10% organic growth versus Q4 '22, and on a full year basis grew 11% organically. Full year growth was led by our Stone Management and Prosthetic Urology globally. And in 2023, we re-launched our direct-to-patient campaign driving therapy awareness for erectile dysfunction and supporting double-digit growth within our Prosthetic Urology franchise. We're excited about the opportunities ahead in Urology, including our recently announced agreement to acquire Axonics, a medical technology company that offers innovative devices, treat urinary and bowel dysfunction. We look forward to bringing these complementary portfolios together and expanding access to differentiated technologies for physicians and patients. Endoscopy sales were also excellent in the quarter, growing 12% operationally and 11% organically versus fourth quarter of '22, on a full year basis, growing 12% operationally and 11% organically. Within the quarter, strong results were led by AXIOS and single-use scopes, both growing double-digits. On a full year basis, all regions grew double-digits, supported by the broad and deep portfolio, new product innovation and focus on commercial excellence. Neuromodulation sales grew 7% operationally and 3% organically versus fourth quarter '22, on a full-year basis, 7% operationally and 5% organically versus '22. Our Brain franchise grew double-digits both in the quarter and on a full-year basis, driven by the Vercise Genus portfolio and our innovative Image Guided Programming, which is designed to improve the precision and efficiency of the deep brain stimulation procedure. In the fourth quarter, on an organic basis, our Pain franchise was flat year-over-year, which was in line with our expectations. We expect our performance to improve in 2024 with the recent launch of our US WaveWriter Alpha DPN indication and the strong and real-world data on FAST recently presented at NANS. Furthermore, with the completion of our Relievant Medsystems acquisition in the fourth quarter, we're excited about our ability to offer an expanded Pain portfolio that supports a comprehensive treatment algorithm now included a novel Intracept system for the treatment of chronic low back pain. Peripheral Interventions sales were excellent, also growing 12% operationally and 10% organically versus Q4, on a full-year basis, growing 13% operationally and 11% organically versus '22. Arterial growth was led by the performance of our Drug-Eluting portfolio both in Q4 and on a full year. This market remains underpenetrated with more than half the procedure is still being used with bare-metal devices, underscoring the importance of our ongoing commitment to innovation and clinical evidence. In Venous, Q4 and full year growth was led by Varithena, our market-leading varicose vein technology. Additionally, in fourth quarter, EKOS growth was supported by REAL-PE, the largest real-world and near real-time dataset evaluating advanced therapies for pulmonary embolism patients. Our Interventional Oncology franchise performed extremely well in the fourth quarter and in 2023, growing low double-digits with strength across our portfolio of robust embolization technologies and cancer therapies We continue to look to expand our clinical evidence and are pleased to have commenced enrollment in the ROWAN trial, which will assess the safety and efficacy of using TheraSphere in combination with immunotherapy to treat HCC, the most common type of primary liver cancer. Cardiology delivered tremendous quarter -- delivered tremendous fourth quarter and year with both operational and organic sales growing 14% versus fourth quarter and for the full year 2022. Within Cardiology, Interventional Cardiology Therapies sales grew 10% for the full year and -- for the fourth quarter and full year. On a full-year basis, the Coronary Therapies franchise growth was driven by strong performance in our international regions and our Imaging franchise globally. AGENT Drug-Coated Balloon continues to perform very well in Japan. We now expect approval of AGENT in the US in the first half of 2024. AGENT DCB will be the first coronary drug-eluting balloon in the US indicated for in-stent restenosis, providing physicians and their patients a solution for this unmet clinical need. Our Structural Heart Valves franchise grew double-digits in both fourth quarter and in a full year basis, led by the performance of ACURATE Neo2 in Europe. And we now have treated more than 70,000 patients to date with our ACURATE technology globally. As we look ahead, we anticipate approval of ACURATE Prime in Europe in 2025. However, after reviewing a planned interim analysis of the US ACURATE IDE data, we will now wait for the full one-year data from the RCT cohort of 100 patients to determine our regulatory strategy. Therefore, we no longer anticipate the approval of ACURATE Prime in the US in 2024. Additionally in alignment with the FDA, we are suspending enrollment in the Single-arm Continued Access study, while continuing to enroll in the randomized extended durability cohorts. We expect to have more information in the second half of 2024, following the full data review. WATCHMAN sales grew 23% organically versus fourth quarter '22 and 25% on a full year basis. Q4 finished with record sales and strong utilization in all major markets. We have now treated over 400,000 patients globally with the WATCHMAN technology. US Q4 growth of 23% was supported by the breadth of the portfolio and the initial launch of WATCHMAN FLX Pro, which we expect to move into full launch in the first quarter. We continue to expand the breadth of clinical evidence supporting this technology and are pleased with the pace of enrollment within our post-market HEAL-LAA trial, including our newly added cohort, which is studying WATCHMAN FLX Pro, an underrepresented patient population. We also look forward to initiating our Monotherapy trial, SIMPLIFY trial later this year, which will study WATCHMAN FLX Pro with the simplified post-implant drug regimen. Cardiac Rhythm Management sales grew 5% organically versus Q4 '22, and on a full year basis grew 6% organically versus '22. On a full year basis, our Diagnostics franchise grew double-digits outpacing market growth, driven by broad portfolio and ongoing investments in innovation. In Core CRM, in both fourth quarter and on a full year basis, our high-voltage business grew low-single digits and our low-voltage business grew mid-single-digits. 2023 performance was driven by our differentiated high-voltage portfolio and shock polarity options. As we look ahead, we expect our Core CRM growth to be in line with the market performance in '24. Turning to Electrophysiology, sales grew 43%, both operationally and organically versus fourth quarter '22, and on a full year basis grew 37% operationally and 33% organically versus '22. US fourth quarter sales grew 40% organically, driven by our POLARx launch and ongoing momentum with our Access Solutions portfolio. Our international EP growth accelerated in the fourth quarter, growing 46% organically, fueled by improved FARAPULSE console supply. We now treated over 40,000 patients globally with the FARAPULSE technology to-date. And with the news this morning that we received FDA approval for FARAPULSE, we are thrilled to enter the US market immediately. We continue to invest in ClinicalEVIDENCE to study new indications and support access to our FARAPULSE technology. Late last year, we initiated the AVANT GUARD trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the system. It's a first-line treatment for Persistent AF compared to antiarrhythmic drug therapy. Additionally, real-world data was presented at AHA for more than 17,000 patients treated with the FARAPULSE from the MANIFEST-17K registry, which reinforced the real-world safety profile of the FARAPULSE platform with no reports of permanent phrenic nerve palsy or pulmonary vein stenosis or esophageal injury and an overall major adverse rate event rate of less than 1%. We're excited to bring this innovative technology to more markets and expect approval of FARAPULSE in Japan -- China and Japan likely in the second half of this year. In closing, I'm very proud of our global team what we were able to accomplish in '23, resulting in a full year organic sales growth of 12% and adjusted EPS growth of 20%. We're excited about the year ahead and remain focused on our talent, sustaining a culture that's motivated to drive differentiated performance and achieve our long-range plan goals. Those goals, as a reminder, are sales an average of 8% to 10% over the three-year period, while expanding adjusted operating margin by 150 basis points, including double-digit adjusted EPS growth, an improvement of our free cash flow conversion to approximately 70% in 2026. With all of that, I'll pass it over to Dan to provide more details on the financials. Sure. Thanks, Robbie, for the comments. I'll start with the WATCHMAN, just an excellent platform with the growth of 23% for the quarter, 25% for the full year. Terrific work. And as you know, that product gets larger and larger for us. I had to cut the script back because the clinical investments we're making with WATCHMAN will go on for a while, and we can touch on those if interested. But as you know, we continue to exceed likely 90% share in the US. We'll be rolling out WATCHMAN Flex Pro, you know, more as a percent of our total mix in the US in the first quarter and throughout the year. So you'll continue to see that, which is a differentiated platform. So with the clinical work that we're doing and the WATCHMAN Flex Pro and the Steerable Sheath likely to be in the market in 2024 as well, we continue to expect to gain share, and we aim to significantly widen the market opportunity through these clinical trials. So full steam ahead with WATCHMAN. On FARAPULSE, maybe the most exciting day I've had in my career at Boston Scientific with this platform that we have, based on the results that we've seen in Europe and the enthusiasm globally for our PFA platform. And to receive approval today was really exciting. We did anticipate a first-quarter approval for FARAPULSE. And as you might expect, we expect the impact of FARAPULSE to be, you know, somewhat in the first quarter and much more significant as the year goes on as we work with contracting with hospitals, getting on contract and getting the capital approved and rolling it out. But we have a lot of experience in doing that through our European success that we've enjoyed. Our team is trained. We have installation team. We continue to invest in it. So we're really excited about aiming to disrupt the EP market with what we think is the premier PFA platform. Yeah, so Ken can help me out. But obviously China and Japan represent significant opportunities in the EP market. They're the largest markets that we compete in -- in those countries and we currently are under-scaled, particularly in China. In Japan, we built a lot of momentum over the last, call it, 18 months with our POLARx launch. So in Japan, you know, that grew, I don't know, I think over 40%, our EP business. And so we have a more scaled commercial team capabilities in Japan. And the eventual approval in the second half of this year in Japan with FARAPULSE will really be, you know, the next leg of the growth stool in Japan for us. So a lot of confidence there. The market in China may be even bigger. We're a bit more under-scaled in China, so we'll be making a lot of investments there. We have a brand new leader. We're excited about in China to run our EP business under June Chang. So we'll be making additional commercial investments, clinical investments, and hope to have approval in the second half of the year in China. So those will be nice growth drivers for us in '24, more significant in 2025. And AGENT, Ken, do you want to comment a bit more on FARAPULSE? Dr. Stein? Thanks, Joanne Thanks, Larry. Starting with FARAPULSE, really very proud of the global supply chain team and what they've done over the past 18 months in the FARAPULSE Group that we originally acquired a while ago. But they've done a tremendous job in building capabilities to supply this for the US launch and to expand in Europe, and eventually Asia, as we just highlighted. So we are now significantly improved our catheter and console supply. We opened numerous centers in Europe in the fourth quarter and we're ready to go. So we, at this point, don't anticipate supply being an issue to continue to support Europe or to facilitate the US launch, given the capabilities and investments that we've made in approvals to manufacture in multiple locations. So great work by the supply chain team. And we're ready to launch this in the US. On ACURATE Neo2, as I mentioned in the earnings script, maybe just two overall points. We continue to do very well with ACURATE Neo2 in Europe, implanting, I think, the number 70,000, and continuing to grow faster than the market in Europe. And we are on track for what we have is called Prime in Europe in 2025. So that continues to move forward as planned. With respect to the trial, as I mentioned in the script, based on the interim analysis, we now need to wait for the full one year follow up of the 1,500 patients. And as a result of that, we don't -- we will not be receiving approval for ACURATE Neo2 in 2024. And we will wait until likely near the end of 2024 for the full readout of the ACURATE IDE study to determine our path forward. Sure, Vijay. Thanks. Lauren is not leaving the company. She will be around. She'll be around. We're still going to see her. Okay, well. We'll work our way in, right, once in a while. So we're excited for John to come in and Lauren to move out. No, excited for Lauren to go to Urology. Yes. So to answer your question, we are fully committed to the 8% to 10% organic growth CAGR over the '24 to '26 period that we provided in Investor Day. Absolutely no change in that outlook. And pleased with the '23 performance, as you know, where we grew 12%. So absolutely no change to those financial goals. You know, ACURATE continues to do well in Europe. It's a product that's used every day by many European physicians and we're excited about getting the larger size approved there. We are disappointed that we didn't get ACURATE over the goal line for approval in 2024. So at this point, we need to wait until the full data sets been followed up for a year and read out likely before the end of this year in 2024. And we'll take it from there in terms of the US launch. But we are disappointed we're not going to launch that really very end of this year and into next, but absolutely no change to our financial guidance that we gave at Investor Day. Janar, Are you able to hear us okay? Great. Dr. Sathananthan is our Chief Medical Officer, as you know, for ICT and Structural Heart. Maybe he could comment a bit. Dr. Stein, do you want to take a shot on it? Thanks. Thank you. Sure. Well, we haven't closed it yet. We hope to first half this year. You know, the team at Axonics done an amazing job with this platform since starting the company years ago and taking significant share and what is a strong double-digit growth market. The team at Axonics, you know, can't speak too much for them. It hasn't closed yet, has also done a remarkable job in a few areas. One at just the core technology where they gain -- leveraged that to gain share, the clinical data that they have, the commercial excellence that they possess, and also expanding the market through their direct-to-patient marketing and awareness. So this is a significant global opportunity. And the patient awareness of this treatment is still early days. And so that's one reason why we acquired the company was the momentum they have the technology and the long-term market cater that we see based on the global opportunity. The market today is reasonable nearly all US. That's something we'll evaluate more in the future here as to would it make sense for us to bring this to select markets outside the US, given the data that we have? As you mentioned, we have a significant commercial channel in our Urology business through all of our different business units within Urology. So this is an ideal fit. It is an adjacency for us. We don't have any competitive product in this area. So it's a nice adjacency for us that will allow us to compete more comprehensively with Urology customers. But we aim to, you know, take Axonics to the next level, but that team has done a terrific job to date. Sure. Thank you."

So essentially what happened in the trial was that as part of a planned interim analysis, we made the decision to await the full one-year data. It is important just to note that the accurate IDE study is still an active clinical study with active clinical follow-up. And so as a result, we cannot disclose any data related to the trial at this time. We will expect, as Mike said, a readout of the study in the second half of 2024, following a full data review."

            "name": "Kenneth Stein",
            "content": "I mean, I love to comment on FARAPULSE. Again it is a very exciting day. Joanne, in terms of the questions specifically about Japan and China, right. I think we got to realize I mean, AFib is a global disease. I hate to use the word pandemic, but it is pandemic. Now and we're really pleased about the strength of the clinical trial data that we have as well as the commercial experience in Europe with, as Mike said, you know, greater than 40,000 patients already treated to-date. And it's that strength of the clinical data, right, that led us to the really, I think, rapid approval that we got from the FDA, and that has led us to update our anticipated approval times both in Japan and China. Again, I think having said that, you know, we look to those approvals in the second half. So I don't think we're going to expect to really see too much material out of that until we get into 2025. But they are both large and important markets and large and important patient populations that are currently really very much underserved in terms of access to Ablation technology. Yes, Josh, and thanks, Mike. I think it's a couple of factors here, and I don't know that I can parse out for you, you know, how much is getting contributed from each. But again, I think we just begin with the fact, right, that atrial fibrillation is an incredibly common arrhythmia. Again, as I said earlier, it is literally pandemic worldwide. I know, for instance, in the US, right, a quarter of adults over the age of 40 will experience Afib at some point in our lives. And ablation, even with legacy thermal technologies, things for us, like stable point or POLARx is incredibly effective. It's more effective than drugs. But on a global scale, it is still really incredibly underpenetrated as a market. And much of the growth that you see, really just reflects, I think, you know, increasing realization in the cardiology community, the referring physician community, about the relative efficacy and safety of all ablation technologies. And then you layer on top of that the promise and the data of FARAPULSE, right? And FARAPULSE, again, it takes a procedure that's already effective. It is at least as effective. It is clearly safer. And it's also much more efficient than thermal ablation. And so that, right, enables docs and medical centers to scale this out much better, right, and start to get into this underpenetratrated population. So maybe a long-winded answer, but the short answer is, right, it's both a dramatically underpenetrated population to begin with, and then on top of that, you have the accelerated impact of FARAPULSE. Yeah. Just a few clarifying points. Again, in Europe, where we set 70,000 valves and physicians use it routinely on an everyday basis. We continue to grow faster than the market there and have continued to done that for, I don't know, 10 quarters in a row. So we make nice progress. And we're excited about getting the large valve size approved in Europe. I believe in 2025 is the time period. In the US, you know, honestly, first of all, I would state that we've never quoted a market share goal for TAVR in the US. So we never said 20. I'm not sure if that was what you put in your models or not. But based on the results that we've seen in Europe, we've always been confident in our ability to have ACURATE be a meaningful growth driver in the US, as we stated in Investor Day. You know, as a result of this, we are disappointed that, you know, we're not going to have this launched in 2024. As we talked about, based on the data that we just highlighted in the script, and as Janar mentioned, we now need to wait for the full year data, the full one-year follow-up on the 1,500 patients, and then working with the FDA and submitting that and having a data readout by year-end 2024. And we'll take it from there. So we -- as Janar said, the trial is still active. So we do not expect any of this news to alter our 8% to 10% organic growth over the three-year period. We're coming off of 12%. We continue to grow faster than most all of our peers and drop EPS faster than our peer group. And we're still very committed to those financial targets. And we're hopeful that ACURATE will continue to be a big growth driver for us. But a lot of it depends on that data readout in fourth quarter '24."

            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Fourth quarter 2023 consolidated revenue of $3,725 million, represents 14.9% reported growth versus fourth quarter of 2022 and includes a 40 basis point tailwind from foreign exchange, in line with our expectations. Excluding this $12 million tailwind from foreign exchange, operational revenue growth was 14.5% in the quarter. Sales from closed acquisitions and divestitures contributed 90 basis points resulting in 13.6% organic revenue growth, exceeding our guidance range of 8% to 10%. Q4 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $0.55 grew 24% versus 2022, exceeding the high-end of our guidance range of $0.49 to $0.52, primarily driven by our strong sales performance. Full year 2023 consolidated revenue of $14,240 million represents 12.3% reported revenue growth versus full year 2022 and includes an 80 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, again in line with our expectations. Excluding this $104 million headwind from foreign exchange, operational revenue growth for the year was 13.1%. Sales from closed acquisitions and divestitures contributed 80 basis points, resulting in 12.3% organic revenue growth, exceeding our guidance range of approximately 11%. Full year 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $2.05, grew 20% versus 2022, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $1.99 to $2.02. Adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter was 70.4%, resulting in full year 2023 adjusted gross margin of 70.7%, in line with our expectations and representing a 20 basis point improvement versus full year 2022, inclusive of a 220 basis point headwind from foreign exchange. In 2024, we expect a mixed benefit from our new launches with offsetting headwinds from FX and the incremental investment in our manufacturing capacity. And as a result, we anticipate our full year 2024 adjusted gross margin will be at or slightly below our full-year 2023 rate. Fourth quarter adjusted operating margin was 26.6%, resulting in a full year 2023 adjusted operating margin of 26.3%, improving 70 basis points versus 2022. We expect to expand adjusted operating margin in 2024 by another 30 basis points to 50 basis points, balancing progress towards our long-range plan goal of 150 basis points over the three years, 2024 to 2026, with flexibility for critical investments to support key launches. On a GAAP basis, the fourth quarter operating margin was 15.7%, resulting in a full year reported operating margin of 16.5%. Moving to below the line, fourth quarter adjusted interest and other expenses totaled $79 million, resulting in full year adjusted interest and other expenses of $331 million in line with our expectations. On an adjusted basis, our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 10% and 11.2% for the full year 2023, including favorable discrete tax items and the benefit from stock compensation accounting. Our operational tax rate was 14.6% for the fourth quarter and 13.9% for the full year, again in line with expectations. Fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding ended at 1,477 million shares in Q4 and 1,464 million shares for full year 2023. Free cash flow for the quarter was $718 million with $984 million of operating activities, less $267 million of net capital expenditures. Excluding special items, adjusted free cash flow was $913 million. Full year 2023 cash flow was $1.8 billion and adjusted free cash flow was $2.5 billion, both in line with expectations. For 2024, we expect full year free cash flow to be in excess of $2 billion, which includes approximately $800 million of expected payments related to acquisitions, restructuring, litigation and other special items. As of December 31st, 2023, we had cash on hand, $865 million, and our gross debt leverage was 2.3 times. We expect to fund the Axonics acquisition through a mix of cash on hand and new debt, which will be determined prior to or at the time of close. Our top capital allocation priority remains strategic tuck-in M&A, followed by annual share repurchases to offset dilution from employee stock grants. Our legal reserve was $377 million as of December 31st, a decrease of $30 million versus the prior quarter, $108 million of this reserve is already funded through our qualified settlement funds. Now I'll walk through guidance for the first quarter and the full year 2024. We expect full year 2024 reported revenue growth to be in a range of 8.5% to 9.5% versus 2023. Excluding an approximate 50 basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates, we expect full year 2024 operational revenue growth to be 9% to 10%, excluding a 100 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect full year 2024 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 8% to 9% versus 2023. We expect first quarter 2024 reported revenue growth to be in a range of 7.5% to 9.5% versus first quarter 2023. Excluding an approximate 100 basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates, we expect first quarter 2024 operational growth to be 8.5% to 10.5%, excluding a 150 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect first quarter 2024 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 7% to 9% versus Q1 2023. We expect our full year 2024 adjusted below the line expenses to be approximately $330 million. Under current legislation, including enacted laws and issued guidance under OECD Pillar Two rules, we forecast a full year 2024 operational tax rate of approximately 14% and an adjusted tax rate of approximately 13%. We continue to monitor tax legislation globally, including the currently drafted law to partially repeal US R&D capitalization. If the law were to be passed as currently proposed, we would expect a tailwind of approximately 100 basis points to our operational tax rate in 2024. We expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.23 to $2.27, representing 9% to 11% growth versus 2023, including an approximate $0.04 headwind from foreign exchange at current rates and existing hedging contracts, which will be recognized ratably through the year. We expect first quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.50 to $0.52. For more information, please check our investor relations website for Q4 2023 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more details on Q4 and full year results and 2024 guidance. In closing, I'm very proud of our 2023 performance and look forward to executing on our 2024 guidance of 8% to 9% organic revenue growth, 30 basis points to 50 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and adjusted EPS growth of 9% to 11%. Before I turn it back over to Lauren for the Q&A, I wanted to provide a quick update. A key part of our talent strategy is moving high-potential individuals throughout the company to give them a broad set of experiences. As part of this, effective March 1st, Lauren Tengler will become the Global Controller for our Urology business unit, providing financial leadership to the global business and importantly, playing a key role in the integration of the Axonics business. Lauren previously spent many years within our Urology business, making her uniquely qualified for this opportunity. Following Lauren's transition, Jon Monson, currently our Chief Accounting Officer, will move to our Investor Relations function, leading Ally DeVoe and the rest of the team. I know the investment community will join me in thanking Lauren for her leadership and contributions and in welcoming Jon to the role. With that, I'll turn it back to Lauren, who will moderate the Q&A. Sure. So the VBP assumptions are the same as they've always been, really no change there. As you saw, in December, when we issued the press release on AVANT GUARD, we moved up the timing of expected FARAPULSE launch to Q1. So we've been anticipating Q1 launch. And that 8% to 9% full year and the 7% to 9% for the first quarter in terms of revenue growth contemplated a Q1 approval of FARAPULSE, as Mike said, you know, there's probably some contribution in Q1, but more of that contribution comes in Q2 to Q4. So the 8% to 9% has that contemplated in the overall guide. And then pricing, so I would say on pricing is, we were basically flat in 2023 and the goal is to be flat again in 2024. So likely no impact would be the goal in 2024 versus 2023. No, all the days -- there's a lot of, obviously, a lot of noise in days around the world through the year. It's all contemplated in the guidance. All in the 8% to 8% for the full year. Sure, I can take that one. So as you mentioned, Axonics, the most recent deal we did. Super pleased with that. I think that is a classic tuck-in for Boston Scientific. It's one, I think, we -- as you look back, these types of deals, we really do well with and we're super excited to have that close and welcome the Axonics team into the BSE family. As you said, we've been remarkably consistent over a long period of time. Tuck-in M&A is still the number one capital allocation priority for us and will continue to be active. In terms of how active over the near-to medium-term. This is not a major event like a major delevering event that we need to do. This is -- take on a little bit of additional debt over a period of time. And then over a very reasonable period of time, we'll be right back to where we are today relative to our leverage goal. So I look us -- I look for us to continue to be active in the tuck-in M&A space in '24 and beyond. Thank you. Yeah, I can give you the short answer and a little bit longer answer. So the short one is that we've contemplated all that. Our team is super close to everything relative to our global supply chain network. And so there -- everything that we have in the guidance that we gave contemplates what we know today and what -- and the guidance that they're giving us on that, which -- the impact is minimal. Overall on gross margin, the little bit longer answer. You know, if you look at '23, we came in pretty much right where we expected at that 70.7%. And then, as we said at the Investor Day in September, we said it would be a challenge to contribute to our margin expansion goals in '24, right, which that's probably going to prove out to be true because we're saying we'll be either at or slightly below. But that's okay, as there are many other areas of the P&L, and as you know, we have a pretty solid track record over time of managing all those lines of the P&L to drive margin expansion, most recently that 70 basis points last year. So for '24, I'd kind of point to two headwinds and two tailwinds that will play out, and, again, have us at that kind of at or slightly below the 70.7% we put up last year. And one is inflation. And that's probably a little bit of a tailwind, right? So the macro factors are improving, in general, relative to inflation and other things. But as a reminder, we entered into, you know, contracts for many elements of materials for 2024 already last year. So we don't see that full benefit. But in '25 and '26, I'd like to believe there's even more benefit there, not only from the macro side of inflation, but also for gross margin in total. And then our mix, so you know, getting the FARAPULSE approval today, that's exciting because that's a great mix thing for the company, and many of our other launches are as well. And then on the headwind side, foreign exchange was a headwind in '23, that continue in '24. And as I said, at Investor Day, good problem to have, but we also need to make investments in manufacturing capacity to support the sales growth, you know, growing 12% last year and then 8% to 9% this year. But we're absolutely committed to the 150 basis points over three years. Gross margin probably won't pay a lot of bills for us in '24, but I think it certainly will in '25 and '26. Recall, we used to be north of 72% back in 2019. And we are maniacally focused to get there and then to get the overall operating margin kind of, you know, on the doorstep of 28 when we get to 2026. And that puts that 30% long-term goal that we've had kind of right in our line of sight as we're in 2026."

We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q2 2023 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release, as well as reconciliations on the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financials & Filings. The duration of this morning's call will be approximately one hour. Mike and Dan will provide comments on Q3 performance, as well as the outlook for our business, including Q4 and full-year 2023 guidance. Then we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike, and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Ken Stein. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, operational revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, and organic revenue growth further excludes acquisitions and divestitures for which there are less than a full period of comparable net sales. Relevant acquisitions and divestitures excluded for organic growth are Baylis Medical, which closed on February 14, 2022, the majority stake investment in Acotec Scientific, and Apollo Endosurgery, which closed in February and April of this year, respectively. Divestitures include the endoscopy pathology business, which closed April of this year. Please note that we have elected to consolidate Acotec results on a one quarter lag, which had been included in our Q3 reported and adjusted results. Guidance excludes the previously announced agreement to acquire Relievant Medsystems, which is expected to close in the first half of 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. For more information, please refer to our financial and operating highlights deck, which may be found on our Investor Relations website. On this call, all references to sales and revenue, unless otherwise specified, are organic. This call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, may, believe, estimate, and other similar words. They include, among other things, statements about our growth in market share, new and anticipated product approvals and launches, acquisitions, clinical trials, cost savings and growth opportunities, our cash flow and expected use, our financial performance, including sales, margins and earnings, as well as our tax rates, R&D spend, and other expenses. If our underlying assumptions turn out to be incorrect, or if certain risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from the expectations and projections expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them. At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike.\nMike Mahoney: Well done, Lauren. Thank you, and thank you for joining us today. We're pleased with another quarter of excellent results, with momentum continuing fueled by new product innovation, clinical evidence, and our talented teams across the globe. Q3 \u201923, total company sales grew 11% operationally and 10% organically versus Q3 \u201822, which exceeds the high end of our guidance range of 7% to 9%. This performance is a testament to our category leadership strategy, focus on innovation, and strong commercial execution. We believe that most of our global business units grew in line or faster than the respective markets. Q3 adjusted EPS at $0.50 grew 15% versus Q3 \u201822, which exceeds the high end of the guidance range of $0.46 to $0.48. Q3 adjusted operating margin was 26.1%, slightly higher than anticipated. Now, for \u201823 guidance, we're guiding to Q4 \u201823 organic revenue growth of 8% to 10%, and aligning our full-year organic guidance to approximately 11%, the high end of our prior guidance. Our Q4 \u201823 adjusted EPS estimate is $0.49 to $0.52, and we are raising our full-year adjusted EPS range to $1.99 to $2.02.  I'll now provide additional highlights on Q3, along with comments on our 2023 outlook, and then Dan will provide more details on the financials. Regionally, on an operational basis, the US grew 9% versus Q3 \u201922, driven by strong performance within our WATCHMAN, EP, endo, and urology businesses. Europe, Middle East, and Africa grew 11% on an operational basis versus Q3 \u201822. Performance of the region was broad-based, with double-digit growth in seven out of our eight business units. Within the quarter, we saw strong growth in EP, with ongoing momentum and demand for FARAPULSE and POLARx. Asia Pac grew 19% operationally versus third quarter \u201922, led by strength in Japan and China. Japan grew strong double digits in the quarter, with ongoing momentum from new products, most notably AGENT DCB, Rez\u016bm, POLARx FIT, and WATCHMAN FLX. Physician demand for our differentiated AGENT DCB remains high, and we've taken a market leadership position within the quarter after launching earlier this year. Double-digit growth in China was led by our Imaging and Complex PCI portfolio, as well as the commercial execution of the team more broadly. These results were further supported by the performance of the Acotec business, and we continue to expect double-digit growth in China for the full year.  I'll now provide some additional commentary on the business units. In the quarter, urology sales grew 11% organically, with international growth of 18%, fueled by new products and globalization efforts, with all regions outside the US growing double digits. Globally, the Stone Management franchise grew double digits, driven by LithoVu and Laser Therapies. Rez\u016bm had another strong quarter of double-digit growth, backed by long-term clinical data supporting international momentum with a leave nothing behind message resonating in Asia. Endoscopy sales grew 11% organically and 12% operationally versus third quarter \u201922, broad-based strength across all regions. Our single-use imaging and AXIOS technologies continued to perform well, both doing double digits within the quarter. And earlier this month, we received US marketing authorization for an expanded indication of the AXIOS stent to include gallbladder drainage, increasing access to more patients with this platform. Neuromodulation sales grew 3% organically versus third quarter \u201822. Our Brain franchise grew low double digits in the quarter, with strength from new product launches, including the Vercise Neural Navigator 5 Software, which is our fifth generation DBS programming solution, furthering our leadership in image-guided programming for more streamlined DBS programming in the US.  Our pain business grew low single digits, driven by spinal cord stimulation sales, which were slightly below our expectations. We're optimistic about the opportunities ahead of our pain business included in our recent US approval to expand indication of our WaveWriter Alpha SCS system to include DPN, which is expected to launch in early \u201824. We're also excited to add to our portfolio with our recently announced agreement to acquire Relievant Medsystems and its Intracept procedure. Intracept is the only US-cleared system for vertebrogenic pain, expanding our portfolio of pain offerings, which is expected to close in the first half of 2024. Peripheral intervention sales grew 8% organically and 13% operationally, which includes the results of Acotec versus third quarter \u201922. Our Arterial franchise delivered another strong quarter, growing low double digits, led by ongoing success globally with our drug-eluting portfolio. in Venous, data from the REAL-PE study was presented earlier this week, demonstrating statistically significant lower major bleeding rates in patients with pulmonary embolism who are treated with EKOS compared to a competitive mechanical thrombectomy device. The REAL-PE study analyzed nearly real-time EHR data for over 2,200 PE patients from 2009 to 2023. This study provides new clinical evidence for providers in determining the optimal modality for each patient's needs. Our Interventional Oncology franchise grew double digits, including ongoing momentum with our Embold Coil, launch as well as strong demand for our cancer therapies. Within the quarter, we received FDA clearance to expand the indication of the Visual ICE Cryoablation System to treat pain associated with tumors that have metastasized to bone in patients who are unable to receive standard radiation therapy. Our cardiology group delivered another excellent quarter, with organic sales growth of 11% versus third quarter \u201822. Within cardiology, interventional cardiology therapy sales grew 7% organically versus third quarter \u201822. Our Structural Heart Valves franchise grew double digits in third quarter, led by ACURATE Neo2 sales performance in Europe. And growth within our Coronary Therapies franchise is fueled by ongoing success of our Imaging technologies. We're pleased to have received clearance for the AVVIGO+ Guidance System. AVVIGO is our next-generation platform that provides high quality fast imaging, with improved physiologic assessment of coronary vessels and lesions. We continue to be pleased with the performance of AGENT DCB in Japan. Importantly, our AGENT IDE trial results were presented yesterday as a late breaker at TCT, with data demonstrating statistical superiority of the AGENT drug-coated balloon versus uncoated balloon angioplasty for the treatment of patients with in-stent restenosis. With our recent regulatory submission to FDA, we anticipate approval of AGENT, the first drug-coated balloon indicated for the coronary arteries within the US in the second half of \u201924. WATCHMAN sales grew 23% organically versus third quarter \u201822. We're very pleased with the excellent performance of this franchise, and have now treated more than 350,000 patients globally. Last month, we received FDA approval of the latest generation WATCHMAN FLX Pro, which is designed to improve visualization during device placement to enhance healing post-implant, and treat a broader range of patient anatomies. Additionally, enrollment has commenced in HEAL-LAA, a post-market study of the WATCHMAN FLX Pro device in the US. We continue to expect strong growth from the WATCHMAN, business backed by new technologies and significant investment in clinical evidence.  Cardiac rhythm management sales grew 5% organically versus third quarter \u201922. And core CRM, our high voltage business, grew low single digits, and our low voltage business grew mid-single digits. Our Diagnostics franchise grew double digits in the quarter, fueled by our diverse portfolio of ambulatory ECGs and ICM. We continue to further innovate in the space, having launched in the US the next-generation LUX-Dx II and the II+ implantable cardiac monitor for long-term monitoring of arrhythmias, providing enhanced diagnostic capabilities and enabling a more efficient workflow. Electrophysiology sales grew 27% organically versus third quarter \u201822. International growth of 33% was driven by excellent performance from our differentiated FARAPULS and POLARx technologies, as well as our Access Solutions franchise and the leading VersaCross Access platform. US growth of 22% was led by our Access Solutions franchise, along with contribution from the early approval - I'm sorry, from the approval of the POLARx Cryoablation System, including POLARx FIT, which enables physicians to adjust and expand the cryo balloon to best fit a patient's individual anatomy. Also, within the quarter, we launched VersaCross Connect for POLARSHEATH, which provides safe and efficient access to the left side of the heart during procedures, expanding our Access Solutions portfolio. Clinical evidence generation remains a key priority, and we're pleased to have completed enrollment in the first phase of the ADVANTAGE AF clinical trial studying FARAPULSE for the treatment of patients with persistent AFib. Additionally, we commenced enrollment and treated our first patient in an extension arm of the ADVANTAGE study to evaluate FARAPOINT, which is a point-by-point PFA focal catheter for CTI ablations used to treat atrial flutter. Finally, within the quarter, we achieved important milestones to bring in our leading PFA technology to the US. Recalled data from our ADVENT IDE trial was presented at ESC at the end of August, comparing FARAPULSE to standard of care thermal modalities meeting the primary endpoints. We've also completed our US regulatory submission and continue to anticipate the approval of FARAPULSE in the US in the second half of \u201924.  Through the first nine months of this year, we have grown organic sales 12% while growing adjusted EPS 18%, with broad-based growth across all of our business units and regions. This performance is supportive of the goal we laid out last month at our Investor Day, where we aspire to be highest performing large cap med tech company over the next three years. We believe our focus and talent and culture, our relentless pursuit of innovation, while doing the right thing for society and operating responsibly, sets us up to deliver a unique set of financial goals over the 2024 to 2026 long range period. Our LRP goals include growing sales 8% to 10% CAGR over the period, while expanding adjusted rate operating margins by 150 basis points over the three years, with double-digit adjusted EPS growth annually, and improvement of our free cash flow conversion to approximately 70% by 2026.  With that, I'll pass off to Dan to provide more details on the financials. \nDan Brennan: Thanks, Mike. Third quarter 2023 consolidated revenue of $3,527 million, represents 11.2% reported revenue growth versus third quarter 2022, and includes a 10 basis point tailwind from foreign exchange, which was lower than expected due to the strengthening of the US dollar throughout the quarter. Excluding this $4 million tailwind from foreign exchange, operational revenue growth was 11.1% in the quarter. Sales from acquisitions and divestitures contributed 90 basis points, resulting in 10.2% organic revenue growth, exceeding our guidance range of 7% to 9%.  Q3 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $0.50 grew 15% versus 2022, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.46 to $0.48, driven predominantly by our strong sales performance. Adjusted gross margin for the third quarter was 70.2%, slightly lower than our expectations, primarily driven by foreign exchange. In light of our Q3 results, we now anticipate that full-year 2023 adjusted gross margin will only slightly improve on a year-over-year basis.  Strong sales performance drove third quarter adjusted operating margin of 26.1%, resulting in a year-to-date adjusted operating margin also of 26.1%. Our year-to-date performance sets us up well to achieve our full-year 2023 adjusted operating margin goal of approximately 26.4%, which represents 80 basis points of expansion versus 2022.On a GAAP basis, the third quarter operating margin was 19.6%, which includes a $111 million credit primarily related to certain IP litigation matters.  Moving to below the line, third quarter adjusted interest and other expenses totaled $81 million, which was in line with our expectations. On an adjusted basis, our tax rate for the third quarter was 12.4%, favorable to our expectations, driven by certain discreet tax items in the quarter. Our operational tax rate was 13.9%, in line with expectations. Fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding ended at 1,475 million in Q3. Free cash flow for the quarter was $509 million, with $698 million from operating activities, less $190 million net capital expenditures. Excluding special items, adjusted free cash flow was $582 million. As a result of our strong year-to-date adjusted free cash flow generation, we now expect full-year 2023 adjusted free cash flow in excess of $2.4 billion.  Our top capital allocation priority remains strategic tuck-in M&A, followed by annual share purchases to offset dilution from employee stock grants, which we announced at last month's Investor Day. As of September 30, 2023, we had cash on hand of $952 million, and our gross debt leverage was 2.3 times.  I'll now walk through guidance for Q4 and full-year 2023. We expect full-year 2023 operational revenue growth to be approximately 12%, which excludes an approximate 100 basis-point headwind from foreign exchange, higher than our previous estimate due to the strengthening of the US dollar. Excluding the impact of closed acquisitions and divestitures, we expect full-year 2023 organic revenue growth to be approximately 11% versus 2022. We expect fourth quarter 2023 operational revenue growth to be in a range of 9% to 11% versus Q3 2022, with a neutral impact from foreign exchange based on current rates. Excluding the contribution from closed acquisitions and divestitures, we expect fourth quarter 2023 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 8% to 10%. We continue to expect our full-year 2023 adjusted below the line expenses to be approximately $340 million. Our full-year 2023 operational tax rate is now expected to be approximately 13.5% under current legislation and forecasted geographic mix of sales. As a result of a lower operational tax rate and favorable discrete items recognized in the third quarter, we now expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 12%. We expect a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1,478 million shares for Q4 2023, and 1,464 million shares for the full year 2023. We expect full-year adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.99 to $2.02, representing 17% to 18% growth versus 2022. We continue to anticipate a neutral impact from foreign exchange on full year 2023 adjusted earnings per share. We expect fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.49 to $0.52. For more information, please check our Investor Relations website for Q3 2023 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more details on Q3 results and 2023 guidance.  In closing, I'm very proud of our year-to-date financial performance, with top-tier organic revenue growth of 12%, adjusted operating margin of 26.1%, and adjusted earnings per share growth of 18%. I look forward to continued momentum in the fourth quarter to close out 2023, which will set the stage towards achieving our long-range financial goals.  With that, I'll turn it back to Lauren, who will moderate the Q&A.\nLauren Tengler: Thanks, Dan. Costas, let's open it up to questions for the next 30 minutes or so. In order for us to take as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question. Costas, please go ahead.\nOperator: [Operator instructions]. And the first question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\nRobbie Marcus: Hi, good morning. And congrats on a great quarter. And since many of us are at TCT, I'll add the nice AGENT DCB trial as well. I had two questions, so I'm going to - I'll just go with one here. As we go back to the Analyst Day, you pointed to 8% to 10% growth and 150 basis points of operating margin expansion over the three-year timeframe. And I believe one of the comments was at the beginning of the range, it'll be towards the lower end and accelerate as you have some of your big new product launches coming. So, I'm looking at 2024 here and I see the Street at 8% to 9% organic sales growth and about 50 basis points margin expansion. I just want to make sure we're interpreting the comments you made at t he Analyst Day correctly, and any thoughts you have on directionality for next year. Thanks a lot.\nMike Mahoney: Yes, sure. Robbie. I think relative to the Analyst Day commentary, let me just reiterate just to make sure we're all on the same page. So, yes, as you said, 8% to 10% organic revenue growth over the period, 2024 to 2026, 150 basis points of margin expansion over that three-year period, which would put us, assuming we're at that 26.4% at the end of this year, kind of near that 28%, which is a nice jumping off point for that 30% long-term goal. And then we said that the 2025 revenue growth rate would likely be higher than our 2024 revenue growth rate due to the launches that are coming in 2024. So, that's really the commentary that we had relative to Investor Day. And obviously, 2023 is shaping up to be a great year, good jumping off point heading into 2024. But relative to specifics around 2024, we're working through our 2024 annual planning process here in the fourth quarter. And as you would expect, we'll use that as the basis to give you the guidance when we get to our Q4 earnings call in January.\nRobbie Marcus: All right, appreciate it. Thank you. \nOperator: The next question is from the line of Joanne Wuensch with Citibank. Please go ahead.\nJoanne Wuensch: Good morning, and thank you for taking the question. Since many are sitting here at TCT, I think I'm going to focus on that, including, I'd love some feedback on the data that's been presented here, particularly on the AGENT trial. And then I found the WATCH-TAVR Trial also interesting. So, anything you can comment on, that would be wonderful. Thank you.\nMike Mahoney: Dr. Stein, you want to comment?\nDr. Ken Stein: Yes, thanks, Mike. Let me start again. Hey Joanne. We\u2019re really pleased by all of the data that we saw at TCT. I'll begin with AGENT, and literally could not be happier with the ultimate results of that randomized trial, which again, as I hope everyone recognizes, right, is intended to get approval of the first drug-coated balloon indicated for use in the coronaries in the United States for in-stent restenosis, right? In-stent restenosis accounts for approximately 10% of US coronary interventions today. Having a drug-coated balloon will allow interventionalists to address these stent failures while leaving nothing behind. We've seen how well it's performing where we do have it approved in Japan. And just to reiterate really the incredible results from the trial met endpoint of target lesion failure at 12 months was really marked statistical and clinical superiority to Plano balloon angioplasty, and importantly, both clinically important reductions in target-vessel-MI, and reductions in the need for target lesion revascularization.  And then - yes, so that was yesterday. Day before yesterday, we saw the results of WATCH-TAVR. And so, WATCH-TAVR, I think, was an important investigator-initiated trial looking at the combined use of the legacy WATCHMAN 2.5 device at the same time of TAVR in high risk patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing TAVR. And I think on the one hand, we sort of acknowledge that combined use of WATCHMAN with TAVR does face a challenge in reimbursement environment, but also important, the trial validates the safety and the efficacy of the legacy WATCHMAN 2.5 device as compared to control therapy, including the use of NOACs in this population.\nJoanne Wuensch: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from a line of Rick Wise with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nRick Wise: Good morning. Thank you for the question and it's wonderful to see such an excellent quarter. I guess if I focus on one, maybe you could expand on your - Mike, on your - if you want to do it, your neuromod comments, just your latest thinking, just broadly what's going to help re-accelerate the business or what's next from here. But more specifically, the PDN indication approval, how does that affect the business? When does it start contributing? How would you have us think about the beneficial contribution there? Thanks a lot.\nMike Mahoney: Thanks. Morning, Rick. In the third quarter, as I mentioned, we're proud that most all of our businesses grew, at least, at most likely, most of them grew above market, likely, with the exception of the one that you asked about, neuromod. So, in the neuromod business, we grew roughly 3% in the quarter. I'll just start off, before you - I jumped SCS, the brain business. Our DBS business continues to do well, continues to grow share. And in third quarter, it grew double digits again with the neural navigator. So, that business continues to become a larger part of the overall mix. Global SCS still is the largest piece. That's been under pressure, as you pointed out. The pressure points really come from additional - probably a couple of new competitors to the marketplace, some competitive launches, and our DPN approval, which we're very excited about, which you highlighted, we received in October, but we don't expect to launch our DPN platform until likely first quarter, near the mid first quarter of 2024. So, this will certainly help us with our core SCS business with that additional indication. And also, with the Relievant company that we've signed but not yet closed, we expect to close that in 2024. So, we need the combination of the DPN through our existing SCS base, combining with the Relievant, and also our RF platform gives us a really nice category leadership position to treat pain with a variety of options, which will be differentiated. So, we do expect likely some softness to continue in the fourth quarter, and we obviously aim to improve on those results in 2024 based on what I just highlighted.\nRick Wise: Appreciate the color. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nVijay Kumar: Hey, guys, congrats on the print and the data being presented at TCT. If I may, I want to stick to on the financial side. Dan, just to clarify the 2024 commentary, if the acceleration is all being driven by new products, and these new products are being launched, I think you said back half of next year, should we be perhaps thinking about the lower end of that 8% to 10%? And I think you mentioned gross margins FX impact here. So, it looks like Q4 is going to look similar to 3Q. How to think about any FX impact from gross margins as we look at the outlook.\nDan Brennan: Sure. So, I\u2019ll hit the gross margin one first. The gross margin in the third quarter was a little bit lower than we expected, and it was predominantly driven by FX, that 70.2%. So, we had been targeting kind of to be approaching 71% for the full year this year. We were 70.5 last year. Just tempering that commentary to say you know what, we might not hit the approaching 71%. We might be - we'll be north of 70.5, but maybe not as high as approaching 71%. So, a bit of a nuance there, but driven by FX. And we had mentioned for - the long range plan at Investor Day for 2024, 2025, and 2026, that there'd be a bit of an FX headwind in gross margin in 2024 that should get better over that timeframe of 2024, 2025, 2026. Relative to 2024 organic revenue growth, no, there's really not much to assume other than we'll let you know on January 31 when we have our call. We have 8% to 10% as the CAGR for the three years. As I mentioned, we'll work through our annual planning process here over the back half of this quarter, and we'll let you know. We do have some nice launches, obviously in 2024, as you mentioned, many in the back half, but we'll let you know on January 31 what we think the range will be for 2024.\nVijay Kumar: Understood. Thanks, guys. \nOperator: The next question is from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good morning. Congrats on the print. Mike, we've made it this far without GLP-1 question, but I'm going to ask it anyway. Obviously, diabetes and obesity are risk factors for many diseases such as cardiovascular disease. So, how are you thinking about the potential long-term impact of GLP-1s on your businesses, and any high level thoughts, Mike, on how investors have reacted to GLP-1s in general? Thank you.\nMike Mahoney: Dr. Stein, you want to give our comment on GLP-1? \nDr. Ken Stein: Yes, thanks, Mike, and hey, good morning, Larry. I think I'm going to begin, right, I mean, as a doc, I think you have to acknowledge these are promising agents. I think on the other hand, as a doc and a realist who's lived through the launch of other promising agents in the past, and I think statins are a really good example, I think you\u2019ve got to acknowledge, and particularly these drugs, given issues of cost, issues of convenience and issues of tolerability, we expect it will take at least a decade to reach peak penetration of these drugs in the indicated population. And even after a decade, we expect that only a minority of American patients with obesity will be taking these drugs. But if you think about these barriers to usage, I begin by saying, we see very limited short-term impact on cardiovascular disease, and even in the long-term, right, our analysis, taking into account, again, penetration ramp of these drugs, as I said, and taking into account what we know this far, thus far, about a reported 20% reduction in cardiovascular event rates, suggests to us that the impact on US coronary and peripheral procedure volumes will be minor even at peak. And I think it's important to state. So, we, even with these drugs, continue to expect both of these procedures to continue to grow in volume over the next decade. First of all, I think it's also really important to point out that cardiovascular disease is a global issue, that there is less attribution to obesity in other regions, particularly Asia, making it less amenable to prevention with these drugs, which are frankly also very likely to be less accessible outside of the US. Also, any decrease in cardiovascular mortality and events will necessarily be accompanied by a corresponding increase in the prevalence of other diseases that are associated with aging, diseases in areas that are really very well served by our products, including things like cardiac pacing, interventional oncology for many forms of cancer, deep brain stimulation. And finally, right, the assumptions that I'm talking to in terms of our modeling, right, don't consider other procedural growth factors like an aging population over this period, and certainly doesn't consider the long track record that we have of focusing and executing on innovation. \nLarry Biegelsen: Thanks, Dr. Stein.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Travis Steed with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nTravis Steed: Hey, thanks for taking the question. I did want to ask about FARAPULSE. It sounded like the update was expected approval in second half 2024. Just curious when that was filed with the FDA. And maybe talk a little bit about scaling that up in the US and the potential to see pull-through on the ancillary products like mapping.\nLauren Tengler: Maybe you take the timing of launch, and you can speak to the value to the full portfolio.\nDr. Ken Stein: Yes, sure, Lauren. So, yes, on timing, again, as we said, I think everyone knows, right, our foundational pivotal scale data to submit to the FDA was ADVENT. Presented those results, as Mike said at, ESC, the end of August, with simultaneous publication in New England Journal of Medicine. Hit all of our endpoints, very clean data set. And so, again, as we've said, we've now completed our regulatory submission to the FDA and things are in the regulator's hands. So, continue to expect approval second half of next year. And I think all of the EPs that I've spoken to in the US can't wait to get their hands on it.\nMike Mahoney: Yes. You saw the results in the third quarter, which are quite strong with both POLARx and FARAPULSE. I think what's important is our supply chain team has done a terrific job over the past 18 months in building supply of both catheters and the capital equipment needed. So, we expect to see a more significant install cadence to the back half of this quarter and into first quarter. So, we feel like we've really significantly improved our supply capabilities, and you'll see that in 2024 in Europe, and we'll be ready for the US launch.\nTravis Steed: Great. Thanks a lot for the question. Congrats on the good quarter.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Danielle Antalffy with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDanielle Antalffy: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. And congrats on a great quarter and the data here at TCT. Just a quick question on Q4 topline guide. I imagine there's some conservatism baked in here, but if I'm looking at it correctly, is implying a little bit of a deceleration, and not to be nitpicky here, but just want to make sure we're understanding of what the tailwinds versus headwinds are as we go into Q4 and heading into 2024. Thanks so much.\nDan Brennan: Sure, Danielle. Yes, I think of note, if you think back to our July guidance, obviously we didn't give specific Q4 guidance, but implied in that guidance would've been 7% to 9%. So, the 8% to 10% that we have for the fourth quarter is a bit of acceleration from where that would've been. As always, we think the 8% to 10% is a prudent number for the quarter, and believe it's the right number for the quarter for - to close out the year. It'll put us at 11%, approximately 11% organic revenue growth for the year. So, I think that's a great year for the company. And you combine that with the other metrics that we have, not just revenue, but the 11% organic revenue growth, you'd see 80 basis points of margin expansion at that 26.4% adjusted op margin. And then you get to 17% to 18% full-year EPS at that $1.99 to kind of that milestone over $2 to get to that $2.02. That's a good year.\nDanielle Antalffy: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Matt Taylor with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nMatt Taylor: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I actually wanted to ask one on neuromodulation. You talked about results below expectations in light of competitive dynamics. So, I was hoping you could comment on that and whether you expect any improvement in growth now that you have the PDN indication.\nMike Mahoney: Sure, Matt. Yes, there's been a couple of new entrants into the field over the last 12 months. And so, they've taken a little bit of market share. Overall, the market's likely, I don't know, 5% to 6%-ish, and this year we're likely to - in SCS US, likely be below the market. I mentioned earlier, a big driver there is not having the support of DPN, which we just recently received in October. And we expect to be able to offer that capability in line with some of our competitors in first quarter 2024. So, we do expect to have a softer fourth quarter, and then we expect acceleration improvement in 2024 versus 2023 for our SCS business and our Brain business. DBS continues to take share and grow double digits, and again, mentioned it's likely the only division that's grown below the market.\nMatt Taylor: Great. Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Josh Jennings with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJosh Jennings: Hi, good morning. Congratulations on the strong results, and wanted to follow up on Travis's question on FARAPULSE. Was hoping to just better understand where your US EP sales force stands today and how you're building that out, your plan to build that out and for the FARAPULSE launch. And then just on top of that, just thinking about the full integration of FARAPULSE and arrhythmia and developing these FARAVIEW capabilities, is there anything of note that we should be thinking about that would provide clinical advantages that could catalyze stronger demand for arrhythmia once that integration is completed, I believe at the year-end of 2024? Thanks for taking the questions.\nMike Mahoney: Sure. Yes. I won't go into all too many specifics on our commercial strategy. We do have a scaled and trained EP sales force, as you imagine, given the capabilities we have with our WATCHMAN division and our EP business and our CRM business. So, we have a scaled EP force that's been trained up now, and what's great to see is they're successfully selling cryo today. So, having the approval of that, and we had a really nice initial, I don't know, 30 days or so of cryo openings. So, we expect to see cryo to be a nice revenue driver force in 2024 as we wait for the FARAPULSE approval. So, we do have a scaled, highly capable EP commercial team. And Ken, if you want to comment on the arrhythmia offerings. \nDr. Ken Stein: Yes. Thanks, Josh. And again, we're very excited about FARAPULSE as it stands today. So, we have disclosed, we do have a next generation of FARAWAVE catheter, right, which is the ablation catheter part of the FARAPULSE system that will include an embedded NAV sensor that will work with a novel iteration to the arrhythmia software that we're calling FARAVIEW that we do have targeted for year-end of 2024. And our goal here really, Josh, is, I said, we're never going to compel people to use arrhythmia if they want to use FARAPULSE, but we're going to make the FARAWAVE and FARAVIEW system compelling for physicians to use. And there are really some very novel things that we're able to do with that system combination that we believe is going to improve physician workflow and hopefully lead to even better patient outcomes with the combined system, even on top of the great outcomes that we saw in ADVENT.\nJosh Jennings: Great. Thanks a lot. \nOperator: The next question is from the line of Chris Pasquale with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nChrisPasquale: Thanks. I had a follow-up for Dr. Stein on AGENT. The results were certainly impressive versus PTA, but it was noted from the podium that about 85% of ISR cases in the US today are being treated with drug-eluting stents. So, do you have plans to follow up the IDE study with a randomized trial versus DES? And maybe just some thoughts on how you see AGENT fitting into the treatment paradigm versus that standard of care.\nDr. Ken Stein: Yes, Chris, I\u2019m not going to get into what our post-approval research strategy is going to look like. I think that there's a lot to be learned when you see how drug-coated balloons are used in Japan and how they're used in Europe today, right? And patients with in-stent restenosis have failed the stent. And fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. I don't think that there are a lot of physicians who want to be putting additional foreign objects into someone who's already had in-stent restenosis. So, we really believe the results that we saw with AGENT are compelling and compelling enough to move the vast majority of interventionalists to use AGENT in place of either Plano balloon angioplasty or in place of, again, yet another stent in the in-stent restenosis area. I think the only other thing I'll say is, clearly there are a lot of potential indications for the use of the AGENT product beyond in-stent restenosis, and we'll certainly be looking at research into all of those as we get beyond approval and use for the first indication.\nChrisPasquale: That's helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Mike Polark with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nMike Polark: Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I have a question on price-cost. On price, the message has been historically we were kind of a little negative. We've moved it at the portfolio level to neutral. As we jump into 2024, what's a good base case? Neutral, again, a little up, a little down. On the cost side, kind of where are you seeing opportunities, raw materials, freight, labor, where are you seeing tensions? And then the last piece of this is, one of your large competitors did announce an inventory obsolescence charge this quarter. I think we all can see that inventories for the sector overall are quite higher than they used to be because of the COVID stresses and strains. Can I get an update on Boston's status on inventory? Thank you.\nDan Brennan: Sure, Mike. Happy to. A lot in that question. So, on the pricing, historically, we've been in that kind of very low single-digit decline for many years. We're starting to envision a world where we could be flat. So, that's a goal of ours as we go forward over the LRP to get to flat pricing, which obviously helps revenue and helps all the way down through the rest of the P&L. On the cost side, as you look at the traditional areas that we've talked about that have been impacted over the past couple of years, when you take freight, I'd say that's gotten better, but it's certainly not back to where it was. So, I'd say improving, but still elevated. And obviously, the conflict in the Middle East has us focused on fuel and oil, as that runs the risk of increasing off of that. The inflation impact on our direct material costs, again, I would say, this seems - we're seeing signs of that stabilizing over time, but it's absolutely elevated from where it was. So, we still do see impact there. And then the consistency of supply, it's not fully back to normal again, but it has improved. So, we're optimistic about the future that we see a better macro environment for cost of goods in that category, but we're not there yet, is what I would say. And then relative to inventory, yes, I mean, I would say, we've been building inventory over the last two or three years, right? Our back order has been elevated higher than we have liked. The team's done a great job over the last 12 months of getting that more in line with where you\u2019ve been historically. So, I would not point to EE&O charges from our perspective as a big driver because we're still a bid and catch-up mode and making sure that we have the right amount of inventory to supply. So, I think we're focused on having the right inventory, but we're not at the point where we have too much inventory.\nOperator: Mr. Polark, have you finished with your questions? \nMike Polark: Yes. Thank you. \nLauren Tengler: Yes. Can we take the last question?\nOperator: The next - our last question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nMatthew O'Brien: Morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I know you guys are a domestic company, but the performance in EMEA and APAC specifically were notable, and specifically APAC was really, really strong this quarter. Can you just give us a little more sense for - because I think those two collectively were roughly half your growth this quarter. The durability of the performance in those geographies, is it a function of just more and more products into those areas, and so that's pretty straightforward, or is it share taking that's required, or what's really required to continue to deliver, maybe not this level of growth, which is really strong again, but a very strong growth going forward where that's a significant contributor to the topline for 2024, 2025 and beyond? Thanks.\nMike Mahoney: Sure. Yes, starting with Europe is really not a - thankfully, it's not a new phenomenon for our team in Europe, which we also were referencing. Middle East, Africa, last year they grew 12%, and they're on track to grow another double digits again in 2023. So, the European team, it's really a combination clearly of share-taking given the markets aren't growing double digits in Europe. And our European team has benefited from the portfolio of having many of the product launches that were talked about for second half of 2024 in the US already in that marketplace. So, they're doing an excellent job of launching our innovative products, taking share in the more developed western European markets, and also building a pretty significant capability in the appropriate emerging markets in Europe. That also grows double digits. So, the team's just done a really nice job of executing and driving our innovation with the launches. Asia Pac had another strong quarter this year. That region also will grow double digits, grew double digits last year and double digits again this year. And I would say, the new news here is really just the strength of Japan is excellent in the quarter, and we expect another strong quarter for them in the fourth quarter. Again, it's all back to our people and our portfolio, and the team in Japan launching POLARx AGENT, AVVIGO will be the next platform to launch in Japan. So, that team's done a really nice job. In China, I was just there for about a week, and that team continues to grow nicely, strong double digits, despite all the challenges that are well known in the marketplace, again, based on the strength of our portfolio, some of the alliances that we're doing, and our team in China is quite strong. So, they continue to - so it's not a new event for us this quarter. Those regions have been delivering that for quite some time.\nLauren Tengler: Thanks, Mike. And thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Boston Scientific. If we were unable to get to your question, or if you have any follow-up, please don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dr. Ken Stein",
            "content": "Yes, thanks, Mike. Let me start again. Hey Joanne. We're really pleased by all of the data that we saw at TCT. I'll begin with AGENT, and literally could not be happier with the ultimate results of that randomized trial, which again, as I hope everyone recognizes, right, is intended to get approval of the first drug-coated balloon indicated for use in the coronaries in the United States for in-stent restenosis, right? In-stent restenosis accounts for approximately 10% of US coronary interventions today. Having a drug-coated balloon will allow interventionalists to address these stent failures while leaving nothing behind. We've seen how well it's performing where we do have it approved in Japan. And just to reiterate really the incredible results from the trial met endpoint of target lesion failure at 12 months was really marked statistical and clinical superiority to Plano balloon angioplasty, and importantly, both clinically important reductions in target-vessel-MI, and reductions in the need for target lesion revascularization.  And then - yes, so that was yesterday. Day before yesterday, we saw the results of WATCH-TAVR. And so, WATCH-TAVR, I think, was an important investigator-initiated trial looking at the combined use of the legacy WATCHMAN 2.5 device at the same time of TAVR in high risk patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing TAVR. And I think on the one hand, we sort of acknowledge that combined use of WATCHMAN with TAVR does face a challenge in reimbursement environment, but also important, the trial validates the safety and the efficacy of the legacy WATCHMAN 2.5 device as compared to control therapy, including the use of NOACs in this population. Yes, thanks, Mike, and hey, good morning, Larry. I think I'm going to begin, right, I mean, as a doc, I think you have to acknowledge these are promising agents. I think on the other hand, as a doc and a realist who's lived through the launch of other promising agents in the past, and I think statins are a really good example, I think you've got to acknowledge, and particularly these drugs, given issues of cost, issues of convenience and issues of tolerability, we expect it will take at least a decade to reach peak penetration of these drugs in the indicated population. And even after a decade, we expect that only a minority of American patients with obesity will be taking these drugs. But if you think about these barriers to usage, I begin by saying, we see very limited short-term impact on cardiovascular disease, and even in the long-term, right, our analysis, taking into account, again, penetration ramp of these drugs, as I said, and taking into account what we know this far, thus far, about a reported 20% reduction in cardiovascular event rates, suggests to us that the impact on US coronary and peripheral procedure volumes will be minor even at peak. And I think it's important to state. So, we, even with these drugs, continue to expect both of these procedures to continue to grow in volume over the next decade. First of all, I think it's also really important to point out that cardiovascular disease is a global issue, that there is less attribution to obesity in other regions, particularly Asia, making it less amenable to prevention with these drugs, which are frankly also very likely to be less accessible outside of the US. Also, any decrease in cardiovascular mortality and events will necessarily be accompanied by a corresponding increase in the prevalence of other diseases that are associated with aging, diseases in areas that are really very well served by our products, including things like cardiac pacing, interventional oncology for many forms of cancer, deep brain stimulation. And finally, right, the assumptions that I'm talking to in terms of our modeling, right, don't consider other procedural growth factors like an aging population over this period, and certainly doesn't consider the long track record that we have of focusing and executing on innovation. Yes, sure, Lauren. So, yes, on timing, again, as we said, I think everyone knows, right, our foundational pivotal scale data to submit to the FDA was ADVENT. Presented those results, as Mike said at, ESC, the end of August, with simultaneous publication in New England Journal of Medicine. Hit all of our endpoints, very clean data set. And so, again, as we've said, we've now completed our regulatory submission to the FDA and things are in the regulator's hands. So, continue to expect approval second half of next year. And I think all of the EPs that I've spoken to in the US can't wait to get their hands on it. Yes. Thanks, Josh. And again, we're very excited about FARAPULSE as it stands today. So, we have disclosed, we do have a next generation of FARAWAVE catheter, right, which is the ablation catheter part of the FARAPULSE system that will include an embedded NAV sensor that will work with a novel iteration to the arrhythmia software that we're calling FARAVIEW that we do have targeted for year-end of 2024. And our goal here really, Josh, is, I said, we're never going to compel people to use arrhythmia if they want to use FARAPULSE, but we're going to make the FARAWAVE and FARAVIEW system compelling for physicians to use. And there are really some very novel things that we're able to do with that system combination that we believe is going to improve physician workflow and hopefully lead to even better patient outcomes with the combined system, even on top of the great outcomes that we saw in ADVENT. Yes, Chris, I'm not going to get into what our post-approval research strategy is going to look like. I think that there's a lot to be learned when you see how drug-coated balloons are used in Japan and how they're used in Europe today, right? And patients with in-stent restenosis have failed the stent. And fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. I don't think that there are a lot of physicians who want to be putting additional foreign objects into someone who's already had in-stent restenosis. So, we really believe the results that we saw with AGENT are compelling and compelling enough to move the vast majority of interventionalists to use AGENT in place of either Plano balloon angioplasty or in place of, again, yet another stent in the in-stent restenosis area. I think the only other thing I'll say is, clearly there are a lot of potential indications for the use of the AGENT product beyond in-stent restenosis, and we'll certainly be looking at research into all of those as we get beyond approval and use for the first indication."

            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Third quarter 2023 consolidated revenue of $3,527 million, represents 11.2% reported revenue growth versus third quarter 2022, and includes a 10 basis point tailwind from foreign exchange, which was lower than expected due to the strengthening of the US dollar throughout the quarter. Excluding this $4 million tailwind from foreign exchange, operational revenue growth was 11.1% in the quarter. Sales from acquisitions and divestitures contributed 90 basis points, resulting in 10.2% organic revenue growth, exceeding our guidance range of 7% to 9%.  Q3 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $0.50 grew 15% versus 2022, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.46 to $0.48, driven predominantly by our strong sales performance. Adjusted gross margin for the third quarter was 70.2%, slightly lower than our expectations, primarily driven by foreign exchange. In light of our Q3 results, we now anticipate that full-year 2023 adjusted gross margin will only slightly improve on a year-over-year basis.  Strong sales performance drove third quarter adjusted operating margin of 26.1%, resulting in a year-to-date adjusted operating margin also of 26.1%. Our year-to-date performance sets us up well to achieve our full-year 2023 adjusted operating margin goal of approximately 26.4%, which represents 80 basis points of expansion versus 2022.On a GAAP basis, the third quarter operating margin was 19.6%, which includes a $111 million credit primarily related to certain IP litigation matters.  Moving to below the line, third quarter adjusted interest and other expenses totaled $81 million, which was in line with our expectations. On an adjusted basis, our tax rate for the third quarter was 12.4%, favorable to our expectations, driven by certain discreet tax items in the quarter. Our operational tax rate was 13.9%, in line with expectations. Fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding ended at 1,475 million in Q3. Free cash flow for the quarter was $509 million, with $698 million from operating activities, less $190 million net capital expenditures. Excluding special items, adjusted free cash flow was $582 million. As a result of our strong year-to-date adjusted free cash flow generation, we now expect full-year 2023 adjusted free cash flow in excess of $2.4 billion.  Our top capital allocation priority remains strategic tuck-in M&A, followed by annual share purchases to offset dilution from employee stock grants, which we announced at last month's Investor Day. As of September 30, 2023, we had cash on hand of $952 million, and our gross debt leverage was 2.3 times.  I'll now walk through guidance for Q4 and full-year 2023. We expect full-year 2023 operational revenue growth to be approximately 12%, which excludes an approximate 100 basis-point headwind from foreign exchange, higher than our previous estimate due to the strengthening of the US dollar. Excluding the impact of closed acquisitions and divestitures, we expect full-year 2023 organic revenue growth to be approximately 11% versus 2022. We expect fourth quarter 2023 operational revenue growth to be in a range of 9% to 11% versus Q3 2022, with a neutral impact from foreign exchange based on current rates. Excluding the contribution from closed acquisitions and divestitures, we expect fourth quarter 2023 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 8% to 10%. We continue to expect our full-year 2023 adjusted below the line expenses to be approximately $340 million. Our full-year 2023 operational tax rate is now expected to be approximately 13.5% under current legislation and forecasted geographic mix of sales. As a result of a lower operational tax rate and favorable discrete items recognized in the third quarter, we now expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 12%. We expect a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1,478 million shares for Q4 2023, and 1,464 million shares for the full year 2023. We expect full-year adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.99 to $2.02, representing 17% to 18% growth versus 2022. We continue to anticipate a neutral impact from foreign exchange on full year 2023 adjusted earnings per share. We expect fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.49 to $0.52. For more information, please check our Investor Relations website for Q3 2023 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more details on Q3 results and 2023 guidance.  In closing, I'm very proud of our year-to-date financial performance, with top-tier organic revenue growth of 12%, adjusted operating margin of 26.1%, and adjusted earnings per share growth of 18%. I look forward to continued momentum in the fourth quarter to close out 2023, which will set the stage towards achieving our long-range financial goals.  With that, I'll turn it back to Lauren, who will moderate the Q&A. Sure. So, I'll hit the gross margin one first. The gross margin in the third quarter was a little bit lower than we expected, and it was predominantly driven by FX, that 70.2%. So, we had been targeting kind of to be approaching 71% for the full year this year. We were 70.5 last year. Just tempering that commentary to say you know what, we might not hit the approaching 71%. We might be - we'll be north of 70.5, but maybe not as high as approaching 71%. So, a bit of a nuance there, but driven by FX. And we had mentioned for - the long range plan at Investor Day for 2024, 2025, and 2026, that there'd be a bit of an FX headwind in gross margin in 2024 that should get better over that timeframe of 2024, 2025, 2026. Relative to 2024 organic revenue growth, no, there's really not much to assume other than we'll let you know on January 31 when we have our call. We have 8% to 10% as the CAGR for the three years. As I mentioned, we'll work through our annual planning process here over the back half of this quarter, and we'll let you know. We do have some nice launches, obviously in 2024, as you mentioned, many in the back half, but we'll let you know on January 31 what we think the range will be for 2024. Sure, Danielle. Yes, I think of note, if you think back to our July guidance, obviously we didn't give specific Q4 guidance, but implied in that guidance would've been 7% to 9%. So, the 8% to 10% that we have for the fourth quarter is a bit of acceleration from where that would've been. As always, we think the 8% to 10% is a prudent number for the quarter, and believe it's the right number for the quarter for - to close out the year. It'll put us at 11%, approximately 11% organic revenue growth for the year. So, I think that's a great year for the company. And you combine that with the other metrics that we have, not just revenue, but the 11% organic revenue growth, you'd see 80 basis points of margin expansion at that 26.4% adjusted op margin. And then you get to 17% to 18% full-year EPS at that $1.99 to kind of that milestone over $2 to get to that $2.02. That's a good year. Sure, Mike. Happy to. A lot in that question. So, on the pricing, historically, we've been in that kind of very low single-digit decline for many years. We're starting to envision a world where we could be flat. So, that's a goal of ours as we go forward over the LRP to get to flat pricing, which obviously helps revenue and helps all the way down through the rest of the P&L. On the cost side, as you look at the traditional areas that we've talked about that have been impacted over the past couple of years, when you take freight, I'd say that's gotten better, but it's certainly not back to where it was.

The inflation impact on our direct material costs, again, I would say, this seems - we're seeing signs of that stabilizing over time, but it's absolutely elevated from where it was. So, we still do see impact there. And then the consistency of supply, it's not fully back to normal again, but it has improved. So, we're optimistic about the future that we see a better macro environment for cost of goods in that category, but we're not there yet, is what I would say. And then relative to inventory, yes, I mean, I would say, we've been building inventory over the last two or three years, right? Our back order has been elevated higher than we have liked. The team's done a great job over the last 12 months of getting that more in line with where you've been historically. So, I would not point to EE&O charges from our perspective as a big driver because we're still a bid and catch-up mode and making sure that we have the right amount of inventory to supply. So, I think we're focused on having the right inventory, but we're not at the point where we have too much inventory."

            "name": "Mike Mahoney",
            "content": "Well done, Lauren. Thank you, and thank you for joining us today. We're pleased with another quarter of excellent results, with momentum continuing fueled by new product innovation, clinical evidence, and our talented teams across the globe. Q3 '23, total company sales grew 11% operationally and 10% organically versus Q3 \u201822, which exceeds the high end of our guidance range of 7% to 9%. This performance is a testament to our category leadership strategy, focus on innovation, and strong commercial execution. We believe that most of our global business units grew in line or faster than the respective markets. Q3 adjusted EPS at $0.50 grew 15% versus Q3 \u201822, which exceeds the high end of the guidance range of $0.46 to $0.48. Q3 adjusted operating margin was 26.1%, slightly higher than anticipated. Now, for \u201823 guidance, we're guiding to Q4 \u201823 organic revenue growth of 8% to 10%, and aligning our full-year organic guidance to approximately 11%, the high end of our prior guidance. Our Q4 \u201823 adjusted EPS estimate is $0.49 to $0.52, and we are raising our full-year adjusted EPS range to $1.99 to $2.02.  I'll now provide additional highlights on Q3, along with comments on our 2023 outlook, and then Dan will provide more details on the financials. Regionally, on an operational basis, the US grew 9% versus Q3 '22, driven by strong performance within our WATCHMAN, EP, endo, and urology businesses. Europe, Middle East, and Africa grew 11% on an operational basis versus Q3 \u201822. Performance of the region was broad-based, with double-digit growth in seven out of our eight business units. Within the quarter, we saw strong growth in EP, with ongoing momentum and demand for FARAPULSE and POLARx. Asia Pac grew 19% operationally versus third quarter '22, led by strength in Japan and China. Japan grew strong double digits in the quarter, with ongoing momentum from new products, most notably AGENT DCB, Rezu\u0304m, POLARx FIT, and WATCHMAN FLX. Physician demand for our differentiated AGENT DCB remains high, and we've taken a market leadership position within the quarter after launching earlier this year. Double-digit growth in China was led by our Imaging and Complex PCI portfolio, as well as the commercial execution of the team more broadly. These results were further supported by the performance of the Acotec business, and we continue to expect double-digit growth in China for the full year.  I'll now provide some additional commentary on the business units. In the quarter, urology sales grew 11% organically, with international growth of 18%, fueled by new products and globalization efforts, with all regions outside the US growing double digits. Globally, the Stone Management franchise grew double digits, driven by LithoVu and Laser Therapies. Rezu\u0304m had another strong quarter of double-digit growth, backed by long-term clinical data supporting international momentum with a leave nothing behind message resonating in Asia. Endoscopy sales grew 11% organically and 12% operationally versus third quarter '22, broad-based strength across all regions. Our single-use imaging and AXIOS technologies continued to perform well, both doing double digits within the quarter. And earlier this month, we received US marketing authorization for an expanded indication of the AXIOS stent to include gallbladder drainage, increasing access to more patients with this platform. Neuromodulation sales grew 3% organically versus third quarter \u201822. Our Brain franchise grew low double digits in the quarter, with strength from new product launches, including the Vercise Neural Navigator 5 Software, which is our fifth generation DBS programming solution, furthering our leadership in image-guided programming for more streamlined DBS programming in the US.  Our pain business grew low single digits, driven by spinal cord stimulation sales, which were slightly below our expectations. We're optimistic about the opportunities ahead of our pain business included in our recent US approval to expand indication of our WaveWriter Alpha SCS system to include DPN, which is expected to launch in early \u201824. We're also excited to add to our portfolio with our recently announced agreement to acquire Relievant Medsystems and its Intracept procedure. Intracept is the only US-cleared system for vertebrogenic pain, expanding our portfolio of pain offerings, which is expected to close in the first half of 2024. Peripheral intervention sales grew 8% organically and 13% operationally, which includes the results of Acotec versus third quarter '22. Our Arterial franchise delivered another strong quarter, growing low double digits, led by ongoing success globally with our drug-eluting portfolio. in Venous, data from the REAL-PE study was presented earlier this week, demonstrating statistically significant lower major bleeding rates in patients with pulmonary embolism who are treated with EKOS compared to a competitive mechanical thrombectomy device. The REAL-PE study analyzed nearly real-time EHR data for over 2,200 PE patients from 2009 to 2023. This study provides new clinical evidence for providers in determining the optimal modality for each patient's needs. Our Interventional Oncology franchise grew double digits, including ongoing momentum with our Embold Coil, launch as well as strong demand for our cancer therapies. Within the quarter, we received FDA clearance to expand the indication of the Visual ICE Cryoablation System to treat pain associated with tumors that have metastasized to bone in patients who are unable to receive standard radiation therapy. Our cardiology group delivered another excellent quarter, with organic sales growth of 11% versus third quarter \u201822. Within cardiology, interventional cardiology therapy sales grew 7% organically versus third quarter \u201822. Our Structural Heart Valves franchise grew double digits in third quarter, led by ACURATE Neo2 sales performance in Europe. And growth within our Coronary Therapies franchise is fueled by ongoing success of our Imaging technologies. We're pleased to have received clearance for the AVVIGO+ Guidance System. AVVIGO is our next-generation platform that provides high quality fast imaging, with improved physiologic assessment of coronary vessels and lesions. We continue to be pleased with the performance of AGENT DCB in Japan. Importantly, our AGENT IDE trial results were presented yesterday as a late breaker at TCT, with data demonstrating statistical superiority of the AGENT drug-coated balloon versus uncoated balloon angioplasty for the treatment of patients with in-stent restenosis. With our recent regulatory submission to FDA, we anticipate approval of AGENT, the first drug-coated balloon indicated for the coronary arteries within the US in the second half of '24. WATCHMAN sales grew 23% organically versus third quarter \u201822. We're very pleased with the excellent performance of this franchise, and have now treated more than 350,000 patients globally. Last month, we received FDA approval of the latest generation WATCHMAN FLX Pro, which is designed to improve visualization during device placement to enhance healing post-implant, and treat a broader range of patient anatomies. Additionally, enrollment has commenced in HEAL-LAA, a post-market study of the WATCHMAN FLX Pro device in the US. We continue to expect strong growth from the WATCHMAN, business backed by new technologies and significant investment in clinical evidence.  Cardiac rhythm management sales grew 5% organically versus third quarter '22. And core CRM, our high voltage business, grew low single digits, and our low voltage business grew mid-single digits. Our Diagnostics franchise grew double digits in the quarter, fueled by our diverse portfolio of ambulatory ECGs and ICM. We continue to further innovate in the space, having launched in the US the next-generation LUX-Dx II and the II+ implantable cardiac monitor for long-term monitoring of arrhythmias, providing enhanced diagnostic capabilities and enabling a more efficient workflow. Electrophysiology sales grew 27% organically versus third quarter \u201822. International growth of 33% was driven by excellent performance from our differentiated FARAPULS and POLARx technologies, as well as our Access Solutions franchise and the leading VersaCross Access platform. US growth of 22% was led by our Access Solutions franchise, along with contribution from the early approval - I'm sorry, from the approval of the POLARx Cryoablation System, including POLARx FIT, which enables physicians to adjust and expand the cryo balloon to best fit a patient's individual anatomy. Also, within the quarter, we launched VersaCross Connect for POLARSHEATH, which provides safe and efficient access to the left side of the heart during procedures, expanding our Access Solutions portfolio. Clinical evidence generation remains a key priority, and we're pleased to have completed enrollment in the first phase of the ADVANTAGE AF clinical trial studying FARAPULSE for the treatment of patients with persistent AFib. Additionally, we commenced enrollment and treated our first patient in an extension arm of the ADVANTAGE study to evaluate FARAPOINT, which is a point-by-point PFA focal catheter for CTI ablations used to treat atrial flutter. Finally, within the quarter, we achieved important milestones to bring in our leading PFA technology to the US. Recalled data from our ADVENT IDE trial was presented at ESC at the end of August, comparing FARAPULSE to standard of care thermal modalities meeting the primary endpoints. We've also completed our US regulatory submission and continue to anticipate the approval of FARAPULSE in the US in the second half of '24.  Through the first nine months of this year, we have grown organic sales 12% while growing adjusted EPS 18%, with broad-based growth across all of our business units and regions. This performance is supportive of the goal we laid out last month at our Investor Day, where we aspire to be highest performing large cap med tech company over the next three years. We believe our focus and talent and culture, our relentless pursuit of innovation, while doing the right thing for society and operating responsibly, sets us up to deliver a unique set of financial goals over the 2024 to 2026 long range period. Our LRP goals include growing sales 8% to 10% CAGR over the period, while expanding adjusted rate operating margins by 150 basis points over the three years, with double-digit adjusted EPS growth annually, and improvement of our free cash flow conversion to approximately 70% by 2026.  With that, I'll pass off to Dan to provide more details on the financials. Yes, sure. Robbie. I think relative to the Analyst Day commentary, let me just reiterate just to make sure we're all on the same page. So, yes, as you said, 8% to 10% organic revenue growth over the period, 2024 to 2026, 150 basis points of margin expansion over that three-year period, which would put us, assuming we're at that 26.4% at the end of this year, kind of near that 28%, which is a nice jumping off point for that 30% long-term goal. And then we said that the 2025 revenue growth rate would likely be higher than our 2024 revenue growth rate due to the launches that are coming in 2024. So, that's really the commentary that we had relative to Investor Day. And obviously, 2023 is shaping up to be a great year, good jumping off point heading into 2024. But relative to specifics around 2024, we're working through our 2024 annual planning process here in the fourth quarter. And as you would expect, we'll use that as the basis to give you the guidance when we get to our Q4 earnings call in January. Dr. Stein, you want to comment? Thanks. Morning, Rick. In the third quarter, as I mentioned, we're proud that most all of our businesses grew, at least, at most likely, most of them grew above market, likely, with the exception of the one that you asked about, neuromod. So, in the neuromod business, we grew roughly 3% in the quarter. I'll just start off, before you - I jumped SCS, the brain business. Our DBS business continues to do well, continues to grow share. And in third quarter, it grew double digits again with the neural navigator. So, that business continues to become a larger part of the overall mix. Global SCS still is the largest piece. That's been under pressure, as you pointed out. The pressure points really come from additional - probably a couple of new competitors to the marketplace, some competitive launches, and our DPN approval, which we're very excited about, which you highlighted, we received in October, but we don't expect to launch our DPN platform until likely first quarter, near the mid first quarter of 2024. So, this will certainly help us with our core SCS business with that additional indication. And also, with the Relievant company that we've signed but not yet closed, we expect to close that in 2024. So, we need the combination of the DPN through our existing SCS base, combining with the Relievant, and also our RF platform gives us a really nice category leadership position to treat pain with a variety of options, which will be differentiated. So, we do expect likely some softness to continue in the fourth quarter, and we obviously aim to improve on those results in 2024 based on what I just highlighted. Dr. Stein, you want to give our comment on GLP-1? Yes. You saw the results in the third quarter, which are quite strong with both POLARx and FARAPULSE. I think what's important is our supply chain team has done a terrific job over the past 18 months in building supply of both catheters and the capital equipment needed. So, we expect to see a more significant install cadence to the back half of this quarter and into first quarter. So, we feel like we've really significantly improved our supply capabilities, and you'll see that in 2024 in Europe, and we'll be ready for the US launch. Sure, Matt. Yes, there's been a couple of new entrants into the field over the last 12 months. And so, they've taken a little bit of market share. Overall, the market's likely, I don't know, 5% to 6%-ish, and this year we're likely to - in SCS US, likely be below the market. I mentioned earlier, a big driver there is not having the support of DPN, which we just recently received in October. And we expect to be able to offer that capability in line with some of our competitors in first quarter 2024. So, we do expect to have a softer fourth quarter, and then we expect acceleration improvement in 2024 versus 2023 for our SCS business and our Brain business. DBS continues to take share and grow double digits, and again, mentioned it's likely the only division that's grown below the market. Sure. Yes. I won't go into all too many specifics on our commercial strategy. We do have a scaled and trained EP sales force, as you imagine, given the capabilities we have with our WATCHMAN division and our EP business and our CRM business. So, we have a scaled EP force that's been trained up now, and what's great to see is they're successfully selling cryo today. So, having the approval of that, and we had a really nice initial, I don't know, 30 days or so of cryo openings. So, we expect to see cryo to be a nice revenue driver force in 2024 as we wait for the FARAPULSE approval. So, we do have a scaled, highly capable EP commercial team. And Ken, if you want to comment on the arrhythmia offerings. Sure. Yes, starting with Europe is really not a - thankfully, it's not a new phenomenon for our team in Europe, which we also were referencing. Middle East, Africa, last year they grew 12%, and they're on track to grow another double digits again in 2023. So, the European team, it's really a combination clearly of share-taking given the markets aren't growing double digits in Europe. And our European team has benefited from the portfolio of having many of the product launches that were talked about for second half of 2024 in the US already in that marketplace. So, they're doing an excellent job of launching our innovative products, taking share in the more developed western European markets, and also building a pretty significant capability in the appropriate emerging markets in Europe. That also grows double digits. So, the team's just done a really nice job of executing and driving our innovation with the launches. Asia Pac had another strong quarter this year. That region also will grow double digits, grew double digits last year and double digits again this year. And I would say, the new news here is really just the strength of Japan is excellent in the quarter, and we expect another strong quarter for them in the fourth quarter. Again, it's all back to our people and our portfolio, and the team in Japan launching POLARx AGENT, AVVIGO will be the next platform to launch in Japan. So, that team's done a really nice job. In China, I was just there for about a week, and that team continues to grow nicely, strong double digits, despite all the challenges that are well known in the marketplace, again, based on the strength of our portfolio, some of the alliances that we're doing, and our team in China is quite strong. So, they continue to - so it's not a new event for us this quarter. Those regions have been delivering that for quite some time."

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please also note, this event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Lauren Tengler, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nLauren Tengler: Thank you, Kyle. Welcome everyone, and thanks for joining us today. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q2 2023 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release, as well as reconciliations on the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financials & Filings. The duration of this morning's call will be approximately 1 hour. Mike and Dan will provide comments on Q1 performance as well as the outlook for our business including Q2 and full year 2023 guidance. And then, we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Ken Stein. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, operational revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and organic revenue growth further excludes acquisitions and divestitures for which there are less than a full period of comparable net sales. Relevant acquisitions and divestitures excluded for organic growth or Baylis Medical, which closed on February 14, 2022. The majority stake investment in Acotec Scientific Holdings Limited and Apollo Endosurgery, which closed in February and April of this year, respectively. Divestitures include the endoscopy pathology business, which closed April of this year. Please note that, we have elected to consolidate Acotec results on a one quarter lag, which had an immaterial impact on our Q2 reported and adjusted results. On June 15, 2022, we announced our entry into a definitive agreement to purchase a majority stake in M.I. Tech, the agreement required global regulatory approvals that we were unable to obtain in some countries. As a result, the original agreement was terminated and in June of this year, we purchased a minority stake in M.I. Tech. For more information, please refer to our financial and operating highlights deck, which may be found on our Investor Relations website. On this call, all references to sales and revenue, unless otherwise specified are organic. This call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate expect, may, believe, estimate and other similar words. They include, among other things, statements about our growth in market share, new and anticipated product approvals and launches, acquisitions, clinical trials, cost savings and growth opportunities, our cash flow and expected use, our financial performance, including sales, margins and earnings, as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses. If our underlying assumptions turn out to be incorrect or if certain risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from the expectations and projections used on \u2013 or expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC.

Mike?\nMike Mahoney: Thanks, Lauren, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. We're very proud of our second quarter results, which exceeded our expectations and demonstrated the strength of our category leadership strategy, commitment to clinical evidence, and the winning spirit of our global team. In second quarter '23, total company sales grew 12%, both operationally and organically versus second quarter '22, exceeding the high end of our organic guidance range of 7% to 9%. We anticipate that most of our business units grew in line or faster than the respective markets, fueled by our innovative portfolio and commercial execution, also supported by healthy procedure demand. Second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.53 grew 21% versus second quarter '22, exceeding the high end of the guidance range of $0.48 to $0.50. And second quarter adjusted operating margin was 26.8%, also slightly higher than anticipated. Through the first half of the year, we have grown their business organic sales rate at 13%, with broad-based durable growth across all of our business units and regions. Importantly, we have also grown our adjusted EPS growth 20% during the first half, while balancing our investments to ensure we achieve our short-term and long-term goals. Now for our 2023 guidance, we're guiding the third quarter '23 organic revenue growth of 7% to 9% and we expect momentum to continue and are raising our full year organic guidance to 10% to 11%. Our third quarter adjusted EPS estimate is $0.46 to $0.48 and we're increasing our full year adjusted EPS range to $1.96 to $2. I'll now provide some additional highlights in the second quarter, along with comments on our '23 outlook, and Dan will provide more details on the financials. Regionally, and on an operational basis, the U.S. grew 9% in second quarter, with notable strength in our WATCHMAN, PI and Endoscopy businesses. Europe, Middle East Africa also grew 9% on an operational basis versus second quarter, with strong performance in the region was broad-based, with double-digit growth in four out of our five major markets in Europe. Across the portfolio, we saw strength in new and ongoing product launches, including FARAPULSE, POLARx, ACURATE neo2 and LUX-DX. Asia Pacific grew 24% operationally versus second quarter, led by strength in China and Japan. Japan growth is fueled by new products, including agent, our drug-coated balloon for the coronary arteries, and resume our minimally invasive BPH technology with device performance and procedures that leave nothing behind is resonating in the market. China delivered excellent growth in the second quarter, led by our innovative portfolio and commercial execution against the COVID impact second quarter '22. We also saw particular strength in our interventional cardiology therapies, WATCHMAN, CRM and PI business units and we continue to expect double-digit growth in China for the full year. I'll now provide some additional commentary on our businesses. Starting with urology. Urology sales grew 8% organically in the second quarter. The stone management franchise grew double-digits, driven by LithoVue and ongoing globalization efforts. Rezum continues to do well globally, growing strong double-digits in the quarter and most recently launching in Brazil. We continue to see ongoing momentum within our prosthetic urology franchise, fueled by patient activation efforts. designed to bring awareness to our erectile restoration and male incontinence interventions. Endoscopy sales were excellent, growing 12% organically and 14% operationally in the second quarter, with notable strength in the U.S., Latin America and Asia-Pac, with new product momentum and healthy procedure demand. Our Apollo integration is progressing well and earlier this month that we received FDA clearance for OverStitch NXT, a suturing system that enables suture placement during advanced endoscopic procedures. This next-generation device brings ease-of-use benefits and improved accessibility when using a single-channel endoscope. Neuromodulation sales grew 3% organically in the second quarter. Spinal cord stimulation sales were flat versus prior year and we expect SCS sales growth to improve in the second half of the year, with strong trialing in the second quarter in support of clinical evidence, which was presented this month at Aspen. Notably, six-month outcome data were reported from the SOLIS trial, which is a randomized controlled trial for non-surgical back pain, which demonstrated superior outcomes for SCS against conventional medical management, also consistent with primary endpoint results. Our brain franchise grew double-digits in the quarter, with continued momentum from new product launches in the U.S. and procedure recovery in Europe. Earlier this month, we received FDA approval for the Vercise Neural Navigator 5 software, which when used with our deep brain stimulation system can help provide clinicians with data for efficient programming in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Peripheral Interventions sales were very strong growing 13% organically versus second quarter '22. Our arterial franchise grew double-digits, led by our drug eluting portfolio. And earlier this month, after reviewing all available data and analysis, the FDA provided updated information associated with paclitaxel-coated devices used to treat PAD, recognizing the safety of these devices and eliminating the requirement for specific warning language within device-related labeling. We're pleased that the FDA determined that the available data do not support an excess mortality risk and we remain dedicated to helping physicians provide the best care possible for their patients. In Venous, U.S. growth was led by ongoing strength in Varithena, a non-thermal treatment for varicose veins, with international growth driven by our clot management technologies. Our Interventional Oncology franchise grew double-digits with strength across the entire portfolio. And last month, we received clearance for the EMBOLD, Soft and Packing Coils, which along with the EMBOLD fibroid coil, complete our detachable coil system. We also began our limited market release for Obsidio, which is the only conformable gel embolic material that's indicated for the peripheral vasculature, adding to our robust embolization portfolio. Cardiology delivered another excellent quarter with organic sales growth of 13% versus second quarter. Within cardiology, the Interventional Cardiology Therapies business, sales grew 12% organically versus second quarter. Our coronary therapies franchise growth was driven by our innovative imaging technologies as well as the recent launch of our agent drug-coated balloon in Japan, offsetting ongoing price pressure in drug eluting stents. Our structural heart valves franchise grew strong double-digits with another quarter of performance from our ACURATE neo2 in Europe. Market reception remains very high, backed by clinical evidence, ease-of-use benefits and a focus on lifetime patient management. We continue to expect to bring ACURATE neo2 to the U.S. in the second half of 2024. WATCHMAN sales grew 27% organically versus second quarter, also outpacing the market. U.S. demand remains strong and international growth was led by China and Japan. We were pleased to have completed enrollment in the WATCHMAN FLX Pro CT pilot study, which is a single study design using multiple imaging modalities to assess post-procedural healing in the next generation of WATCHMAN FLX Pro. We expect continued momentum within the WATCHMAN franchise further supported by the anticipated approval of our both WATCHMAN FLX Pro and our steerable sheath called Trusteer (ph) by the end of 2023. Cardiac Rhythm Management sales grew 5% organically in the quarter. In core CRM, our high-voltage business grew low-single digits and our low-voltage business grew mid-single digits, and we believe that performance was in line or slightly below market growth as the replacement tailwinds neutralize. Our diagnostic franchise grew double-digits in the quarter on the strength of our broad cardiac diagnostic portfolio and we anticipate momentum will continue, supported by the approval of our next-generation ICM called LUX 2 expected later this year. Electrophysiology sales grew 28% organically in the second quarter. International growth continues to be fueled by strong performance in both FARAPULSE and POLARx across Europe and Asia-Pac. We continue to make progress towards bringing these innovative technologies to the U.S., and we expect POLARx approval in the third quarter. In addition, we are looking forward to the data presentation of the ADVENT trial, our U.S. IDE, at the ESC Conference on August 27. Recall the ADVENT trial is a first of its kind, randomized clinical trial, designed for a non-inferior 12-month primary safety and efficacy endpoints compared to a commercially available RF and cryoablation systems. It is notable for its design and rigor as it seeks to demonstrate the single procedure effectiveness of an intervention without the use of antiarrhythmic drugs and reablations. We continue to anticipate the approval of FARAPULSE in the U.S. in 2024. The Access Solutions franchise grew strong double-digits in the second quarter with continued momentum in the U.S. and Japan with a differentiated VersaCross Transseptal platform. We're also proud of the performance of our global teams and are confident in our future. We remain committed to sustainable innovation and our financial goals, consistently growing sales faster than our underlying markets, expanding operating margins and delivered strong double-digit adjusted EPS growth with a strong adjusted free cash flow generation. We're looking forward to our September 20 Investor Day, where our leadership team will provide more insight into our innovative pipeline today, the opportunities ahead and our long-term financial goals. So before I pass it along to Dan, I want to announce that we also have some movement within our business unit leadership team. And after nearly 20 years at Boston Scientific, Maulik Nanavaty has announced his plan to retire in August. Jim Cassidy will now lead the neuromodulation business, where he previously spent eight years prior before moving over to lead the WATCHMAN franchise five years ago. Lastly, Angelo DeRosa will now lead our WATCHMAN business. Angelo has spent the last 10 years of Boston Scientific in Europe, most recently leading the European CRM and EP business. Congratulations to Jim and Angelo and we appreciate Maulik for his many contributions to Neuromodulation in Boston Scientific throughout his career. With that, I'll pass it over to Dan to provide more details on the financials.\nDan Brennan: Thanks, Mike. Second quarter 2023 consolidated revenue of $3.599 billion represents 11% reported revenue growth versus the second quarter of 2022 and reflects a 100 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, in line with expectations. Excluding this $33 million headwind from foreign exchange, operational revenue growth was 12% in the quarter. Sales from acquisitions and divestitures contributed 30 basis points, resulting in 11.6% organic revenue growth, exceeding our guidance range of 7% to 9%. Q2 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $0.53 grew 20.7% versus 2022, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.48 to $0.50, driven by strong sales performance and a favorable effective tax rate in the quarter. Adjusted gross margin for the second quarter was 72%, slightly ahead of our expectations, resulting in an adjusted gross margin of 71.2% for the first half of 2023. We continue to expect second half gross margin to be lower than the first half of 2023 and in line with the second half of 2022, largely due to timing of foreign exchange movements in 2022. Second quarter adjusted operating margin was 26.8%, slightly ahead of expectations, predominantly driven by strong top line performance and partially offset by slightly higher SG&A spend. We continue to focus on adjusted operating margin expansion and are maintaining our full year 2023 goal of approximately 26.4% adjusted operating margin, which would represent 80 basis points of improvement versus the full year 2022. On a GAAP basis, the second quarter operating margin was 14.3%. Moving to below the line, second quarter adjusted interest and other expenses totaled $93 million, slightly higher than expectations, driven by FX volatility in certain unhedged currencies. On an adjusted basis, our tax rate for the second quarter was 9.8%, slightly below expectations due to certain discrete tax items and a lower than anticipated operational tax rate of 13.2%, driven by our geographic mix of earnings in the quarter. Fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding ended at 1,456 million shares in Q2, which includes the issuance of 23.98 million common shares upon the conversion of our mandatory convertible preferred stock on June 1 of this year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $514 million, with $658 million from operating activities, less $143 million net capital expenditures. Excluding special items, adjusted free cash flow was $730 million. We continue to target full year 2023 adjusted free cash flow in excess of $2.3 billion. As of June 30, 2023, we had cash on hand of $426 million and our leverage was 2.4 times, in line with our expectations. I'll now walk through guidance for Q3 and the full year. We expect full year 2023 operational revenue growth to be in a range of 11% to 12%, which excludes an approximate 50 basis point headwind from foreign exchange. Excluding the impact of closed acquisitions and divestitures, we expect full year 2023 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 10% to 11% versus 2022. We expect third quarter 2023 operational revenue growth to be in a range of 8% to 10% versus Q3 2022, excluding an approximate 50 basis point tailwind from foreign exchange based on current rates. Excluding the contribution from closed acquisitions and divestitures, we expect third quarter 2023 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 7% to 9%. We continue to expect our full year 2023 adjusted below the line expenses to be approximately $340 million. We continue to expect our full year 2023 operational tax rate to be approximately 14%. Under current legislation and forecasted geographic mix of sales, we now expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 12.5%, reflecting favorable tax discretes recognized in the second quarter. We expect a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1.475 billion shares for Q3 2023 and 1.464 billion shares for full year 2023. We expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.96 to $2, representing 15% to 17% growth versus 2022, which we believe delivers top tier financial performance. We continue to anticipate a neutral impact from FX on our full year 2023 adjusted earnings per share and we expect third quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.46 to $0.48. For more information, please check our Investor Relations website for Q2 2023 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more details on Q2 results and 2023 guidance. In closing, I'm very proud of our first half financial performance with top tier organic revenue growth of 13%, adjusted operating margin of 26.2% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 20%, all contributing towards our top-tier financial goals. I look forward to continued momentum in the second half of 2023. And with that, I'll turn it back to Lauren, who will moderate the Q&A.\nLauren Tengler: Thanks, Dan. Kyle, let's open it up for questions for the next 35 minutes or so. In order for us to take as many questions as possible, please limit their self to one question. Kyle, please go ahead.\nOperator: Thank you, Lauren. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRobert Marcus: Good morning and congrats on a really nice quarter.\nMike Mahoney: Thanks, Robbie.\nRobert Marcus: Maybe with my one question. It looks like you guys beat pretty much across the board with the exception of neuromodulation. It looks like it was a really strong geographically as well, split across the regions. We've heard from some public statements from managed care companies that outpatients saw kind of a bolus in utilization, but it looks like it was global as well. So I'd love to get the read from you on what you're seeing, what's underlying demand, what is maybe onetime upside, and what you're seeing in the different regions around the world? And if there's any difference inpatient, outpatient, cardio versus non-cardio? Thanks a lot.\nMike Mahoney: Sure. Good morning, Robbie. Yeah. So as you know, our portfolio is with the interventional procedures that we offer are very geared to an outpatient setting, in which we think is very positive trend and strategy for the long-term outlook for Boston Scientific, that's where the market is moving towards. So just a quick snapshot around the world. Japan had a very strong quarter just -- really that's primarily portfolio related. China had an excellent quarter. There was an easier comp in second quarter last year due to COVID impact. But I think that whole outpatient dynamic doesn't really play as significantly as much in Asia-Pac there. But really, it's more portfolio related for Japan, some COVID benefit, but great performance in China. And I think what's impressive about Europe, it's really across the board, across all the regions and the emerging markets. Some slowness in Russia, but we're lightly exposed in Russia, less than 1% and U.S. grew 9% as well. You've seen a bit higher proportion of outpatient procedures in the U.S than some of the other regions. But we continue to see just very strong patient demand. There's still a typically a very common wait list for most of our procedures for physicians. So it's a very steady supply and we have a terrific portfolio to meet the market.\nRobert Marcus: Thanks a lot.\nMike Mahoney: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citi. Please go ahead.\nJoanne Wuensch: Good morning and thank you for asking \u2013 for taking the question, let me ask. As soon as you print this very good quarter, I'm going to get 15 questions about or more about what to expect for ESC and for the analyst meeting. So maybe you can sort of set or level set what you expect or how we should think about putting those two events within the right framework?\nMike Mahoney: Sure. I'll -- maybe Dr. Stein comment and I'll see if I need to comment further afterwards.\nKenneth Stein: Yeah. Thanks, Mike. Thanks, Joanne. Obviously, our big highlight at ESC is going to be the release of the data from Advent, which is, I think as everyone is aware at this point, our IDE trial to seek approval of FARAPULSE in the United States. We're really proud of the rigor of that trial. It is the first randomized trial in this space, comparing Pulsed Field Ablation with FARAPULSE system against thermal ablation with RS and Cryo. It's an incredibly rigorous design in terms of the endpoints and the monitoring, and we look forward to sharing those results in public.\nMike Mahoney: Yeah. To make additional comment on FARAPULSE in the quarter, really pleased to see the increased utilization in Europe. We still have been supply chain constrained with our councils in Europe. So the demand for the platform far exceeds our ability to supply thus far, which we've reported out for a number of quarters in a row. But what's exciting, we just recently received GMED approval for a manufacturing approval to actually manufacture this in Minnesota, where we are here. And so we do anticipate, with the capabilities of the European team and the materials work by the supply chain, that we expect a significant increase in availability of new accounts in the fourth quarter of 2023 and that continuing on in 2024 well in advance of the launch in the U.S. So really proud of the supply chain team in this environment to build this capability internally to meet the demand. And you should expect a number of new centers opening in the fourth quarter, but the utilization is what surprised me. The utilization growth within the served centers in Europe continues to be impressive, which speaks to the performance of the platform.\nDan Brennan: And then specific to Investor Day, Joanne, which is coming up here on September 20 for us, I would expect to see what you've seen in past investor days. You'll see the team give us a sense of what we think we can do with our financial goals over the next three years. So a formula, it's worked pretty well for us in our past Investor Days and I would look for us to do the same here in September.\nJoanne Wuensch: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rick Wise with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nFrederick Wise: Good morning, Mike. Hi, Dan. Maybe focusing on the excellent margin performance. Operating margins were particularly stand out and the divisional performance, I mean, MedSurg up 410 basis points, cardiovascular up 240 basis points. Help us understand maybe a little more detail the drivers. Is it volume, is it mix? And to what extent did price play a role? And I'm not quite sure I'm understanding your commentary, Dan, about second half margins as well? Thanks so much.\nDan Brennan: Sure. Let me try and put a finer point on that, Rick. So for the first half, we ended at 26.2% operating margin with a real strong 26.8% in the second quarter, which puts us in a good spot for our full year target, which is the 26.4%. Specific to Q2 and the 26.8%, for us, it's always about achieving the overall operating margin goals. And I think history would show that we manage all lines of the P&L pretty well to accomplish that objective. So in any given period, you may see one area of the P&L might contribute more or less. But the ultimate goal is, obviously, to get to that bottom line. And then really specific to Q2, I'm really happy that we got to that 26.8% adjusted operating margin. It's 160 basis points better than last year. And we were also able to accelerate some key SG&A investments to ensure the success of some of those upcoming transformational launches that we have starting here, hopefully, this year with our Cryo launch. So for us, it's always about all areas of the P&L can contribute to the overall operating margin story. Relative to first half, second half, the gross margin, which was a little north of 71% for the first half should be lower in the second half, should be more in line with where we were in the second half of last year, kind of in that 70.5% range for the second half. But the operating margin for the second half will get us -- will be higher than it was in the first half and obviously get us to that 26% goal for the year. The reason for the gross margin being lower in the second half, as we've said, is the FX movements in 2022. So as you go forward, I think lower gross margin in the second half, but higher operating margin in the second half to get to that 26.4%. And one little slight quarterly nuance is, I would expect to see a step down in Q3 relative to that 26.8% that we posted in Q2 and then a step up in Q4 to get to the overall number to get to 26.4% for the year. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of flavor of how we were thinking about it in Q2 and what the second half would bring to get us to that 26.4% for the year.\nFrederick Wise: Appreciate that Dan. Thanks.\nDan Brennan: Sure.\nOperator: Next question comes from Larry Bison with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I'll reiterate my congratulations at another strong quarter here. Dr. Stein, on Advent, just using the same definition of success in Advent as manifest, I think the success rate was 74%. So what differences do we need to consider between the two studies and how much do you think those differences could impact the results for FARAPULSE? And separately, what have the success rates been with RF and Cryo in previous studies when using the same criteria as Advent? Sorry for the long question. Just lastly, if FARAPULSE is numerically lower on success or efficacy versus RF and Cryo, how do you think it will impact adoption? Thanks for taking the question.\nKenneth Stein: Yeah. Sure, Larry. There's a lot there. Let me start right, again, reinforce to everyone. The definition of \"success\" is very different across a lot of the trials. And Advent, I think, has the most rigorous definition of what constitutes success, frankly, compared to any trial that's ever been done in this space, whether it's PFA or whether it's thermal ablation. And so specifically, right, ADVENT is a randomized trial and that requires patients to have success to have no arrhythmia recurrence, cannot continue taking antiarrhythmic drugs even at doses that had previously failed and cannot be reablated during the so-called three month blanking period after the index ablation. It also includes a very rigorous screening for asymptomatic arrhythmias, including three days of periodic Holter monitoring throughout the of course of the one-year follow-up in the study. I think because of that, there's really no way to make apples-to-apples comparisons across the trials. And the other thing, I'd do in terms of expectation, we'd refer everyone back to the design manuscript for the ADVENT study, which is now published online in Heart Rhythm. And this study was designed around to achieve optimal power around an assumed success rate using this definition of 65% in both the thermal and the FARAPULSE arms. And again, to remind everyone, the studies were powered for non-inferiority. And from our standpoint, then success would constitute a demonstration of non-inferiority both for safety and for efficacy.\nLarry Biegelsen: Got it. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Travis Steed with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nTravis Steed: Hi. Congrats on a good quarter. Just maybe following up to Larry's question, how would you frame up the commercial opportunity for FARAPULSE for the market growth and share kind of based on the various potential outcomes for ADVENT? And I think you said it the most exciting product launch in your career, but just curious how you think the commercial opportunity frames out based on how ADVENT comes out? And then curious if you've seen the data yet or are you still blinded to the data? Thanks.\nMike Mahoney: Yeah. We're obviously very bullish. WATCHMAN has been a pretty amazing product launch as well. Sometimes it gets drowned out in some of these would be continued momentum in that category and the growth of that market. But FARAPULSE is very exciting for us. We've been investing for quite a while post-acquisition to build up manufacturing capabilities, which is the most important thing we could do to meet the demand that we're seeing in Europe and in certain countries in Asia-Pac. So we're very pleased with that milestone. And as I commented earlier, expect to drive a number of new installs in the fourth quarter. I also mentioned just the ongoing increase in utilization. So the physicians who are using that in Europe and selected markets in Asia continue to drive more usage of it, which really is a terrific sign, very similar to what we saw with WATCHMAN throughout that progress. We also have a very strong clinical trial cadence with our persistent trial advantage, which is enrolling very quickly in other trials that we've announced as well as ongoing enhancements of the portfolio. So we have the R&D to continue to strengthen the portfolio, the clinical science studies to continue to advance it, and it's the fastest growing -- one of the fastest-growing fields along with WATCHMAN in MedTech, where we have a very low share. We know it's a very competitive market, but we feel we have many advantages with FARAPULSE and really driving the clinical data in this field and we also have the commercial infrastructure to exploit the opportunity. So we're very bullish on it, and we're looking forward to the ADVENT release.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDanielle Antalffy: Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question and congrats to Maulik. He was always a pleasure to work with, if you could pass along my best to him. I'd appreciate it. Thank you so much. And my question is really around just thinking about the back half of the year top line growth guidance. It does organically move higher. And I just want to make sure I understand all the puts and takes there. Obviously, back half of the year does get a little bit tougher from a comp perspective on an organic basis, but does reflect some deceleration. I want to basically understand how much of this is just prudent conservatism on your part, which you guys tend to do versus some real product driven or business driven things we need to consider when looking at the back half? Thanks so much.\nDan Brennan: Sure, Danielle. I think I can take that one. If you look at the second half, take the full year of 10% to 11%, which I'm super excited about. I mean they have a fully double-digit range for the full year for organic revenue growth is exciting and I'm proud of that. And when you look at the second half, the guidance we've given for the third quarter is 7% to 9%, so 8% at the midpoint. And then the implied is 7% to 9% for the fourth quarter to get to that, coupled with the first half performance that's what gets you to that 10% to 11% full year result. And I think that's appropriate and prudent guidance with where we are the comps, they're a little harder in the second half. I think it's like 100 basis points harder in the second half than they are in the first half. But overall, I think that 7% to 9% is appropriate, prudent for the second half. And if it gets us to that 10% to 11% for the full year, I think that will be a really successful year, coupled with 80 basis points of margin expansion and EPS growth of 15% to 17%, adjusted EPS for the year, I'd call that a pretty good year for the company.\nDanielle Antalffy: Great. Thanks so much, Dan.\nDan Brennan: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Taylor with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Taylor: Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. Dan, I had one more conceptually on margins, I guess. I wanted to understand some of the key puts and takes for margin expansion going forward. And specifically, I think a lot of investors are focused on inflation kind of abating and the potential for you to get savings on things like freight and lower component costs. Do you think that we could see any of that be good guide (ph) for margins in '24 and beyond, and maybe just speak to the high-level factors there, if you could?\nDan Brennan: Sure. I'll start at the kind of the overall operating margin level. So if you say that we achieved the 26.4% adjusted operating margin goal for this year, the good news is there's still a long runway of margin expansion journey for us, well beyond that 26.4%. We've said publicly many times that we believe that 30% plus is a very reasonable target for the company. There's nothing structurally that prevents us from getting there. And to the extent that you have a durably, consistently growing top line, it just gives you a number of leverage opportunities to continue to grow that. So you have that kind of as a backdrop. Specific to areas of the P&L, I think the inflation piece is largely hitting gross margin. And we said that we had the $375 million of impact in '22 versus 2019 in gross margin and, in this year, it's basically stayed relatively consistent. So it's not a headwind or a tailwind versus last year, but obviously, a headwind versus that 72.4% margin that we were in 2019. So specific to your question around what happens going forward, I don't think we'll see a lot of inflationary abatement in '23. I think the guidance that we've given assumes we're kind of in -- we are where we are for the year. But as we look forward to '24 and beyond, yes, I mean, this year, the full year gross margin is -- will be kind of approaching 71% for the year. So that's a gap to where we used to be. And our goal, we're maniacally focused on getting back to that level. We do need some macro help in that, as you mentioned. So some of the elements of it, freight, we do see that getting a little better, the inflationary impact of the cost of the inputs into our manufacturing process, we see that abating over time. And then the consistency of the supply of the materials into our manufacturing process has improved. I mean, frankly, that\u2019s improved, but it\u2019s not back to where it used to be. So we still \u2013 it is choppier than we\u2019d like to see it. And that does impact your ability to really run a really efficient manufacturing process. So I think \u201823 kind of, as I said, we are where we are. When you get to \u201824 and beyond, I think there is an opportunity for gross margin to continue to contribute. Frankly, I think all areas of the P&L can contribute, both areas in OpEx, SG&A and R&D, we can be more efficient. In R&D, we certainly can be more efficient overall in SG&A. And if gross margin can move north of that, approaching 71% that we have for this year, I\u2019m excited about the opportunity for margin expansion going forward.\nMatthew Taylor: Great. Thanks. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you.\nDan Brennan: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt O'Brien with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nSamantha Kurtz: Hi. This is Sam Kurtz on for Matt. Congrats on a great quarter and for taking our question. I guess we would like to touch on the guidance again. And maybe could you tell us a little bit about where you're most excited heading into the second half of the year and where we could potentially see that upside?\nMike Mahoney: Yeah. Thank you. I'm trying to be vague. It's as you saw in the first half results, the results are really broad-based across the company and across each region. Excellent growth in Asia Pac and Japan and China, continued share taking in Europe and excellent performance in the U.S. So it's really not one region driving it, which should give investors a lot of confidence in just the momentum and durable growth of the company. The standouts, there are a number of them. You continue to see WATCHMAN performance very strong. That market continues to grow well in excess of 20%. We continue to take a little bit of share in that category. And we're very excited in the future about the launches of the distributable sheets and the next-gen WATCHMAN FLX Pro and the potential of these market-expanding trials, which will read out in a couple of years here. So that platform continues to do very well. Our coronary business did excellent. We're seeing nice results of agents in the U.S. We'll be launching that in 2024, which really reverses any declining trend in drug-eluting stents, and that complex coronary business continues to do well. We saw a great strong growth in PI and endo, euro. We had some softness in our Neuromod business. We anticipate that to get better in the second half. So really, it's a continued momentum. And what we'll highlight at Investor Day is some of the questions we received today. We have some potential very big growth drivers with ongoing WATCHMAN momentum in our entire EP business with the launch of Cryo, which we anticipate in the third quarter this year, and FARAPULSE, which has been discussed at great length. So just good momentum and extremely exciting launches coming that we\u2019ll detail out at Investor Day.\nSamantha Kurtz: Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Miksic with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Miksic: Hey. Thanks so much for taking the question and congrats on a super strong quarter. So really impressive breaking into double-digits. You are welcome. So Dan, I want to just follow up on cash flows and cash flow conversion and sort of what the puts and takes there have been in the first half? What your expectations are in the back half, and your intermediate long-term goals there? I'm sure you more about at the Analyst Meeting, but anything you can share now? And then also just on cash, if I could. You have so many things going on in that portfolio and in your our clinical programs, but I'd love to get your sort of posture on the business development front and your efforts to find and invest in additional technology and assets? Thanks.\nDan Brennan: Sure. So on free cash flow, I'm really happy with Q2. Strong free cash flow quarter, both sequentially and year-over-year. To your point, conversion, it's an area of focus for us, an area of opportunity that has our attention, and one we're looking to improve on as we go forward here. As I've said in the past, there's a couple of kind of key reasons, one of which is our GAAP operating income is lower than some of our peers. We're doing a pretty good job of closing that gap over time, and that will be a key contributor. And then the acquisitive nature of what we do is -- can be a bit of a hamstring there, but I would look for -- as you said, at Investor Day, I'd look for us to give some pretty concrete goals relative to what we think we can do over that LRP period in the next three years to improve the conversion ratio that we have. And again, it\u2019s a focus area for us and something that we will look to improve on going forward. And I think your second question was on cash and M&A, is that fair?\nMatthew Miksic: Yeah, exactly. Yeah.\nDan Brennan: Yes. So I mean our capital allocation strategy has been remarkably consistent, right? It\u2019s all about the number one priority being high-quality tuck-in M&A. It\u2019s still our number one priority. We continue to look at opportunities in conjunction with our financial goals. We have closed two deals this year. The acquisition of Apollo closed in April, and then our acquisition of a stake in Acotec, the Chinese company, closed in February. So we\u2019ve closed a couple this year. We continue to look to be active in the M&A space, and that remains our number one capital allocation priority.\nMatthew Miksic: Thanks and congrats.\nDan Brennan: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Marie Thibault with BTIG. Please go ahead.\nMarie Thibault: Hi. Good morning. Nice quarter and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask here on POLARx, the Cryo catheter. You have that coming to the U.S. in the second half of this year. I know it's had pretty great success in Europe, but given some of the supply dynamics happening with FARAPULSE, it sounds like manufacturing will ease there for 47:16. And the timing of the FARAPULSE launch here in the U.S. How are you thinking about that POLARx launch here in the U.S.? Can that same success be replicated here, do you think?\nMike Mahoney: Yes. Thank you. POLARx is doing extremely well in Japan, doing quite well in Europe as well, where we also are selling FARAPULSE, as you indicated. We do not have the constraints on POLARx from a supply standpoint. So the team has been well ahead of that. So there's no limitations there. We do anticipate approval at some point, likely in the third quarter. So we'll have the supply to meet the demand. We have the commercial team in place. And the Cryo market is quite substantial in the U.S. And certainly, doctors are very interested in FARAPULSE, but there's a number of Cryo users there. Some physicians may be looking for even longer-term data on FARAPULSE. So we do see a nice market for Cryo in the coming years. And that's an area that really hasn't seen any innovation in nearly a decade. And so we're excited about what POLARx delivers in terms of differentiating features. Physicians are anxious to try a new platform, and we had the demand to support it. So it's -- we're blessed to have both FARAPULSE coming in the U.S. and Cryo as well as our mapping system to really meet the demands of the electrophysiologists. So we're excited about launching Cryo.\nMarie Thibault: Okay. Very good. Thanks so much.\nMike Mahoney: Yeah. Thanks, Marie.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Patrick Wood with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Wood: Amazing. Thank you very much for taking the question. I'd love a little bit more detail if you could on the Endo business. Obviously, you did very well in the quarter. There's obviously a lot happening in that business overall. But maybe just giving us a sense of patient volumes relative to share pricing, like any details you can give around their single-use endoscopy, that kind of thing. I'd love any more details, if you could? Thanks.\nMike Mahoney: Thanks for the endo question. Just one of our very best businesses in the company, a very global business, a strong contributor to accretive OI margin and grew 12% in the quarter. And consistent with other quarters, on the portfolio, it's quite broad-based. We did see strong procedure volume in the quarter, which is positive. And so I would say the procedure volume overall is quite high in that arena. But still, as mentioned earlier, oftentimes waitlist certainly in the U.S. and in Europe for that business. So we expect ongoing strong demand there. The Apollo acquisition, we're very excited about. The strategy for within endo is we have such a broad-based portfolio with so many SKUs that we are the clear category leader in that area. And we also, as you know, offer very differentiated technologies within that portfolio like SpyGlass, Axios (ph) and now Apollo and also the GESTALT-D (ph) platform. So Apollo also adds this endoluminal suturing capability. The opportunity to expand into the endobariatric market, which we believe will be a high growth area. Certainly, it is in Asia today, in Japan and in the U.S. patients seek a less invasive form to have that bariatric procedure. And it couples nicely with the entire portfolio. So our customers enjoy doing broad-based contracts with our Endo business and the portfolio that we offer, supported by strong procedure volumes. So we'll continue to innovate in that business. And the scopes continue to contribute growth as well. So it's really broad-based across that portfolio.\nPatrick Wood: Really appreciate it. Thanks for the details.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nVijay Kumar: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe my first one here, you look at 2023 double-digit organic, that's a pretty big number. Should we worry about comps? When you look at the outlook here, can you just remind us, the plus and minuses from a product perspective, what could be tailwinds, headwinds in fiscal '24?\nMike Mahoney: Yeah. So we -- it's good for us to create tough comps. We didn't have an easy comp going into this year. It was about a 9% comp going into '23. So that's a pretty healthy comp. And you indicated what the guidance is. I won't repeat up too many of the other comments. It's broad-based momentum. So growing in that guidance range versus 9% comp is a strong year. And we'll give guidance obviously in January for 2024, and Dan will give some insights to our three-year LRP at Investor Day. And we're really bullish about this next three-year period based on these differentiated launches that based on the current momentum that we have in the business, the product cycle that we have and the opportunity to potentially take it up to another level over a three-year period with these launches, many of which we've been discussed on the call today, many of them coming out of the cardio business. And also the benefit of the margin improvement opportunity that Dan outlined, which we think is a multiyear margin improvement opportunity for us and the increasing strength of the balance sheet. So I think all those areas point to the momentum of the company, but we're excited about really the next chapter of the company, given the cadence of launches that really have been a bit more derisked, I would say, versus a year ago.\nVijay Kumar: Understood. That's helpful commentary. Dan, on the margin question, any one-offs that we should be aware of when we think of fiscal '24? Anything on FX, kind of VVP (ph), anything that's outside the normal operating leverage at Boston and Delaware that we should be thinking about?\nDan Brennan: Yeah. Obviously, with FX, we'll see where that is when we snap the line when we give guidance. So hard to comment on that now. And then there's always things that happen \u2013 VPP (ph) and other things that happen in every year. So our goal will be to -- we'll hit that 26.4% for this year continue to move that north over the LRP period. And again, as Mike said, look for us to be pretty prescriptive as what we think we can do at our Investor Day upcoming in September.\nVijay Kumar: Understood. Thanks, guys. Congrats on the [indiscernible].\nDan Brennan: Thanks.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nJayson Bedford: Good morning and thanks for fitting me in. Just touching on an earlier question and trying to break out what's normalized market growth versus, say, a temporary catch-up here. You've grown revenue in the double digits in three of the last four quarters here. So I guess my question is, what do you think end market growth is right now in the markets in which you compete?\nMike Mahoney: You've seen others report. So the markets are healthy. There's -- we had a bit tougher comps than some of the others in the second quarter. So we're proud of the growth we had in the second quarter. And we had maybe a bit less easier comp. So the -- we'll further redefine what we think the markets are growing in the future. We call it maybe the -- we would have said 6% to 7%-ish range for our served market growth and maybe that's a bit higher this year. But we still believe that in most of our business units, we're growing faster than our peer group, which is what we're paid to do. So it's a healthy market. And whenever we have a very close pulse with our customers and the hospitals that have -- the big hospital systems who have already announced earnings, they have very healthy demand, but we see an ongoing patient backlog for lack of a -- patient wait time. So we don't see the current demand abating. Oftentimes, you'll see a bit of a slowdown in some of the vacation months in August and so forth, which is very routine. But we do anticipate continued support from strong procedure volume in the coming years. We don't see that really abating.\nJayson Bedford: Helpful. Thank you.\nLauren Tengler: Thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Boston Scientific.

Obviously, our big highlight at ESC is going to be the release of the data from Advent, which is, I think as everyone is aware at this point, our IDE trial to seek approval of FARAPULSE in the United States. We're really proud of the rigor of that trial. It is the first randomized trial in this space, comparing Pulsed Field Ablation with FARAPULSE system against thermal ablation with RS and Cryo. It's an incredibly rigorous design in terms of the endpoints and the monitoring, and we look forward to sharing those results in public. Yeah. Sure, Larry. There's a lot there.

Second quarter 2023 consolidated revenue of $3.599 billion represents 11% reported revenue growth versus the second quarter of 2022 and reflects a 100 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, in line with expectations. Excluding this $33 million headwind from foreign exchange, operational revenue growth was 12% in the quarter. Sales from acquisitions and divestitures contributed 30 basis points, resulting in 11.6% organic revenue growth, exceeding our guidance range of 7% to 9%. Q2 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $0.53 grew 20.7% versus 2022, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.48 to $0.50, driven by strong sales performance and a favorable effective tax rate in the quarter. Adjusted gross margin for the second quarter was 72%, slightly ahead of our expectations, resulting in an adjusted gross margin of 71.2% for the first half of 2023. We continue to expect second half gross margin to be lower than the first half of 2023 and in line with the second half of 2022, largely due to timing of foreign exchange movements in 2022. Second quarter adjusted operating margin was 26.8%, slightly ahead of expectations, predominantly driven by strong top line performance and partially offset by slightly higher SG&A spend. We continue to focus on adjusted operating margin expansion and are maintaining our full year 2023 goal of approximately 26.4% adjusted operating margin, which would represent 80 basis points of improvement versus the full year 2022. On a GAAP basis, the second quarter operating margin was 14.3%. Moving to below the line, second quarter adjusted interest and other expenses totaled $93 million, slightly higher than expectations, driven by FX volatility in certain unhedged currencies. On an adjusted basis, our tax rate for the second quarter was 9.8%, slightly below expectations due to certain discrete tax items and a lower than anticipated operational tax rate of 13.2%, driven by our geographic mix of earnings in the quarter. Fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding ended at 1,456 million shares in Q2, which includes the issuance of 23.98 million common shares upon the conversion of our mandatory convertible preferred stock on June 1 of this year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $514 million, with $658 million from operating activities, less $143 million net capital expenditures. Excluding special items, adjusted free cash flow was $730 million. We continue to target full year 2023 adjusted free cash flow in excess of $2.3 billion. As of June 30, 2023, we had cash on hand of $426 million and our leverage was 2.4 times, in line with our expectations. I'll now walk through guidance for Q3 and the full year. We expect full year 2023 operational revenue growth to be in a range of 11% to 12%, which excludes an approximate 50 basis point headwind from foreign exchange. Excluding the impact of closed acquisitions and divestitures, we expect full year 2023 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 10% to 11% versus 2022. We expect third quarter 2023 operational revenue growth to be in a range of 8% to 10% versus Q3 2022, excluding an approximate 50 basis point tailwind from foreign exchange based on current rates. Excluding the contribution from closed acquisitions and divestitures, we expect third quarter 2023 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 7% to 9%. We continue to expect our full year 2023 adjusted below the line expenses to be approximately $340 million. We continue to expect our full year 2023 operational tax rate to be approximately 14%. Under current legislation and forecasted geographic mix of sales, we now expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 12.5%, reflecting favorable tax discretes recognized in the second quarter. We expect a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1.475 billion shares for Q3 2023 and 1.464 billion shares for full year 2023. We expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.96 to $2, representing 15% to 17% growth versus 2022, which we believe delivers top tier financial performance. We continue to anticipate a neutral impact from FX on our full year 2023 adjusted earnings per share and we expect third quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.46 to $0.48. For more information, please check our Investor Relations website for Q2 2023 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more details on Q2 results and 2023 guidance. In closing, I'm very proud of our first half financial performance with top tier organic revenue growth of 13%, adjusted operating margin of 26.2% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 20%, all contributing towards our top-tier financial goals. I look forward to continued momentum in the second half of 2023. And with that, I'll turn it back to Lauren, who will moderate the Q&A. And then specific to Investor Day, Joanne, which is coming up here on September 20 for us, I would expect to see what you've seen in past investor days. You'll see the team give us a sense of what we think we can do with our financial goals over the next three years. So a formula, it's worked pretty well for us in our past Investor Days and I would look for us to do the same here in September. Sure. Let me try and put a finer point on that, Rick. So for the first half, we ended at 26.2% operating margin with a real strong 26.8% in the second quarter, which puts us in a good spot for our full year target, which is the 26.4%. Specific to Q2 and the 26.8%, for us, it's always about achieving the overall operating margin goals. And I think history would show that we manage all lines of the P&L pretty well to accomplish that objective. So in any given period, you may see one area of the P&L might contribute more or less. But the ultimate goal is, obviously, to get to that bottom line. And then really specific to Q2, I'm really happy that we got to that 26.8% adjusted operating margin. It's 160 basis points better than last year. And we were also able to accelerate some key SG&A investments to ensure the success of some of those upcoming transformational launches that we have starting here, hopefully, this year with our Cryo launch. So for us, it's always about all areas of the P&L can contribute to the overall operating margin story. Relative to first half, second half, the gross margin, which was a little north of 71% for the first half should be lower in the second half, should be more in line with where we were in the second half of last year, kind of in that 70.5% range for the second half. But the operating margin for the second half will get us -- will be higher than it was in the first half and obviously get us to that 26% goal for the year. The reason for the gross margin being lower in the second half, as we've said, is the FX movements in 2022. So as you go forward, I think lower gross margin in the second half, but higher operating margin in the second half to get to that 26.4%. And one little slight quarterly nuance is, I would expect to see a step down in Q3 relative to that 26.8% that we posted in Q2 and then a step up in Q4 to get to the overall number to get to 26.4% for the year. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of flavor of how we were thinking about it in Q2 and what the second half would bring to get us to that 26.4% for the year. Sure. Sure, Danielle. I think I can take that one. If you look at the second half, take the full year of 10% to 11%, which I'm super excited about. I mean they have a fully double-digit range for the full year for organic revenue growth is exciting and I'm proud of that. And when you look at the second half, the guidance we've given for the third quarter is 7% to 9%, so 8% at the midpoint. And then the implied is 7% to 9% for the fourth quarter to get to that, coupled with the first half performance that's what gets you to that 10% to 11% full year result. And I think that's appropriate and prudent guidance with where we are the comps, they're a little harder in the second half. I think it's like 100 basis points harder in the second half than they are in the first half. But overall, I think that 7% to 9% is appropriate, prudent for the second half. And if it gets us to that 10% to 11% for the full year, I think that will be a really successful year, coupled with 80 basis points of margin expansion and EPS growth of 15% to 17%, adjusted EPS for the year, I'd call that a pretty good year for the company. Sure. Sure. I'll start at the kind of the overall operating margin level. So if you say that we achieved the 26.4% adjusted operating margin goal for this year, the good news is there's still a long runway of margin expansion journey for us, well beyond that 26.4%. We've said publicly many times that we believe that 30% plus is a very reasonable target for the company. There's nothing structurally that prevents us from getting there. And to the extent that you have a durably, consistently growing top line, it just gives you a number of leverage opportunities to continue to grow that. So you have that kind of as a backdrop. Specific to areas of the P&L, I think the inflation piece is largely hitting gross margin. And we said that we had the $375 million of impact in '22 versus 2019 in gross margin and, in this year, it's basically stayed relatively consistent. So it's not a headwind or a tailwind versus last year, but obviously, a headwind versus that 72.4% margin that we were in 2019. So specific to your question around what happens going forward, I don't think we'll see a lot of inflationary abatement in '23. I think the guidance that we've given assumes we're kind of in -- we are where we are for the year. But as we look forward to '24 and beyond, yes, I mean, this year, the full year gross margin is -- will be kind of approaching 71% for the year. So that's a gap to where we used to be. And our goal, we're maniacally focused on getting back to that level. We do need some macro help in that, as you mentioned. So some of the elements of it, freight, we do see that getting a little better, the inflationary impact of the cost of the inputs into our manufacturing process, we see that abating over time. And then the consistency of the supply of the materials into our manufacturing process has improved. I mean, frankly, that's improved, but it's not back to where it used to be. So we still \u2013 it is choppier than we'd like to see it. And that does impact your ability to really run a really efficient manufacturing process. So I think \u201823 kind of, as I said, we are where we are. When you get to \u201824 and beyond, I think there is an opportunity for gross margin to continue to contribute. Frankly, I think all areas of the P&L can contribute, both areas in OpEx, SG&A and R&D, we can be more efficient. In R&D, we certainly can be more efficient overall in SG&A. And if gross margin can move north of that, approaching 71% that we have for this year, I'm excited about the opportunity for margin expansion going forward. Thanks, Matt. Sure. So on free cash flow, I'm really happy with Q2. Strong free cash flow quarter, both sequentially and year-over-year. To your point, conversion, it's an area of focus for us, an area of opportunity that has our attention, and one we're looking to improve on as we go forward here. As I've said in the past, there's a couple of kind of key reasons, one of which is our GAAP operating income is lower than some of our peers. We're doing a pretty good job of closing that gap over time, and that will be a key contributor. And then the acquisitive nature of what we do is -- can be a bit of a hamstring there, but I would look for -- as you said, at Investor Day, I'd look for us to give some pretty concrete goals relative to what we think we can do over that LRP period in the next three years to improve the conversion ratio that we have. And again, it's a focus area for us and something that we will look to improve on going forward. And I think your second question was on cash and M&A, is that fair? Yes. So I mean our capital allocation strategy has been remarkably consistent, right? It's all about the number one priority being high-quality tuck-in M&A. It's still our number one priority. We continue to look at opportunities in conjunction with our financial goals. We have closed two deals this year. The acquisition of Apollo closed in April, and then our acquisition of a stake in Acotec, the Chinese company, closed in February. So we've closed a couple this year. We continue to look to be active in the M&A space, and that remains our number one capital allocation priority. Thanks, Matt. Yeah. Obviously, with FX, we'll see where that is when we snap the line when we give guidance. So hard to comment on that now. And then there's always things that happen \u2013 VPP (ph) and other things that happen in every year. So our goal will be to -- we'll hit that 26.4% for this year continue to move that north over the LRP period. And again, as Mike said, look for us to be pretty prescriptive as what we think we can do at our Investor Day upcoming in September. Thanks."

            "name": "Mike Mahoney",
            "content": "Thanks, Lauren, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. We're very proud of our second quarter results, which exceeded our expectations and demonstrated the strength of our category leadership strategy, commitment to clinical evidence, and the winning spirit of our global team. In second quarter '23, total company sales grew 12%, both operationally and organically versus second quarter '22, exceeding the high end of our organic guidance range of 7% to 9%. We anticipate that most of our business units grew in line or faster than the respective markets, fueled by our innovative portfolio and commercial execution, also supported by healthy procedure demand. Second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.53 grew 21% versus second quarter '22, exceeding the high end of the guidance range of $0.48 to $0.50. And second quarter adjusted operating margin was 26.8%, also slightly higher than anticipated. Through the first half of the year, we have grown their business organic sales rate at 13%, with broad-based durable growth across all of our business units and regions. Importantly, we have also grown our adjusted EPS growth 20% during the first half, while balancing our investments to ensure we achieve our short-term and long-term goals. Now for our 2023 guidance, we're guiding the third quarter '23 organic revenue growth of 7% to 9% and we expect momentum to continue and are raising our full year organic guidance to 10% to 11%. Our third quarter adjusted EPS estimate is $0.46 to $0.48 and we're increasing our full year adjusted EPS range to $1.96 to $2. I'll now provide some additional highlights in the second quarter, along with comments on our '23 outlook, and Dan will provide more details on the financials. Regionally, and on an operational basis, the U.S. grew 9% in second quarter, with notable strength in our WATCHMAN, PI and Endoscopy businesses. Europe, Middle East Africa also grew 9% on an operational basis versus second quarter, with strong performance in the region was broad-based, with double-digit growth in four out of our five major markets in Europe. Across the portfolio, we saw strength in new and ongoing product launches, including FARAPULSE, POLARx, ACURATE neo2 and LUX-DX. Asia Pacific grew 24% operationally versus second quarter, led by strength in China and Japan. Japan growth is fueled by new products, including agent, our drug-coated balloon for the coronary arteries, and resume our minimally invasive BPH technology with device performance and procedures that leave nothing behind is resonating in the market. China delivered excellent growth in the second quarter, led by our innovative portfolio and commercial execution against the COVID impact second quarter '22. We also saw particular strength in our interventional cardiology therapies, WATCHMAN, CRM and PI business units and we continue to expect double-digit growth in China for the full year. I'll now provide some additional commentary on our businesses. Starting with urology. Urology sales grew 8% organically in the second quarter. The stone management franchise grew double-digits, driven by LithoVue and ongoing globalization efforts. Rezum continues to do well globally, growing strong double-digits in the quarter and most recently launching in Brazil. We continue to see ongoing momentum within our prosthetic urology franchise, fueled by patient activation efforts. designed to bring awareness to our erectile restoration and male incontinence interventions. Endoscopy sales were excellent, growing 12% organically and 14% operationally in the second quarter, with notable strength in the U.S., Latin America and Asia-Pac, with new product momentum and healthy procedure demand. Our Apollo integration is progressing well and earlier this month that we received FDA clearance for OverStitch NXT, a suturing system that enables suture placement during advanced endoscopic procedures. This next-generation device brings ease-of-use benefits and improved accessibility when using a single-channel endoscope. Neuromodulation sales grew 3% organically in the second quarter. Spinal cord stimulation sales were flat versus prior year and we expect SCS sales growth to improve in the second half of the year, with strong trialing in the second quarter in support of clinical evidence, which was presented this month at Aspen. Notably, six-month outcome data were reported from the SOLIS trial, which is a randomized controlled trial for non-surgical back pain, which demonstrated superior outcomes for SCS against conventional medical management, also consistent with primary endpoint results. Our brain franchise grew double-digits in the quarter, with continued momentum from new product launches in the U.S. and procedure recovery in Europe. Earlier this month, we received FDA approval for the Vercise Neural Navigator 5 software, which when used with our deep brain stimulation system can help provide clinicians with data for efficient programming in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Peripheral Interventions sales were very strong growing 13% organically versus second quarter '22. Our arterial franchise grew double-digits, led by our drug eluting portfolio. And earlier this month, after reviewing all available data and analysis, the FDA provided updated information associated with paclitaxel-coated devices used to treat PAD, recognizing the safety of these devices and eliminating the requirement for specific warning language within device-related labeling. We're pleased that the FDA determined that the available data do not support an excess mortality risk and we remain dedicated to helping physicians provide the best care possible for their patients. In Venous, U.S. growth was led by ongoing strength in Varithena, a non-thermal treatment for varicose veins, with international growth driven by our clot management technologies. Our Interventional Oncology franchise grew double-digits with strength across the entire portfolio. And last month, we received clearance for the EMBOLD, Soft and Packing Coils, which along with the EMBOLD fibroid coil, complete our detachable coil system. We also began our limited market release for Obsidio, which is the only conformable gel embolic material that's indicated for the peripheral vasculature, adding to our robust embolization portfolio. Cardiology delivered another excellent quarter with organic sales growth of 13% versus second quarter. Within cardiology, the Interventional Cardiology Therapies business, sales grew 12% organically versus second quarter. Our coronary therapies franchise growth was driven by our innovative imaging technologies as well as the recent launch of our agent drug-coated balloon in Japan, offsetting ongoing price pressure in drug eluting stents. Our structural heart valves franchise grew strong double-digits with another quarter of performance from our ACURATE neo2 in Europe. Market reception remains very high, backed by clinical evidence, ease-of-use benefits and a focus on lifetime patient management. We continue to expect to bring ACURATE neo2 to the U.S. in the second half of 2024. WATCHMAN sales grew 27% organically versus second quarter, also outpacing the market. U.S. demand remains strong and international growth was led by China and Japan. We were pleased to have completed enrollment in the WATCHMAN FLX Pro CT pilot study, which is a single study design using multiple imaging modalities to assess post-procedural healing in the next generation of WATCHMAN FLX Pro. We expect continued momentum within the WATCHMAN franchise further supported by the anticipated approval of our both WATCHMAN FLX Pro and our steerable sheath called Trusteer (ph) by the end of 2023. Cardiac Rhythm Management sales grew 5% organically in the quarter. In core CRM, our high-voltage business grew low-single digits and our low-voltage business grew mid-single digits, and we believe that performance was in line or slightly below market growth as the replacement tailwinds neutralize. Our diagnostic franchise grew double-digits in the quarter on the strength of our broad cardiac diagnostic portfolio and we anticipate momentum will continue, supported by the approval of our next-generation ICM called LUX 2 expected later this year. Electrophysiology sales grew 28% organically in the second quarter. International growth continues to be fueled by strong performance in both FARAPULSE and POLARx across Europe and Asia-Pac. We continue to make progress towards bringing these innovative technologies to the U.S., and we expect POLARx approval in the third quarter. In addition, we are looking forward to the data presentation of the ADVENT trial, our U.S. IDE, at the ESC Conference on August 27. Recall the ADVENT trial is a first of its kind, randomized clinical trial, designed for a non-inferior 12-month primary safety and efficacy endpoints compared to a commercially available RF and cryoablation systems. It is notable for its design and rigor as it seeks to demonstrate the single procedure effectiveness of an intervention without the use of antiarrhythmic drugs and reablations. We continue to anticipate the approval of FARAPULSE in the U.S. in 2024. The Access Solutions franchise grew strong double-digits in the second quarter with continued momentum in the U.S. and Japan with a differentiated VersaCross Transseptal platform. We're also proud of the performance of our global teams and are confident in our future. We remain committed to sustainable innovation and our financial goals, consistently growing sales faster than our underlying markets, expanding operating margins and delivered strong double-digit adjusted EPS growth with a strong adjusted free cash flow generation. We're looking forward to our September 20 Investor Day, where our leadership team will provide more insight into our innovative pipeline today, the opportunities ahead and our long-term financial goals. So before I pass it along to Dan, I want to announce that we also have some movement within our business unit leadership team. And after nearly 20 years at Boston Scientific, Maulik Nanavaty has announced his plan to retire in August. Jim Cassidy will now lead the neuromodulation business, where he previously spent eight years prior before moving over to lead the WATCHMAN franchise five years ago. Lastly, Angelo DeRosa will now lead our WATCHMAN business. Angelo has spent the last 10 years of Boston Scientific in Europe, most recently leading the European CRM and EP business. Congratulations to Jim and Angelo and we appreciate Maulik for his many contributions to Neuromodulation in Boston Scientific throughout his career. With that, I'll pass it over to Dan to provide more details on the financials. Thanks, Robbie. Sure. Good morning, Robbie. Yeah. So as you know, our portfolio is with the interventional procedures that we offer are very geared to an outpatient setting, in which we think is very positive trend and strategy for the long-term outlook for Boston Scientific, that's where the market is moving towards. So just a quick snapshot around the world. Japan had a very strong quarter just -- really that's primarily portfolio related. China had an excellent quarter. There was an easier comp in second quarter last year due to COVID impact. But I think that whole outpatient dynamic doesn't really play as significantly as much in Asia-Pac there. But really, it's more portfolio related for Japan, some COVID benefit, but great performance in China. And I think what's impressive about Europe, it's really across the board, across all the regions and the emerging markets. Some slowness in Russia, but we're lightly exposed in Russia, less than 1% and U.S. grew 9% as well. You've seen a bit higher proportion of outpatient procedures in the U.S than some of the other regions. But we continue to see just very strong patient demand. There's still a typically a very common wait list for most of our procedures for physicians. So it's a very steady supply and we have a terrific portfolio to meet the market. Thank you. Sure. I'll -- maybe Dr. Stein comment and I'll see if I need to comment further afterwards. Yeah. To make additional comment on FARAPULSE in the quarter, really pleased to see the increased utilization in Europe. We still have been supply chain constrained with our councils in Europe. So the demand for the platform far exceeds our ability to supply thus far, which we've reported out for a number of quarters in a row. But what's exciting, we just recently received GMED approval for a manufacturing approval to actually manufacture this in Minnesota, where we are here. And so we do anticipate, with the capabilities of the European team and the materials work by the supply chain, that we expect a significant increase in availability of new accounts in the fourth quarter of 2023 and that continuing on in 2024 well in advance of the launch in the U.S. So really proud of the supply chain team in this environment to build this capability internally to meet the demand. And you should expect a number of new centers opening in the fourth quarter, but the utilization is what surprised me. The utilization growth within the served centers in Europe continues to be impressive, which speaks to the performance of the platform. Yeah. We're obviously very bullish. WATCHMAN has been a pretty amazing product launch as well. Sometimes it gets drowned out in some of these would be continued momentum in that category and the growth of that market. But FARAPULSE is very exciting for us. We've been investing for quite a while post-acquisition to build up manufacturing capabilities, which is the most important thing we could do to meet the demand that we're seeing in Europe and in certain countries in Asia-Pac. So we're very pleased with that milestone. And as I commented earlier, expect to drive a number of new installs in the fourth quarter. I also mentioned just the ongoing increase in utilization. So the physicians who are using that in Europe and selected markets in Asia continue to drive more usage of it, which really is a terrific sign, very similar to what we saw with WATCHMAN throughout that progress. We also have a very strong clinical trial cadence with our persistent trial advantage, which is enrolling very quickly in other trials that we've announced as well as ongoing enhancements of the portfolio. So we have the R&D to continue to strengthen the portfolio, the clinical science studies to continue to advance it, and it's the fastest growing -- one of the fastest-growing fields along with WATCHMAN in MedTech, where we have a very low share. We know it's a very competitive market, but we feel we have many advantages with FARAPULSE and really driving the clinical data in this field and we also have the commercial infrastructure to exploit the opportunity. So we're very bullish on it, and we're looking forward to the ADVENT release. Yeah. Thank you. I'm trying to be vague. It's as you saw in the first half results, the results are really broad-based across the company and across each region. Excellent growth in Asia Pac and Japan and China, continued share taking in Europe and excellent performance in the U.S. So it's really not one region driving it, which should give investors a lot of confidence in just the momentum and durable growth of the company. The standouts, there are a number of them. You continue to see WATCHMAN performance very strong. That market continues to grow well in excess of 20%. We continue to take a little bit of share in that category. And we're very excited in the future about the launches of the distributable sheets and the next-gen WATCHMAN FLX Pro and the potential of these market-expanding trials, which will read out in a couple of years here. So that platform continues to do very well. Our coronary business did excellent. We're seeing nice results of agents in the U.S. We'll be launching that in 2024, which really reverses any declining trend in drug-eluting stents, and that complex coronary business continues to do well. We saw a great strong growth in PI and endo, euro. We had some softness in our Neuromod business. We anticipate that to get better in the second half. So really, it's a continued momentum. And what we'll highlight at Investor Day is some of the questions we received today. We have some potential very big growth drivers with ongoing WATCHMAN momentum in our entire EP business with the launch of Cryo, which we anticipate in the third quarter this year, and FARAPULSE, which has been discussed at great length. So just good momentum and extremely exciting launches coming that we'll detail out at Investor Day. Yes. Thank you. POLARx is doing extremely well in Japan, doing quite well in Europe as well, where we also are selling FARAPULSE, as you indicated. We do not have the constraints on POLARx from a supply standpoint. So the team has been well ahead of that. So there's no limitations there. We do anticipate approval at some point, likely in the third quarter. So we'll have the supply to meet the demand. We have the commercial team in place. And the Cryo market is quite substantial in the U.S. And certainly, doctors are very interested in FARAPULSE, but there's a number of Cryo users there. Some physicians may be looking for even longer-term data on FARAPULSE. So we do see a nice market for Cryo in the coming years. And that's an area that really hasn't seen any innovation in nearly a decade. And so we're excited about what POLARx delivers in terms of differentiating features. Physicians are anxious to try a new platform, and we had the demand to support it. So it's -- we're blessed to have both FARAPULSE coming in the U.S. and Cryo as well as our mapping system to really meet the demands of the electrophysiologists. So we're excited about launching Cryo. Yeah. Thanks, Marie. Thanks for the endo question. Just one of our very best businesses in the company, a very global business, a strong contributor to accretive OI margin and grew 12% in the quarter. And consistent with other quarters, on the portfolio, it's quite broad-based. We did see strong procedure volume in the quarter, which is positive. And so I would say the procedure volume overall is quite high in that arena. But still, as mentioned earlier, oftentimes waitlist certainly in the U.S. and in Europe for that business. So we expect ongoing strong demand there. The Apollo acquisition, we're very excited about. The strategy for within endo is we have such a broad-based portfolio with so many SKUs that we are the clear category leader in that area. And we also, as you know, offer very differentiated technologies within that portfolio like SpyGlass, Axios (ph) and now Apollo and also the GESTALT-D (ph) platform. So Apollo also adds this endoluminal suturing capability. The opportunity to expand into the endobariatric market, which we believe will be a high growth area. Certainly, it is in Asia today, in Japan and in the U.S. patients seek a less invasive form to have that bariatric procedure. And it couples nicely with the entire portfolio. So our customers enjoy doing broad-based contracts with our Endo business and the portfolio that we offer, supported by strong procedure volumes. So we'll continue to innovate in that business. And the scopes continue to contribute growth as well. So it's really broad-based across that portfolio. Yeah. So we -- it's good for us to create tough comps. We didn't have an easy comp going into this year. It was about a 9% comp going into '23. So that's a pretty healthy comp. And you indicated what the guidance is. I won't repeat up too many of the other comments. It's broad-based momentum. So growing in that guidance range versus 9% comp is a strong year. And we'll give guidance obviously in January for 2024, and Dan will give some insights to our three-year LRP at Investor Day. And we're really bullish about this next three-year period based on these differentiated launches that based on the current momentum that we have in the business, the product cycle that we have and the opportunity to potentially take it up to another level over a three-year period with these launches, many of which we've been discussed on the call today, many of them coming out of the cardio business. And also the benefit of the margin improvement opportunity that Dan outlined, which we think is a multiyear margin improvement opportunity for us and the increasing strength of the balance sheet. So I think all those areas point to the momentum of the company, but we're excited about really the next chapter of the company, given the cadence of launches that really have been a bit more derisked, I would say, versus a year ago. You've seen others report. So the markets are healthy. There's -- we had a bit tougher comps than some of the others in the second quarter. So we're proud of the growth we had in the second quarter. And we had maybe a bit less easier comp. So the -- we'll further redefine what we think the markets are growing in the future. We call it maybe the -- we would have said 6% to 7%-ish range for our served market growth and maybe that's a bit higher this year. But we still believe that in most of our business units, we're growing faster than our peer group, which is what we're paid to do. So it's a healthy market. And whenever we have a very close pulse with our customers and the hospitals that have -- the big hospital systems who have already announced earnings, they have very healthy demand, but we see an ongoing patient backlog for lack of a -- patient wait time. So we don't see the current demand abating. Oftentimes, you'll see a bit of a slowdown in some of the vacation months in August and so forth, which is very routine. But we do anticipate continued support from strong procedure volume in the coming years. We don't see that really abating."

At this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Lauren Tengler, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nLauren Tengler: Thank you, Jamie. Welcome, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. . We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q1 2023 results, which include reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading, Financials and Filings. The duration of this morning's call will be approximately 1 hour. Mike and Dan will provide comments on Q1 performance as well as the outlook for our business, including Q2 and full year 2023 guidance, and then we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Ken Stein. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, operational revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, and organic revenue growth further excludes acquisitions and divestitures for which there are less than a full period of comparable net sales. Relevant acquisitions excluded for organic growth are Baylis Medical, which closed on February 14, 2022, the majority stake investment in Acotec Scientific Holdings Limited and Apollo Endosurgery, which closed in February and April of this year, respectively. Please note that we have elected to consolidate Acotec results of operations on a 1-quarter lag, thus having no impact to our Q1 reported or adjusted results. Guidance excludes the previously announced agreement to purchase a majority stake in MI Tech, which has not closed. For more information, please refer to our financial and operating highlights deck, which may be found on our Investor Relations website. On this call, all references to sales and revenue, unless otherwise specified, are organic. This call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, may believe, estimate and other similar words. They include, among other things, statements about our growth and market share, new anticipated product approvals and launches, acquisitions, clinical trials, cost savings and growth opportunities, our cash flow and expected use, our financial performance, including sales, margins and earnings, as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses. If our underlying assumptions turn out to be incorrect or certain risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from the expectations and projections expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them. At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike.\nMichael Mahoney: Thanks, Lauren, and thank you to everyone, for joining us today. Our first quarter performance exceeded our expectations across all business units and regions, which is a testament to the winning spirit of our global team and the relentless focus on innovation and execution, and we also launched more than 70 new products globally in 2022. In the first quarter 2023, total company operational sales grew 15% versus 2022, while organic sales grew 14%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of 6% to 8%. We believe that all business units grew faster than their respective markets with differentiated portfolios and a strong commercial execution, supported by healthy procedural demand. First quarter EPS of $0.47 grew 19% versus 2022, exceeding the high end of the guidance range of $0.42 to $0.44. First quarter adjusted operating margin was 25.5%, which is in line with expectations. Now for our 2023 guidance. For second quarter '23, organic revenue, we're guiding to growth of 7% to 9% and full year organic growth of 8% to 10%. Our second quarter '23 adjusted EPS estimate is $0.48 to $0.50. And we're guiding to a full year adjusted EPS range of $1.90 to $1.96. I'll provide additional highlights on first quarter, along with comments on our 2023 outlook, and Dan will provide more details on the financials. Regionally, on an operational basis, the U.S. grew 13% versus first quarter '22 inclusive of 140 basis point tailwind from the Baylis acquisition with notable strength -- with notable organic strength across all our business units. Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 20% on an operational basis versus first quarter '22 with nearly every market growing double digits in the quarter. This strong above-market growth is driven by our diverse portfolio, new launches and commercial execution with healthy underlying market demand. We remain excited about the year ahead and expect to continue to outpace our peers within the EMEA market. Asia Pac grew 15% operationally versus first quarter '22 with broad-based strength across all major markets and business units. Within the quarter, we're pleased to have received Health Sciences Authority approval for Farapulse in Singapore, expanding access of this innovative new technology to more patients. In Japan, first quarter growth was fueled by the launch of AGENT, drug coated balloon, a differentiated coronary drug-coated balloon for in-stent restenosis and small vessels with physicians pleased with ease of use in balloon deliverability. China also grew double digits in first quarter, ahead of our expectations with solid procedural demand as hospitals work through COVID delayed procedures. Our diverse portfolio in China, commercial execution and supply chain management within the country supported the strong performance in the quarter. In February, we also closed our majority stake investment in Acotec, further expanding our presence in the market, and we continue to expect double-digit growth in China for the full year. I'll now provide some comments on our business units. Urology sales grew 16% organically. All four franchises grew double digits in the quarter with strength in key products, including LithoVue and Rezum. In the U.S., we received FDA clearance and initiated a limited market release for LithoVue Elite, which is a single-use flexible ureteroscope, which incorporates an innovative pressure-sensing capability that will enable physicians to monitor intrarenal pressure during stone removal procedures. Endoscopy sales for the quarter grew 11% organically versus first quarter '22 with broad-based strength across all regions and franchises. Our Single-Use-Imaging franchise grew double digits, so we're pleased to have recently launched our third-generation EXALT-D with improved ergonomic design updates to improve the physician experience. In April, we closed the Apollo Endosurgery acquisition, which furthers our category leadership strategy within the important area of endoluminal surgery. With differentiated technologies like OverStitch and X-Tack along with an entry into the adjacent endobariatric market. Neuromodulation sales grew 14% organically versus first quarter '22. Our pain business grew high single digits in the quarter with strong SCS performance driven by our innovative Alpha portfolio with FAST therapy and our Cognita suite of digital tools supporting patient activation. Our brain franchise grew double digits in the quarter, driven by new product launches, including GUIDE XT, which was developed in collaboration with Brainlab. This revolutionary software provides implanting and managing clinicians the ability to model the effect of a patient simulation ahead of actual programming, which will improve procedural efficiency. In the quarter, peripheral interventions also grew 12% organically versus first quarter '22. Our arterial franchise grew double digits, led by our drug-eluting portfolio, establishing clear leadership in SFA drug elution, further supported by our differentiated Eluvia long-length DES. Our Venous franchise growth was driven by ongoing above-market performance in Varithena. And within the quarter, we launched EKOS Plus in the U.S., which provides more ultrasound power to resolve clot burden more quickly and completely. Our Interventional Oncology franchise grew double digits with strength across the entire portfolio. We look forward to initiating our limited market release in the second quarter for Obsidio, the first conformable embolic indication for the peripheral vasculature. Cardiology delivered another excellent quarter, with operational sales growing 17% and organic sales growing 15% versus first quarter '22. Within cardiology, interventional cardiology therapies, sales grew 13%. Our coronary therapies franchise grew low double digits in first quarter, led by strong performance within our imaging portfolio with particular strength in the U.S. with the ongoing launch of the AVVIGO-II guidance system. Our Structural Heart Valves franchise continues to grow strong double digits, and we're pleased to have completed enrollment on our ACURATE IDE trial and continue to expect to launch ACURATE Neo2 within the U.S. in the second half of 2024. Watchman sales grew 29% organically versus first quarter '22. Demand remains very strong for Watchman FLX, and we now have treated more than 300,000 patients globally since launch. We are proud of our performance to date, and we continue to invest for the future through product innovation, solutions and clinical evidence. Last week, the Population Health Research Institute announced the IDE approval of [ LOUS 4 ], which is a collaborative research study with Boston Scientific that will continue to expand our LAAC clinical evidence. This trial is expected to start in mid-2023 and will complement the existing CHAMPION AF and Option trials. Cardiac Rhythm Management sales grew 8% organically versus first quarter '22. Our Diagnostics franchise grew strong double digits in the quarter with continued momentum across the portfolio. In core CRM, both our high-voltage and low-voltage businesses grew mid-single digits. And we believe that all major markets were in line or slightly above market growth. We do expect our core CM growth to taper closer to market growth for the remainder of '23 as replacement tailwinds neutralize. Electrophysiology sales grew 54% operationally and 31% organically versus first quarter '22. Our international EP business grew 40%. And importantly, the EMEA region grew our EP business 57%, driven by strong adoption of Farapulse and POLARx. We continue to invest in the expansion of our portfolio and received approval in Japan, Canada and Europe for POLARx FIT, which is an expandable balloon catheter, capable of creating 28- and 31-millimeter sizes, providing procedural adaptability and efficiency. And just last week, 1 year outcomes data from the MANIFEST-PF registry were presented as a late breaker at EHRA. This is the first large real-world dataset on a novel ablation technology, which demonstrated real-world safety, efficacy and efficiency of the Farapulse PFA system. The data also reinforced the minimal learning curve and reproducibility of the Farapulse workflow and everyday commercial use. We continue to advance our clinical evidence within this space and initiate enrollment in our ADVANTAGE AF trial, which is studying the use of Farapulse for patients with persistent atrial fibrillation. We also look forward to the readout of our Advent U.S. ID randomized controlled trial in the second half of this year and continue to expect the approval in the U.S. in '24. We're also very pleased with the performance of our Access Solutions franchise, which grew strong double digits in the first quarter, driven by further penetration into transseptal crossing procedures. Last week, we released our '22 performance report, outlining our environmental, social and governance results. We are pleased with the progress our global teams have made to advance sustainable innovation while contributing to a healthier planet, addressing in equities and supporting communities around the world. We have much more to do, and our values-based culture will serve us well as we continue to transform lives and hold ourselves accountable to our commitments. We are confident the year ahead will bring many more exciting milestones across each of our business units, and we remain committed to our financial goals of consistently growing faster than our underlying markets and our peer group, expanding operating margins and delivering double-digit adjusted EPS growth with strong free cash flow generation. We also look forward to hosting our hybrid Investor Day event on September 20. With that, I'll pass it off to Dan to provide more details on the financials.\nDaniel Brennan: Thanks, Mike. First quarter consolidated revenue of $3.389 billion represents 12% reported revenue growth versus first quarter 2022 and reflects an $88 million headwind from foreign exchange, slightly favorable to our expectations with continued volatility in foreign exchange rates throughout the quarter. . Excluding this 290 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, operational revenue growth was 14.9% in the quarter. Sales from the acquisition of Baylis through mid-February contributed 90 basis points, resulting in 14% organic revenue growth, nicely exceeding our guidance range of 6% to 8%. Strong revenue performance resulted in Q1 adjusted earnings per share of $0.47, again, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.42 to $0.44 and representing growth of 19.2% versus 2022. Adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 70.4%. We continue to expect full year 2023 gross margin to include a similar level of macroeconomic and supply chain headwinds as 2022 and expect a sequential improvement in Q2, resulting in a first half 2023 gross margin that is higher than the second half of 2023, largely due to the timing of foreign exchange movements in 2022. First quarter adjusted operating margin was 25.5%. We continue to prioritize operating margin expansion and are maintaining our full year 2023 goal of approximately 26.4% adjusted operating margin, representing 80 basis points of improvement versus the full year 2022. On a GAAP basis, the first quarter operating margin was 16.3%. Moving to below the line. First quarter adjusted interest and other expense totaled $78 million, slightly favorable to expectations due to gains on certain unhedged currencies. On an adjusted basis, our tax rate for the first quarter was 12.8%, including discrete tax items and the benefit from stock compensation accounting, slightly higher than expectations due to the timing of certain discrete tax items. Our operational tax rate was 13.8% for the first quarter in line with our full year expectations of approximately 14%. Fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding ended at 1.446 billion shares in Q1. Free cash flow for the quarter was $83 million, with $190 million from operating activities, less $108 million net capital expenditures. Excluding payments related to acquisitions, restructuring and other special items, adjusted free cash flow was $229 million. We continue to aim for full year 2023 adjusted free cash flow in excess of $2.3 billion. As of March 31, 2023, we had cash on hand of $570 million, which in accordance with accounting standards for less than wholly owned subsidiaries includes the cash balance from Acotec of approximately $140 million following the completion of our majority stake investment. As of March 31, our leverage was 2.5x, in line with our expectations. I'll now walk through guidance for Q2 and the full year 2023. We expect full year 2023 operational revenue growth to be in a range of 9% to 11%, which excludes an approximate 50 basis point headwind from foreign exchange. Excluding the impact of closed acquisitions, and the recently closed divestiture of our pathology business, which had approximately $24 million revenue in 2022, we expect full year 2023 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 8% to 10% versus 2022. We expect second quarter 2023 operational revenue growth to be in a range of 7.5% to 9.5% versus Q2 2022 excluding an approximate 100 basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates. Excluding the contribution from closed acquisitions and divestitures, we expect second quarter 2023 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 7% to 9%. We expect our full year 2023 adjusted below-the-line expenses to be approximately $340 million. We continue to expect our full year 2023 operational tax rate to be approximately 14%, with an adjusted tax rate of approximately 13% under current legislation and forecasted geographic mix of sales. We expect a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1.458 billion shares for Q2 2023 and 1.464 billion shares for full year 2023, which includes the 23.98 million shares we expect to issue based on our current stock price on June 1, 2023, upon the conversion of our mandatory convertible preferred stock. We expect the impact to adjusted earnings per share to be neutral with the approximately $14 million quarterly preferred stock dividend ending at the time of conversion. We expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.90 to $1.96, representing 11% to 15% growth versus 2022, which we believe delivers top-tier financial performance. We continue to anticipate a neutral impact from FX on full year 2023 adjusted earnings per share. We expect second quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.48 to $0.50. For more information, please check our Investor Relations website for Q1 2023 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more details on Q1 results and 2023 guidance. Before I turn the call over for a few upcoming events, to note: we will be hosting our Annual Shareholder Meeting on May 4 at 8:00 a.m. Eastern and our Q2 2023 earnings call on Thursday, July 27, at 7:30 a.m. Eastern. With that, I'll turn it back to Lauren, who will moderate the Q&A.\nLauren Tengler: Thanks, Dan. [indiscernible] let's open it up to questions for the next 35 minutes or so. In order for us to take as many questions as possible, please try and limit yourself to one question. Jamie, please go ahead.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan.\nRobert Marcus: And congrats on a great quarter here. Let me start with -- and I'll just ask one two-part question here. Great, great performance in the first quarter, particularly on the top line. We all know this is probably the last easy comp from COVID trends in first quarter last year. But would love to get a sense of what are you seeing globally? How sustainable is this? You guided to a slight deceleration in second quarter. Anything to note there other than conservatism? And then second, there have been some news reports lately about M&A on the -- behalf of Boston Scientific. Would love to just get a refresh on your M&A strategy. We've seen a lot more smaller tuck-in type deals historically. Is that still the goal? And any thoughts there?\nMichael Mahoney: Sure, Robbie. Thanks for the question. I'll -- second one is easier for me then I'll do the first one. On the second one on M&A, as you know, we've been consistent over the years. As a matter of practice, we never comment on rumors or speculation in the marketplace. On the first question, really proud just of the global performance really across the board. If you look at on the regional side, as I mentioned in the script there, U.S. grew 13%. I think it's really important to note that Europe grew 20%, and Asia Pac grew 15%. So it wasn't one region or one business. It really was across the board performance. And it's encouraging in Europe, in particular, where we have an impressive product line in our EP portfolio and in our TAVI portfolio that's not launched yet in the U.S., which I think is a good signal for the future, as you'll hear about more in Investor Day, as well as in Japan, where we have our POLARx product approved in Japan, but not approved in the U.S. So the fact that the U.S. put up a double-digit number, albeit on some softer comps, as you said, given then the COVID impact. The European and Asia Pac performance is really impressive, and LatAm. And those products -- many of those products are not yet approved in the U.S. So overall, really pleased. You saw almost every business unit grew double digits. But I think, more importantly, not all of our competitors have reported yet, but we'd be surprised if we didn't exceed the peer group across each one of our businesses. So the execution of the team is very -- quite strong. And also, I would say the -- there were clearly some underlying market improvement in first quarter. You saw the public hospitals report, good patient volume, particularly good outpatient volume, which is a good indicator for Boston Scientific, given our portfolio. Nursing shortage is still a challenge for sure, but has improved. And the hospitals being very efficient. So the underlying backdrop for procedure volume demand has improved and is strong and our portfolio really meets the moment around the world. So we're really pleased with the overall performance.\nDaniel Brennan: And then specific to Q2, Robbie, just to double-click a bit on that. As Mike said, relative to CRM, that grew 8% in the quarter. We had talked about at the beginning of the year, that kind of growing at market, lower single digits. . We have some replacement trends that start to get a little bit more challenging. So that 8% probably a bit outsized for what we're expecting there. And then Neuromod, as you look at that, that's a business that over the last many quarters has been kind of in that low single-digit range and to pop of 14, that's great in the quarter. But I think a little early to call the ball on that market and say that it's fully recovered. So just the 7% to 9%, I think, is appropriately prudent for second quarter guidance.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from Citi.\nJoanne\u00a0Wuensch: And may I reiterate or repeat, good quarter. One of the things I've been trying to figure out this particular quarter is how much of what we're seeing is easy comps, pent-up demand or something else. I know you can't particularly pick that apart on this kind of delivery but if it is pent-up demand, is there any way to quantify how many quarters or what kind of tailwind that is? And I'll throw my second question in too. Farapulse seems to be doing quite well outside the United States, and we're getting a lot of questions on the timing of it in the United States and what that ramp may look like. If there's any color or sort of level setting of expectations, that would be appreciated.\nMichael Mahoney: Sure. On the first one, Joanne, wish we could give you a perfect scientific response to your question on the overall market. I would say it's a healthy market for all the factors that you just indicated. There are some easier comps. Our comp for Q1 was -- it was 9.7%, but that was based on COVID impacted 2021. So maybe the comps are a little bit easier, but clearly, the procedure volume is stronger, as I mentioned, with the hospitals that have reported. The outpatient momentum is quite strong, which fits our portfolio. And we've got a very strong portfolio cadence across the world right now. So I think it's really all those things that contribute to a very strong first quarter and the increase in the guide that we gave for the full year. We typically have said previously that the markets that we serve grow kind of plus 6% in that range. Clearly, the market grew faster than that in the first quarter. But we're not quite ready to call this exceptionally strong market growth for the full year. We think that would be premature to do that and not responsible. So that's why we gave the guidance that we did of the 8% to 10% full year because we do see strong underlying market demand but it may not be quite as strong as we saw in the first quarter, and we'll see as the year goes on. On Farapulse, I was at that EHRA meeting in Europe just last week, and the enthusiasm for Farapulse is very unique, I would say. The MANIFEST data was excellent. And Dr. Stein is here. Can you remind us when the -- when do we expect the trial to read out?\nKen Stein: Yes. So our U.S. IDE trial, Joanne, is Advent. It's the most rigorous trial that anyone's done in this space. It's a double-lined randomized trial against conventional thermal ablation. Continue to expect to present that data second half of this year, submit to the FDA at the same time. So again, continue to anticipate U.S. approval in '24.\nJoanne\u00a0Wuensch: Would you expect it to ramp similarly to what you're seeing outside the United States?\nMichael Mahoney: Sorry, I didn't hear the question?\nLauren Tengler: Yes, sales ramp similar in U.S. versus...\nMichael Mahoney: Well, for Farapulse?\nLauren Tengler: Yes.\nMichael Mahoney: Yes. So Farapulse, we broke out the #4 in Europe, which is 57%, I believe.\nLauren Tengler: Organically, all EP.\nMichael Mahoney: Yes. And that includes POLARx, which makes a very strong contribution, and we expect approvals for POLARx in the U.S. the second half of this year. And we do expect POLARx to be a nice part of our portfolio globally for many, many years. So that's having a nice contribution, and Farapulse is having an outweighted contribution despite some still limitations in supply. So customer demand is outpacing supply, I would say, still at this moment. But clearly, there's a lot of enthusiasm. You saw the MANIFEST trial data in terms of the safety, the efficacy and the procedure, the productivity has clearly been differentiated. So we'll continue to report our progress in EP, but the momentum in Europe is quite strong, and that's why we called that number out for you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rick Wise from Stifel.\nFrederick Wise: Mike, just looking ahead to the September 20 Analyst Day, Boston's excellent CFO recently spoken public, I think, March 1 at my friend Joanne's event and said that he is excited for the next chapter for the company for '23 and then for '24, '25 and '26. And I think you said Boston has the opportunity to have a special chapter for the company. I'm just wondering what do you think, Dan, meant? And what is a special chapter? And does that possibly suggest more willingness, given that everything is happening fundamentally and with the product portfolio to commit to a sustained higher growth rate guidance for the next LRP?\nMichael Mahoney: Well, Dan is a smart guy, and he wouldn't have said that unless he meant it. And so I certainly support that. And we'll lay it out more at Investor Day. But just overall, you see the strength of our businesses really across the board, and the portfolio mix continues to help us. It's what we purposely designed and executed on for many, many quarters in a row. Our businesses in the slower growth markets continue to get smaller and smaller as a percent of our sales, and we continue to layer on faster growth markets and better innovation that also help us with the pricing. And you're very aware of many of our key products that are launched outside the U.S. that are not in the U.S. that we can make very -- that we can make very nice gross margins and at high customer demand. So we look forward to bringing those to the U.S. and we'll also tell you about some other products or capabilities that may lie outside our 3-year LRP. But we'll share all that at Investor Day, but we're very excited about the future of the company.\nFrederick Wise: And let me sneak in one quick follow-up on Farapulse. I know that you've been supply constrained on Farapulse generators. Is that situation improving? Will it be resolved by the time you hopefully get U.S. approval? Any update on that situation?\nMichael Mahoney: Yes. We do expect that to dramatically improve prior to having U.S. approval, primarily because we will bring in -- we have really important strategic contractors that we have very long-term contracts in place with, were a very much part of our solution. But we're also, in parallel, have internal capabilities that we're ramping up. And so both those things will continue to happen for many, many years. But we do expect, particularly in the second half of '22 -- of '23, I'm sorry, to have enhanced console supply to meet the demand. And we expect by the time the U.S. approval that we'll have significantly more capabilities in this area. So I guess for that reason, it's the only reason why we're happy about the timeline and the slight delay in the U.S. with the trials to ramp up our production. But we expect to be able to meet that demand in the U.S. when we get approval.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.\nLarry Biegelsen: Congrats on a great start to the year here, guys. So one for Dr. Stein, one for Mike. So Dr. Stein, Farapulse is a single-shot technology with PFA energy, but companies are developing large local catheters and dual energy sources. How are you thinking about the evolution of Farapulse beyond its current geometry and energy source? And Mike, we all completely understand you won't comment on rumors, but there are interesting assets in MedTech that would push you to over 4.5x leverage or require the use of equity because of relatively large deals. Are those options on the table? And just remind us of how you think about ROIC?\nKen Stein: Yes. Thanks, Larry...\nMichael Mahoney: I will take the second one...\nKen Stein: Take the second one.\nMichael Mahoney: As a matter of practice, Larry, we don't comment on rumors or speculation. I will comment on -- we did comment on the closing of Apollo in the quarter, which is really going to be a nice asset for us, endoscopy, expand our endoluminal presence and a nice continued focus on category leadership. So we -- our venture portfolio, we've signed Acotec or closed the Acotec deal this year. We had closed the Apollo deal. But like we always said, any future deal speculation, as a matter of practice, we don't comment on.\nKen Stein: And then, Larry, on sort of the evolution of Farapulse. We certainly are looking at alternate catheter form factors. And sort of as you mentioned, there are a lot of different things that you can do with pulse field energy and with the Farawave platform or Farapulse platform. I do think it's important, though, as you think through that to think through the different use cases. And so for atrial fibrillation, whether it's paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, where really the goal of therapy is just pulmonary vein isolation or whether it's persistent atrial fibrillation where you may very well need to go beyond that, do pulmonary vein isolation plus posterior wall isolation, which we're investigating right now in our ADVANTAGE trial. And as Mike noted in his prepared remarks, we've already begun enrollment in that trial and really our -- I'd say, beyond pleased, at the excitement at the rate at which we're enrolling in that trial. When you think about both of those use cases, right, it's our belief -- and in fact, the data that you've seen from things like Manifest supports that belief that the Farawave catheter itself is uniquely well suited among all the competing technologies for achieving those goals. So again, when you think about AF ablation, right, we think that the Farawave catheter is the best of the catheter form factors out there. And then when you couple that with the waveform that we deliver, when you couple that with the dosing protocol that we've optimized over the many years of preclinical and clinical research that Farapulse did and that we've continued since the acquisition, we are really satisfied with that as the catheter that's going to be preferred for AFib ablation. And then it's adding on like some of these other form factors that you talk about as we think about some of the smaller use cases beyond the AFib market.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Travis Steed from Bank of America.\nTravis Steed: I guess high level, maybe you could just refresh us on your overall capital allocation priorities and start there. And then a quick question on the guidance. Revenue growth obviously moved up quite a bit, but earnings didn't move up quite as much. So I just want to make sure I'm not missing something on the EPS side given that margins are staying the same.\nDaniel Brennan: Sure, Travis. I think I can probably take both of those. Capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. It's been an equation that's worked well for us for many years here relative to capital allocation. So first priority is high-quality tuck-in adjacent type growth M&A. And Mike just gave you a couple of examples of those that we've closed this year. And then we fill in on the back with any excess cash for share repurchase. And as you know, obviously don't pay dividend this time. So I think that's clear. With respect to the drop-through in the quarter, as I look at it, we kind of beat the midpoint of the range and the consensus by $200 million. You drop that through at our overall margin percentage and you get to about $0.02 to $0.03 of additional adjusted EPS, you would have expected. We delivered 3.5%. I think that's kind of in that range. We're at 25.5% adjusted operating margin. I think that puts us right in place to achieve that 26.4% for the year. So I think all is well relative to the margin profile. And the 26.4%, again, it would be 80 basis points on top of last year, which I think gives us a bit of a differentiated expansion versus our peer set.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore.\nVijay Kumar: Congrats on the [ printing ]. I had a two-part, one on product and one on capital allocation. On the product side, PFA, Mike, did I hear you correctly on the prior question on Farapulse. Can you do point-by-point ablation at this point? I thought it was a single-shot catheter, but I would be curious to know if you have -- if it can do point-by-point ablation and are you gaining share in the RF side as well in the current market? And then on the capital allocation side, I know you're not going to comment on market speculation. So this is not related to market speculation, but can you just remind us, in current interest rate environment, what kind of leverage levels would Boston be comfortable with? And if Boston deems a deal as strategic, would you be okay doing an earnings dilutive deal?\nKen Stein: Vijay, it's Ken. Let me start with a question about Farapulse and Farawave and really answer in two parts, right? So the first part, so the current catheter that we have approved in the CE Mark countries and as Mike said, in Singapore, and that we're evaluating the U.S. in the Advent trial, is a \"single-shot catheter\". So it's not a point-by-point ablation catheter. And as I said to Larry, it's a catheter form factor that really is uniquely well suited for pulmonary vein isolation and for posterior wall isolation. And again, we firmly believe that this is the best form factor out there than for tackling the vast majority of patients are undergoing atrial fibrillation ablation. Now having said that, and I think sort of the proof behind that is when you look at our commercial release in Europe, we are taking share both from centers that were \"single-shot centers\", so the cryo users, but also taking share from folks who were very well known in the field for their point-by-point RF ablation. I'd say we've really been impressed and pleased at the way we're converting folks who were point-by-point users into PFA and that's based on the safety, based on the efficacy and also, frankly, based on the efficiency of ablation with Farawave.\nDaniel Brennan: And then relative to your specific question on leverage, I'd say it's been a focused and intentional journey for us to get back to BBB+ with all three rating agencies that rate us. And very comfortable there, obviously committed to investment grade and comfortable at that BBB+ rating.\nVijay Kumar: Sorry, on earnings dilution, Dan, would you be consider an earnings dilutive deal if Boston deems it as strategic?\nDaniel Brennan: I wouldn't comment on specific dilution and this and that. I think from our perspective, relative to the M&A environment. We're committed to looking at deals that are high growth and tuck-in acquisitions as we've done.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy from UBS.\nDanielle Antalffy: And congrats on a really strong quarter. Just a question on Farapulse. Sorry, there's so much focus on this one product on the call. But I'm curious about how you guys are thinking about the evolution of the market probably. I mean this has been a market that AF ablation market that's been double-digit grower for the last decade plus. But is it right to think about Farapulse and just the advent of pulse sales ablation overall is potentially accelerating market growth in a meaningfully and sustainable way because of the safety profile of the device? Or how are you thinking about -- and what are you seeing, I guess, in Europe about market growth overall for this device? And I have one follow-up on Watchman.\nKen Stein: Yes. Sure, Danielle. I guess I'll take that first one, and we'll see on the follow-up. I mean the easy answer to what your question was, is yes. We do see Farapulse accelerating adoption of AF ablation. AF, right, is the most common sustained arrhythmia that's seen globally. In fact, ablation today for current indications is still very much underpenetrated. It's underpenetrated for a couple of reasons, right? And one is safety concerns around the procedure. One is just the skill level and the relative inefficiency of AF ablations today using thermal energy. So I think, first of all, with the Farapulse system with Farawave and again, the safety the efficacy and the procedural efficiency, I think it's going to pull more people in who are currently indicated. And then also believe that there's a real opportunity to drive further use of this, the patients with persistent atrial fibrillation, where frankly, conventional thermal ablation results are marginal at best. And it's one of the reasons we're so excited about the ADVANTAGE trial that we recently began enrollment in the United States, which is aimed at getting approval and indication for Farawave for persistent atrial fibrillation as well as paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.\nDanielle Antalffy: Okay. And then my question on Watchman is just really around -- on a similar vein, sort of what we're seeing from a market growth perspective there because really strong numbers. Hard to parse out what backlog, what's underlying growth but it's been growing quite helpfully for a while with a competitor launching in the U.S. Just curious what you're seeing from a market growth acceleration perspective on Watchman?\nMichael Mahoney: Sure. I would say we call the market 25-percent-ish growth. So very, very strong as it continues to get more and more scale. I think it's important to note that we believe our share is maintained at least flat, if not actually increased over the past 6 months. So our teams in the U.S. have done a very, very excellent job commercially with the Watchman FLX product. So we continue to see this to be a plus 20%, 25% market grower for a number of years here. And then we have these very groundbreaking trials with Option, with CHAMPION, and we just highlighted [ LOUS 4 ], which will follow those. So we're very committed to the market developments of this category and expanding the indication over time through these clinical trials, assuming that they're positive. And I think just as importantly, we look to continue that momentum with our product cadence. We have a differentiated steerable sheath that will be approved in the coming 9 months. And then our third generation Watchman product which should be launching kind of around this time next year or first quarter next year. So we've got the portfolio and the clinical work to continue to expand the market, and the team is doing an excellent job globally.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Cecilia Furlong from Morgan Stanley.\nCecilia Furlong: And also, echoing my congrats on the quarter. I wanted to ask specifically just your comments on pain and SCS. Really what you saw in the quarter, especially as it pertains to recent headwinds [indiscernible]? And then just your outlook in terms of underlying market growth, do we see some recapture in 1Q? Was that part of the strength? And how you're thinking about underlying market growth going forward?\nMichael Mahoney: Sure. In the first quarter, we did see an improvement out of that global business. The overall business grew 14%, led by our deep brain simulation business, had a terrific quarter. And spinal cord's tended fine, about 9%. So in the quarter, there definitely was some improvement in staffing which likely helped the entire market and the Neuromod business. And as we said, there are some slightly favorable comps as well in the quarter comparing to the '21, the COVID year. But overall, we expect that business and the pain size to grow above market and the brain side, DBS, significantly above market. And we're very excited about this new STIMVIEW capability. The one challenge with that deep brain stimulation, it's an excellent procedure, but it's -- it takes quite a bit of time and a lot of coordination between neurologists, implanting physicians, the patient, and we believe the software enhancement will continue to improve the productivity and cycle time for patients. So overall, I think it's too early to call what we think the market will be for spinal cord stim for the full year. We still would say maybe mid-single digits kind of 5%, 6% is where we would land if you force us to give you a number now.\nCecilia Furlong: Great. And if I could just quickly follow up on China. Some of your comments, what you saw in the quarter coming in ahead of expectations. How should we think about really just the rest of the '23 in terms of pent-up demand, backlog procedures and then also what you've seen to date with Watchman in the region?\nMichael Mahoney: Yes. China catches up to everything quickly. So there was an impact early in the quarter with COVID procedures, and they clogged that back very quickly in the second half of the quarter. So we do expect double-digit growth in China despite some of the pricing pressure consistent with previous years, really based on the strength of the overall portfolio there and continuing to expand our capabilities. We're excited about this Acotec agreements where we own 60% of Acotec, which is a local China company that's the leader in drug-coated balloons in the region as well as many other peripheral and potentially cardiology procedures. So we think that strategic alliance will also help us and help them and we continue to expect double-digit growth in China. And Watchman, I have the exact numbers. Doing fine in China and we can provide more details in the future. But that FLX is approved, I believe, isn't it?\nLauren Tengler: Yes, and good quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Taylor from Jefferies.\nMatthew Taylor: So great result. I guess what I'm struggling to understand is, obviously, you saw strong demand in the quarter. And I think we're seeing a lot of macro things improving like staffing, et cetera. I mean could it actually theoretically get better sequentially? Or why are we thinking so conservatively? Do you think that the direction of travel could be positive, negative or neutral? And what are some of the background thoughts that you would base that on?\nMichael Mahoney: Well, I would say, again, we're super proud of the quarter. We exceeded, we believe, the peer group and did well across every region. I won't go through every one. And we do think there are -- despite it being a 9.7% comp, again, it's off of a lighter '21. So we do think there is some comp benefit there despite it showing a 9.7% if you look at the number. But that doesn't take away from the excellent performance in the quarter overall as you compare to our peers. So I just think it would be not prudent for us to assume the same market growth for the remainder of the year when traditionally, this has been a, call it, 6.5% markets that we serve in. And over time, you're going to see that served market growth continue to expand like we have every couple of years based on our portfolio. So to say that the market's kind of jumped from 6% to 10% over the last 6 months probably isn't feasible. So we think that the markets are healthy. We still think the market's growth is kind of 6% to 7% where we serve. And those will hopefully increase over time as our strategy continues to play out, but it's too soon to call the first quarter performance for the market lapping every quarter.\nMatthew Taylor: Yes. And then, Mike, just a follow-up on that. I mean, thinking ahead to 2024, if we do have some, let's call it, super normal growth this year, some catch-up or whatever, do you still think that you can grow in kind of the LRP range in 2024 over what could be a tough comp in 2023 if things play out well?\nDaniel Brennan: I would attend our Investor Day. We'll give you a sense then of what we think the LRP is for '24, '25 and '26. We'll see how this year plays out over the next few quarters. But I would imagine, as we have at prior Investor Days, we'll give you a good sense there about what we think the next 3 years look like.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Matt Miksic from Barclays.\nMatthew Miksic: So a question for Dan. And then just a couple of follow-ups on some of the product lines here we haven't yet talked about so much on the call. So for Dan, free cash flow conversion. Could you talk maybe a little bit about where you're at now, where you want to be and what some of the challenges are currently, supply chain or whatever else has been more challenging and how you're kind of tackling those? And as I mentioned, I just have one other follow-up.\nDaniel Brennan: Sure. I think I would say I'm not where I want to be yet on free cash flow conversion. It's a key focus item for us. Some things are structural and some are probably a bit more transient and focused on working capital. The foundational ones are as an acquisitive company, and we're going to continue, obviously, over time to be acquiring companies. We're going to have integration costs. So that's a cost that kind of gets in the way of free cash flow conversion. We have had in the past, we've had litigation challenges. I think those are waning over time here. That's a good thing. So that's one less thing that will get in the way of that. We have restructuring as well. So restructuring charges, I think good hygiene of a company to continue to drive out continuous improvement and drive out unnecessary costs. So I think those are still going to be there. So from a foundational perspective, those are a bit challenging relative to the difference between operating cash flow and adjusted cash flow. On the working capital side, the things that we really focus on there relative to receivables and payables, inventory, have a real maniacal focus inside the company to continue to make those -- continue to be in our favor. So some things are structural relative to how the differences between operational and adjusted free cash flow. Others have our focus. But the takeaway is, we are probably not where I want to be, but focused on improving that over time.\nMatthew Miksic: Great. And then maybe a follow-up for Mike. So Interventional Oncology, we talk to clinicians that business just seems to be growing at very healthy kind of rates in these centers. So just any quick color or comment on what Obsidio could mean to that business? And then similarly, stone management, very strong. Maybe if you could talk a little bit about how the Lumines acquisition is kind of dovetailing there and what the impact of this new single-use scope could be to the LithoVue Elite?\nMichael Mahoney: Yes, Matt, thank you, first of all, for bringing up these other businesses that are over $2 billion and growing very fast and accretive to our margin profile overall. Farapulse, we love, but sometimes it drowns out everything else we're doing as a company. . On PI, Interventional Oncology, so pleased with overall that BTG acquisition after we -- it's been integrated very well. Jeff Mirviss, Peter Patt and the team do a really nice job with that. We continue to take core share with Y90. The cryo product that we have has been a surprise for us, does extremely well globally. And this Obsidio should be, again, another differentiated product to round out that portfolio even further. It just speaks to the category leadership focus that we have as a company. So we're very well positioned from a portfolio standpoint. The team is also pushing for new clinical indications. It's very early. They won't be impacted in the LRP, but we think Y90 and other therapies can be used outside their current indications, and we hope to prove that through our clinical science over the coming 5 years. So we want to invest long term there. So we see a bright future overall for Interventional Oncology, and we're positioned well. And the same goes for the -- similar words, although be it different products for urology. We're the clear global leader here. The team has taken LithoVue, the single-use scope and pioneered that and really want to continue to pioneer that industry and tie in our pressure sensor, other AI algorithms and fluid management to create a smarter, more efficient system that's more productive for the doctor and the staff and have better outcomes for patients. So we call that StoneSmart and that's a multiyear journey that the team continues to execute well on. So I think that differentiated product as well as the other key components of that urology business make Boston really a preferred partner for most customers. We have to earn that every day with our clinical people and our smart contracting, but we have a very robust portfolio to serve that call point.\nOperator: And our final question today comes from Chris Pasquale from Nephron.\nChristopher Pasquale: And sorry, Mike, but I'm going to go back to Farapulse real quick here to finish up. Just and I want to ask a couple of follow-ups on the MANIFEST study. First, do you think 80% efficacy in paroxysmal patients is a realistic goal for Advent? Or should we keep in mind any important differences in endpoints or trial design? And then second, I was struck by the relatively low use of mapping in Europe today. How important do you think Rhythmia integration is to the long-term outlook of Farapulse? And how are you thinking about the regulatory pathway and timing to achieve that?\nKen Stein: Yes, Chris. I'll take MANIFEST first and then say a few words about where we think we need to be in terms of mapping. And so I mean, as you said in the question, there were some very important differences in trial design between our Advent study and what you saw in MANIFEST. And some towards the positive, some towards the negative. There are differences actual definition of endpoints. So in MANIFEST, that 80% number that you cite allowed for patients to still be on previously an effective antiarrhythmic drug over the course of the year that would not count as a success in Advent. And the actual -- just the monitoring strategy in Advent is a lot more intensive than it was in a registry like MANIFEST. On the other hand of that is that MANIFEST is the first broad rollout and real-world commercial experience as opposed to just going to some highly selected clinical trial sites. I think what I'd urge on Advent, really the importance is the comparison in the randomized trial against thermal ablation techniques. The trial, right, is designed as a non-inferiority trial. We would have had to design a much larger trial to be able to use superiority as a primary endpoint, although if we hit non-inferiority, we're allowed to test for superiority. But really, the goal in Advent is, again, to get regulatory approval based on non-inferiority versus thermal techniques. And then let's look at a real-world use. Let's see if we can duplicate results like the MANIFEST results in the United States. On mapping, I think we anticipate in the United States, we'll see more use of mapping than we see in Europe for the obvious economic reasons. Having said that, right, for paroxysmal Afib, where you're just doing pulmonary vein isolation, it's pretty clear that you don't have the map to have a successful procedure with Farapulse and the MANIFEST results speak for themselves in that regard. And I'd expect things to split out pretty much the same way they do with Cryoablation. When you go beyond that, though, I think there will be more of a tendency to want to map those cases. And so we will have a second-generation Farawave catheter that will be integrated with the RHYTHMIA system, but we're never going to force people to use Rhythmia. We're always going to maintain it as an open system. You can map with whatever system you want, although we believe with some of the enhancements we're going to bring out, it's going to drive a lot of folks to want to use Rhythmia when they want to map Farawave case.\nLauren Tengler: Thank you, Dr. Stein, and thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Boston Scientific. If we are unable to get to your question or if you have any follow-up, please don't hesitate to reach out the Investor Relations team.

            "name": "Michael Mahoney",
            "content": "Thanks, Lauren, and thank you to everyone, for joining us today. Our first quarter performance exceeded our expectations across all business units and regions, which is a testament to the winning spirit of our global team and the relentless focus on innovation and execution, and we also launched more than 70 new products globally in 2022. In the first quarter 2023, total company operational sales grew 15% versus 2022, while organic sales grew 14%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of 6% to 8%. We believe that all business units grew faster than their respective markets with differentiated portfolios and a strong commercial execution, supported by healthy procedural demand. First quarter EPS of $0.47 grew 19% versus 2022, exceeding the high end of the guidance range of $0.42 to $0.44. First quarter adjusted operating margin was 25.5%, which is in line with expectations. Now for our 2023 guidance. For second quarter '23, organic revenue, we're guiding to growth of 7% to 9% and full year organic growth of 8% to 10%. Our second quarter '23 adjusted EPS estimate is $0.48 to $0.50. And we're guiding to a full year adjusted EPS range of $1.90 to $1.96. I'll provide additional highlights on first quarter, along with comments on our 2023 outlook, and Dan will provide more details on the financials. Regionally, on an operational basis, the U.S. grew 13% versus first quarter '22 inclusive of 140 basis point tailwind from the Baylis acquisition with notable strength -- with notable organic strength across all our business units. Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 20% on an operational basis versus first quarter '22 with nearly every market growing double digits in the quarter. This strong above-market growth is driven by our diverse portfolio, new launches and commercial execution with healthy underlying market demand. We remain excited about the year ahead and expect to continue to outpace our peers within the EMEA market. Asia Pac grew 15% operationally versus first quarter '22 with broad-based strength across all major markets and business units. Within the quarter, we're pleased to have received Health Sciences Authority approval for Farapulse in Singapore, expanding access of this innovative new technology to more patients. In Japan, first quarter growth was fueled by the launch of AGENT, drug coated balloon, a differentiated coronary drug-coated balloon for in-stent restenosis and small vessels with physicians pleased with ease of use in balloon deliverability. China also grew double digits in first quarter, ahead of our expectations with solid procedural demand as hospitals work through COVID delayed procedures. Our diverse portfolio in China, commercial execution and supply chain management within the country supported the strong performance in the quarter. In February, we also closed our majority stake investment in Acotec, further expanding our presence in the market, and we continue to expect double-digit growth in China for the full year. I'll now provide some comments on our business units. Urology sales grew 16% organically. All four franchises grew double digits in the quarter with strength in key products, including LithoVue and Rezum. In the U.S., we received FDA clearance and initiated a limited market release for LithoVue Elite, which is a single-use flexible ureteroscope, which incorporates an innovative pressure-sensing capability that will enable physicians to monitor intrarenal pressure during stone removal procedures. Endoscopy sales for the quarter grew 11% organically versus first quarter '22 with broad-based strength across all regions and franchises. Our Single-Use-Imaging franchise grew double digits, so we're pleased to have recently launched our third-generation EXALT-D with improved ergonomic design updates to improve the physician experience. In April, we closed the Apollo Endosurgery acquisition, which furthers our category leadership strategy within the important area of endoluminal surgery. With differentiated technologies like OverStitch and X-Tack along with an entry into the adjacent endobariatric market. Neuromodulation sales grew 14% organically versus first quarter '22. Our pain business grew high single digits in the quarter with strong SCS performance driven by our innovative Alpha portfolio with FAST therapy and our Cognita suite of digital tools supporting patient activation. Our brain franchise grew double digits in the quarter, driven by new product launches, including GUIDE XT, which was developed in collaboration with Brainlab. This revolutionary software provides implanting and managing clinicians the ability to model the effect of a patient simulation ahead of actual programming, which will improve procedural efficiency. In the quarter, peripheral interventions also grew 12% organically versus first quarter '22. Our arterial franchise grew double digits, led by our drug-eluting portfolio, establishing clear leadership in SFA drug elution, further supported by our differentiated Eluvia long-length DES. Our Venous franchise growth was driven by ongoing above-market performance in Varithena. And within the quarter, we launched EKOS Plus in the U.S., which provides more ultrasound power to resolve clot burden more quickly and completely. Our Interventional Oncology franchise grew double digits with strength across the entire portfolio. We look forward to initiating our limited market release in the second quarter for Obsidio, the first conformable embolic indication for the peripheral vasculature. Cardiology delivered another excellent quarter, with operational sales growing 17% and organic sales growing 15% versus first quarter '22. Within cardiology, interventional cardiology therapies, sales grew 13%. Our coronary therapies franchise grew low double digits in first quarter, led by strong performance within our imaging portfolio with particular strength in the U.S. with the ongoing launch of the AVVIGO-II guidance system. Our Structural Heart Valves franchise continues to grow strong double digits, and we're pleased to have completed enrollment on our ACURATE IDE trial and continue to expect to launch ACURATE Neo2 within the U.S. in the second half of 2024. Watchman sales grew 29% organically versus first quarter '22. Demand remains very strong for Watchman FLX, and we now have treated more than 300,000 patients globally since launch. We are proud of our performance to date, and we continue to invest for the future through product innovation, solutions and clinical evidence. Last week, the Population Health Research Institute announced the IDE approval of [ LOUS 4 ], which is a collaborative research study with Boston Scientific that will continue to expand our LAAC clinical evidence. This trial is expected to start in mid-2023 and will complement the existing CHAMPION AF and Option trials. Cardiac Rhythm Management sales grew 8% organically versus first quarter '22. Our Diagnostics franchise grew strong double digits in the quarter with continued momentum across the portfolio. In core CRM, both our high-voltage and low-voltage businesses grew mid-single digits. And we believe that all major markets were in line or slightly above market growth. We do expect our core CM growth to taper closer to market growth for the remainder of '23 as replacement tailwinds neutralize. Electrophysiology sales grew 54% operationally and 31% organically versus first quarter '22. Our international EP business grew 40%. And importantly, the EMEA region grew our EP business 57%, driven by strong adoption of Farapulse and POLARx. We continue to invest in the expansion of our portfolio and received approval in Japan, Canada and Europe for POLARx FIT, which is an expandable balloon catheter, capable of creating 28- and 31-millimeter sizes, providing procedural adaptability and efficiency. And just last week, 1 year outcomes data from the MANIFEST-PF registry were presented as a late breaker at EHRA. This is the first large real-world dataset on a novel ablation technology, which demonstrated real-world safety, efficacy and efficiency of the Farapulse PFA system. The data also reinforced the minimal learning curve and reproducibility of the Farapulse workflow and everyday commercial use. We continue to advance our clinical evidence within this space and initiate enrollment in our ADVANTAGE AF trial, which is studying the use of Farapulse for patients with persistent atrial fibrillation. We also look forward to the readout of our Advent U.S. ID randomized controlled trial in the second half of this year and continue to expect the approval in the U.S. in '24. We're also very pleased with the performance of our Access Solutions franchise, which grew strong double digits in the first quarter, driven by further penetration into transseptal crossing procedures. Last week, we released our '22 performance report, outlining our environmental, social and governance results. We are pleased with the progress our global teams have made to advance sustainable innovation while contributing to a healthier planet, addressing in equities and supporting communities around the world. We have much more to do, and our values-based culture will serve us well as we continue to transform lives and hold ourselves accountable to our commitments. We are confident the year ahead will bring many more exciting milestones across each of our business units, and we remain committed to our financial goals of consistently growing faster than our underlying markets and our peer group, expanding operating margins and delivering double-digit adjusted EPS growth with strong free cash flow generation. We also look forward to hosting our hybrid Investor Day event on September 20. With that, I'll pass it off to Dan to provide more details on the financials. Sure, Robbie. Thanks for the question. I'll -- second one is easier for me then I'll do the first one. On the second one on M&A, as you know, we've been consistent over the years. As a matter of practice, we never comment on rumors or speculation in the marketplace. On the first question, really proud just of the global performance really across the board. If you look at on the regional side, as I mentioned in the script there, U.S. grew 13%. I think it's really important to note that Europe grew 20%, and Asia Pac grew 15%. So it wasn't one region or one business. It really was across the board performance. And it's encouraging in Europe, in particular, where we have an impressive product line in our EP portfolio and in our TAVI portfolio that's not launched yet in the U.S., which I think is a good signal for the future, as you'll hear about more in Investor Day, as well as in Japan, where we have our POLARx product approved in Japan, but not approved in the U.S. So the fact that the U.S. put up a double-digit number, albeit on some softer comps, as you said, given then the COVID impact. The European and Asia Pac performance is really impressive, and LatAm. And those products -- many of those products are not yet approved in the U.S. So overall, really pleased. You saw almost every business unit grew double digits. But I think, more importantly, not all of our competitors have reported yet, but we'd be surprised if we didn't exceed the peer group across each one of our businesses. So the execution of the team is very -- quite strong. And also, I would say the -- there were clearly some underlying market improvement in first quarter. You saw the public hospitals report, good patient volume, particularly good outpatient volume, which is a good indicator for Boston Scientific, given our portfolio. Nursing shortage is still a challenge for sure, but has improved. And the hospitals being very efficient. So the underlying backdrop for procedure volume demand has improved and is strong and our portfolio really meets the moment around the world. So we're really pleased with the overall performance. Sure. On the first one, Joanne, wish we could give you a perfect scientific response to your question on the overall market. I would say it's a healthy market for all the factors that you just indicated. There are some easier comps. Our comp for Q1 was -- it was 9.7%, but that was based on COVID impacted 2021. So maybe the comps are a little bit easier, but clearly, the procedure volume is stronger, as I mentioned, with the hospitals that have reported. The outpatient momentum is quite strong, which fits our portfolio. And we've got a very strong portfolio cadence across the world right now. So I think it's really all those things that contribute to a very strong first quarter and the increase in the guide that we gave for the full year. We typically have said previously that the markets that we serve grow kind of plus 6% in that range. Clearly, the market grew faster than that in the first quarter. But we're not quite ready to call this exceptionally strong market growth for the full year. We think that would be premature to do that and not responsible. So that's why we gave the guidance that we did of the 8% to 10% full year because we do see strong underlying market demand but it may not be quite as strong as we saw in the first quarter, and we'll see as the year goes on. On Farapulse, I was at that EHRA meeting in Europe just last week, and the enthusiasm for Farapulse is very unique, I would say. The MANIFEST data was excellent. And Dr. Stein is here. Can you remind us when the -- when do we expect the trial to read out? Sorry, I didn't hear the question? Well, for Farapulse? Yes. So Farapulse, we broke out the #4 in Europe, which is 57%, I believe. Yes. And that includes POLARx, which makes a very strong contribution, and we expect approvals for POLARx in the U.S. the second half of this year. And we do expect POLARx to be a nice part of our portfolio globally for many, many years. So that's having a nice contribution, and Farapulse is having an outweighted contribution despite some still limitations in supply. So customer demand is outpacing supply, I would say, still at this moment. But clearly, there's a lot of enthusiasm. You saw the MANIFEST trial data in terms of the safety, the efficacy and the procedure, the productivity has clearly been differentiated. So we'll continue to report our progress in EP, but the momentum in Europe is quite strong, and that's why we called that number out for you. Well, Dan is a smart guy, and he wouldn't have said that unless he meant it. And so I certainly support that. And we'll lay it out more at Investor Day. But just overall, you see the strength of our businesses really across the board, and the portfolio mix continues to help us. It's what we purposely designed and executed on for many, many quarters in a row. Our businesses in the slower growth markets continue to get smaller and smaller as a percent of our sales, and we continue to layer on faster growth markets and better innovation that also help us with the pricing. And you're very aware of many of our key products that are launched outside the U.S. that are not in the U.S. that we can make very -- that we can make very nice gross margins and at high customer demand. So we look forward to bringing those to the U.S. and we'll also tell you about some other products or capabilities that may lie outside our 3-year LRP. But we'll share all that at Investor Day, but we're very excited about the future of the company. Yes. We do expect that to dramatically improve prior to having U.S. approval, primarily because we will bring in -- we have really important strategic contractors that we have very long-term contracts in place with, were a very much part of our solution. But we're also, in parallel, have internal capabilities that we're ramping up. And so both those things will continue to happen for many, many years. But we do expect, particularly in the second half of '22 -- of '23, I'm sorry, to have enhanced console supply to meet the demand. And we expect by the time the U.S. approval that we'll have significantly more capabilities in this area. So I guess for that reason, it's the only reason why we're happy about the timeline and the slight delay in the U.S. with the trials to ramp up our production. But we expect to be able to meet that demand in the U.S. when we get approval. I will take the second one... As a matter of practice, Larry, we don't comment on rumors or speculation. I will comment on -- we did comment on the closing of Apollo in the quarter, which is really going to be a nice asset for us, endoscopy, expand our endoluminal presence and a nice continued focus on category leadership. So we -- our venture portfolio, we've signed Acotec or closed the Acotec deal this year. We had closed the Apollo deal. But like we always said, any future deal speculation, as a matter of practice, we don't comment on. Sure. I would say we call the market 25-percent-ish growth. So very, very strong as it continues to get more and more scale. I think it's important to note that we believe our share is maintained at least flat, if not actually increased over the past 6 months. So our teams in the U.S. have done a very, very excellent job commercially with the Watchman FLX product. So we continue to see this to be a plus 20%, 25% market grower for a number of years here. And then we have these very groundbreaking trials with Option, with CHAMPION, and we just highlighted [ LOUS 4 ], which will follow those. So we're very committed to the market developments of this category and expanding the indication over time through these clinical trials, assuming that they're positive. And I think just as importantly, we look to continue that momentum with our product cadence. We have a differentiated steerable sheath that will be approved in the coming 9 months. And then our third generation Watchman product which should be launching kind of around this time next year or first quarter next year. So we've got the portfolio and the clinical work to continue to expand the market, and the team is doing an excellent job globally. Sure. In the first quarter, we did see an improvement out of that global business. The overall business grew 14%, led by our deep brain simulation business, had a terrific quarter. And spinal cord's tended fine, about 9%. So in the quarter, there definitely was some improvement in staffing which likely helped the entire market and the Neuromod business. And as we said, there are some slightly favorable comps as well in the quarter comparing to the '21, the COVID year. But overall, we expect that business and the pain size to grow above market and the brain side, DBS, significantly above market. And we're very excited about this new STIMVIEW capability. The one challenge with that deep brain stimulation, it's an excellent procedure, but it's -- it takes quite a bit of time and a lot of coordination between neurologists, implanting physicians, the patient, and we believe the software enhancement will continue to improve the productivity and cycle time for patients. So overall, I think it's too early to call what we think the market will be for spinal cord stim for the full year. We still would say maybe mid-single digits kind of 5%, 6% is where we would land if you force us to give you a number now. Yes. China catches up to everything quickly. So there was an impact early in the quarter with COVID procedures, and they clogged that back very quickly in the second half of the quarter. So we do expect double-digit growth in China despite some of the pricing pressure consistent with previous years, really based on the strength of the overall portfolio there and continuing to expand our capabilities. We're excited about this Acotec agreements where we own 60% of Acotec, which is a local China company that's the leader in drug-coated balloons in the region as well as many other peripheral and potentially cardiology procedures. So we think that strategic alliance will also help us and help them and we continue to expect double-digit growth in China. And Watchman, I have the exact numbers. Doing fine in China and we can provide more details in the future. But that FLX is approved, I believe, isn't it? Well, I would say, again, we're super proud of the quarter. We exceeded, we believe, the peer group and did well across every region. I won't go through every one. And we do think there are -- despite it being a 9.7% comp, again, it's off of a lighter '21. So we do think there is some comp benefit there despite it showing a 9.7% if you look at the number. But that doesn't take away from the excellent performance in the quarter overall as you compare to our peers. So I just think it would be not prudent for us to assume the same market growth for the remainder of the year when traditionally, this has been a, call it, 6.5% markets that we serve in. And over time, you're going to see that served market growth continue to expand like we have every couple of years based on our portfolio. So to say that the market's kind of jumped from 6% to 10% over the last 6 months probably isn't feasible. So we think that the markets are healthy. We still think the market's growth is kind of 6% to 7% where we serve. And those will hopefully increase over time as our strategy continues to play out, but it's too soon to call the first quarter performance for the market lapping every quarter. Yes, Matt, thank you, first of all, for bringing up these other businesses that are over $2 billion and growing very fast and accretive to our margin profile overall. Farapulse, we love, but sometimes it drowns out everything else we're doing as a company. . On PI, Interventional Oncology, so pleased with overall that BTG acquisition after we -- it's been integrated very well. Jeff Mirviss, Peter Patt and the team do a really nice job with that. We continue to take core share with Y90. The cryo product that we have has been a surprise for us, does extremely well globally. And this Obsidio should be, again, another differentiated product to round out that portfolio even further. It just speaks to the category leadership focus that we have as a company. So we're very well positioned from a portfolio standpoint. The team is also pushing for new clinical indications. It's very early. They won't be impacted in the LRP, but we think Y90 and other therapies can be used outside their current indications, and we hope to prove that through our clinical science over the coming 5 years. So we want to invest long term there. So we see a bright future overall for Interventional Oncology, and we're positioned well. And the same goes for the -- similar words, although be it different products for urology. We're the clear global leader here. The team has taken LithoVue, the single-use scope and pioneered that and really want to continue to pioneer that industry and tie in our pressure sensor, other AI algorithms and fluid management to create a smarter, more efficient system that's more productive for the doctor and the staff and have better outcomes for patients. So we call that StoneSmart and that's a multiyear journey that the team continues to execute well on. So I think that differentiated product as well as the other key components of that urology business make Boston really a preferred partner for most customers. We have to earn that every day with our clinical people and our smart contracting, but we have a very robust portfolio to serve that call point."

            "name": "Ken Stein",
            "content": "Yes. So our U.S. IDE trial, Joanne, is Advent. It's the most rigorous trial that anyone's done in this space. It's a double-lined randomized trial against conventional thermal ablation. Continue to expect to present that data second half of this year, submit to the FDA at the same time. So again, continue to anticipate U.S. approval in '24. Yes. Thanks, Larry... Take the second one. And then, Larry, on sort of the evolution of Farapulse. We certainly are looking at alternate catheter form factors. And sort of as you mentioned, there are a lot of different things that you can do with pulse field energy and with the Farawave platform or Farapulse platform. I do think it's important, though, as you think through that to think through the different use cases. And so for atrial fibrillation, whether it's paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, where really the goal of therapy is just pulmonary vein isolation or whether it's persistent atrial fibrillation where you may very well need to go beyond that, do pulmonary vein isolation plus posterior wall isolation, which we're investigating right now in our ADVANTAGE trial. And as Mike noted in his prepared remarks, we've already begun enrollment in that trial and really our -- I'd say, beyond pleased, at the excitement at the rate at which we're enrolling in that trial. When you think about both of those use cases, right, it's our belief -- and in fact, the data that you've seen from things like Manifest supports that belief that the Farawave catheter itself is uniquely well suited among all the competing technologies for achieving those goals. So again, when you think about AF ablation, right, we think that the Farawave catheter is the best of the catheter form factors out there. And then when you couple that with the waveform that we deliver, when you couple that with the dosing protocol that we've optimized over the many years of preclinical and clinical research that Farapulse did and that we've continued since the acquisition, we are really satisfied with that as the catheter that's going to be preferred for AFib ablation. And then it's adding on like some of these other form factors that you talk about as we think about some of the smaller use cases beyond the AFib market. Vijay, it's Ken. Let me start with a question about Farapulse and Farawave and really answer in two parts, right? So the first part, so the current catheter that we have approved in the CE Mark countries and as Mike said, in Singapore, and that we're evaluating the U.S. in the Advent trial, is a \"single-shot catheter\". So it's not a point-by-point ablation catheter. And as I said to Larry, it's a catheter form factor that really is uniquely well suited for pulmonary vein isolation and for posterior wall isolation. And again, we firmly believe that this is the best form factor out there than for tackling the vast majority of patients are undergoing atrial fibrillation ablation. Now having said that, and I think sort of the proof behind that is when you look at our commercial release in Europe, we are taking share both from centers that were \"single-shot centers\", so the cryo users, but also taking share from folks who were very well known in the field for their point-by-point RF ablation. I'd say we've really been impressed and pleased at the way we're converting folks who were point-by-point users into PFA and that's based on the safety, based on the efficacy and also, frankly, based on the efficiency of ablation with Farawave. Yes. Sure, Danielle. I guess I'll take that first one, and we'll see on the follow-up. I mean the easy answer to what your question was, is yes. We do see Farapulse accelerating adoption of AF ablation. AF, right, is the most common sustained arrhythmia that's seen globally. In fact, ablation today for current indications is still very much underpenetrated. It's underpenetrated for a couple of reasons, right? And one is safety concerns around the procedure. One is just the skill level and the relative inefficiency of AF ablations today using thermal energy. So I think, first of all, with the Farapulse system with Farawave and again, the safety the efficacy and the procedural efficiency, I think it's going to pull more people in who are currently indicated. And then also believe that there's a real opportunity to drive further use of this, the patients with persistent atrial fibrillation, where frankly, conventional thermal ablation results are marginal at best. And it's one of the reasons we're so excited about the ADVANTAGE trial that we recently began enrollment in the United States, which is aimed at getting approval and indication for Farawave for persistent atrial fibrillation as well as paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Yes, Chris. I'll take MANIFEST first and then say a few words about where we think we need to be in terms of mapping. And so I mean, as you said in the question, there were some very important differences in trial design between our Advent study and what you saw in MANIFEST. And some towards the positive, some towards the negative. There are differences actual definition of endpoints. So in MANIFEST, that 80% number that you cite allowed for patients to still be on previously an effective antiarrhythmic drug over the course of the year that would not count as a success in Advent. And the actual -- just the monitoring strategy in Advent is a lot more intensive than it was in a registry like MANIFEST. On the other hand of that is that MANIFEST is the first broad rollout and real-world commercial experience as opposed to just going to some highly selected clinical trial sites. I think what I'd urge on Advent, really the importance is the comparison in the randomized trial against thermal ablation techniques. The trial, right, is designed as a non-inferiority trial. We would have had to design a much larger trial to be able to use superiority as a primary endpoint, although if we hit non-inferiority, we're allowed to test for superiority. But really, the goal in Advent is, again, to get regulatory approval based on non-inferiority versus thermal techniques. And then let's look at a real-world use. Let's see if we can duplicate results like the MANIFEST results in the United States. On mapping, I think we anticipate in the United States, we'll see more use of mapping than we see in Europe for the obvious economic reasons. Having said that, right, for paroxysmal Afib, where you're just doing pulmonary vein isolation, it's pretty clear that you don't have the map to have a successful procedure with Farapulse and the MANIFEST results speak for themselves in that regard. And I'd expect things to split out pretty much the same way they do with Cryoablation. When you go beyond that, though, I think there will be more of a tendency to want to map those cases. And so we will have a second-generation Farawave catheter that will be integrated with the RHYTHMIA system, but we're never going to force people to use Rhythmia. We're always going to maintain it as an open system. You can map with whatever system you want, although we believe with some of the enhancements we're going to bring out, it's going to drive a lot of folks to want to use Rhythmia when they want to map Farawave case."

            "content": "Thanks, Mike. First quarter consolidated revenue of $3.389 billion represents 12% reported revenue growth versus first quarter 2022 and reflects an $88 million headwind from foreign exchange, slightly favorable to our expectations with continued volatility in foreign exchange rates throughout the quarter. . Excluding this 290 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, operational revenue growth was 14.9% in the quarter. Sales from the acquisition of Baylis through mid-February contributed 90 basis points, resulting in 14% organic revenue growth, nicely exceeding our guidance range of 6% to 8%. Strong revenue performance resulted in Q1 adjusted earnings per share of $0.47, again, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.42 to $0.44 and representing growth of 19.2% versus 2022. Adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 70.4%. We continue to expect full year 2023 gross margin to include a similar level of macroeconomic and supply chain headwinds as 2022 and expect a sequential improvement in Q2, resulting in a first half 2023 gross margin that is higher than the second half of 2023, largely due to the timing of foreign exchange movements in 2022. First quarter adjusted operating margin was 25.5%. We continue to prioritize operating margin expansion and are maintaining our full year 2023 goal of approximately 26.4% adjusted operating margin, representing 80 basis points of improvement versus the full year 2022. On a GAAP basis, the first quarter operating margin was 16.3%. Moving to below the line. First quarter adjusted interest and other expense totaled $78 million, slightly favorable to expectations due to gains on certain unhedged currencies. On an adjusted basis, our tax rate for the first quarter was 12.8%, including discrete tax items and the benefit from stock compensation accounting, slightly higher than expectations due to the timing of certain discrete tax items. Our operational tax rate was 13.8% for the first quarter in line with our full year expectations of approximately 14%. Fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding ended at 1.446 billion shares in Q1. Free cash flow for the quarter was $83 million, with $190 million from operating activities, less $108 million net capital expenditures. Excluding payments related to acquisitions, restructuring and other special items, adjusted free cash flow was $229 million. We continue to aim for full year 2023 adjusted free cash flow in excess of $2.3 billion. As of March 31, 2023, we had cash on hand of $570 million, which in accordance with accounting standards for less than wholly owned subsidiaries includes the cash balance from Acotec of approximately $140 million following the completion of our majority stake investment. As of March 31, our leverage was 2.5x, in line with our expectations. I'll now walk through guidance for Q2 and the full year 2023. We expect full year 2023 operational revenue growth to be in a range of 9% to 11%, which excludes an approximate 50 basis point headwind from foreign exchange. Excluding the impact of closed acquisitions, and the recently closed divestiture of our pathology business, which had approximately $24 million revenue in 2022, we expect full year 2023 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 8% to 10% versus 2022. We expect second quarter 2023 operational revenue growth to be in a range of 7.5% to 9.5% versus Q2 2022 excluding an approximate 100 basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates. Excluding the contribution from closed acquisitions and divestitures, we expect second quarter 2023 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 7% to 9%. We expect our full year 2023 adjusted below-the-line expenses to be approximately $340 million. We continue to expect our full year 2023 operational tax rate to be approximately 14%, with an adjusted tax rate of approximately 13% under current legislation and forecasted geographic mix of sales. We expect a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1.458 billion shares for Q2 2023 and 1.464 billion shares for full year 2023, which includes the 23.98 million shares we expect to issue based on our current stock price on June 1, 2023, upon the conversion of our mandatory convertible preferred stock. We expect the impact to adjusted earnings per share to be neutral with the approximately $14 million quarterly preferred stock dividend ending at the time of conversion. We expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.90 to $1.96, representing 11% to 15% growth versus 2022, which we believe delivers top-tier financial performance. We continue to anticipate a neutral impact from FX on full year 2023 adjusted earnings per share. We expect second quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.48 to $0.50. For more information, please check our Investor Relations website for Q1 2023 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more details on Q1 results and 2023 guidance. Before I turn the call over for a few upcoming events, to note: we will be hosting our Annual Shareholder Meeting on May 4 at 8:00 a.m. Eastern and our Q2 2023 earnings call on Thursday, July 27, at 7:30 a.m. Eastern. With that, I'll turn it back to Lauren, who will moderate the Q&A. And then specific to Q2, Robbie, just to double-click a bit on that. As Mike said, relative to CRM, that grew 8% in the quarter. We had talked about at the beginning of the year, that kind of growing at market, lower single digits. . We have some replacement trends that start to get a little bit more challenging. So that 8% probably a bit outsized for what we're expecting there. And then Neuromod, as you look at that, that's a business that over the last many quarters has been kind of in that low single-digit range and to pop of 14, that's great in the quarter. But I think a little early to call the ball on that market and say that it's fully recovered. So just the 7% to 9%, I think, is appropriately prudent for second quarter guidance. Sure, Travis. I think I can probably take both of those. Capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. It's been an equation that's worked well for us for many years here relative to capital allocation. So first priority is high-quality tuck-in adjacent type growth M&A. And Mike just gave you a couple of examples of those that we've closed this year. And then we fill in on the back with any excess cash for share repurchase. And as you know, obviously don't pay dividend this time. So I think that's clear. With respect to the drop-through in the quarter, as I look at it, we kind of beat the midpoint of the range and the consensus by $200 million. You drop that through at our overall margin percentage and you get to about $0.02 to $0.03 of additional adjusted EPS, you would have expected. We delivered 3.5%. I think that's kind of in that range. We're at 25.5% adjusted operating margin. I think that puts us right in place to achieve that 26.4% for the year. So I think all is well relative to the margin profile. And the 26.4%, again, it would be 80 basis points on top of last year, which I think gives us a bit of a differentiated expansion versus our peer set. And then relative to your specific question on leverage, I'd say it's been a focused and intentional journey for us to get back to BBB+ with all three rating agencies that rate us. And very comfortable there, obviously committed to investment grade and comfortable at that BBB+ rating. I wouldn't comment on specific dilution and this and that. I think from our perspective, relative to the M&A environment. We're committed to looking at deals that are high growth and tuck-in acquisitions as we've done. I would attend our Investor Day. We'll give you a sense then of what we think the LRP is for '24, '25 and '26. We'll see how this year plays out over the next few quarters. But I would imagine, as we have at prior Investor Days, we'll give you a good sense there about what we think the next 3 years look like. Sure. I think I would say I'm not where I want to be yet on free cash flow conversion. It's a key focus item for us. Some things are structural and some are probably a bit more transient and focused on working capital. The foundational ones are as an acquisitive company, and we're going to continue, obviously, over time to be acquiring companies. We're going to have integration costs. So that's a cost that kind of gets in the way of free cash flow conversion. We have had in the past, we've had litigation challenges. I think those are waning over time here. That's a good thing. So that's one less thing that will get in the way of that. We have restructuring as well. So restructuring charges, I think good hygiene of a company to continue to drive out continuous improvement and drive out unnecessary costs. So I think those are still going to be there. So from a foundational perspective, those are a bit challenging relative to the difference between operating cash flow and adjusted cash flow. On the working capital side, the things that we really focus on there relative to receivables and payables, inventory, have a real maniacal focus inside the company to continue to make those -- continue to be in our favor. So some things are structural relative to how the differences between operational and adjusted free cash flow. Others have our focus. But the takeaway is, we are probably not where I want to be, but focused on improving that over time."

Mike?\nMichael Mahoney: Thanks, John. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Our Q3 results exceeded our expectations and we continue to invest in our portfolio and capabilities to deliver differentiated performance over the long-term. In Q3 '24, total company operational sales grew 19% and organic sales grew 18%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of 13% to 15%. Our excellent growth is and will continue to be focused on our category leadership strategy, fueled by innovation, clinical evidence generation and the winning spirit of our global team. Q3 adjusted EPS of $0.63 grew 27%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.57 to $0.59. In Q3, adjusted operating margin was 27.2%. Turning to our fourth quarter and the full year '24 outlook. We're guiding to organic growth of 14% to 16% for fourth quarter and raising our full year guidance to approximately 15%, reflecting momentum across our broad portfolio and particularly in AF solutions. Our fourth quarter adjusted EPS guidance is now $0.64 to $0.66 and we expect our full year adjusted EPS to be $2.45 to $2.47 representing growth of 20% to 21%. Dan will provide more details on our financials in a few minutes and I'll provide additional highlights on our third quarter results, along with our comments and our outlook. Regionally, on an operational basis, the US grew 24% with double-digit growth or higher in six of eight business units. Our EP business continues to deliver impressive performance fueled by FARAPULSE, new account openings and very strong reorder rates. Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 14% on an operational basis. This performance was driven by continued above-market performance in EP, where we continue to expand our PFA leadership, complex PCI and structural heart. In TAVI, we received CE Mark and recently launched our next-generation ACURATE Prime Valve. I also want to announce that following a nearly 30-year career at Boston Scientific, our President of EMEA, Eric Thepaut , will retire in December and Xavier Bertrand, currently the Vice President of Peripheral Interventions in EMEA will be appointed the new President of EMEA. I want to thank Eric for his many significant contributions to the organization and congratulate Xavier on his new role. Asia Pac grew 12% operationally with excellent performance in China, Australia, New Zealand and grew mid-teens despite recent VBP implementations. In Japan, we received PMDA approval of the FARAPULSE PFA system and anticipate reimbursement and commercial launch in the coming weeks. I'll now provide some additional commentary on our business units. Urology sales grew 10% with double-digit growth in Stone Management and Prostate Health, including double-digit growth in both Rezum and SpaceOAR. Within the quarter, we continue to see momentum from the launches of LithoVue Elite and the Tenacio Pump with our AMS 700 device. And looking forward, we expect to close the previously announced acquisition of Axonics in the fourth quarter and we're excited to add this excellent business into Boston Scientific in our Urology business. Endoscopy sales grew 7% organically and 8% operationally with strong growth, particularly in the US. Our anchor products continue to drive above-market growth with AXIOS and Exalt D, both growing double-digits in the quarter. We also continue to see strong double-digit growth in our Endoluminal Surgery franchise. We're pleased to recently received a Category 1 CPT code for the ESG weight loss procedure, which is expected to further momentum within this business. Neuromodulation sales grew 3% organically and 17% operationally including Relievant, which will turn organic in November. Our brains franchise returned to low double-digit growth in the quarter in the US, supported by de novo implants and competitive replacements. Our pain franchise grew low-single-digits organically and double-digits operationally. Our global SCS performance was below our expectations in a market that continues to be challenged, offset by growth in the rest of the pain portfolio, which reflects the value of our category leadership strategy. Peripheral Intervention sales grew 10% organically and 12% operationally. Within our Vascular business, we saw mid-single-digit growth in arterial with continued double-digit growth in Drug-Eluting therapies and low double-digit growth in Venous. We're also pleased to have closed our acquisition of Silk Road Medical in mid-September, adding the innovative TCAR system to our vascular portfolio. Our interventional oncology and embolization franchise grew double-digits again driven by continued momentum from recent launches in embolization and sustained double-digit growth in TheraSphere. Cardiology delivered another exceptional quarter with sales growing 29%. Within Cardiology, Interventional Cardiology Therapies grew 14%. Mid-teens growth in Coronary Therapies was supported by the launch of the US AGENT performance, continued global adoption of coronary imaging with our AVVIGO+ platform and our Calcium portfolio. The US AGENT launch continues to exceed our expectations with both new account openings and strong reorder rates. We also recently commenced enrollment in the aging IDE long lesion substudy and completed enrollment in our Vitalist early feasibility study in high-risk PCI patients. Congratulations to the team on that milestone. Our structural heart valves franchise grew double-digits in the third quarter led by another quarter of above-market growth of ACURATE Neo2 in Europe. In the US, we continue to collaborate with the FDA and our regulatory strategy and data from the US ACURATE IDE will be presented at TCT on October 30. WATCHMAN grew 18% with continued conversion to WATCHMAN FLX Pro in the US and Japan. And globally, we surpassed 500,000 patients treated with the WATCHMAN device, driven by our innovation, clinical evidence and patient awareness efforts. Key near-term catalyst for WATCHMAN drive our confidence in delivering high growth in this business, including the recently implemented DRG for concomitant LAAC and AF ablation. And if positive, the data readout from the OPTION trial, which will be presented as a late-breaking clinical trial at the American Heart Association Conference on November 16th. We also recently commenced enrollment of our SIMPLIFY trial, which studying the less intensive post-procedure drug regimen, enabled by our latest generation WATCHMAN FLX Pro and continue to expect data from the CHAMPION trial in the first half of '26. Cardiac Rhythm Management sales grew 2% in the quarter. In the third quarter, our Diagnostics franchise grew high-single-digits, driven by our implantable cardiac monitors, LUX-Dx, which both received CE Mark within the quarter. In Core CRM, strong international growth was offset by below market growth in the US. We're excited about new and upcoming product launches in this business, including the expanded indication of our INGEVITY lead for conduction system pacing, which received FDA approval in the quarter and our EMPOWUR leadless pacemaker, which we now have submitted to the FDA. Electrophysiology sales grew an exceptional 177% in the quarter, driven by continued commercial execution, pull-through in our Access Solutions business and increased procedure volumes driven by excellent outcomes as well as efficiencies gained with FARAPULSE. We have now treated over 125,000 patients with FARAPULSE, driving rapid and transformative conversion from RF and cryo to PFA, specifically using FARAPULSE. As a result of this accelerated conversion in the market, we now expect PFA to likely exceed our previously communicated range of 40% to 60% of global AF ablations by 2026. We are excited about the recent FARAPULSE approvals in both Japan and China and expect these launches to have a meaningful impact on our global EP business in 2025. Recently, we received USA approval of the FARAWAVE NAV Catheter, which combined with a FARAVIEW Software to visualize cardiac ablation procedures exclusively with our OPAL HDx mapping system. We are pleased to have completed the follow-up Phase I of the ADVANTAGE AF clinical trial, which is evaluating FARAPULSE in the treatment of patients with drug-refractory persistent AF. And we expect to submit the results of the trial to the FDA later this quarter and anticipating presenting the results in early '25 with label expansion expected in the second half of '25. We're also studying in a very new patient population of drug-naive persistent AF patients in AVANT GUARD. As we have neared the end of this enrollment, we have elected to temporarily pause the trial to assess a few unanticipated observations. It is our intention to resume enrollments in the near-term. And based on the totality of clinical evidence and commercial real-world experience, we remain extremely confident in the unique performance of FARAPULSE. In closing, we're very proud of the performance of our global teams and are confident in the sustainability of our top-tier financial performance. With that, I'll hand over to Dan and provide more details on the financials.\nDaniel Brennan: Thanks, Mike. Third quarter 2024 consolidated revenue of $4,209 million represents 19.4% reported growth versus third quarter of 2023 and includes a 10 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, which was favorable versus our expectations. Excluding this $4 million foreign exchange headwind, operational revenue growth was 19.5% in the quarter. Sales impact from closed acquisitions contributed 130 basis points, resulting in 18.2% organic revenue growth, exceeding our third quarter guidance range of 13% to 15%. Q3 2024 adjusted earnings per share of $0.63 grew 27% versus 2023, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.57 to $0.59 primarily driven by our strong sales performance. Adjusted gross margin for the third quarter was 70.4%, slightly lower than anticipated, driven primarily by foreign exchange. We continue to expect second half adjusted gross margin to be higher than the first half and full year adjusted gross margin to be slightly below our 2023 rate. Third quarter adjusted operating margin was 27.2%, which expanded 110 basis points versus the prior year period. Given our strong year-to-date performance, we now expect full year adjusted operating margin to be approximately 27%. We believe this strikes a nice balance of delivering incremental margin from our sales upside and continuing to invest appropriately to drive strong top line performance. On a GAAP basis, third quarter operating margin was 17.4%. Moving to below the line. Third quarter adjusted interest and other expenses totaled $65 million, which was favorable to our expectations primarily due to higher interest income. On an adjusted basis, our tax rate for the third quarter was 13.2%, which includes favorable discrete tax items. Our operational tax rate for the quarter was 13.5%. Fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding ended at 1,487 million in the third quarter. Free cash flow for the third quarter was $822 million, with $1,002 million from operating activities less $180 million in net capital expenditures, which includes payments of $208 million related to acquisitions, restructuring, litigation and other special items. In 2024, we continue to expect full year free cash flow to exceed $2 billion, which includes approximately $900 million of expected payments related to special items. As of September 30th, 2024, we had cash on hand of $2.5 billion, and our gross debt leverage ratio was 2.4 times. Our top capital allocation priority remains strategic tuck-in M&A followed by annual share repurchases to offset dilution from employee stock grants. Our legal reserve was $250 million as of September 30th, roughly flat versus Q2 2024. $53 million of this reserve is already funded through our qualified settlement funds. I'll now walk through guidance for Q4 and full year 2024. We expect full year 2024 reported revenue growth to be approximately 16.5% versus 2023. Excluding an approximate 50 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, based on current rates. We expect full year 2024 operational revenue growth to be approximately 17%. Excluding a 200 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect full year 2024 organic revenue growth to be approximately 15% versus 2023. We expect fourth quarter 2024 reported revenue growth to be in a range of 16.5% to 18.5% versus fourth quarter 2023. Excluding an approximate 50 basis point tailwind from foreign exchange, based on current rates, we expect fourth quarter 2024 operational revenue growth to be 16% to 18% and excluding a 200 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect fourth quarter 2024 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 14% to 16% versus 2023. We continue to expect full year 2024 adjusted below-the-line expenses to be approximately $300 million. We also continue to expect a full year 2024 operational tax rate of approximately 13.5% and an adjusted tax rate of approximately 12.5%, which contemplates current legislation, including enacted laws and issued guidance under OECD Pillar 2 rules. We expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.47 representing growth of 20% to 21% versus 2023, including an approximate $0.04 headwind from foreign exchange, which is unchanged from our previous expectations. We expect fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.64 to $0.66. Before we move to Q&A, I want to provide a few housekeeping items related to 2025 that may be helpful with your modeling. There will be one less business day in 2025, which comes in Q1. Note that in 2024, we have two extra business days versus 2023, one here in Q3 and one upcoming in Q4. Below the line, we expect a meaningful increase versus 2024 related to higher adjusted net interest expense. In 2024, we will earn approximately $100 million of nonrecurring interest income on the cash raised earlier this year to fund the Axonics acquisition, which we expect to close here in the fourth quarter. In 2025, we also have approximately $1.6 billion of bonds coming due, which we expect to look to refinance likely at higher rates than the existing bonds while maintaining our strong balance sheet. The good news is, this incremental expense should largely be offset by the operating income dollars associated with the deals we have closed in 2024 and the expected close of Axonics. Based on current global tax legislation, we expect our tax rate to be in line with our historical rate of approximately 14% operational and 13% adjusted. In 2025, we will aim to outperform our markets, deliver meaningful margin improvement and grow adjusted earnings per share double-digits and faster than sales towards our goal of being the highest performing large-cap medtech company as we said at last year's Investor Day. For more information, check our Investor Relations website for Q3 2024 financial and operational highlights which outlines more details on Q3 results and 2024 guidance. And with that, I'll turn it back to Jon, who'll moderate the Q&A.\nJonathan Monson: Thanks, Dan. Drew, let's open it up for questions for the next 40 minutes or so. In order for us to take as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question. Drew, please go ahead.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRobert Marcus: Great. Good morning and congrats on another fantastic quarter here.\nMichael Mahoney: Thanks, Robbie.\nRobert Marcus: My one question, there's so much to ask about here.\nMichael Mahoney: Make it a good one, Robbie.\nRobert Marcus: In our checks, we hear consistently that the upcoming OPTION trial that we'll see at AHA, combined with the recently started on October 1st reimbursement for concomitant, WATCHMAN and PF ablation has already started to kick in the gear and OPTION could meaningfully alter the usage patterns ahead of CHAMPION in the first half of '26. So I wanted to get your thoughts on the importance of both concomitant and should OPTION be positive what that can mean for both of those franchises, both in the short and long-term? Thanks.\nMichael Mahoney: Sure. I'll comment and Dr. Stein can add probably more helpful color. Clearly, independently, both platforms are doing incredibly well. WATCHMAN on its own with all the clinical evidence, and you saw the amazing results of FARAPULSE today. And doctors are so comfortable with both procedures. It's a very safe procedure. The concomitant reimbursement, we view as quite positive. It's also very positive economic for the hospital, benefits for the patient, the procedure will be performed safety. So we're really pleased with that concomitant. And so it's clearly an ongoing long-term tailwind for WATCHMAN and also further helps FARAPULSE. Both platforms, as you know, have a number of different clinical trials to continue to expand indications. And Dr. Stein, any other comments you'd like to make on it?\nKenneth Stein: No. Sure, Mike. Thanks, Robbie. I again reiterate what Mike said at the outset, right? I mean, the ability to do concomitant procedures and get reimbursed with them under the new CMS DRG, it's one of those things that it's positive for patients, it's positive for the health care system and hospitals and it's certainly positive for us given the unique advantages in doing concomitant procedures when you think of the safety and efficiency of FARAPULSE, and you think of the safety and efficiency and frankly excellent outcomes with FARAPULSE and with WATCHMAN FLX and WATCHMAN FLX Pro. Again, just to give some sense of the importance of this, right, there are approximately 350,000 ablations performed in the US every year for atrial fibrillation. And roughly half of those patients are at high risk of stroke according to things like the CHA2DS2-VASc scoring system. I think we are all anxiously looking forward to see the OPTION data when it gets read out and the impact that will have, I think stating the obvious will depend on what those data show. And if they do show a compelling benefit to WATCHMAN, right, how big is that benefit? And then, again, to reiterate what Mike said, beyond OPTION, we also have the CHAMPION trial. Expecting that trial to read out in early '26, which would look at WATCHMAN versus the new oral anticoagulants in all comers.\nRobert Marcus: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: The next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citi. Please go ahead.\nJoanne Wuensch: Good morning and thank you for the question. I want to talk about the amazing results of FARAPULSE that we just saw. And specifically how you're thinking about moving. I was really interested in one quote that you said to exceed 40% to 60% of global AF procedures by 2026. Thank you.\nMichael Mahoney: Sure. So this has just been a tremendous launch. Just a quick shout out to our operations supply chain team for staying ahead of the manufacturing. Extremely high demand for this product and the excellence that we're seeing in the field by the commercial and clinical teams. So doctors are moving surprisingly quickly towards FARAPULSE, surprisingly to what we thought it would be a year ago. So when we had the Investor Day, we weren't quite sure because we had didn't have approval in the US. We saw excellent momentum in Europe. And now our operations team is scaled to meet the demand. And those same excellent clinical outcomes and procedural efficiencies and safety benefits that patients received in Europe are being felt throughout the world now. We've been planning over 120,000 of them. So that was our point estimate about a year ago or so. And based on the rapid uptake, we're confident in stating that we do expect it to be at the high end and likely exceed that 40% to 60% based on how quickly physicians are transforming, especially for PVI from traditional RF and cryo to FARAPULSE. And it's also been supported by the studies within ADVENT that show the benefits of FARAPULSE versus traditional RF. So it's a great time in the market for the physicians and the patients. And we've also proven based on our competitive launches in Europe who have been out for a while that we clearly are the market leader in PFA and we have lots of plans in place to continue to extend that leadership with clinical differentiation and product enhancements.\nJoanne Wuensch: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nLawrence Biegelsen: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I'll echo my congratulations on a really phenomenal quarter here. Dr. Stein, given the importance of FARAPULSE, can you provide more color on the AVANT GUARD trial and the observations you saw? And related to that, there are going to be more PFA ablation choices soon, including from the market leader. Once these new PFA catheters are launched, what are the factors that will lead existing FARAPULSE customers to stay with FARAPULSE or choose FARAPULSE if they haven't adopted it yet? Thank you.\nKenneth Stein: Yes. Sure, Larry. Let me take those successively. So first, on AVANT GUARD. Again, as Mike said, due to a few unanticipated observations in the trial which is studying a completely new population, which is drug-naive patients with persistent AF, which FARAPULSE is not currently indicated to treat. We did elect to temporarily pause enrollment until we develop better understanding of the observations. While none of the observations were life-threatening, we did make a decision to temporarily pause, but it is our intention to resume enrollments in the near-term. And this in no way at all affects our confidence in the overall performance of the FARAPULSE system as it's being used today commercially or in other clinical trials. Again, as Mike said in his opening comments, we remain confident that we're going to obtain expanded indication for drug-refractory persistent AF patients. And that's the data from our ADVANTAGE Phase I trial. Again, as Mike said, we expect to submit that data to the FDA later this quarter. We expect to present that data in early 2025, with indication expansion expected to come in the second half of 2025. And again, I just want to close by emphasizing that this patient population that we're studying in AVANT GUARD, which is drug-naive persistent AF patients has not previously been studied, it's a population that's not indicated for ablation today under guidelines, and it's not the population that's being treated today with FARAPULSE system. And I also want to emphasize that we remain highly confident in the global performance of FARAPULSE, which has now been used to treat more than 125,000 patients across more than 65 different countries and is supported by extensive clinical data demonstrating positive outcomes for the device. And I think that also leads into your second question, right, which is why is FARAPULSE going to maintain category leadership in Pulsed Field Ablation and what's going to prompt new users to continue to newly adopt the system. And it's several things. I think, first of all, it's just the compelling ease of use and straightforward nature of doing the ablation with FARAPULSE. It's just a tremendous clinical experience that people have when they start using the system. I am not aware of anyone who started using this and then has stopped and gone back to thermal ablation. It's also an extensive clinical trial data that we've got supporting it. As Mike mentioned, right, we had a sub-analysis, the ADVENT data, which is the first data that anyone has had to actually show superiority and efficacy outcomes when we look at AF burden as a secondary analysis of the ADVENT data. It's supported by published clinical data now in approximately 20,000 patients globally. And again, as Mike said, right, in Europe, where we've seen commercial systems launch, right, we really have not seen that meaningfully detract from the position that FARAPULSE has as the leading PFA system in those markets. And then last, just to make sure it doesn't get lost in all the other stuff here, right, the approval and the launch now of FARAWAVE NAV Catheter and FARAVIEW mapping system, which really becomes the first mapping system that's really designed around PFA, I think, provides just maybe it's the cherry on top of that sundae in terms of answering your question.\nLawrence Biegelsen: Thank you so much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Rick Wise with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nFrederick Wise: Thank you, and good morning, everybody. I'm hoping, Mike, that you or Dr. Stein will expand on the NAV Cat comments from a couple of aspects. Just are you ready to fully launch and train? Will NAV Cat have a price premium, given premier technology first to market with something like this integrated. Can we assume that you're going to sell it at a higher price? And just last and sort of related to what Dr. Stein was talking about as well. If FARAWAVE is approved for, only AFib, obviously a huge portion of the market, how does it, how are you going to manage the argument that other imaging mapping systems, obviously are approved for all imaging? Just where will FARA NAV fit in, in the broader, the larger scheme? Thank you.\nMichael Mahoney: Dr. Stein?\nKenneth Stein: Yes, Rick. Let me take the second part of that question first and then get on to what some of the advantages are that we see unique to FARAVIEW right, which is on our refreshed OPAL HDx platform. And so again, right, the OPAL platform is approved for mapping navigation across the whole spectrum of cardiac arrhythmias. Now when we look at the use specifically as it integrates with FARAWAVE and FARAWAVE NAV like FARAWAVE is an AF ablation catheter. And I think part of the reason that we've seen the success that we've had, part of the reason I was able to give the answer that I did to Larry, right, is that it's just exquisitely beautifully designed for ablating atrial fibrillation. It's a fantastic tool for pulmonary vein isolation. And again, we hope to share our data from our ADVANTAGE clinical trial showing how it is also can be used to treat persistent atrial fibrillation. But it is really explicitly not designed to be the catheter to tackle some other arrhythmias. The next catheter in our pipeline is our FARAPOINT Catheter. And that catheter was studied in Phase II of our ADVANTAGE clinical trial. And we have completed enrollment in that Phase II of ADVANTAGE and are continuing to follow those patients. And to start, we'd expect to qualify that catheter for use for treating arrhythmia called atrial flutter as an adjunct to atrial fibrillation ablation procedures. But beyond that, right, it could see FARAPOINT used, right, for really any sort of arrhythmia where you would prefer a point catheter form factor. And then next to follow after that, right, is our so-called map and ablate catheter. It's a large focal lesion catheter called FARAFLEX, right, which, again, all of these will integrate with FARAWAVE on OPAL, right? And that would really give us building the capability to be able to target the vast majority of arrhythmias that are seen in clinical practice. In terms of FARAVIEW specifically, again, I think it's really important to emphasize. This is the first mapping and navigation software that's built around understanding Pulsed Field Ablation. And so it gives a lot of advantages to users to want to use it to navigate a catheter. It gives dynamic visualization of the FARAWAVE catheter as it moves into its various configurations, whether it's a basket or a flower or anything in between. And it's also got a unique feature of called field tagging, where physicians will be able to see where the pulsed field will intersect with tissue and hopefully allow them to better strategize where and when and how to put lesions in when they're doing an ablation procedure.\nFrederick Wise: That's an amazing answer. And just the price premium part? Thank you.\nKenneth Stein: Yes, I'm not going to comment on pricing on specific products, Rick?\nFrederick Wise: Thanks so much, everybody.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nDavid Roman: Thank you and good morning everyone. I was hoping to switch gears a little bit from the EP side of the business. And maybe if you could spend a few minutes on the performance of the franchises kind of ex-WATCHMAN and EP, which are still trending very well, although a slowdown from where you started the year. How are you thinking about resource allocation and just the focus on those businesses and maintaining ongoing support for those franchises in light of the success of PFA? And how should we think about the growth drivers in some of those more established categories on a go-forward basis?\nMichael Mahoney: Sure. I'll take that. I'll give Dr. Stein some oxygen here. We run as a very decentralized business units. And so we have -- the leaders of these divisions that's all they do. They have global teams, thousands of employees. They wake up and think about peripheral inventions, interventional oncology, endoscopy, urology, neuromod all day long and ICTx, which grew at what 15% in the quarter. So there's tremendous focus by their teams on the global execution of these businesses. We just announced the closing of Silk Road. We anticipate announcing the closing of Axonics in the fourth quarter here. Just as Ken said, we attempt to drive this category leadership in terms of our breadth of portfolio and unique innovation across each division. And we have different varying degrees of success in that. But in general, we're very strong in that area. So in terms of capital allocation, we've obviously invested significantly in the manufacturing ramp of PFA as well as ongoing R&D and clinical studies as well as commercial capabilities to continue to enhance our mapping sales force. But that in no way has detracted from the investments that we're making across these other businesses, which are really the foundation of the company. And despite doing both those at the same times, we continue to improve our margin profile, which I think shows the testament and the winning spirit of the team. So we have a rich pipeline of products organically within these business units. You've seen the performance for the quarter and the full year. We did see a bit of a slowdown in some procedure volume in the summertime in July, August, specifically in our endo, uro business. But we saw a nice procedure bounce back in September and essentially grew kind of in line where we have for the past eight quarters in those businesses. So we have a lot of confidence in them and we don't, Dr. Stein and I may spend a bit more time on PFA, certainly Dr. Stein does. But we don't take the gas pedal down on the other businesses at all in the company.\nDavid Roman: Great. Thanks. I appreciate the perspective.\nOperator: The next question comes from Patrick Wood with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Wood: Perfect. Thank you very much for taking my question. I guess just one on capacity in totality for the system. Obviously, I get PFA adding some efficiencies to the system overall. But for EPs, between WATCHMAN and everything, there's a tremendous call on people's time. We saw in structural heart a little bit of noise on one of the players saying there were capacity constraints. How are you viewing that going forward? And how quickly do you think the system can adapt to enable you to keep growing these franchise and still have capacity to actually get them done? Thanks.\nMichael Mahoney: Well, we're still relatively early in our launch. In the US, we got approved in February. We started launching in late February and March. So that we still have a number of new accounts that have not used FARAPULSE in the US. And we have yet to launch in Japan and we've yet to launch in a meaningful way in China in many other countries. So we're still quite early in the launch in very major markets. And we're seeing, in currently launched accounts, we're seeing many accounts move from one system originally to two, three and sometimes four systems. So they're increasing their utilization of FARAPULSE across their multiple labs. So we have a lot to do to continue to increase share within existing accounts. And then thirdly, because of the efficiencies of the system, the hospitals are improving their workflow, and most accounts are doing, I don't know, Ken, 25%, 30% more procedure volume in a day. So there's a lot of efficiencies and the hospitals win economically and the patients benefit as do the physicians. And then to your term on capacity, that's why this concomitant procedure is also a big win for the workflow of the hospital and the patient. So now an extra 10, 15 minutes for the appropriate patient, you can do a FARAPULSE system as well as the LAAC with WATCHMAN. So it also drives procedural efficiency, which is very unique to Boston Scientific versus our competitors. So when we design these platforms, we look at operational efficiency and also the economics of the hospital. And we think FARAPULSE and WATCHMAN and concomitant are all very helpful to hospitals efficiency. And we're still really early in the launch of FARAPULSE.\nPatrick Wood: Love it. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: The next question comes from Travis Steed with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nTravis Steed: Hey, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow up on the AVANT GUARD trial pausing. I guess a lot of questions on that this morning. So it seems like the observations you saw didn't change your thoughts drastically if you're restarting the trial soon. And then just making sure that maybe help us understand why this doesn't really change your view on safety of FARAPULSE overall or mitigate the real-world data you have or and maybe just help us understand this patient population that's in this trial today, how they're getting treated today would be great? Thanks a lot.\nKenneth Stein: Yes. Sure, Travis. Let me again begin, at least the patient population. And so right today standard of care for patients with newly diagnosed persistent atrial fibrillation is to get a trial of antiarrhythmic drug therapy first. And then guidelines would say only to be referred for ablation if they actually fail antiarrhythmic drug therapy. Obviously because even though we've paused enrollment for the moment, there's still an ongoing clinical trial. So I really can't get into any detail on the observations. Again, just to reassure everyone, nothing that we saw certainly was life-threatening. And I think we are very highly confident in the overall safety profile, overall efficacy and again overall efficiency of FARAPULSE system. And again that's just based on the extensive experience that we've got with it, which is both commercial experience, as we said, over 125,000 patients now have been treated with this system globally as well as extensive clinical data that's been published in approximately 20,000 patients and data that we see from all of our ongoing clinical trials.\nTravis Steed: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: The next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDanielle Antalffy: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on this amazing quarter. I'm kind of speechless. But just wanted to ask, I appreciate there's not going to be a lot you can say, Dan, I appreciate the comments that you did give on 2025. But specifically, as we think about sales, you noted above-market sales growth. I mean market can be a moving target a little bit here about how you think about the market's growing next year. So I was hoping maybe you could give a little bit more color, if possible, even if it's just highlighting tailwinds and headwinds from a sales growth perspective to think about as we look ahead to 2025. Thanks so much.\nMichael Mahoney: I'll start and then Dan, you can clean up my mess. So we're excited, obviously, about '24 growing estimated 15% over a comp of 12% of 2023. And as we head into 2025, obviously, we'll have a nice comp at approximately 15%. But there's so many good things going on with the company. Thank you for the non-FARAPULSE question that was asked earlier about the other businesses like PI and ICTx and neurology commonly growing double-digits and the strength of endo and we want to strengthen neuromod and US CRM a bit more. And so but as we look at 2025, the big headlines obviously are FARAPULSE and WATCHMAN. We do think the Japan launch and China launch will drive meaningful growth for the franchise. And as I mentioned just prior, there's a number of new accounts to open in the US and there's a lot of penetration in current accounts to add additional volume to both FARAPULSE. You've heard all about the concomitant reimburse for WATCHMAN. So those are all nice tailwinds for the company. The procedure volumes we see is relatively consistent. We did see a bit of a slowdown in July, August, but strengthening in September. And so we think procedure volumes will maintain strong versus as they are now. And we see strong global performance. So obviously, we'll have some more challenging comps. There will be some more competition in PFA, but we're doing very well, I guess, that competition in Europe. I don't know, Dan, also we have the AGENT, which throw one out to the cardiology team, which has performed quite well. So we'll find out about reimbursement on that product in the next coming weeks. That should add some additional momentum to that franchise.\nDaniel Brennan: I think that summarizes it well. And just to give you a sense of the process, it's no different than it is any year. We have our annual operating plan process that's alive and well here through the fourth quarter. We'll review that as we go through the end of the quarter and into early next year and we'll let you know what we think for 2025 at our Q4 earnings call.\nDanielle Antalffy: Appreciate it. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: The next question comes from Anthony Petrone with Mizuho Group. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Petrone: Thanks and congrats on a strong quarter here. I think the question will be on the go-to-market next year, 2025, you go back to the October 18 press release and you have FARAWAVE NAV Catheter out there, but it indicates that it's exclusive to OPAL on the mapping side. So in other words, the company is coming with a closed loop offering here next year. And presumably, we'll have competitors that are coming with a bundled approach. So maybe the question here is just when we enter '25, it seems that three competitors will be out there with a bundled approach to PFA with mappers. So maybe just walk through that dynamic a little bit. Congratulations again on the quarter.\nMichael Mahoney: Yes. I'll just comment and Ken, again, you can finish this. So today customers using FARAPULSE with our legacy RHYTHMIA mapping system and they're also using it with our two primary competitors today. So the OPAL platform will not be closed out in such a way that if a physician wants to continue to use a competitive mapping system with FARAPULSE, they still can. We do think that with the OPAL mapping system, specifically with FARAPULSE, the user experience will be more meaningful and more streamlined and differentiated. So we're not closing the system and that we're shutting out competitive systems from doing FARAPULSE cases. But we're quite confident in the user experience, the overall economics and the value of the OPAL integration with FARAPULSE to be differentiated versus what they're using today.\nKenneth Stein: Yes. I mean, Anthony, just to again build on what Mike said, right, we do not feel that we've got to force people to use our products. And what we see with FARAWAVE is people want to use it. And people have used it in a variety of different ways and we are going to continue to support their ability to use it in the way that they want to. And that includes people who use no mapping navigation at all, which is really through the predominant use case that we see in Europe and throughout a lot of the world or use it with a mapping and navigation system. We're going to continue to keep the original , right, the FARAWAVE Catheter without the NAV sensor on the market for people who want to use it with a competitive mapping system. FARAWAVE NAV, because it's got a magnetic NAV sensor and it does have to get tied into a particular mapping system, which for us is the refreshed OPAL HDx system with FARAVIEW. But we're not going to force people to use it. we think it's got enough compelling differentiated advantages compared to what else is out there that people are going to want to use it.\nAnthony Petrone: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nVijay Kumar: Hi, guys. Congrats on a nice quarter here and thanks for taking my question. Mike, maybe one for you on next week's ACURATE Neo2 results here. What is the regulatory strategy? Do you expect to file with the FDA? And I think you mentioned that you expect to have a successful launch in the US. Is that referring to Neo2 or some other generation of the valves? So maybe talk about your TAVR strategy in the US?\nMichael Mahoney: Sure. So as we've talked about before, the ACURATE Neo2 trial on the 1,500 patient will be TCT on what Wednesday?\nDaniel Brennan: October 30th.\nMichael Mahoney: October 30th. So that is an important milestone to see that clinical trial datas that will be presented. And we'll actually be holding an investor meeting that day with Joe Fitzgerald and Lance Bates and the team to talk about the broader cardiology portfolio and the plan for ACCURATE post the data. As you know, we've continued to have excellent momentum in Europe. You saw the third quarter results. We continue to grow above-market. And kudos to the team on the launch of Prime, the next-generation ACURATE Neo2, which they just recently started implementing in Europe.\nVijay Kumar: Sorry and does it mean you expect to file with the FDA, Mike? And what does successful launch mean?\nMichael Mahoney: Well, a successful launch, we've never provided share, attainment goals just like we don't provide a share for FARAPULSE. So we obviously want to grow the business. It's a very large market, very mature, market growing, I don't know, 8% -- 7%, 9% and we continue to do quite well in the US, but we'll provide more information at the TCT at the investor call there.\nOperator: The next question comes from Matt Miksic with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMatt Miksic: Hey, thanks so much for fitting us in and congrats on a really impressive quarter and all the great growth drivers you have running. I had a question just on maybe for Dan on some of the dynamics in the gross margin line in the quarter you mentioned FX being kind of one of the primary headwinds. But as you move into '25, maybe you can talk a little bit about where the leverage in the model is, if it's stable gross margin and levering some of the operating investments that you're making? Maybe just some color on how that -- how you see that progressing at this point? Thanks.\nDaniel Brennan: Sure, Matt. The Q3 story is actually pretty simple. So we were 70.4% gross margin in Q3, slightly below what we would have expected and that's really driven by foreign exchange in the quarter. So simple story for Q3. We've said consistently that we believe our full year adjusted gross margin will be below last year. Last year, we were 70.7%. So we've consistently said, you know what, we're probably not going to hit that 70.7% in 2024, that's okay because we're actually driving 70 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion without that kind of testament to the hallmark of the DNA of the company of continuing to drive margin expansion through all lines of the P&L. So 2024 gross margin, not going to contribute, that's okay because we have the SG&A and other horses to ride there. As you go into '25 and beyond, I think all lines of the P&L could contribute. I think gross margin is part of that. And how does that happen? A big piece of that will be product mix. So call FARAPULSE today, the single-use catheter, that's a nice margin, but you have a lot of that, the capital placements that we have. As Mike mentioned, we're still launching this. It's only six or seven months into the launch. So we're still launching a lot of capital, placing a lot of capital. And next year, we'll have Japan and China. So we'll still be doing that. We'll be effectively launching there. But I think the story is as you go into '25 and work through '25 and beyond, FARAPULSE becomes accretive overall as the single-use catheter kind of swamps the overall margin within FARAPULSE and is accretive to overall Boston Scientific. WATCHMAN is obviously helpful. You heard a lot of commentary on the call today about the some of the tailwinds that could be there for WATCHMAN. That's great news for the gross margin line. So I think the takeaway is gross margin, '25 and beyond, gross margin can be a contributor to the overall operating margin journey that's been so successful for the company for the last decade.\nMatt Miksic: That's great. Thanks a lot. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Josh Jennings with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJoshua Jennings: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on another home run quarter. I wanted to just check the box, Mike, you called out or you called out your ops and supply chain team for keeping up with the demand for FARAPULSE and staying on time. I just want to make sure that there's no manufacturing capacity issues next year if that franchise continues to outperform internal expectations? And then also just sorry to follow up on a two-parter. But wanted to just get your team's view on this mapping segment. I mean our understanding is that mapping capital and diagnostic mapping catheters, the kind of the percentage of the overall ablation market, it's even higher than the ablation catheter segment and just I know you guys are now well positioned there, but just to review that and maybe just the revenue -- the business model for Boston Scientific, whether there's FARAPULSE NAV Catheter will be single-use for PVIs and or and then just how you're building out your diagnostic mapping catheter portfolio. Sorry for the multipart.\nKenneth Stein: Hey, Josh, I'll take the second part first and then we can get to the supply issue. So just for clarity.\nMichael Mahoney: Let me just jump up. There is no supply issue. So let's talk about that. So kudos to the team. Let me take the first part. We do not anticipate, even despite the high demand, our team has done a great job on the catheter supply and the console supply. So we don't anticipate any supply shortages.\nKenneth Stein: Thanks. I should not have used that word. Yes, in terms of just for clarity. So the FARAWAVE NAV Catheter, it is a single-use device. It is, again, current indicated for PVI for patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. As we said at the ADVANTAGE clinical trial is our clinical trial to get label expansion for the FARAWAVE Catheter family for use in patients with drug refractory persistent atrial fibrillation. And again I think what we really want to emphasize here is that there's some really significant differentiated advantages to FARAVIEW versus other systems that are currently on the market for mapping a navigation of PFA catheters, right? And that's specifically ability to dynamic visualization of the catheter shape as it changes ability also to do field tagging and so ability to plan where to put lesions in when you're doing an ablation procedure.\nJoshua Jennings: And just in terms of the diagnostic mapping catheter portfolio buildout, you guys do have a high-density mapping catheter in the pipeline is my understanding, but just wanted to get a better look on that.\nKenneth Stein: Yes. I mean, Josh, we already have a high-density mapping catheter, right, which is our ORION catheter, which can be used on the refreshed OPAL system. And then as we go down the road, right, we've talked about additional catheters and be part of the FARAPULSE family, which includes FARAPOINT and includes our FARAFLEX catheter, which would have the capability to do both high-density mapping and also do PFA ablation in the same catheter.\nMichael Mahoney: They're all -- just I'll just add on and we'll move on to the next one. There are elements of the procedure that we don't compete in today that pie like ice catheters and others. So we're doing extremely well in the ablation portion of it. We expect OPAL to do quite well in the mapping segment, which we've been underscaled in, but there are still segments within the EP procedure mix that we don't play in today that we're shooting to fill out in the portfolio over time. I'll just make one other comment on FARAPULSE relates to China for -- it wasn't a question, but we're excited about the approval in Japan and in China. We do expect the China launch to be a bit slower than what you typically see in the US and Japan based on obviously, not product or team, but it's more on getting approvals and registries and launch cadence in terms of the volume of new accounts. We've done some recent openings there that have gone quite well, but we don't anticipate the same aggressive launch in China that you've seen in US. We do expect to have a very strong launch in Japan. And also just a shout out to the China team. Despite the significant VBP headwinds that we've seen, which have impacted our IVUS franchise and there will be more VBPs in 2025. We continue to grow essentially at the company average in China despite those headwinds when many of our peers have faced tougher results.\nJonathan Monson: Drew, let's take one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. That question will come from Matt O'Brien with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nMatthew O'Brien: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. And I'd much rather focus on all the positive things going on here, but I'm looking at the stock down now versus up prior to this AVANT GUARD commentary. So Dr. Stein, I'm not sure exactly what you can say, but is there any kind of safety signal that we should be aware of? And then if you can't comment on that, is there anything to think about in terms of this patient population really being the cause of the difference, maybe extra lesions that need to be created, higher risk benefit requirements because it's drug-naive patients. Just anything along those lines that you can share because I think folks are pretty nervous this morning just based on how important FARAPULSE is to the business. Thanks.\nKenneth Stein: Yes, Matt, again, because this is an ongoing trial, I can't get into any details. Again, what I can say is we are highly confident in the safety of the system. Again, we've got extensive commercial use data and over 125,000 patients treated. We've got extensive published clinical trial data and other ongoing clinical trials and are highly confident in the safety, the efficiency and the efficacy of the FARAPULSE system.\nMichael Mahoney: We expect to re-launch this trial soon.\nJonathan Monson: All right. Thanks, Ken. Thanks, Mike, and thanks, everyone for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Boston Scientific. If we weren't able to get to your question or if you have any follow-ups, please don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team. Before you disconnect, Drew will give you all the pertinent details for the replay. Thanks, everyone. Have a great day.\nOperator: Please note, a recording will be available in one hour by dialing either 1877-344-7529 or 1412-317-0088 using replay code 2607711 until October 30th, 2024, at 11:59 P.M.

            "content": "Thanks, John. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Our Q3 results exceeded our expectations and we continue to invest in our portfolio and capabilities to deliver differentiated performance over the long-term. In Q3 '24, total company operational sales grew 19% and organic sales grew 18%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of 13% to 15%. Our excellent growth is and will continue to be focused on our category leadership strategy, fueled by innovation, clinical evidence generation and the winning spirit of our global team. Q3 adjusted EPS of $0.63 grew 27%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.57 to $0.59. In Q3, adjusted operating margin was 27.2%. Turning to our fourth quarter and the full year '24 outlook. We're guiding to organic growth of 14% to 16% for fourth quarter and raising our full year guidance to approximately 15%, reflecting momentum across our broad portfolio and particularly in AF solutions. Our fourth quarter adjusted EPS guidance is now $0.64 to $0.66 and we expect our full year adjusted EPS to be $2.45 to $2.47 representing growth of 20% to 21%. Dan will provide more details on our financials in a few minutes and I'll provide additional highlights on our third quarter results, along with our comments and our outlook. Regionally, on an operational basis, the US grew 24% with double-digit growth or higher in six of eight business units. Our EP business continues to deliver impressive performance fueled by FARAPULSE, new account openings and very strong reorder rates. Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 14% on an operational basis. This performance was driven by continued above-market performance in EP, where we continue to expand our PFA leadership, complex PCI and structural heart. In TAVI, we received CE Mark and recently launched our next-generation ACURATE Prime Valve. I also want to announce that following a nearly 30-year career at Boston Scientific, our President of EMEA, Eric Thepaut , will retire in December and Xavier Bertrand, currently the Vice President of Peripheral Interventions in EMEA will be appointed the new President of EMEA. I want to thank Eric for his many significant contributions to the organization and congratulate Xavier on his new role. Asia Pac grew 12% operationally with excellent performance in China, Australia, New Zealand and grew mid-teens despite recent VBP implementations. In Japan, we received PMDA approval of the FARAPULSE PFA system and anticipate reimbursement and commercial launch in the coming weeks. I'll now provide some additional commentary on our business units. Urology sales grew 10% with double-digit growth in Stone Management and Prostate Health, including double-digit growth in both Rezum and SpaceOAR. Within the quarter, we continue to see momentum from the launches of LithoVue Elite and the Tenacio Pump with our AMS 700 device. And looking forward, we expect to close the previously announced acquisition of Axonics in the fourth quarter and we're excited to add this excellent business into Boston Scientific in our Urology business. Endoscopy sales grew 7% organically and 8% operationally with strong growth, particularly in the US. Our anchor products continue to drive above-market growth with AXIOS and Exalt D, both growing double-digits in the quarter. We also continue to see strong double-digit growth in our Endoluminal Surgery franchise. We're pleased to recently received a Category 1 CPT code for the ESG weight loss procedure, which is expected to further momentum within this business. Neuromodulation sales grew 3% organically and 17% operationally including Relievant, which will turn organic in November. Our brains franchise returned to low double-digit growth in the quarter in the US, supported by de novo implants and competitive replacements. Our pain franchise grew low-single-digits organically and double-digits operationally. Our global SCS performance was below our expectations in a market that continues to be challenged, offset by growth in the rest of the pain portfolio, which reflects the value of our category leadership strategy. Peripheral Intervention sales grew 10% organically and 12% operationally. Within our Vascular business, we saw mid-single-digit growth in arterial with continued double-digit growth in Drug-Eluting therapies and low double-digit growth in Venous. We're also pleased to have closed our acquisition of Silk Road Medical in mid-September, adding the innovative TCAR system to our vascular portfolio. Our interventional oncology and embolization franchise grew double-digits again driven by continued momentum from recent launches in embolization and sustained double-digit growth in TheraSphere. Cardiology delivered another exceptional quarter with sales growing 29%. Within Cardiology, Interventional Cardiology Therapies grew 14%. Mid-teens growth in Coronary Therapies was supported by the launch of the US AGENT performance, continued global adoption of coronary imaging with our AVVIGO+ platform and our Calcium portfolio. The US AGENT launch continues to exceed our expectations with both new account openings and strong reorder rates. We also recently commenced enrollment in the aging IDE long lesion substudy and completed enrollment in our Vitalist early feasibility study in high-risk PCI patients. Congratulations to the team on that milestone. Our structural heart valves franchise grew double-digits in the third quarter led by another quarter of above-market growth of ACURATE Neo2 in Europe. In the US, we continue to collaborate with the FDA and our regulatory strategy and data from the US ACURATE IDE will be presented at TCT on October 30. WATCHMAN grew 18% with continued conversion to WATCHMAN FLX Pro in the US and Japan. And globally, we surpassed 500,000 patients treated with the WATCHMAN device, driven by our innovation, clinical evidence and patient awareness efforts. Key near-term catalyst for WATCHMAN drive our confidence in delivering high growth in this business, including the recently implemented DRG for concomitant LAAC and AF ablation. And if positive, the data readout from the OPTION trial, which will be presented as a late-breaking clinical trial at the American Heart Association Conference on November 16th. We also recently commenced enrollment of our SIMPLIFY trial, which studying the less intensive post-procedure drug regimen, enabled by our latest generation WATCHMAN FLX Pro and continue to expect data from the CHAMPION trial in the first half of '26. Cardiac Rhythm Management sales grew 2% in the quarter. In the third quarter, our Diagnostics franchise grew high-single-digits, driven by our implantable cardiac monitors, LUX-Dx, which both received CE Mark within the quarter. In Core CRM, strong international growth was offset by below market growth in the US. We're excited about new and upcoming product launches in this business, including the expanded indication of our INGEVITY lead for conduction system pacing, which received FDA approval in the quarter and our EMPOWUR leadless pacemaker, which we now have submitted to the FDA. Electrophysiology sales grew an exceptional 177% in the quarter, driven by continued commercial execution, pull-through in our Access Solutions business and increased procedure volumes driven by excellent outcomes as well as efficiencies gained with FARAPULSE. We have now treated over 125,000 patients with FARAPULSE, driving rapid and transformative conversion from RF and cryo to PFA, specifically using FARAPULSE. As a result of this accelerated conversion in the market, we now expect PFA to likely exceed our previously communicated range of 40% to 60% of global AF ablations by 2026. We are excited about the recent FARAPULSE approvals in both Japan and China and expect these launches to have a meaningful impact on our global EP business in 2025. Recently, we received USA approval of the FARAWAVE NAV Catheter, which combined with a FARAVIEW Software to visualize cardiac ablation procedures exclusively with our OPAL HDx mapping system. We are pleased to have completed the follow-up Phase I of the ADVANTAGE AF clinical trial, which is evaluating FARAPULSE in the treatment of patients with drug-refractory persistent AF. And we expect to submit the results of the trial to the FDA later this quarter and anticipating presenting the results in early '25 with label expansion expected in the second half of '25. We're also studying in a very new patient population of drug-naive persistent AF patients in AVANT GUARD. As we have neared the end of this enrollment, we have elected to temporarily pause the trial to assess a few unanticipated observations. It is our intention to resume enrollments in the near-term. And based on the totality of clinical evidence and commercial real-world experience, we remain extremely confident in the unique performance of FARAPULSE. In closing, we're very proud of the performance of our global teams and are confident in the sustainability of our top-tier financial performance. With that, I'll hand over to Dan and provide more details on the financials. Thanks, Robbie. Make it a good one, Robbie. Sure. I'll comment and Dr. Stein can add probably more helpful color. Clearly, independently, both platforms are doing incredibly well. WATCHMAN on its own with all the clinical evidence, and you saw the amazing results of FARAPULSE today. And doctors are so comfortable with both procedures. It's a very safe procedure. The concomitant reimbursement, we view as quite positive. It's also very positive economic for the hospital, benefits for the patient, the procedure will be performed safety. So we're really pleased with that concomitant. And so it's clearly an ongoing long-term tailwind for WATCHMAN and also further helps FARAPULSE. Both platforms, as you know, have a number of different clinical trials to continue to expand indications. And Dr. Stein, any other comments you'd like to make on it? Sure. So this has just been a tremendous launch. Just a quick shout out to our operations supply chain team for staying ahead of the manufacturing. Extremely high demand for this product and the excellence that we're seeing in the field by the commercial and clinical teams. So doctors are moving surprisingly quickly towards FARAPULSE, surprisingly to what we thought it would be a year ago. So when we had the Investor Day, we weren't quite sure because we had didn't have approval in the US. We saw excellent momentum in Europe. And now our operations team is scaled to meet the demand. And those same excellent clinical outcomes and procedural efficiencies and safety benefits that patients received in Europe are being felt throughout the world now. We've been planning over 120,000 of them. So that was our point estimate about a year ago or so. And based on the rapid uptake, we're confident in stating that we do expect it to be at the high end and likely exceed that 40% to 60% based on how quickly physicians are transforming, especially for PVI from traditional RF and cryo to FARAPULSE. And it's also been supported by the studies within ADVENT that show the benefits of FARAPULSE versus traditional RF. So it's a great time in the market for the physicians and the patients. And we've also proven based on our competitive launches in Europe who have been out for a while that we clearly are the market leader in PFA and we have lots of plans in place to continue to extend that leadership with clinical differentiation and product enhancements. Dr. Stein? Sure. I'll take that. I'll give Dr. Stein some oxygen here. We run as a very decentralized business units. And so we have -- the leaders of these divisions that's all they do. They have global teams, thousands of employees. They wake up and think about peripheral inventions, interventional oncology, endoscopy, urology, neuromod all day long and ICTx, which grew at what 15% in the quarter. So there's tremendous focus by their teams on the global execution of these businesses. We just announced the closing of Silk Road. We anticipate announcing the closing of Axonics in the fourth quarter here. Just as Ken said, we attempt to drive this category leadership in terms of our breadth of portfolio and unique innovation across each division. And we have different varying degrees of success in that. But in general, we're very strong in that area. So in terms of capital allocation, we've obviously invested significantly in the manufacturing ramp of PFA as well as ongoing R&D and clinical studies as well as commercial capabilities to continue to enhance our mapping sales force. But that in no way has detracted from the investments that we're making across these other businesses, which are really the foundation of the company. And despite doing both those at the same times, we continue to improve our margin profile, which I think shows the testament and the winning spirit of the team. So we have a rich pipeline of products organically within these business units. You've seen the performance for the quarter and the full year. We did see a bit of a slowdown in some procedure volume in the summertime in July, August, specifically in our endo, uro business. But we saw a nice procedure bounce back in September and essentially grew kind of in line where we have for the past eight quarters in those businesses. So we have a lot of confidence in them and we don't, Dr. Stein and I may spend a bit more time on PFA, certainly Dr. Stein does. But we don't take the gas pedal down on the other businesses at all in the company. Well, we're still relatively early in our launch. In the US, we got approved in February. We started launching in late February and March. So that we still have a number of new accounts that have not used FARAPULSE in the US. And we have yet to launch in Japan and we've yet to launch in a meaningful way in China in many other countries. So we're still quite early in the launch in very major markets. And we're seeing, in currently launched accounts, we're seeing many accounts move from one system originally to two, three and sometimes four systems. So they're increasing their utilization of FARAPULSE across their multiple labs. So we have a lot to do to continue to increase share within existing accounts. And then thirdly, because of the efficiencies of the system, the hospitals are improving their workflow, and most accounts are doing, I don't know, Ken, 25%, 30% more procedure volume in a day. So there's a lot of efficiencies and the hospitals win economically and the patients benefit as do the physicians. And then to your term on capacity, that's why this concomitant procedure is also a big win for the workflow of the hospital and the patient. So now an extra 10, 15 minutes for the appropriate patient, you can do a FARAPULSE system as well as the LAAC with WATCHMAN. So it also drives procedural efficiency, which is very unique to Boston Scientific versus our competitors. So when we design these platforms, we look at operational efficiency and also the economics of the hospital. And we think FARAPULSE and WATCHMAN and concomitant are all very helpful to hospitals efficiency. And we're still really early in the launch of FARAPULSE. I'll start and then Dan, you can clean up my mess. So we're excited, obviously, about '24 growing estimated 15% over a comp of 12% of 2023. And as we head into 2025, obviously, we'll have a nice comp at approximately 15%. But there's so many good things going on with the company. Thank you for the non-FARAPULSE question that was asked earlier about the other businesses like PI and ICTx and neurology commonly growing double-digits and the strength of endo and we want to strengthen neuromod and US CRM a bit more. And so but as we look at 2025, the big headlines obviously are FARAPULSE and WATCHMAN. We do think the Japan launch and China launch will drive meaningful growth for the franchise. And as I mentioned just prior, there's a number of new accounts to open in the US and there's a lot of penetration in current accounts to add additional volume to both FARAPULSE. You've heard all about the concomitant reimburse for WATCHMAN. So those are all nice tailwinds for the company. The procedure volumes we see is relatively consistent. We did see a bit of a slowdown in July, August, but strengthening in September. And so we think procedure volumes will maintain strong versus as they are now. And we see strong global performance. So obviously, we'll have some more challenging comps. There will be some more competition in PFA, but we're doing very well, I guess, that competition in Europe. I don't know, Dan, also we have the AGENT, which throw one out to the cardiology team, which has performed quite well. So we'll find out about reimbursement on that product in the next coming weeks. That should add some additional momentum to that franchise. Yes. I'll just comment and Ken, again, you can finish this. So today customers using FARAPULSE with our legacy RHYTHMIA mapping system and they're also using it with our two primary competitors today. So the OPAL platform will not be closed out in such a way that if a physician wants to continue to use a competitive mapping system with FARAPULSE, they still can. We do think that with the OPAL mapping system, specifically with FARAPULSE, the user experience will be more meaningful and more streamlined and differentiated. So we're not closing the system and that we're shutting out competitive systems from doing FARAPULSE cases. But we're quite confident in the user experience, the overall economics and the value of the OPAL integration with FARAPULSE to be differentiated versus what they're using today. Sure. So as we've talked about before, the ACURATE Neo2 trial on the 1,500 patient will be TCT on what Wednesday? October 30th. So that is an important milestone to see that clinical trial datas that will be presented. And we'll actually be holding an investor meeting that day with Joe Fitzgerald and Lance Bates and the team to talk about the broader cardiology portfolio and the plan for ACCURATE post the data. As you know, we've continued to have excellent momentum in Europe. You saw the third quarter results. We continue to grow above-market. And kudos to the team on the launch of Prime, the next-generation ACURATE Neo2, which they just recently started implementing in Europe. Well, a successful launch, we've never provided share, attainment goals just like we don't provide a share for FARAPULSE. So we obviously want to grow the business. It's a very large market, very mature, market growing, I don't know, 8% -- 7%, 9% and we continue to do quite well in the US, but we'll provide more information at the TCT at the investor call there. Let me just jump up. There is no supply issue. So let's talk about that. So kudos to the team. Let me take the first part. We do not anticipate, even despite the high demand, our team has done a great job on the catheter supply and the console supply. So we don't anticipate any supply shortages. They're all -- just I'll just add on and we'll move on to the next one. There are elements of the procedure that we don't compete in today that pie like ice catheters and others. So we're doing extremely well in the ablation portion of it. We expect OPAL to do quite well in the mapping segment, which we've been underscaled in, but there are still segments within the EP procedure mix that we don't play in today that we're shooting to fill out in the portfolio over time. I'll just make one other comment on FARAPULSE relates to China for -- it wasn't a question, but we're excited about the approval in Japan and in China. We do expect the China launch to be a bit slower than what you typically see in the US and Japan based on obviously, not product or team, but it's more on getting approvals and registries and launch cadence in terms of the volume of new accounts. We've done some recent openings there that have gone quite well, but we don't anticipate the same aggressive launch in China that you've seen in US. We do expect to have a very strong launch in Japan. And also just a shout out to the China team. Despite the significant VBP headwinds that we've seen, which have impacted our IVUS franchise and there will be more VBPs in 2025. We continue to grow essentially at the company average in China despite those headwinds when many of our peers have faced tougher results. We expect to re-launch this trial soon."

I mean, the ability to do concomitant procedures and get reimbursed with them under the new CMS DRG, it's one of those things that it's positive for patients, it's positive for the health care system and hospitals and it's certainly positive for us given the unique advantages in doing concomitant procedures when you think of the safety and efficiency of FARAPULSE, and you think of the safety and efficiency and frankly excellent outcomes with FARAPULSE and with WATCHMAN FLX and WATCHMAN FLX Pro. Again, just to give some sense of the importance of this, right, there are approximately 350,000 ablations performed in the US every year for atrial fibrillation. And roughly half of those patients are at high risk of stroke according to things like the CHA2DS2-VASc scoring system. I think we are all anxiously looking forward to see the OPTION data when it gets read out and the impact that will have, I think stating the obvious will depend on what those data show. And if they do show a compelling benefit to WATCHMAN, right, how big is that benefit? And then, again, to reiterate what Mike said, beyond OPTION, we also have the CHAMPION trial. Expecting that trial to read out in early '26, which would look at WATCHMAN versus the new oral anticoagulants in all comers. Yes. Sure, Larry. Let me take those successively. So first, on AVANT GUARD. Again, as Mike said, due to a few unanticipated observations in the trial which is studying a completely new population, which is drug-naive patients with persistent AF, which FARAPULSE is not currently indicated to treat. We did elect to temporarily pause enrollment until we develop better understanding of the observations. While none of the observations were life-threatening, we did make a decision to temporarily pause, but it is our intention to resume enrollments in the near-term. And this in no way at all affects our confidence in the overall performance of the FARAPULSE system as it's being used today commercially or in other clinical trials. Again, as Mike said in his opening comments, we remain confident that we're going to obtain expanded indication for drug-refractory persistent AF patients. And that's the data from our ADVANTAGE Phase I trial. Again, as Mike said, we expect to submit that data to the FDA later this quarter. We expect to present that data in early 2025, with indication expansion expected to come in the second half of 2025. And again, I just want to close by emphasizing that this patient population that we're studying in AVANT GUARD, which is drug-naive persistent AF patients has not previously been studied, it's a population that's not indicated for ablation today under guidelines, and it's not the population that's being treated today with FARAPULSE system. And I also want to emphasize that we remain highly confident in the global performance of FARAPULSE, which has now been used to treat more than 125,000 patients across more than 65 different countries and is supported by extensive clinical data demonstrating positive outcomes for the device. And I think that also leads into your second question, right, which is why is FARAPULSE going to maintain category leadership in Pulsed Field Ablation and what's going to prompt new users to continue to newly adopt the system. And it's several things. I think, first of all, it's just the compelling ease of use and straightforward nature of doing the ablation with FARAPULSE. It's just a tremendous clinical experience that people have when they start using the system. I am not aware of anyone who started using this and then has stopped and gone back to thermal ablation. It's also an extensive clinical trial data that we've got supporting it. As Mike mentioned, right, we had a sub-analysis, the ADVENT data, which is the first data that anyone has had to actually show superiority and efficacy outcomes when we look at AF burden as a secondary analysis of the ADVENT data. It's supported by published clinical data now in approximately 20,000 patients globally. And again, as Mike said, right, in Europe, where we've seen commercial systems launch, right, we really have not seen that meaningfully detract from the position that FARAPULSE has as the leading PFA system in those markets. And then last, just to make sure it doesn't get lost in all the other stuff here, right, the approval and the launch now of FARAWAVE NAV Catheter and FARAVIEW mapping system, which really becomes the first mapping system that's really designed around PFA, I think, provides just maybe it's the cherry on top of that sundae in terms of answering your question. Yes, Rick. Let me take the second part of that question first and then get on to what some of the advantages are that we see unique to FARAVIEW right, which is on our refreshed OPAL HDx platform. And so again, right, the OPAL platform is approved for mapping navigation across the whole spectrum of cardiac arrhythmias. Now when we look at the use specifically as it integrates with FARAWAVE and FARAWAVE NAV like FARAWAVE is an AF ablation catheter. And I think part of the reason that we've seen the success that we've had, part of the reason I was able to give the answer that I did to Larry, right, is that it's just exquisitely beautifully designed for ablating atrial fibrillation. It's a fantastic tool for pulmonary vein isolation. And again, we hope to share our data from our ADVANTAGE clinical trial showing how it is also can be used to treat persistent atrial fibrillation. But it is really explicitly not designed to be the catheter to tackle some other arrhythmias. The next catheter in our pipeline is our FARAPOINT Catheter. And that catheter was studied in Phase II of our ADVANTAGE clinical trial. And we have completed enrollment in that Phase II of ADVANTAGE and are continuing to follow those patients. And to start, we'd expect to qualify that catheter for use for treating arrhythmia called atrial flutter as an adjunct to atrial fibrillation ablation procedures. But beyond that, right, it could see FARAPOINT used, right, for really any sort of arrhythmia where you would prefer a point catheter form factor. And then next to follow after that, right, is our so-called map and ablate catheter. It's a large focal lesion catheter called FARAFLEX, right, which, again, all of these will integrate with FARAWAVE on OPAL, right? And that would really give us building the capability to be able to target the vast majority of arrhythmias that are seen in clinical practice. In terms of FARAVIEW specifically, again, I think it's really important to emphasize. This is the first mapping and navigation software that's built around understanding Pulsed Field Ablation. And so it gives a lot of advantages to users to want to use it to navigate a catheter. It gives dynamic visualization of the FARAWAVE catheter as it moves into its various configurations, whether it's a basket or a flower or anything in between. And it's also got a unique feature of called field tagging, where physicians will be able to see where the pulsed field will intersect with tissue and hopefully allow them to better strategize where and when and how to put lesions in when they're doing an ablation procedure. Yes, I'm not going to comment on pricing on specific products, Rick? Yes. Sure, Travis. Let me again begin, at least the patient population. And so right today standard of care for patients with newly diagnosed persistent atrial fibrillation is to get a trial of antiarrhythmic drug therapy first. And then guidelines would say only to be referred for ablation if they actually fail antiarrhythmic drug therapy. Obviously because even though we've paused enrollment for the moment, there's still an ongoing clinical trial. So I really can't get into any detail on the observations. Again, just to reassure everyone, nothing that we saw certainly was life-threatening. And I think we are very highly confident in the overall safety profile, overall efficacy and again overall efficiency of FARAPULSE system. And again that's just based on the extensive experience that we've got with it, which is both commercial experience, as we said, over 125,000 patients now have been treated with this system globally as well as extensive clinical data that's been published in approximately 20,000 patients and data that we see from all of our ongoing clinical trials. Yes. I mean, Anthony, just to again build on what Mike said, right, we do not feel that we've got to force people to use our products. And what we see with FARAWAVE is people want to use it. And people have used it in a variety of different ways and we are going to continue to support their ability to use it in the way that they want to. And that includes people who use no mapping navigation at all, which is really through the predominant use case that we see in Europe and throughout a lot of the world or use it with a mapping and navigation system. We're going to continue to keep the original , right, the FARAWAVE Catheter without the NAV sensor on the market for people who want to use it with a competitive mapping system. FARAWAVE NAV, because it's got a magnetic NAV sensor and it does have to get tied into a particular mapping system, which for us is the refreshed OPAL HDx system with FARAVIEW. But we're not going to force people to use it. we think it's got enough compelling differentiated advantages compared to what else is out there that people are going to want to use it. Hey, Josh, I'll take the second part first and then we can get to the supply issue. So just for clarity. Thanks. I should not have used that word. Yes, in terms of just for clarity. So the FARAWAVE NAV Catheter, it is a single-use device. It is, again, current indicated for PVI for patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. As we said at the ADVANTAGE clinical trial is our clinical trial to get label expansion for the FARAWAVE Catheter family for use in patients with drug refractory persistent atrial fibrillation. And again I think what we really want to emphasize here is that there's some really significant differentiated advantages to FARAVIEW versus other systems that are currently on the market for mapping a navigation of PFA catheters, right? And that's specifically ability to dynamic visualization of the catheter shape as it changes ability also to do field tagging and so ability to plan where to put lesions in when you're doing an ablation procedure. Yes. I mean, Josh, we already have a high-density mapping catheter, right, which is our ORION catheter, which can be used on the refreshed OPAL system. And then as we go down the road, right, we've talked about additional catheters and be part of the FARAPULSE family, which includes FARAPOINT and includes our FARAFLEX catheter, which would have the capability to do both high-density mapping and also do PFA ablation in the same catheter. Yes, Matt, again, because this is an ongoing trial, I can't get into any details. Again, what I can say is we are highly confident in the safety of the system. Again, we've got extensive commercial use data and over 125,000 patients treated. We've got extensive published clinical trial data and other ongoing clinical trials and are highly confident in the safety, the efficiency and the efficacy of the FARAPULSE system."

            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Third quarter 2024 consolidated revenue of $4,209 million represents 19.4% reported growth versus third quarter of 2023 and includes a 10 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, which was favorable versus our expectations. Excluding this $4 million foreign exchange headwind, operational revenue growth was 19.5% in the quarter. Sales impact from closed acquisitions contributed 130 basis points, resulting in 18.2% organic revenue growth, exceeding our third quarter guidance range of 13% to 15%. Q3 2024 adjusted earnings per share of $0.63 grew 27% versus 2023, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.57 to $0.59 primarily driven by our strong sales performance. Adjusted gross margin for the third quarter was 70.4%, slightly lower than anticipated, driven primarily by foreign exchange. We continue to expect second half adjusted gross margin to be higher than the first half and full year adjusted gross margin to be slightly below our 2023 rate. Third quarter adjusted operating margin was 27.2%, which expanded 110 basis points versus the prior year period. Given our strong year-to-date performance, we now expect full year adjusted operating margin to be approximately 27%. We believe this strikes a nice balance of delivering incremental margin from our sales upside and continuing to invest appropriately to drive strong top line performance. On a GAAP basis, third quarter operating margin was 17.4%. Moving to below the line. Third quarter adjusted interest and other expenses totaled $65 million, which was favorable to our expectations primarily due to higher interest income. On an adjusted basis, our tax rate for the third quarter was 13.2%, which includes favorable discrete tax items. Our operational tax rate for the quarter was 13.5%. Fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding ended at 1,487 million in the third quarter. Free cash flow for the third quarter was $822 million, with $1,002 million from operating activities less $180 million in net capital expenditures, which includes payments of $208 million related to acquisitions, restructuring, litigation and other special items. In 2024, we continue to expect full year free cash flow to exceed $2 billion, which includes approximately $900 million of expected payments related to special items. As of September 30th, 2024, we had cash on hand of $2.5 billion, and our gross debt leverage ratio was 2.4 times. Our top capital allocation priority remains strategic tuck-in M&A followed by annual share repurchases to offset dilution from employee stock grants. Our legal reserve was $250 million as of September 30th, roughly flat versus Q2 2024. $53 million of this reserve is already funded through our qualified settlement funds. I'll now walk through guidance for Q4 and full year 2024. We expect full year 2024 reported revenue growth to be approximately 16.5% versus 2023. Excluding an approximate 50 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, based on current rates. We expect full year 2024 operational revenue growth to be approximately 17%. Excluding a 200 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect full year 2024 organic revenue growth to be approximately 15% versus 2023. We expect fourth quarter 2024 reported revenue growth to be in a range of 16.5% to 18.5% versus fourth quarter 2023. Excluding an approximate 50 basis point tailwind from foreign exchange, based on current rates, we expect fourth quarter 2024 operational revenue growth to be 16% to 18% and excluding a 200 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect fourth quarter 2024 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 14% to 16% versus 2023. We continue to expect full year 2024 adjusted below-the-line expenses to be approximately $300 million. We also continue to expect a full year 2024 operational tax rate of approximately 13.5% and an adjusted tax rate of approximately 12.5%, which contemplates current legislation, including enacted laws and issued guidance under OECD Pillar 2 rules. We expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.47 representing growth of 20% to 21% versus 2023, including an approximate $0.04 headwind from foreign exchange, which is unchanged from our previous expectations. We expect fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.64 to $0.66. Before we move to Q&A, I want to provide a few housekeeping items related to 2025 that may be helpful with your modeling. There will be one less business day in 2025, which comes in Q1. Note that in 2024, we have two extra business days versus 2023, one here in Q3 and one upcoming in Q4. Below the line, we expect a meaningful increase versus 2024 related to higher adjusted net interest expense. In 2024, we will earn approximately $100 million of nonrecurring interest income on the cash raised earlier this year to fund the Axonics acquisition, which we expect to close here in the fourth quarter. In 2025, we also have approximately $1.6 billion of bonds coming due, which we expect to look to refinance likely at higher rates than the existing bonds while maintaining our strong balance sheet. The good news is, this incremental expense should largely be offset by the operating income dollars associated with the deals we have closed in 2024 and the expected close of Axonics. Based on current global tax legislation, we expect our tax rate to be in line with our historical rate of approximately 14% operational and 13% adjusted. In 2025, we will aim to outperform our markets, deliver meaningful margin improvement and grow adjusted earnings per share double-digits and faster than sales towards our goal of being the highest performing large-cap medtech company as we said at last year's Investor Day. For more information, check our Investor Relations website for Q3 2024 financial and operational highlights which outlines more details on Q3 results and 2024 guidance. And with that, I'll turn it back to Jon, who'll moderate the Q&A. I think that summarizes it well. And just to give you a sense of the process, it's no different than it is any year. We have our annual operating plan process that's alive and well here through the fourth quarter. We'll review that as we go through the end of the quarter and into early next year and we'll let you know what we think for 2025 at our Q4 earnings call. October 30th. Sure, Matt. The Q3 story is actually pretty simple. So we were 70.4% gross margin in Q3, slightly below what we would have expected and that's really driven by foreign exchange in the quarter. So simple story for Q3. We've said consistently that we believe our full year adjusted gross margin will be below last year. Last year, we were 70.7%. So we've consistently said, you know what, we're probably not going to hit that 70.7% in 2024, that's okay because we're actually driving 70 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion without that kind of testament to the hallmark of the DNA of the company of continuing to drive margin expansion through all lines of the P&L. So 2024 gross margin, not going to contribute, that's okay because we have the SG&A and other horses to ride there. As you go into '25 and beyond, I think all lines of the P&L could contribute. I think gross margin is part of that. And how does that happen? A big piece of that will be product mix. So call FARAPULSE today, the single-use catheter, that's a nice margin, but you have a lot of that, the capital placements that we have. As Mike mentioned, we're still launching this. It's only six or seven months into the launch. So we're still launching a lot of capital, placing a lot of capital. And next year, we'll have Japan and China. So we'll still be doing that. We'll be effectively launching there. But I think the story is as you go into '25 and work through '25 and beyond, FARAPULSE becomes accretive overall as the single-use catheter kind of swamps the overall margin within FARAPULSE and is accretive to overall Boston Scientific. WATCHMAN is obviously helpful. You heard a lot of commentary on the call today about the some of the tailwinds that could be there for WATCHMAN. That's great news for the gross margin line. So I think the takeaway is gross margin, '25 and beyond, gross margin can be a contributor to the overall operating margin journey that's been so successful for the company for the last decade."

Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jon Monson, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJon Monson: Thank you, Drew, and welcome everyone and thanks for joining us today. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q2 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in this release. We have posted a link to that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financials and Filings. The duration of this morning's call will be approximately one hour. Mike and Dan will provide comments on Q2 performance as well as the outlook for our business, including Q3 and full year 2024 guidance, and then we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Ken Stein. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, operational revenue excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, and organic revenue further excludes acquisitions and divestitures for which there are less than a full period of comparable net sales. Relevant acquisitions and divestitures excluded for organic growth are the majority stake investment in Acotec Scientific Holdings Limited and the acquisitions of Apollo Endosurgery and Relievant Medsystems, which closed in February, April and November 2023 respectively, as well as our acquisition of the Endoluminal Vacuum Therapy portfolio from B. Braun, which closed in March 2024. Divestitures include the Endoscopy, Pathology business, which closed in April 2023. Guidance excludes the previously-announced agreement to acquire Axonics and Silk Road Medical both of which are expected to close in the second half of 2024, subject to customary closing conditions.

Mahoney: Thanks, Jon and thank you everyone for joining us today. Our second quarter results exceeded our expectations, led by the strength of our differentiated global cardiovascular portfolio, particularly the execution in AF Solutions and the winning spirit of our global team. In second quarter, total company operational sales grew 16, organic sales grew 15, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of 10 to 12. Our top tier growth continues to be fueled by innovation, clinical evidence generation, and our strategy of category leadership. Consistent with prior quarters, most of our businesses and regions grew well above market. Second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.62 grew 15% versus 2023, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.57 to $0.59. Second quarter adjusted operating margin was 27.2% and as a result of our first half margin performance and revenue upside versus previous expectations, we now expect to expand adjusted operating margin 50 to 70 basis points for the full year. Turning to the third quarter and full year 2024 outlook, we're guiding to organic growth of 13% to 15% for third quarter and raising our full year guidance from 10% to 12% to 13% to 14%, reflecting momentum across our broad portfolio, particularly in our EP business unit. Our third quarter adjusted EPS guidance is $0.57 to $0.59 and we expect our full year adjusted EPS to be $2.38 to $2.42, representing growth of 16% to 18%. Dan will provide more details on our financials and I'll provide some additional color on the quarter and the outlook for the second half of 2024. Regionally and on an operational basis, the U.S. grew 17% in second quarter with exceptional growth in EP, fueled by the continuous success of the FARAPULSE launch, as well as Watchman, coronary imaging, and strengthen our med-surg businesses. Europe grew 16% on an operational basis versus second quarter 2023. This impressive performance was driven by double-digit growth in seven of our eight business units, led by robust growth in EP and strength across our growth and emerging markets. Second quarter was also a record quarter in the region for our structural heart business, following positive data presented on ACURATE Neo2 at the recent Euro PCR Conference. We expect this momentum to continue, supported by the launch of the largest size ACURATE prime valve in late 2024. Asia-Pac grew 13% operationally versus a difficult comp in second quarter 2023, with excellent performance in China, growing high teens, and Japan growing double digits. We also recently received approval in China for FARAPULSE and AGENT Drug-Coated Balloon, and continue to expect approval for FARAPULSE in Japan in the second half of this year. We expect the contribution from these launches will ramp over 2025. Within the quarter, pricing actions in key geographies went into effect with a China VBP on coronary imaging, and Japan reimbursement cuts in June. We do expect Asia-Pac to grow low double digits in the second half of the year, including the full impact of these pricing actions. Some additional commentary on the business units. Our urology business grew 9% organically in the quarter with double digit growth in stone management and prosthetic urology, supported by our direct-to-patient efforts, driving patient awareness, and early contribution from the limited market release of the Tenacio Pump. International growth of 14% was driven by laser therapies and Rezum. We look forward to closing this previously announced acquisition of Axonics, which we are continuing to expect in the second half of this year. Endoscopy sales grew 8% both operationally and organically in second quarter. Second quarter results were driven by above market growth in our Biliary franchise, led by high teens growth in AXIOS, and the high teens growth in our Endoluminal Surgery franchise. We continue to expect Endo sales to go faster than the market throughout 2024, enabled by our innovative portfolio. Neuromodulation sales grew 16% operationally and 4% organically in the quarter. Our Brain franchise grew low single digits with some impact from competitive product launches. We expect this business to strengthen in the second half of the year, driven by our portfolio of differentiated technologies. In second quarter, our pain franchise grew strong double digits operationally and mid single digits on an organic basis. Our spinal cord stem business saw improved U.S. trialing cadence in the quarter and we expect that our U.S. SCS franchise will improve in the second half of the year. The relieving business continues to perform extremely well with more than 30,000 patients treated with the Intracept System to date. Peripheral Intervention sales grew 12% operationally and 9% organically versus second quarter. High single digit growth in Arterial was driven by continued momentum in our drug-eluting portfolio, with double digit growth in the quarter. Mid single digit growth in Venous was driven by momentum of EKOS supported by the real PE data set and continued double digit growth in Varithena. Our Interventional Oncology franchise grew double digits in second quarter, driven by our broad offering across embolization and cancer therapies. Looking forward, we continue to expect to close the previously announced acquisition of Silk Road Medical in the second half of this year. Cardiology; cardiology delivered another excellent quarter with organic sales growing 22% versus second quarter 2023. Within cardiology, interventional cardiology therapy sales grew 9%. Growth in coronary therapies was driven by continued strength in our global imaging franchise and APAC calcium franchise. Within the quarter we initiated a limited launch of AGENT DCB in the U.S., which has received positive initial physician feedback. Our structural heart valves franchise grew strong double digits in the second quarter, led by ACURATE Neo2, which continues to see growth from both new and existing accounts in Europe and Latin America. At the end of the quarter, we also completed follow-up of the full 1,500 patient cohort and the U.S. ACURATE IDE trial. We now expect to present this data in the first half of 2025 likely at the Annual ACC Meeting. Watchman had another excellent quarter growing 20% organically with strong contribution from the ongoing launch of Watchman FLX Pro in the U.S. and Japan. The U.S. grew 20% led by further penetration into the existing indicated patient population enabled by our innovation, clinical evidence, and patient awareness efforts. Cardiac Rhythm Management sales grew 3% organically in the quarter. In second quarter, our Diagnostics franchise grew double digits. This above-market growth was driven by our broad cardiac diagnostics portfolio. In Core CRM, our high and low voltage business grew low single digits with strong international growth partially offset by slightly below market growth in the U.S. At the recent HRS Meeting, data was presented from the MODULAR ATP Trial of the MODULAR CRM System, which is comprised of the EMPOWER Leadless Pacemaker and EMBLEM SICD, which met all pre-specified six-month endpoints and a high rate of ATP success with no patient requests for deactivation of pacing due to pain or discomfort. Turning to EP. EP sales grew an impressive 125% organically versus second quarter 2023, driven by the rapid and sustained adoption of the transformative FARAPULSE PFA System. Second quarter sales were driven by outstanding commercial execution, robust supply, and positive real-world outcomes, as well as increased AF ablation volumes, supported by the efficiency of the FARAPULSE workflow. Our Baylis Access Solutions business also continues to see strong double-digit growth in the U.S. with utilization in approximately 80% of PFA procedures and approximately 85% of Watchman procedures. Internationally, we saw continued FARAPULSE account openings and robust utilization in Europe and launched APAC markets. Importantly, evidence of more than 20,000 patients treated with FARAPULSE has been published or presented at medical conferences, demonstrating the safety, efficacy, and reproducibility of the system. And within the quarter, we completed an enrollment in the NAVIGATE-PF study of the FARAVIEW software module and FARAWAVE Nav-enabled catheter, both of which are expected to launch in the U.S. during the second half of the year. At the recent HRS meeting, outcomes from a sub-analysis of the ADVENT trial were presented. This is the very first randomized data for a PFA system demonstrating superior efficacy versus thermal modalities, with significantly more patients having achieved an arterial arrhythmic burden of less than 0.1% with FARAPULSE compared to RF and Cryo. We plan to continue a steady cadence of clinical evidence generation to maintain our PFA leadership, including Rematch-AF, a planned trial designed to study the FARAPOINT and FARAWAVE catheter in patients who need a redo ablation, which we expect to begin enrolling early in 2025. In closing, I'm very grateful to our global team for the commitment and winning spirit, enabling us to deliver life-changing technologies to millions of patients. We're in the most exciting chapters as a company with a track record of executing or exceeding our financial goals while delivering meaningful innovation. With that, I'll hand it over to Dan.\nDaniel J. Brennan: Thanks, Mike. Second quarter 2024 consolidated revenue of $4.120 billion represents 14.5% reported growth versus second quarter 2023 and includes a 160 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, which was slightly unfavorable, versus our expectations. Excluding this $57 million foreign exchange headwind, operational revenue growth was 16.1% in the quarter. The sales impact from closed acquisitions was 140 basis points, resulting in 14.7% organic revenue growth, exceeding our second quarter guidance range of 10% to 12%. Q2 2024 adjusted earnings per share of $0.62, grew 15.4% versus 2023, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.57 to $0.59, primarily driven by our strong sales performance. Adjusted gross margin for the second quarter was 70.4%, contracting 160 basis points versus the prior year period, driven by higher than expected inventory charges related to the POLARx cryoablation system, given the strong commercial adoption of FARAPULSE in the U.S., as well as increased levels of capital placements in the quarter. We continue to expect second half adjusted gross margin to be higher than the first half, driven by the mixed benefit from key product launches and full recognition of our annual standard cost improvements. We expect full-year adjusted gross margin to be slightly below our 2023 rate. Second quarter adjusted operating margin was 27.2%, which expanded 40 basis points versus the prior year period. Given our strong first half operating margin and our expectations for the second half, we are raising our full-year 2024 adjusted operating margin expansion goal to 50 to 70 basis points from 30 to 50 basis points compared to 2023. We believe this strikes a nice balance of delivering incremental margin from our sales upside and continuing to invest appropriately to drive strong top line performance. On a GAAP basis, second quarter operating margin was 12.6%, which included intangible asset impairment charges related to the acquisitions of Cryterion Medical and Devoro Medical. The Cryterion impairment charges were related to the high conversion rates of cryoablation to FARAPULSE for ablation procedures in the U.S. The Devoro impairment charges were related to the decision to discontinue work advancing the Wolf thrombectomy platform. Moving to below the line, second quarter adjusted interest and other expenses totaled $68 million, which was favorable to our expectations. On an adjusted basis, our tax rate for the second quarter was 13.1%, which includes favorable discrete tax items. Our operational tax rate for the quarter was 13.6%. Fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding ended at 1.484 billion shares in the second quarter. Free cash flow for the second quarter was $660 million with $814 million from operating activities, less $155 million in net capital expenditures, which includes payments of $200 million related to acquisitions, restructuring, litigation, and other special items. In 2024, we continue to expect full year free cash flow to exceed $2 billion, which includes approximately $700 million of expected payments related to special items. As of June 30, 2024 we had cash on hand of $2.9 billion and our gross debt leverage ratio was 2.4 times. Our top capital allocation priority remains strategic tuck-in M&A, followed by annual share repurchases to offset dilution from employee stock grants. In alignment with our acquisition strategy, in Q2 we announced our agreement to acquire Silk Road Medical and closed the acquisition of SoundCath [ph], a pre-revenue, privately held medical technology company developing an intracardiac echocardiography product complementing our existing electrophysiology portfolio. Our legal reserve was $251 million as of June 30th, a decrease of $32 million versus Q1 2024. $54 million of this reserve is already funded through our qualified settlement funds. I will now walk through guidance for Q3 and full year 2024. We expect full year 2024 reported revenue growth to be in a range of 13.5% to 14.5% versus 2023. Excluding an approximate 100 basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates, we expect full year 2024 operational revenue growth to be 14.5% to 15.5%. Excluding a 150 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect full year 2024 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 13% to 14% versus 2023. We expect third quarter 2024 reported revenue growth to be in a range of 13% to 15% versus third quarter 2023. Excluding an approximate 100 basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates, we expect third quarter 2024 operational revenue growth to be 14% to 16%. Excluding a 100 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect third quarter 2024 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 13% to 15% versus 2023. We now expect full year 2024 adjusted below the line expenses to be approximately $300 million. Given discrete items recognized in the first half of 2024, we now expect a full year 2024 operational tax rate of approximately 13.5% and an adjusted tax rate of approximately 12.5%, which contemplates current legislation, including enacted laws and issued guidance under OECD pillar two rules. We expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.38 to $2.42, representing growth of 16% to 18% versus 2023, including an approximate $0.04 headwind from foreign exchange, which is unchanged from our previous expectations. We expect third quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.57 to $0.59. For more information, please check our investor relations website for Q2 2024 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more details on Q2 results and 2024 guidance. And with that, I'll turn it back to Jon, who will moderate the Q&A.\nJon Monson: Thanks, Dan. Drew, let's open it up for questions for the next 40 minutes or so. In order for us to take as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question. Drew, please go ahead.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Robbie Marcus with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\nRobert Marcus: Oh, thank you and congratulations on another fantastic quarter here.\nMichael F. Mahoney: Thanks, Robbie.\nDaniel J. Brennan: Thanks, Robbie.\nRobert Marcus: With my one question, I want to ask about guidance and the sustainability. This is a, it was a big quarter. You had a big first quarter. PFA is clearly outperforming. Watchman had a great quarter. A lot of the rest of the business continues to fire on all cylinders. So I'm seeing about 14% organic for the back half of the year, which is a really healthy rate. And I guess really the question is, how do you feel about continuing through 2024 and really into 2025, is this a pull forward of the revenues expected in the long range plan, or do you think there's better demand, better market adoption, better volumes underlying pricing that could keep maybe not 14%, but something elevated for the foreseeable future? Thanks.\nMichael F. Mahoney: Sure, Rob. I'll take a shot at. We're not going to give 2025 guidance here but at our Investor Day, we said our goal was to be the highest performing med tech company in terms of sales and EPS growth, which we believe we did in 2023. Our aim is to do that in 2024 and our aim is to do that for many years to come. And I think one is the primary drivers of you've seen the decade-long portfolio shift into faster-growth markets for the company, where weighted average market growth rate is probably closer to 7% to 8% versus what it used to be kind of flat. So one, we enjoy because of our portfolio choices, faster growing markets. Secondly, we have strong growth across the world. You're seeing Europe double digits, Asia Pac double digits where FARAPULSE is not yet launched. And obviously, the U.S. doing quite well as well. And then I think you just have to look at the durability of other businesses. We'll likely talk about FARAPULSE and WATCHMAN a lot on the call, but you see continued strong growth, 8% to 9%-ish through the first half within our MedSurg businesses. So that kind of gets diminished because of the strength of some other areas, but that's pretty good. And then the cardiovascular portfolio is just getting stronger and stronger. With our EP franchise, Baylis, what we're doing with coronary with Drug-Coated Balloon, you saw the results with ACURATE in Europe, and also potentially some benefits with concomitant reimbursement in the future. And who knows, maybe these procedures may move over time to an ASC center and EP, which also, we think would benefit Boston Scientific given our solution. So we had a tough comp in 2023 with a 12%. Our guidance for the full year is now 13% to 14%. We won't give 2025 guidance, but our goal is to be really distinguish ourselves from the peer group in terms of revenue growth and EPS, and we have the portfolio and the team to do it.\nRobert Marcus: Appreciate the thoughts, thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citibank. Please go ahead.\nJoanne Wuensch: Thank you so much for taking the question and I echo a very nice quarter. Can we unpack just a little bit and you may not like this question, but I get it a lot, what's next, and how do we think about -- to your point, we're going to talk about FARAPULSE and Watchman a lot, but people are now sort of looking forward at how does this continue to roll out to deliver this kind of growth? And thank you.\nMichael F. Mahoney: Yes. I think it's -- thanks, Joanne. I think it's similar to some of the themes I just highlighted. We have -- we're in a higher weighted average market growth rate markets to start. We see consistent procedure volume around the world. We are in a pricing environment where we used to be a price giver, pretty significantly. Now it's getting closer to negative 1 to 0. We also expect on the margin front, we took our margin goals up for the year. We expect gross margin to improve over time. Right now, we're getting more margin benefit from SG&A primarily, which is good leverage. We would expect to get more gross margin upside over the LRP period and we just have a very strong product cadence in very fast-growing markets. Two of the best markets in all of MEDTECH, obviously are our EP and WATCHMAN and we have strong leadership position in PFA and that market is only growing. And we are going to launch that in Asia. And we have a lot of clinical work going on with WATCHMAN, as you know, to significantly increase the TAM of that market where it'll rival the TAVI market, three to five years from now. So the clinical evidence that we have in fast-growing market is different in the portfolio, and we continue to make and place strong M&A bets with Axonics and Silk and our venture portfolio, which we'll continue to leverage. So the playbook hasn't changed, but it's the execution of the team of continually putting this in better markets and out-executing the competition.\nJoanne Wuensch: Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nLawrence Biegelsen: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on a really nice quarter here. Mike, maybe just to drill down on EP and FARAPULSE. I guess it's a similar question, but just the sustainability here of the growth and the share. By our math, it looks like you've captured about 15% of the U.S. EP market in the second quarter, excluding Baylis. Help us understand how durable your EP share and growth is, can EP continue to be a growth driver for Boston Scientific for years to come and what's driving your confidence you can compete effectively with Athera [ph] and VeraPulse [ph] when they launch? Thank you.\nMichael F. Mahoney: So I'll start and then Dr. Stein can maybe talk about how we're really leading the field in our clinical evidence and some of the physician comment. We're competing with those companies today in Europe. With J&J, with all the companies that have PFA platforms. And you've heard us talk on many calls now on the differentiation of FARAPULSE in terms of its safety profile, the clinical data and the -- really, the usage of physicians who never considered using Boston Scientific EP prior, many of them have completely converted to using FARAPULSE for their A-fibrillation procedures. But we're still relatively early in our launch in the U.S. It's less than six months of launching in the U.S. and we have yet to launch in China, and we've yet to launch in Japan, and we have a lot more to do in Europe and we have additional indications coming and additional portfolio coming. So we think the short story is the FARAPULSE platform, combined with Baylis, combined with our clinical will be a differentiated growth driver for Boston for many years to come. Now will it grow as it continues to scale up over 100% a quarter, unlikely, but we expect this to be maybe the biggest business of Boston Scientific in the years to come here.\nKenneth Stein: And Larry, maybe just to sort of add on Mike said first just -- I mean, AF is the most common sustained arrhythmia in the world. Ablation therapy for AF today is still dramatically underpenetrated, right. I mean ablation, high single-digit penetration for persistent afib, low double-digit penetration for paroxysmal afib and the safety advantages, the efficacy advantages, the efficiency advantages and just the overall simplicity of the FARAPULSE system, I think are just going to continue to drive the size of that market and penetration into that market. In terms of the competition, right, again, we do expect to see competitors bring out their first-generation products late this year, early next year, they're already approved in Europe. And frankly, as Mike said earlier, right, we have not seen that materially impact the rapid sustained adoption of FARAPULSE in Europe. And FARAPULSE is a transformative technology with really important differentiated advantages against these competitors. As Mike said, right, treated over 70,000 patients to date, published clinical trial data on over 20,000 patients to date, which really testifies to the safety, to the simplicity, to the efficiency and again, Mike referred to the data we presented at Heart Rhythm Society. It's the only system right now with any data testifying to actually superiority in an efficacy measure against traditional ablation.\nLawrence Biegelsen: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Rick Wise with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nJon Monson: Hey Rick, can you hear us.\nFrederick Wise: Hi, there, can you hear me.\nJon Monson: Yes, we can hear you now.\nFrederick Wise: Great, sorry about that. I was hoping also to talk about PFA from another perspective. In my recent doc checks I've heard a great deal of encouraging interest in RHYTHMIA. And obviously, in many cases that are being mapped now with other companies' systems. Just maybe give us some more color on when you launch your mapping integrated catheter in the second half, I assume that's still the target. How do we think about the implications for RHYTHMIA adoption for the percentage of cases that could be mapped on the RHYTHMIA system and the impact on your growth outlook as a result? Thank you.\nKenneth Stein: Yes. Thanks, Rick. I appreciate the question. Again, we still are projecting approval of both our NAV-enabled FARAWAVE catheter and a completely new software suite on RHYTHMIA that we're calling FARAVIEW to help support that. And we certainly do expect that to help drive more adoption of the use of RHYTHMIA and FARAVIEW to accompany FARAWAVE. Now I want to begin though by saying, FARAPULSE will remain an open system. We want to support workflows that don't involve any use of mapping or navigation, support workflows that involve these competitive systems, but also we'll expect with FARAVIEW and FARAWAVE NAV to provide some major advantages in terms of workflow. I think important for me I think emphasize that existing mapping and navigation systems don't understand PFA at all. They were built around an RF ablation paradigm. And so FARAVIEW is going to be the first software and a mapping system that fundamentally understands what we do with PFA and with FARAPULSE. There are some important features, dynamic visualization of the catheter as it changes shape from basket flower configuration, field tagging specific to PFA energy. I think when you put all of that together it has the potential to minimize the use of fluoroscopy during these procedures, minimize catheter exchanges, and really continue what we've tried to do and I think have accomplished with FARAPULSE to begin, right, which is to create a procedure that is safer, that is at least as effective, and that is far more simple and efficient compared to what people have been doing with legacy systems.\nMichael F. Mahoney: And on the financial side, as you know, you've seen some of the competitive reports. Mapping is a sizable chunk of the overall EP procedure. And when FARAPULSE is being used, you're seeing increased procedure volume based on the efficiency. So some competitors are benefiting from that productivity gain of FARAPULSE. So in addition to strong utilization rates and opening new centers, more broadly impacted in 2025, we do expect a number of physicians to adopt this Fairview platform that Ken said which is additional revenue that you're not seeing today in the FARAPULSE EP procedure.\nFrederick Wise: That\u2019s great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nVijay Kumar: Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions and my congratulations on the experience here. I had one question on U.S. PFA, the 220% growth. Can you parse what was capital contribution versus catheter contribution in the U.S. number. And I think you mentioned a TPT for -- in the U.S., in the outpatient setting, any update on has Boston submitted its TPT? thank you.\nMichael F. Mahoney: Yes. So thanks for the question. Unfortunately, we're not going to break out for you the capital and disposable. Disposable is obviously more sizable than the capital, but that's probably the color we'll provide on that. And on the overall pricing, as you do know the pricing is a bit of a premium. But based on the clinical benefits and efficacy and efficiency that physicians and customers are enjoying that seemed to be the proper price point. And on TPT, Ken, do you have any comments on that?\nKenneth Stein: Yes, Vijay. So we have submitted for TPT. Again, I think important to recognize there are some very strict criteria for eligibility for TPT. And I think just to reiterate what Mike said, which is, right now, we are not seeing pricing as a barrier to the rapid and sustained adoption of FARAPULSE.\nOperator: Next question comes from David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nDavid Roman: Thank you and good morning. I want to keep going a little bit on the EP side. But also, could you talk a little bit more about both the technology and commercial strategy and as you think about the technology side, right now, the bulk of your business right now sits in the ablation side. You talked a little bit about the importance of mapping and access. But how should we think about the portfolio evolving and how that unlocks new opportunities for you, whether that's in the non-AF side of the ablation market, be it with FARAPOINT or some of the other products? And then on the commercial side, where are the opportunities for pull-through here, so for example, are you training your mappers on generator replacements and ICDs and how should we think about the overall benefit to the portfolio?\nMichael F. Mahoney: Again, I guess Ken and I will try to tag team this. Thank you for the question. It's maybe the best market in med tech. It's about a $10 billion market. The chunk that we're doing well in now is the $6 billion afib market that we continue to strengthen, and we'll get approval, as you know in Asia impact in 2025. There are a number of other areas that we're trying to move into the mapping segment based on the previous commentary is one. We do have an organic ICE program, which we hopefully will -- which is a 510(k) product, hopefully, we'll be competitive with the new ICE platform during this LRP period, which is another large slice of it. And Ken can probably detail out a bit more the clinical studies that we're doing to widen the indication for FARAPULSE beyond what is used today.\nKenneth Stein: Yes. Thanks, Mike. So David, let me start with the clinical strategy and then maybe say a little more about where we're going from a technology standpoint as well because I think it's important, right. That all the other stuff we're doing doesn't just get lost in the excitement around FARAPULSE as exciting as FARAPULSE is. From clinical trial standpoint, to begin with our ADVANTAGE clinical trial, which is aimed to get labeling for FARAPULSE persistent Afib has completed enrollment. We expect to present those results late this year, early next year. We are well underway in a trial called AVANT GUARD , which is aimed to prove that FARAPULSE used as first-line therapy for patients with persistent atrial fibrillation. We've announced the intent to run a trial called REMATCH, which will look at FARAPULSE for redo ablations. From a technology standpoint, we've already talked about the FARAWAVE NAV catheter. In addition to that, we have a point catheter, FARAPOINT that's through its clinical trial. And then down the road, I think more sophisticated catheters for both mapping and ablation catheter called FARAFLEX. And I think as you can imagine, we are interested in the use of this for many arrhythmias beyond atrial fibrillation, atrial tachycardia, and ventricular tachycardia, that pretty much you name it. But I don't want some of the other technology innovations to get lost. And so right, the EP performance was not only a FARAPULSE story, fantastic performance from our Access Solutions portfolio. And in terms of pull-through, right, see very good synergy between FARAPULSE and the Access solution products, likewise, in really good synergy between the WATCHMAN and the Access Solution products. Again, I think in terms of the pull-through question, with the most obvious opportunity, as Mike mentioned, is the opportunity now to have reimbursement in the U.S. for concomitant FARAPULSE ablation and WATCHMAN procedures, which we expect will be a growth driver and hope to see that finalized before the end of this year by CMS. Again, Dan mentioned our acquisition of SoundCath, so an ICE product to support EP procedures and potentially also WATCHMAN procedures, probably just a very long-winded way of saying we love FARAPULSE, but it is far from the only story.\nOperator: The next question comes from Patrick Wood with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Wood: Fabulous, thank you. And on that note, I might flip the script if that's alright with everybody. And maybe switch to something a little different. Obviously, you guys announced Silk and appreciate that hasn't closed yet, but I'd love if you could unpack what was so exciting for you guys in TCAR and that asset overall and the ability to flip WALLSTENT into the package and how meaningful that is relative to just the capacity to plug it into Boston overall and drive sales? Anything around that would be great.\nMichael F. Mahoney: Sure. Silk is really a terrific asset we've looked at for a long time. Hopefully, we aim to close that in the second half this year. As a stand-alone business, they were really kind of leading the rejuvenation of that field through their clinical evidence and their performance over many years in the U.S. And it came to a point where we felt it was mature enough in terms of its sales ramp and for us to acquire it at the right price. So I guess, first of all, it always starts with clinical indications. We're really pleased with the data and the long-term durability of this procedure. So as a stand-alone company, they're growing certainly accretive to Boston Scientific faster, but clearly not there on the margin front. So now in Boston Scientific sense we feel like we can grow the company faster in the U.S. given the category leadership portfolio we have and a common call point with a vascular surgeon. We also have the ability to take it outside the U.S. to appropriate countries. And we also aim to improve the margin profile of the business by integrating the company as appropriately within our operations supply chain team like we've done for many other acquisitions in the past. So it's an accretive asset that we think will be stronger and more profitable in the hands of Boston and make us more important for the vascular surgeon, which is an area that as the needs improvement for us, I would say, within that business unit. So now we have the lever -- not the leverage, but the capabilities to present to vascular surgeons our broader PI portfolio, given the relationships that the Silk Road team has with the vascular surgeon.\nPatrick Wood: Brilliant, thanks Mike.\nOperator: The next question comes from Travis Steed with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nTravis Steed: Hey, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask, given the strong margin guide raise and EPS guide raise here, where you're at kind of on the FARAPULSE getting those to full margins and the scale there. Are you halfway there, kind of more or less and your willingness to kind of continue to let that flow through? And I also wanted to ask about TAVR. It felt like a little bit of a time change and tone change on TAVR, so I just wanted to make sure we didn't miss anything on the TAVR update?\nDaniel J. Brennan: Sure. I can start on the gross margin and then Mike can take the TAVR one. So where are we on the journey? As Mike said, we're early in the journey in the United States relative to the FARAPULSE launch. That corresponds pretty well with the gross margin story. So if you think of where we are, the standard margin for FARAPULSE is absolutely accretive relative to the catheter. So that's a great accretive gross margin growth driver. The things that in the initial stages are a little bit dilutive are obviously, you heard me talk about the inventory charges with respect to POLARx. So we don't want to take inventory charges, but when it's -- when you're taking them as a result of the success of FARAPULSE, that's -- it should be temporary and should not be something that continues. So those should get better over time. The manufacturing brands, so we have built our manufacturing capacity and our operations and supply chain team to be the leaders in this space. So we have significant capacity. So as we're making the product today, it's a little under absorbed relative to that. So that will get better, obviously, as we make more and that's obviously our plan. And then the capital placements are dilutive. Again, it's not a huge number relative to the overall gross margin for the company, but it does at the edges, kind of take that down a bit. So overall, I would say FARAPULSE, every quarter, FARAPULSE will be a better contributor to margin. And I think as you get into 2025 and 2026, it will be a significantly accretive growth driver for gross margin for the company.\nMichael F. Mahoney: On TAVI, the European team has done really an outstanding quarter and outstanding quarters back to back with ACURATE Neo2, over 20% growth. Importantly, we expect to launch in fourth quarter or maybe first quarter 2025 Prime, which is our next-generation ACURATE Neo2 that has all risk indications and the full-size matrix, which has been the challenge for us to date with an optimized delivery in the valve frame. On the -- just to reiterate on the U.S. timing, we did complete enrollment of the 1,500 patient cohort. And we do expect to present the data in the first half of 2025 likely at the ACC meeting. I think it's important to note that this is the largest randomized trial that's been done in TAVI really based on the timing of the last patient follow-up and the size of the trial and the multiple risk and mixed control groups that we have in it. It's an extensive trial and we believe that the first half 2025 and likely at ACC is the appropriate timing.\nDaniel J. Brennan: And then just as a quick follow-up to the gross margin question, Travis. None of that is a surprise relative to gross margin. So we've been saying all along the gross margin is not likely to help the margin improvement story in 2024. But lo and behold, we're able to increase the overall operating margin from 30 to 50 to 50 to 70. So I think all is well on the margin expansion front. Really proud of that 50 to 70 relative to the guidance for this year. And as you look to 2025 and beyond, I think gross margin, I think all lines of the P&L can contribute to the margin expansion journey and gross margin will be one of those.\nTravis Steed: Great, very helpful. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: The next question comes from Josh Jennings with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJoshua Jennings: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking the questions and congrats on the stellar results. Wanted to just follow up on Travis' two questions. I guess, first on TAVR, could we see top line data before the ACC presentation next year and could Boston file before that presentation? And then just the other follow-up is just on the profitability you guys you're seeing in a lot of profitability flow through on the outperformance on the top line. I wanted to just get a sense of taking some of that profitability and reinvesting that, where could we see -- where some of those dollars going and just some high-level commentary on that reinvestment driving -- supporting this sustainability of top-tier revenue growth in the med tech space? Thanks for taking the questions.\nKenneth Stein: Yes, Josh, maybe I'll take the TAVR question first and then let Dan and Mike take the others. Just really what Mike said, last patient follow-up in the trial was just in this quarter, it's a very large, very complex trial. And just honestly, based on the timing of getting the data cleaned and getting the readouts from all of the various core labs [ph] that are engaged in getting us the analysis for the trial, we are going to miss the abstract deadlines for all of the major fall meetings. So those deadlines literally come up within a couple of weeks. And again, these data are so important and pivotal, right, we want to present this at a major meeting. And so right, the first major cardiology meeting, where we'll be able to meet an abstract deadline is going to be the ACC. Would not expect you to see any data released ahead of that.\nDaniel J. Brennan: And the second part of your question relative to the balance between reinvesting the sales upside and dropping some through. I think you're seeing the evidence of that here in our guidance raise for the 50 to 70. So I think we've struck a really good balance on that. So we've had sales upside during the year and the realization that we closed the first half a little bit ahead of expectations. So we're giving some of that back. So we're taking the 30 to 50 to the 50 to 70. So that's great. At the same time, we are reinvesting in the business, primarily in the commercial facing functions. We're leveraging the back office and the administrative areas, which makes sense. We don't need to grow those when you're growing the revenue at the rate that we're at. So we've got significant leverage opportunities there. And then as Mike said, this isn't just reinvesting in FARAPULSE. This is reinvesting across the whole portfolio, the broad portfolio that we have. So we picked the right spots to reinvest to be able to continue to deliver that top line performance for the long term. And I think we're striking a nice balance there.\nOperator: The next question comes from Daniel Antalffy with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDanielle Antalffy: Hey, good morning everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. And I'll be a broken record here. Congrats on the really awesome quarter. Mike, I wanted to go in a different direction here away from PFA for a second and talk about how we should think, just on this theme of sustainability of growth into 2025, appreciating we'll give guidance here. But if we think about AGENT DCB launching back half of this year and Modular in the back half or, I guess, is that launching this year as well. So how do we think about those contributing maybe elevating CRM growth above the market in next year as well as the Interventional Cardiology portfolio? Thanks so much.\nMichael F. Mahoney: Thank you for pointing that out because I was getting hammered by tax from our agent team and our CRM team for not mentioning those in the prior question. So I think if you were to continue to add on that discussion, which is how do we maintain and sustain high performance, that's highly differentiated from the peer group for the -- for many years to come. It's all the things we talked about before with PFA and WATCHMAN indication expansion. And as you said, with the AGENT, kudos to that team, they're really transforming that portfolio. Drug-eluting stents next year will probably be 2% of overall Boston Scientific. And you're seeing tremendous growth in our imaging business with our IVUS imaging platform. And now we're the first one to have approval for AGENTS, and that TPT decision will be made soon and apply and hopefully, in January. And that is a market that we plan to drive where we have a multiyear advantage, where we have superiority data for what is at least 10% of the market with restenosis and appropriate price points. That's going to accelerate the growth of that division and significantly improve the margin profile over time. Why we continue to invest in clinical science and our structural heart portfolio and also, we have a very vast VC portfolio. And oftentimes, those VC investments come with dilution, which our team is able to manage consistently while investing for the future, while improving margins at the same time. So I think that's a big part of it. As you do know, the CRM business is a bit of a lag for us. International business did quite well. U.S. lagged a little bit and the Modular ATP, proud of the team for that. That was a long study, a very difficult project. But you saw the results of that S-ICD with the modular platform and we're excited to launch that in 2025. So there are two other areas that I didn't mention before that you pointed out. And also, what's not being mentioned here today is just the tremendous growth in our Endo and Uro businesses. Our Uro business is near double digits for the first half. Our Endo business is near double digit for the first half. Those are all accretive margin companies for us. We're very excited about the Axonics acquisition, which will have operational benefit in 2025 and organic in 2026 primarily. But it just makes those divisions even stronger. So there's many things to be excited about for the future of the company to continue on with a goal of differentiated performance.\nDanielle Antalffy: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Matthew O'Brien with Piper Scientific. Please go ahead.\nMatthew O\u2019Brien: Great, thanks so much. From Piper Sandler. Just maybe on just sticking with kind of where Danielle is going outside of PFA. Just on the WATCHMAN business, 20% growth is a little bit of a tick up versus Q1. Your competitor said they grew 45% in the quarter. So are you losing a little bit of share to those guys or is the market starting to accelerate for some reason, I don't know if it's in front of this concomitant reimbursement, just maybe talk a little bit about that? And then maybe for Dr. Stein specifically, if you get this concomitant reimbursement, can you just talk about the workflow for the clinician in terms of doing a PFA case plus a WATCHMAN case at the same time. I mean how much more challenging is that you have to bring in an ICE sometimes and other times not bringing ICE and to do the WATCHMAN part of the case, just maybe talk a little bit about that opportunity going forward? Thank you.\nMichael F. Mahoney: Yes, I'll just touch on the growth, 20% is excellent. We're in the midst of launching our WATCHMAN FLX Pro and maybe as importantly, this new steerable sheet, which is early in its launch. And so I think to clinical data and the extremely high market share of WATCHMAN speaks for itself and the ongoing R&D platforms that we're driving for WATCHMAN and clinical science. So we are extremely comfortable that we're nearly 90% of share in the U.S. and there may be some extremely price-sensitive accounts that will occasionally lose business to. But it's very, very small margin. Very, very small numbers. And if you look at the size of the WATCHMAN business and our share and our technology lead, we're very comfortable with the position we're in.\nKenneth Stein: Yes. And then in terms of just workflow and concomitant, this is one of the areas where I think in between, right, the safety and efficiency advantages of WATCHMAN FLX and FLX Pro combined with the efficiency and safety advantages of FARAPULSE could create a real advantage for us as a unified ecosystem. The beauty of doing these two procedures together, right, is they both involve transseptal access into the left atrium. They both involve the catheter manipulation inside the left atrium. So there's a huge benefit to patients to be able to have it all done at one sitting as opposed to having to have one procedure and then go through many of the same risks of the first procedure go and have it done as a second procedure. And just to reiterate, when you think of doing it as a concomitant procedure what you want our technologies that enable you to do it safely and we do it reproducibly and enable you to do it efficiently. So you're spending as little time as possible, right, mucking about inside someone's left atrium. And FARAPULSE and WATCHMAN FLX Pro together are unmatched in giving you those advantages.\nOperator: And I understand there is time for one last question.\nMichael F. Mahoney: Yes, please.\nOperator: Okay. That last question will come from Matt Taylor with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Taylor: Hi, good morning guys, thank you for taking the questions. Congrats on a great quarter. I did want to ask a follow-up question on FARAPULSE just to help with thinking about the modeling and the opportunity there. Could you give us any kind of update or parameters on how many centers you're in, how many boxes you've placed, and maybe talk about whether the early experience has changed your views on how the market could evolve like you laid out at the Analyst Day several months ago?\nMichael F. Mahoney: Yes, I think the only piece of that we'll provide color on is the last part of it. We don't want to break out catheter usage, capital usage, how many sites. I would say the utilization rates of sites once they use FARAPULSE is very quick and sustainable. So we're not seeing hospitals turn it on and turn it off and go in and out of it, like you see in many med tech products. So the sustainability and usage of FARAPULSE is very high once customers start using it. And obviously, we have a chance to sell more consoles to larger centers in the existing accounts besides opening new accounts. And the second part was what -- having a senior moment. [Multiple Speakers] Great, thanks. I ended it with a dud, sorry Matt.\nMatthew O\u2019Brien: That\u2019s okay, alright.\nJon Monson: Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us today. As always, we appreciate your interest in Boston Scientific. If we were unable to get to your question or have any follow-ups, please don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team. And before you disconnect, Drew will give you all the pertinent details for the replay. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you.

            "content": "Thanks, Jon and thank you everyone for joining us today. Our second quarter results exceeded our expectations, led by the strength of our differentiated global cardiovascular portfolio, particularly the execution in AF Solutions and the winning spirit of our global team. In second quarter, total company operational sales grew 16, organic sales grew 15, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of 10 to 12. Our top tier growth continues to be fueled by innovation, clinical evidence generation, and our strategy of category leadership. Consistent with prior quarters, most of our businesses and regions grew well above market. Second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.62 grew 15% versus 2023, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.57 to $0.59. Second quarter adjusted operating margin was 27.2% and as a result of our first half margin performance and revenue upside versus previous expectations, we now expect to expand adjusted operating margin 50 to 70 basis points for the full year. Turning to the third quarter and full year 2024 outlook, we're guiding to organic growth of 13% to 15% for third quarter and raising our full year guidance from 10% to 12% to 13% to 14%, reflecting momentum across our broad portfolio, particularly in our EP business unit. Our third quarter adjusted EPS guidance is $0.57 to $0.59 and we expect our full year adjusted EPS to be $2.38 to $2.42, representing growth of 16% to 18%. Dan will provide more details on our financials and I'll provide some additional color on the quarter and the outlook for the second half of 2024. Regionally and on an operational basis, the U.S. grew 17% in second quarter with exceptional growth in EP, fueled by the continuous success of the FARAPULSE launch, as well as Watchman, coronary imaging, and strengthen our med-surg businesses. Europe grew 16% on an operational basis versus second quarter 2023. This impressive performance was driven by double-digit growth in seven of our eight business units, led by robust growth in EP and strength across our growth and emerging markets. Second quarter was also a record quarter in the region for our structural heart business, following positive data presented on ACURATE Neo2 at the recent Euro PCR Conference. We expect this momentum to continue, supported by the launch of the largest size ACURATE prime valve in late 2024. Asia-Pac grew 13% operationally versus a difficult comp in second quarter 2023, with excellent performance in China, growing high teens, and Japan growing double digits. We also recently received approval in China for FARAPULSE and AGENT Drug-Coated Balloon, and continue to expect approval for FARAPULSE in Japan in the second half of this year. We expect the contribution from these launches will ramp over 2025. Within the quarter, pricing actions in key geographies went into effect with a China VBP on coronary imaging, and Japan reimbursement cuts in June. We do expect Asia-Pac to grow low double digits in the second half of the year, including the full impact of these pricing actions. Some additional commentary on the business units. Our urology business grew 9% organically in the quarter with double digit growth in stone management and prosthetic urology, supported by our direct-to-patient efforts, driving patient awareness, and early contribution from the limited market release of the Tenacio Pump. International growth of 14% was driven by laser therapies and Rezum. We look forward to closing this previously announced acquisition of Axonics, which we are continuing to expect in the second half of this year. Endoscopy sales grew 8% both operationally and organically in second quarter. Second quarter results were driven by above market growth in our Biliary franchise, led by high teens growth in AXIOS, and the high teens growth in our Endoluminal Surgery franchise. We continue to expect Endo sales to go faster than the market throughout 2024, enabled by our innovative portfolio. Neuromodulation sales grew 16% operationally and 4% organically in the quarter. Our Brain franchise grew low single digits with some impact from competitive product launches. We expect this business to strengthen in the second half of the year, driven by our portfolio of differentiated technologies. In second quarter, our pain franchise grew strong double digits operationally and mid single digits on an organic basis. Our spinal cord stem business saw improved U.S. trialing cadence in the quarter and we expect that our U.S. SCS franchise will improve in the second half of the year. The relieving business continues to perform extremely well with more than 30,000 patients treated with the Intracept System to date. Peripheral Intervention sales grew 12% operationally and 9% organically versus second quarter. High single digit growth in Arterial was driven by continued momentum in our drug-eluting portfolio, with double digit growth in the quarter. Mid single digit growth in Venous was driven by momentum of EKOS supported by the real PE data set and continued double digit growth in Varithena. Our Interventional Oncology franchise grew double digits in second quarter, driven by our broad offering across embolization and cancer therapies. Looking forward, we continue to expect to close the previously announced acquisition of Silk Road Medical in the second half of this year. Cardiology; cardiology delivered another excellent quarter with organic sales growing 22% versus second quarter 2023. Within cardiology, interventional cardiology therapy sales grew 9%. Growth in coronary therapies was driven by continued strength in our global imaging franchise and APAC calcium franchise. Within the quarter we initiated a limited launch of AGENT DCB in the U.S., which has received positive initial physician feedback. Our structural heart valves franchise grew strong double digits in the second quarter, led by ACURATE Neo2, which continues to see growth from both new and existing accounts in Europe and Latin America. At the end of the quarter, we also completed follow-up of the full 1,500 patient cohort and the U.S. ACURATE IDE trial. We now expect to present this data in the first half of 2025 likely at the Annual ACC Meeting. Watchman had another excellent quarter growing 20% organically with strong contribution from the ongoing launch of Watchman FLX Pro in the U.S. and Japan. The U.S. grew 20% led by further penetration into the existing indicated patient population enabled by our innovation, clinical evidence, and patient awareness efforts. Cardiac Rhythm Management sales grew 3% organically in the quarter. In second quarter, our Diagnostics franchise grew double digits. This above-market growth was driven by our broad cardiac diagnostics portfolio. In Core CRM, our high and low voltage business grew low single digits with strong international growth partially offset by slightly below market growth in the U.S. At the recent HRS Meeting, data was presented from the MODULAR ATP Trial of the MODULAR CRM System, which is comprised of the EMPOWER Leadless Pacemaker and EMBLEM SICD, which met all pre-specified six-month endpoints and a high rate of ATP success with no patient requests for deactivation of pacing due to pain or discomfort. Turning to EP. EP sales grew an impressive 125% organically versus second quarter 2023, driven by the rapid and sustained adoption of the transformative FARAPULSE PFA System. Second quarter sales were driven by outstanding commercial execution, robust supply, and positive real-world outcomes, as well as increased AF ablation volumes, supported by the efficiency of the FARAPULSE workflow. Our Baylis Access Solutions business also continues to see strong double-digit growth in the U.S. with utilization in approximately 80% of PFA procedures and approximately 85% of Watchman procedures. Internationally, we saw continued FARAPULSE account openings and robust utilization in Europe and launched APAC markets. Importantly, evidence of more than 20,000 patients treated with FARAPULSE has been published or presented at medical conferences, demonstrating the safety, efficacy, and reproducibility of the system. And within the quarter, we completed an enrollment in the NAVIGATE-PF study of the FARAVIEW software module and FARAWAVE Nav-enabled catheter, both of which are expected to launch in the U.S. during the second half of the year. At the recent HRS meeting, outcomes from a sub-analysis of the ADVENT trial were presented. This is the very first randomized data for a PFA system demonstrating superior efficacy versus thermal modalities, with significantly more patients having achieved an arterial arrhythmic burden of less than 0.1% with FARAPULSE compared to RF and Cryo. We plan to continue a steady cadence of clinical evidence generation to maintain our PFA leadership, including Rematch-AF, a planned trial designed to study the FARAPOINT and FARAWAVE catheter in patients who need a redo ablation, which we expect to begin enrolling early in 2025. In closing, I'm very grateful to our global team for the commitment and winning spirit, enabling us to deliver life-changing technologies to millions of patients. We're in the most exciting chapters as a company with a track record of executing or exceeding our financial goals while delivering meaningful innovation. With that, I'll hand it over to Dan. Thanks, Robbie. Sure, Rob. I'll take a shot at. We're not going to give 2025 guidance here but at our Investor Day, we said our goal was to be the highest performing med tech company in terms of sales and EPS growth, which we believe we did in 2023. Our aim is to do that in 2024 and our aim is to do that for many years to come. And I think one is the primary drivers of you've seen the decade-long portfolio shift into faster-growth markets for the company, where weighted average market growth rate is probably closer to 7% to 8% versus what it used to be kind of flat. So one, we enjoy because of our portfolio choices, faster growing markets. Secondly, we have strong growth across the world. You're seeing Europe double digits, Asia Pac double digits where FARAPULSE is not yet launched. And obviously, the U.S. doing quite well as well. And then I think you just have to look at the durability of other businesses. We'll likely talk about FARAPULSE and WATCHMAN a lot on the call, but you see continued strong growth, 8% to 9%-ish through the first half within our MedSurg businesses. So that kind of gets diminished because of the strength of some other areas, but that's pretty good. And then the cardiovascular portfolio is just getting stronger and stronger. With our EP franchise, Baylis, what we're doing with coronary with Drug-Coated Balloon, you saw the results with ACURATE in Europe, and also potentially some benefits with concomitant reimbursement in the future. And who knows, maybe these procedures may move over time to an ASC center and EP, which also, we think would benefit Boston Scientific given our solution. So we had a tough comp in 2023 with a 12%. Our guidance for the full year is now 13% to 14%. We won't give 2025 guidance, but our goal is to be really distinguish ourselves from the peer group in terms of revenue growth and EPS, and we have the portfolio and the team to do it. Yes. I think it's -- thanks, Joanne. I think it's similar to some of the themes I just highlighted. We have -- we're in a higher weighted average market growth rate markets to start. We see consistent procedure volume around the world. We are in a pricing environment where we used to be a price giver, pretty significantly. Now it's getting closer to negative 1 to 0. We also expect on the margin front, we took our margin goals up for the year. We expect gross margin to improve over time. Right now, we're getting more margin benefit from SG&A primarily, which is good leverage. We would expect to get more gross margin upside over the LRP period and we just have a very strong product cadence in very fast-growing markets. Two of the best markets in all of MEDTECH, obviously are our EP and WATCHMAN and we have strong leadership position in PFA and that market is only growing. And we are going to launch that in Asia. And we have a lot of clinical work going on with WATCHMAN, as you know, to significantly increase the TAM of that market where it'll rival the TAVI market, three to five years from now. So the clinical evidence that we have in fast-growing market is different in the portfolio, and we continue to make and place strong M&A bets with Axonics and Silk and our venture portfolio, which we'll continue to leverage. So the playbook hasn't changed, but it's the execution of the team of continually putting this in better markets and out-executing the competition. So I'll start and then Dr. Stein can maybe talk about how we're really leading the field in our clinical evidence and some of the physician comment. We're competing with those companies today in Europe. With J&J, with all the companies that have PFA platforms. And you've heard us talk on many calls now on the differentiation of FARAPULSE in terms of its safety profile, the clinical data and the -- really, the usage of physicians who never considered using Boston Scientific EP prior, many of them have completely converted to using FARAPULSE for their A-fibrillation procedures. But we're still relatively early in our launch in the U.S. It's less than six months of launching in the U.S. and we have yet to launch in China, and we've yet to launch in Japan, and we have a lot more to do in Europe and we have additional indications coming and additional portfolio coming. So we think the short story is the FARAPULSE platform, combined with Baylis, combined with our clinical will be a differentiated growth driver for Boston for many years to come. Now will it grow as it continues to scale up over 100% a quarter, unlikely, but we expect this to be maybe the biggest business of Boston Scientific in the years to come here. And on the financial side, as you know, you've seen some of the competitive reports. Mapping is a sizable chunk of the overall EP procedure. And when FARAPULSE is being used, you're seeing increased procedure volume based on the efficiency. So some competitors are benefiting from that productivity gain of FARAPULSE. So in addition to strong utilization rates and opening new centers, more broadly impacted in 2025, we do expect a number of physicians to adopt this Fairview platform that Ken said which is additional revenue that you're not seeing today in the FARAPULSE EP procedure. Yes. So thanks for the question. Unfortunately, we're not going to break out for you the capital and disposable. Disposable is obviously more sizable than the capital, but that's probably the color we'll provide on that. And on the overall pricing, as you do know the pricing is a bit of a premium. But based on the clinical benefits and efficacy and efficiency that physicians and customers are enjoying that seemed to be the proper price point. And on TPT, Ken, do you have any comments on that? Again, I guess Ken and I will try to tag team this. Thank you for the question. It's maybe the best market in med tech. It's about a $10 billion market. The chunk that we're doing well in now is the $6 billion afib market that we continue to strengthen, and we'll get approval, as you know in Asia impact in 2025. There are a number of other areas that we're trying to move into the mapping segment based on the previous commentary is one. We do have an organic ICE program, which we hopefully will -- which is a 510(k) product, hopefully, we'll be competitive with the new ICE platform during this LRP period, which is another large slice of it. And Ken can probably detail out a bit more the clinical studies that we're doing to widen the indication for FARAPULSE beyond what is used today. Sure. Silk is really a terrific asset we've looked at for a long time. Hopefully, we aim to close that in the second half this year. As a stand-alone business, they were really kind of leading the rejuvenation of that field through their clinical evidence and their performance over many years in the U.S. And it came to a point where we felt it was mature enough in terms of its sales ramp and for us to acquire it at the right price. So I guess, first of all, it always starts with clinical indications. We're really pleased with the data and the long-term durability of this procedure. So as a stand-alone company, they're growing certainly accretive to Boston Scientific faster, but clearly not there on the margin front. So now in Boston Scientific sense we feel like we can grow the company faster in the U.S. given the category leadership portfolio we have and a common call point with a vascular surgeon. We also have the ability to take it outside the U.S. to appropriate countries. And we also aim to improve the margin profile of the business by integrating the company as appropriately within our operations supply chain team like we've done for many other acquisitions in the past. So it's an accretive asset that we think will be stronger and more profitable in the hands of Boston and make us more important for the vascular surgeon, which is an area that as the needs improvement for us, I would say, within that business unit. So now we have the lever -- not the leverage, but the capabilities to present to vascular surgeons our broader PI portfolio, given the relationships that the Silk Road team has with the vascular surgeon. On TAVI, the European team has done really an outstanding quarter and outstanding quarters back to back with ACURATE Neo2, over 20% growth. Importantly, we expect to launch in fourth quarter or maybe first quarter 2025 Prime, which is our next-generation ACURATE Neo2 that has all risk indications and the full-size matrix, which has been the challenge for us to date with an optimized delivery in the valve frame. On the -- just to reiterate on the U.S. timing, we did complete enrollment of the 1,500 patient cohort. And we do expect to present the data in the first half of 2025 likely at the ACC meeting. I think it's important to note that this is the largest randomized trial that's been done in TAVI really based on the timing of the last patient follow-up and the size of the trial and the multiple risk and mixed control groups that we have in it. It's an extensive trial and we believe that the first half 2025 and likely at ACC is the appropriate timing. Thank you for pointing that out because I was getting hammered by tax from our agent team and our CRM team for not mentioning those in the prior question. So I think if you were to continue to add on that discussion, which is how do we maintain and sustain high performance, that's highly differentiated from the peer group for the -- for many years to come. It's all the things we talked about before with PFA and WATCHMAN indication expansion. And as you said, with the AGENT, kudos to that team, they're really transforming that portfolio. Drug-eluting stents next year will probably be 2% of overall Boston Scientific. And you're seeing tremendous growth in our imaging business with our IVUS imaging platform. And now we're the first one to have approval for AGENTS, and that TPT decision will be made soon and apply and hopefully, in January. And that is a market that we plan to drive where we have a multiyear advantage, where we have superiority data for what is at least 10% of the market with restenosis and appropriate price points. That's going to accelerate the growth of that division and significantly improve the margin profile over time. Why we continue to invest in clinical science and our structural heart portfolio and also, we have a very vast VC portfolio. And oftentimes, those VC investments come with dilution, which our team is able to manage consistently while investing for the future, while improving margins at the same time. So I think that's a big part of it. As you do know, the CRM business is a bit of a lag for us. International business did quite well. U.S. lagged a little bit and the Modular ATP, proud of the team for that. That was a long study, a very difficult project. But you saw the results of that S-ICD with the modular platform and we're excited to launch that in 2025. So there are two other areas that I didn't mention before that you pointed out. And also, what's not being mentioned here today is just the tremendous growth in our Endo and Uro businesses. Our Uro business is near double digits for the first half. Our Endo business is near double digit for the first half. Those are all accretive margin companies for us. We're very excited about the Axonics acquisition, which will have operational benefit in 2025 and organic in 2026 primarily. But it just makes those divisions even stronger. So there's many things to be excited about for the future of the company to continue on with a goal of differentiated performance. Yes, I'll just touch on the growth, 20% is excellent. We're in the midst of launching our WATCHMAN FLX Pro and maybe as importantly, this new steerable sheet, which is early in its launch. And so I think to clinical data and the extremely high market share of WATCHMAN speaks for itself and the ongoing R&D platforms that we're driving for WATCHMAN and clinical science. So we are extremely comfortable that we're nearly 90% of share in the U.S. and there may be some extremely price-sensitive accounts that will occasionally lose business to. But it's very, very small margin. Very, very small numbers. And if you look at the size of the WATCHMAN business and our share and our technology lead, we're very comfortable with the position we're in. Yes, please. Yes, I think the only piece of that we'll provide color on is the last part of it. We don't want to break out catheter usage, capital usage, how many sites. I would say the utilization rates of sites once they use FARAPULSE is very quick and sustainable. So we're not seeing hospitals turn it on and turn it off and go in and out of it, like you see in many med tech products. So the sustainability and usage of FARAPULSE is very high once customers start using it. And obviously, we have a chance to sell more consoles to larger centers in the existing accounts besides opening new accounts. And the second part was what -- having a senior moment.

            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Second quarter 2024 consolidated revenue of $4.120 billion represents 14.5% reported growth versus second quarter 2023 and includes a 160 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, which was slightly unfavorable, versus our expectations. Excluding this $57 million foreign exchange headwind, operational revenue growth was 16.1% in the quarter. The sales impact from closed acquisitions was 140 basis points, resulting in 14.7% organic revenue growth, exceeding our second quarter guidance range of 10% to 12%. Q2 2024 adjusted earnings per share of $0.62, grew 15.4% versus 2023, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.57 to $0.59, primarily driven by our strong sales performance. Adjusted gross margin for the second quarter was 70.4%, contracting 160 basis points versus the prior year period, driven by higher than expected inventory charges related to the POLARx cryoablation system, given the strong commercial adoption of FARAPULSE in the U.S., as well as increased levels of capital placements in the quarter. We continue to expect second half adjusted gross margin to be higher than the first half, driven by the mixed benefit from key product launches and full recognition of our annual standard cost improvements. We expect full-year adjusted gross margin to be slightly below our 2023 rate. Second quarter adjusted operating margin was 27.2%, which expanded 40 basis points versus the prior year period. Given our strong first half operating margin and our expectations for the second half, we are raising our full-year 2024 adjusted operating margin expansion goal to 50 to 70 basis points from 30 to 50 basis points compared to 2023. We believe this strikes a nice balance of delivering incremental margin from our sales upside and continuing to invest appropriately to drive strong top line performance. On a GAAP basis, second quarter operating margin was 12.6%, which included intangible asset impairment charges related to the acquisitions of Cryterion Medical and Devoro Medical. The Cryterion impairment charges were related to the high conversion rates of cryoablation to FARAPULSE for ablation procedures in the U.S. The Devoro impairment charges were related to the decision to discontinue work advancing the Wolf thrombectomy platform. Moving to below the line, second quarter adjusted interest and other expenses totaled $68 million, which was favorable to our expectations. On an adjusted basis, our tax rate for the second quarter was 13.1%, which includes favorable discrete tax items. Our operational tax rate for the quarter was 13.6%. Fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding ended at 1.484 billion shares in the second quarter. Free cash flow for the second quarter was $660 million with $814 million from operating activities, less $155 million in net capital expenditures, which includes payments of $200 million related to acquisitions, restructuring, litigation, and other special items. In 2024, we continue to expect full year free cash flow to exceed $2 billion, which includes approximately $700 million of expected payments related to special items. As of June 30, 2024 we had cash on hand of $2.9 billion and our gross debt leverage ratio was 2.4 times. Our top capital allocation priority remains strategic tuck-in M&A, followed by annual share repurchases to offset dilution from employee stock grants. In alignment with our acquisition strategy, in Q2 we announced our agreement to acquire Silk Road Medical and closed the acquisition of SoundCath [ph], a pre-revenue, privately held medical technology company developing an intracardiac echocardiography product complementing our existing electrophysiology portfolio. Our legal reserve was $251 million as of June 30th, a decrease of $32 million versus Q1 2024. $54 million of this reserve is already funded through our qualified settlement funds. I will now walk through guidance for Q3 and full year 2024. We expect full year 2024 reported revenue growth to be in a range of 13.5% to 14.5% versus 2023. Excluding an approximate 100 basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates, we expect full year 2024 operational revenue growth to be 14.5% to 15.5%. Excluding a 150 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect full year 2024 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 13% to 14% versus 2023. We expect third quarter 2024 reported revenue growth to be in a range of 13% to 15% versus third quarter 2023. Excluding an approximate 100 basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates, we expect third quarter 2024 operational revenue growth to be 14% to 16%. Excluding a 100 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect third quarter 2024 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 13% to 15% versus 2023. We now expect full year 2024 adjusted below the line expenses to be approximately $300 million. Given discrete items recognized in the first half of 2024, we now expect a full year 2024 operational tax rate of approximately 13.5% and an adjusted tax rate of approximately 12.5%, which contemplates current legislation, including enacted laws and issued guidance under OECD pillar two rules. We expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.38 to $2.42, representing growth of 16% to 18% versus 2023, including an approximate $0.04 headwind from foreign exchange, which is unchanged from our previous expectations. We expect third quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.57 to $0.59. For more information, please check our investor relations website for Q2 2024 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more details on Q2 results and 2024 guidance. And with that, I'll turn it back to Jon, who will moderate the Q&A. Thanks, Robbie. Sure. I can start on the gross margin and then Mike can take the TAVR one. So where are we on the journey? As Mike said, we're early in the journey in the United States relative to the FARAPULSE launch. That corresponds pretty well with the gross margin story. So if you think of where we are, the standard margin for FARAPULSE is absolutely accretive relative to the catheter. So that's a great accretive gross margin growth driver. The things that in the initial stages are a little bit dilutive are obviously, you heard me talk about the inventory charges with respect to POLARx. So we don't want to take inventory charges, but when it's -- when you're taking them as a result of the success of FARAPULSE, that's -- it should be temporary and should not be something that continues. So those should get better over time. The manufacturing brands, so we have built our manufacturing capacity and our operations and supply chain team to be the leaders in this space. So we have significant capacity. So as we're making the product today, it's a little under absorbed relative to that. So that will get better, obviously, as we make more and that's obviously our plan. And then the capital placements are dilutive. Again, it's not a huge number relative to the overall gross margin for the company, but it does at the edges, kind of take that down a bit. So overall, I would say FARAPULSE, every quarter, FARAPULSE will be a better contributor to margin. And I think as you get into 2025 and 2026, it will be a significantly accretive growth driver for gross margin for the company. And then just as a quick follow-up to the gross margin question, Travis. None of that is a surprise relative to gross margin. So we've been saying all along the gross margin is not likely to help the margin improvement story in 2024. But lo and behold, we're able to increase the overall operating margin from 30 to 50 to 50 to 70. So I think all is well on the margin expansion front. Really proud of that 50 to 70 relative to the guidance for this year. And as you look to 2025 and beyond, I think gross margin, I think all lines of the P&L can contribute to the margin expansion journey and gross margin will be one of those. And the second part of your question relative to the balance between reinvesting the sales upside and dropping some through. I think you're seeing the evidence of that here in our guidance raise for the 50 to 70. So I think we've struck a really good balance on that. So we've had sales upside during the year and the realization that we closed the first half a little bit ahead of expectations. So we're giving some of that back. So we're taking the 30 to 50 to the 50 to 70. So that's great. At the same time, we are reinvesting in the business, primarily in the commercial facing functions. We're leveraging the back office and the administrative areas, which makes sense. We don't need to grow those when you're growing the revenue at the rate that we're at. So we've got significant leverage opportunities there. And then as Mike said, this isn't just reinvesting in FARAPULSE. This is reinvesting across the whole portfolio, the broad portfolio that we have. So we picked the right spots to reinvest to be able to continue to deliver that top line performance for the long term. And I think we're striking a nice balance there."

            "name": "Kenneth Stein",
            "content": "And Larry, maybe just to sort of add on Mike said first just -- I mean, AF is the most common sustained arrhythmia in the world. Ablation therapy for AF today is still dramatically underpenetrated, right. I mean ablation, high single-digit penetration for persistent afib, low double-digit penetration for paroxysmal afib and the safety advantages, the efficacy advantages, the efficiency advantages and just the overall simplicity of the FARAPULSE system, I think are just going to continue to drive the size of that market and penetration into that market. In terms of the competition, right, again, we do expect to see competitors bring out their first-generation products late this year, early next year, they're already approved in Europe. And frankly, as Mike said earlier, right, we have not seen that materially impact the rapid sustained adoption of FARAPULSE in Europe. And FARAPULSE is a transformative technology with really important differentiated advantages against these competitors. As Mike said, right, treated over 70,000 patients to date, published clinical trial data on over 20,000 patients to date, which really testifies to the safety, to the simplicity, to the efficiency and again, Mike referred to the data we presented at Heart Rhythm Society. It's the only system right now with any data testifying to actually superiority in an efficacy measure against traditional ablation. Yes. Thanks, Rick. I appreciate the question. Again, we still are projecting approval of both our NAV-enabled FARAWAVE catheter and a completely new software suite on RHYTHMIA that we're calling FARAVIEW to help support that. And we certainly do expect that to help drive more adoption of the use of RHYTHMIA and FARAVIEW to accompany FARAWAVE. Now I want to begin though by saying, FARAPULSE will remain an open system. We want to support workflows that don't involve any use of mapping or navigation, support workflows that involve these competitive systems, but also we'll expect with FARAVIEW and FARAWAVE NAV to provide some major advantages in terms of workflow. I think important for me I think emphasize that existing mapping and navigation systems don't understand PFA at all. They were built around an RF ablation paradigm. And so FARAVIEW is going to be the first software and a mapping system that fundamentally understands what we do with PFA and with FARAPULSE. There are some important features, dynamic visualization of the catheter as it changes shape from basket flower configuration, field tagging specific to PFA energy. I think when you put all of that together it has the potential to minimize the use of fluoroscopy during these procedures, minimize catheter exchanges, and really continue what we've tried to do and I think have accomplished with FARAPULSE to begin, right, which is to create a procedure that is safer, that is at least as effective, and that is far more simple and efficient compared to what people have been doing with legacy systems. Yes, Vijay. So we have submitted for TPT. Again, I think important to recognize there are some very strict criteria for eligibility for TPT. And I think just to reiterate what Mike said, which is, right now, we are not seeing pricing as a barrier to the rapid and sustained adoption of FARAPULSE. Yes. Thanks, Mike. So David, let me start with the clinical strategy and then maybe say a little more about where we're going from a technology standpoint as well because I think it's important, right. That all the other stuff we're doing doesn't just get lost in the excitement around FARAPULSE as exciting as FARAPULSE is. From clinical trial standpoint, to begin with our ADVANTAGE clinical trial, which is aimed to get labeling for FARAPULSE persistent Afib has completed enrollment. We expect to present those results late this year, early next year. We are well underway in a trial called AVANT GUARD , which is aimed to prove that FARAPULSE used as first-line therapy for patients with persistent atrial fibrillation. We've announced the intent to run a trial called REMATCH, which will look at FARAPULSE for redo ablations. From a technology standpoint, we've already talked about the FARAWAVE NAV catheter. In addition to that, we have a point catheter, FARAPOINT that's through its clinical trial. And then down the road, I think more sophisticated catheters for both mapping and ablation catheter called FARAFLEX. And I think as you can imagine, we are interested in the use of this for many arrhythmias beyond atrial fibrillation, atrial tachycardia, and ventricular tachycardia, that pretty much you name it. But I don't want some of the other technology innovations to get lost. And so right, the EP performance was not only a FARAPULSE story, fantastic performance from our Access Solutions portfolio. And in terms of pull-through, right, see very good synergy between FARAPULSE and the Access solution products, likewise, in really good synergy between the WATCHMAN and the Access Solution products. Again, I think in terms of the pull-through question, with the most obvious opportunity, as Mike mentioned, is the opportunity now to have reimbursement in the U.S. for concomitant FARAPULSE ablation and WATCHMAN procedures, which we expect will be a growth driver and hope to see that finalized before the end of this year by CMS. Again, Dan mentioned our acquisition of SoundCath, so an ICE product to support EP procedures and potentially also WATCHMAN procedures, probably just a very long-winded way of saying we love FARAPULSE, but it is far from the only story. Yes, Josh, maybe I'll take the TAVR question first and then let Dan and Mike take the others. Just really what Mike said, last patient follow-up in the trial was just in this quarter, it's a very large, very complex trial. And just honestly, based on the timing of getting the data cleaned and getting the readouts from all of the various core labs [ph] that are engaged in getting us the analysis for the trial, we are going to miss the abstract deadlines for all of the major fall meetings. So those deadlines literally come up within a couple of weeks. And again, these data are so important and pivotal, right, we want to present this at a major meeting. And so right, the first major cardiology meeting, where we'll be able to meet an abstract deadline is going to be the ACC. Would not expect you to see any data released ahead of that. Yes. And then in terms of just workflow and concomitant, this is one of the areas where I think in between, right, the safety and efficiency advantages of WATCHMAN FLX and FLX Pro combined with the efficiency and safety advantages of FARAPULSE could create a real advantage for us as a unified ecosystem. The beauty of doing these two procedures together, right, is they both involve transseptal access into the left atrium. They both involve the catheter manipulation inside the left atrium. So there's a huge benefit to patients to be able to have it all done at one sitting as opposed to having to have one procedure and then go through many of the same risks of the first procedure go and have it done as a second procedure. And just to reiterate, when you think of doing it as a concomitant procedure what you want our technologies that enable you to do it safely and we do it reproducibly and enable you to do it efficiently. So you're spending as little time as possible, right, mucking about inside someone's left atrium. And FARAPULSE and WATCHMAN FLX Pro together are unmatched in giving you those advantages."

Mike? \nMichael Mahoney: Thanks, Jon. Thank you to everyone for joining us today. Our first quarter results surpassed our expectations, fueled by our innovative portfolio, including the nearly 90 new products we launched globally in 2023, the execution of our category leadership strategy and the winning spirit of our global team.  \n In the first quarter '24, total company operational sales grew 15% and organic sales grew 13% versus first quarter '23, which exceeds the high end of our guidance range of 7% to 9%. Our strong growth continues to be diversified across businesses and regions. In the quarter, 6 of our 8 business units in all of our regions grew double digits. We believe that most business units grew faster than their respective markets with differentiated portfolios and strong commercial execution, supported by healthy procedural demand.  \n First quarter adjusted EPS was $0.56, which grew 21% versus 2023, which exceeds the high end of our guidance range of $0.50 to $0.52. First quarter adjusted operating margin was 26.2%. \n Turning to our second quarter and full year '24 outlook. We are guiding to organic growth of 10% to 12% for second quarter '24 and raising our full year guidance from 8% to 9% to 10% to 12%, reflecting momentum from our innovative portfolio, healthy procedural volumes and continued execution by our global team.  \n Our second quarter '24 adjusted EPS guidance is $0.57 to $0.59 and we expect our full year adjusted EPS to be $2.29 to $2.34, representing growth of 12% to 14%. \n Dan will provide more details on our financials and I'll provide additional highlights on our first quarter, along with comments on our '24 outlook.  \n Regionally, on an operational basis, the U.S. grew 13% versus first quarter with particular strength in EP, fueled by the launch of FARAPULSE midway through the quarter, as well as on our WATCHMAN ICTx Urology and Endoscopy business units. \n Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 13% on an operational basis versus first quarter '23. This above-market growth was led by exceptional performance in EP as well as double-digit growth in our Endoscopy, Urology and PI businesses. We expect to continue to outpace the market, driven by continued broad-based momentum across our business and investment in emerging markets.  \n Asia Pac grew 26% operationally versus first quarter '23, led by strong double-digit performance in all of our Cardiovascular business units. Japan grew double digits driven by AGENT DCB, Rezum and our Access Solutions products. China delivered excellent results, growing strong double digits with 7 of our 8 business units growing double digits. \n I'll now provide some additional commentary on our business units.  In Urology, sales grew 10%, both operationally and organically versus first quarter '23, with double-digit growth in stone management as well as prosthetic urology. Rezum performed well in the quarter, both in the U.S. and internationally, and secured reimbursement status in France. We look forward to closing the previously announced acquisition of Axonics now expected in the second half of 2024.  \n Endoscopy sales grew 12% operationally and 10% organically versus first quarter '23. Strong first quarter results were driven by the breadth of our portfolio, underpinned by differentiated anchor products such as AXIOS and our single-use imaging products. \n Within the quarter, we also received CE Mark for our MANTIS Clip and NICE in the U.K. issued positive guidance for the ESG endoscopic bariatric surgery procedure, both expected to further momentum in our growing endoluminal surgery franchise.  \n Neuromodulation sales grew 10% operationally and declined 1% organically versus first quarter '23. Our brain franchise grew high single digits in the quarter with low double-digit U.S. growth driven by our comprehensive directional stimulation offering enabled by image-guided programming. \n In the first quarter, our pain franchise grew low double digits operationally, but declined mid-single digits on an organic basis, with continued pressure in our U.S. SCS business.  \n In the U.S., during the first quarter, we did receive FDA approval and recently launched the WaveWriter symptom (sic) [ system ] nonsurgical back pain indication and our next-generation FAST AutoDose. \n Importantly, the Relievant business continues to perform very well with steady expansion of payer coverage, and we expect sales from the novel Intracept procedure to grow about 50% in 2024.  \n Peripheral Intervention sales grew 16% operationally and 11% organically versus first quarter '23. Double-digit growth in arterial was bolstered by our drug-eluting portfolio supported by the strength of clinical evidence and global commercial execution. \n In venous, we saw continued above-market growth from Varithena and clot management continued to perform well, in line with expectations. \n Our interventional oncology franchise grew strong double digits in the first quarter, driven by our broad offering of embolization devices, including the Embold coil family in cancer therapies.  \n In the quarter, TheraSphere also grew double digits and data from the real-world study, PROACTIF, was presented, demonstrating positive outcomes in patients with intermediate and advanced HCC who were treated with TheraSphere.  \n Cardiology sales delivered another excellent quarter with both operational and organic sales growing 18% versus first quarter 2023. \n Within Cardiology, Interventional Cardiology Therapy sales grew an impressive 13% organically versus first quarter '23. \n Growth in Coronary Therapies was driven by continued strength in our international regions, led by our imaging portfolio and AGENT DCB in Japan. \n In the U.S., we're also pleased with the ongoing launch of AVVIGO+, which is our AI-guided imaging platform. We also received FDA approval of our AGENT DCB in first quarter, and we expect to initiate a limited launch in the second quarter as we ramp supply following the earlier-than-anticipated regulatory approval.  \n Our Structural Heart Valves franchise once again grew mid-teens in first quarter, led by ACURATE neo2, which continues to see growth from both new and existing accounts. We have now submitted for CE Mark for our next-generation ACURATE Prime valve, which we continue to expect to launch in Europe in 2025. \n WATCHMAN had another strong quarter, growing 19% organically and maintaining our market-leading share position. In the U.S., WATCHMAN FLX Pro moved into full launch and we received FDA clearance for the TruSteer steerable sheath, allowing physicians to achieve more optimal device positioning in the widest range of LAA anatomies. \n International growth was driven by ongoing momentum in -- ongoing momentum within the quarter, and we received approval and launched WATCHMAN FLX Pro in Japan and Canada, which will support continued growth in these markets.  \n Cardiac Rhythm Management sales grew 5% organically in the first quarter '23. In the first quarter, our Diagnostics franchise also grew double digits, led by strong market adoption of our second-generation LUX-Dx ICM device. \n In core CRM, our low-voltage business grew mid-single digits and our high-voltage business grew low single digits. Our Emblem S-ICD continues to maintain its strong share position and we've seen very limited impact in Europe or the U.S. from a recent competitor's launch. \n We expect to remain the clear market leader in this space and look forward to the upcoming data presentation at HRS of MODULAR ATP, which is a pivotal trial studying the use of the Emblem S-ICD in conjunction with our EMPOWER leadless pacemaker to function as a single-chamber pacemaker, as well as to provide anti-tachycardia pacing when needed. We anticipate FDA approval of the modular CRM system and stand-alone EMPOWER leadless pacemaker in '25.  \n Electrophysiology sales grew 72% both operationally and organically versus first quarter '23 driven by the adoption of the transformative FARAPULSE platform. \n International first quarter sales grew 59%, with continued FARAPULSE account openings and robust utilization in Europe. \n U.S. first quarter sales grew 85% organically, propelled by the mid-first quarter launch of FARAPULSE. We have already made good progress entering to high-volume accounts, supported by compelling clinical evidence, commercial execution and investment in our supply chain.  \n Early feedback on FARAPULSE has been extremely positive with rapid adoption from both RF and cryo users. Electrophysiologists appreciate FARAPULSE's unique safety profile, ease of use, effectiveness and efficiency of the procedure. We expect our broad EP portfolio, coupled with our other AF solutions, to drive significant global growth in '24 and beyond.  \n We also intend to extend our leadership in PFA by investing in innovation, clinical evidence and global capabilities. Within the quarter, we commenced enrollment of the NAVIGATE-PF clinical trial, studying integrated cardiac mapping with a FARAVIEW software and FARAWAVE non-enabled catheter, both of which are expected to launch in the U.S. during the second half of the year. \n We also completed enrollment of Phase II in the ADVANTAGE AF clinical trial, studying our FARAPOINT device for CTI ablations, which is expected to launch in the U.S. in 2025. And we also anticipate data from Phase I of the ADVANTAGE trial for persistent AF to be presented in fourth quarter 2024.  \n We also look forward to our clinical late-breakers at the upcoming HRS meeting in May, which aims to highlight the unique capabilities of FARAPULSE. \n Also of note, this week, we released our 2023 Performance Report, highlighting the company's actions to improve patient outcomes while prioritizing our environmental, social and governance goals. We continue to make progress in all 3 key areas: innovating care to meet patient needs, empowering people and shaping a healthier planet while performing with integrity. While we always have more to do, I know that our values-driven culture and the commitment of our global teams to challenge -- to this challenge of what's possible will continue to raise the bar. \n In closing, I'm very grateful to our global employees who work every day to advance science for life. We remain committed to investing for the long term while delivering top-tier financial performance in 2024 and beyond.  \n And with that, I'll hand over to Dan to provide more details on the financials. \nDaniel Brennan: Thanks, Mike. First quarter 2024 consolidated revenue of $3.856 billion represents 13.8% reported growth versus first quarter 2023 and includes a 120 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, in line with our expectations. Excluding this $40 million headwind from foreign exchange, operational revenue growth was 15% in the quarter. Sales from the closed acquisitions and divestitures contributed 190 basis points, resulting in 13.1% organic revenue growth, exceeding our first quarter guidance range of 7% to 9%.  \n Q1 2024 adjusted earnings per share of $0.56 grew 20.6% versus 2023 exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.50 to $0.52, primarily driven by our strong sales performance. \n Adjusted gross margin for the first quarter was 69.8%, which includes an approximate 30 basis point year-over-year headwind from foreign exchange. Adjusted gross margin was slightly lower than anticipated, primarily driven by inventory charges and less favorable product mix due to increased levels of capital placements in the quarter.  \n Despite a lower Q1, we continue to expect full year adjusted gross margin to be at or slightly below our 2023 full year rate, driven by increasing mix benefit from our new launches, lower inventory charges and the full recognition of our annual standard manufacturing cost improvements in the second half of the year. \n First quarter adjusted operating margin was 26.2%. We remain committed to expanding adjusted operating margin by 30 to 50 basis points in 2024 as we balance progress towards our long-range plan goal of 150 basis points of improvement from 2024 to 2026 with the flexibility to make critical investments to support key launches.  \n On a GAAP basis, first quarter operating margin was 17.5%.  \n Moving to below the line. First quarter adjusted interest and other expenses totaled $80 million. \n On an adjusted basis, our tax rate for the first quarter was 10.7%, which includes favorable discrete tax items and the benefit from stock compensation accounting. Our operational tax rate was 13.7% for the quarter. \n Fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding ended at 1.482 billion shares in the first quarter. \n Free cash flow for the first quarter was a negative $15 million with $164 million from operating activities less $179 million in net capital expenditures, which includes payments of $251 million related to acquisitions, restructuring, litigation and other special items.  \n In 2024, we continue to expect full year free cash flow to exceed $2 billion, which includes approximately $800 million of expected payments related to special items. \n As of March 31, 2024, we had cash on hand of $2.3 billion, inclusive of the $2 billion -- 2 billion euro-denominated senior note offering completed on February 27, which we intend to use to partially fund the Axonics acquisition.  \n During the first quarter, we repaid approximately $500 million of senior notes upon maturity, and our gross debt leverage was 2.5x as of March 31. \n Our top capital allocation priority remains strategic tuck-in M&A, followed by annual share repurchases to offset dilution from employee stock grants. In alignment with our acquisition strategy, we recently closed the acquisition of the endoluminal vacuum therapy portfolio from B. Braun, which complements our existing endoscopy portfolio and is expected to be immaterial to earnings per share in 2024.  \n Our legal reserve was $283 million as of March 31, a decrease of $94 million versus Q4 2023. And $71 million of this reserve is already funded through our qualified settlement funds. \n I'll now walk through guidance for Q2 and the full year 2024. We expect full year 2024 reported revenue growth to be in a range of 11% to 13% versus 2023. Excluding an approximate 50 basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates, we expect full year 2024 operational revenue growth to be 11.5% to 13.5%. Excluding a 150 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect full year 2024 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 10% to 12% versus 2023. \n We expect second quarter 2024 reported revenue growth to be in a range of 10.5% to 12.5% versus second quarter 2023. Excluding an approximate 100 basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates, we expect second quarter 2024 operational revenue growth to be 11.5% to 13.5%. And excluding a 150 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect second quarter 2024 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 10% to 12% versus 2023. \n We now expect full year 2024 adjusted below-the-line expense to be approximately $315 million.  \n Under current legislation, including enacted laws and issued guidance under OECD Pillar 2 rules, we continue to forecast a full year 2024 operational tax rate of approximately 14% and an adjusted tax rate of approximately 13%. \n We expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.29 and to $2.34, representing 12% to 14% growth versus 2023, including an approximate $0.04 headwind from foreign exchange, which is unchanged from our previous expectations. \n We expect second quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.57 to $0.59.  \n For more information, please check our Investor Relations website for Q1 2024 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more details on Q1 results and our 2024 guidance. \n And with that, I'll turn it back to Jon, who will moderate the Q&A. \nJonathan Monson: Thanks, Dan. Drew, let's open it up for questions for the next 40 minutes or so [Operator Instructions] Drew, please go ahead. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. \nRobert Marcus: Great. Congrats on a fantastic quarter. I guess with my one question, it has to be on FARAPULSE and EP in general. The beat was substantial, both U.S. and OUS. The doc feedback we hear is phenomenal on FARAPULSE PFA in general. \n So I'd just love to get your view on what you're seeing in the field, the willingness to adopt the new technology, how fast it could go and how much of the guidance raise is just from FARAPULSE here and the opportunity. \nMichael Mahoney: Yes. First, I want to shout out to early pioneering work by Chris O'Hara, the amazing work by the FARAPULSE team and really the work our team has done over multiple years. This is the most transformational product that I've seen in my career with the company. And Dr. Stein can comment on clinically, but we continue to invest significantly in the current platform and in future products and a significant amount of clinical science to really widen the gap in PFA with our FARAPULSE system.  \n And as I mentioned in the script, we're seeing very rapid adoption from both RF and cryo users. We continue to invest in our commercial footprint in the U.S. And we're able to meet the demand thus far with our talented supply chain teams. \n But we're also excited about the ongoing momentum in Europe, where we've been live for a number of years. But we continue to increase utilization in Europe and open new centers now that they have a bit more supply than they did in 2023. \n And we're also working diligently with our teams in Asia, in Japan and China, to train them up so they can also take advantage of FARAPULSE really kind of more of a fourth quarter 2025 story in Asia. \n So it really -- it's a remarkable platform and we're seeing excellent safety results, ease of use, rapid adoption and excellent effectiveness. Dr. Stein, if you want to comment? \nKen Stein: Yes. Thanks. Thanks, Mike. Thanks, Robbie. Maybe the one thing I'd add, I'd just -- the caution here is against thinking of PFA in general, that every PFA system is very different and I think everyone really needs to be evaluated on its own. So the results you get with PFA are just completely dependent on catheter design, on waveform and on dosing strategy. And as Mike said, what people see when they use FARAPULSE clinically, when people see the data and we've now got published data including randomized clinical trial data, registry data, total data at well over 18,000 patients have reported at this point, and as Mike said, it just has compelling advantages in terms of safety, in terms of efficacy, in terms of ease of use and in terms of efficiency. And that's what you see driving the rapid uptake, both in the U.S. and globally. \nOperator: The next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. \nLarry Biegelsen: I echo Robbie's congratulations on a really strong quarter here. Just with my one question, I feel compelled to ask a big-picture question here. You updated your LRP in September of last year to 8% to 10% organic growth for 2024 to 2026. The assumption at the time was that growth in '25 would accelerate over 2024. You're guiding today to 10% to 12% organic growth. \n So the question is, do you still expect growth to accelerate in 2025? And how should we think about the 8% to 10% CAGR in the context of this strong 2024 guidance? \nMichael Mahoney: Yes. So we outlined at Investor Day the 8% to 10% and our goal to be a very high-performing med tech company. And so we're super pleased with the first quarter results that also led to -- and the business momentum led to the guidance you referred to at 10% to $12. So we're pleased with taking our full year guidance up. We did also receive FARAPULSE earlier than we expected. \n So at this point, we'll hold off and look at our 2025 guidance later in the year. But we're super pleased with the momentum that we have across all regions and all business units. But at this point, we're not going to commit to accelerating growth in 2025. Certainly, our aim would be to do that, but it would be premature to confirm that at this point. \nOperator: The next question comes from Rick Wise with Stifel. \nFrederick Wise: I guess I'd focus on perhaps ACURATE neo. It sounds like it's performing well internationally. But can you maybe expand on where you are both internationally, the new product you spoke about and you're feeling about next steps in the United States? Are you feeling more optimistic, more cautious about timing? And just any incremental color would be just great. \nMichael Mahoney: Sure. Thanks, Rick. We're very pleased with the results in Europe. We continue to grow above market in Europe and have excellent adoption across most major countries in Europe. And importantly, as you said, we've invested quite a bit in this portfolio and we're excited about the Prime submission that we just recently did in Europe, which will enhance the valve further and provide additional valve sizes as well. So we expect that to go well in Europe. \n In the U.S., there's really not going to be any new commentary that we haven't stated publicly. We are waiting for the full year follow-up. We also will be working with the regulators, and we'll communicate in the future date the timing of the release of that clinical data and our next steps in the U.S. \nOperator: The next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citi. \nJoanne\u00a0Wuensch: Another nice quarter. A question on operating margins. I think your LRP was 450 basis points over -- was it over the 2-year period, I would assume? But anyway... \nDaniel Brennan: No, it was over -- it was -- not to interrupt you, Joanne. It was just over the 3-year period. 2024 to 2026 was 150 basis points. \nJoanne\u00a0Wuensch: Excellent. Thank you for that clarification. But as I'm looking at the quarter delivery, it looks like some of the leverage came from R&D, some of it came from SG&A. I'm just curious how you're thinking about providing that leverage over the 3-year period. \nDaniel Brennan: Yes. I think over the 3-year period, all lines will contribute. And I think it's really a great part of the history of the company and the kind of the DNA of the margin expansion story is that at any given point in time, all lines can contribute. So gross margin at that 69.8%, I didn't love that this quarter, but I'm optimistic that, that improves through the year. \n But we said at Investor Day and we reiterated it on our January call, that gross margin probably is not going to contribute this year to the 30 to 50 points. So this year, it's more of an OpEx leverage story. But absolutely, in '25 and '26, I think gross margin can contribute. Recall, we used to be at 72.4% gross margin back in 2019. We're maniacally focused on getting back and improving that from where it is today and have the plans to do that. \n So I think the summary is, as we look to improve the 150 basis points over the 3 years, it puts us kind of at the doorstep of 28% at the end of '26, which is a nice spot to be. It puts that 30% long-term goal that we have really in focus. And all lines of the P&L could contribute along that journey. \nOperator: The next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. \nVijay Kumar: Congrats on really solid finish here. Mike, maybe my one question on the EP portfolio. The 70% overall growth, 85% in the U.S., how -- can you give us a little bit of color on was there any stocking dynamic? How much of this was driven by the account openings versus a procedure uptake? \n And sort of related to that, does new tech add-on payment, does it matter where we are on TPT? \nMichael Mahoney: Yes. So the results in the U.S., 85% as you mentioned, it was really a mid-quarter launch. So the teams moved pretty quickly to have some impact in the first quarter. And we look forward to good results, obviously, in the second quarter and the rest of the year based on momentum. \n So there's not any big onetime stocking. So this is driven by new account openings and I would say very rapid adoption of the technology, and therefore, continued utilization of the product once they have the platform. We're also seeing multiple hospitals buying their second console, which also is a great sign because it shows the adoption and using it routinely every day. \n And so it's really new account openings and increased adoption once they start using the platform, and that's driving the U.S. results. \n And as I mentioned, in Europe, which I think is impressive, now that they have a bit more supply, they continue to open more accounts and increase the utilization of existing accounts with the FARAPULSE platform. \n On the TPT, we think it's a bit less significant for FARAPULSE, but it's something we'll continue to evaluate. And we'll provide you updates as we see them. Dr. Stein? \nKen Stein: I described that, that's NTAP. \nMichael Mahoney: I'm sorry. \nKen Stein: Yes. And Vijay, I think just important maybe to point out. First off, right, the NTAP applies to inpatient Medicare fee-for-service, which is really a small minority of AF ablations today. Having said that, we still do believe that FARAPULSE can use the proposed NTAP related to one of our customers. \n And actually, I think it's important from a physician perspective and a hospital perspective, that we're not in a position of having to create unique ICD-10 codes that are product-specific. That's really not helpful to either the physicians or the hospitals. \nOperator: The next question comes from Travis Steed with Bank of America. \nTravis Steed: Congrats again on a good quarter. I wanted to ask about the new DRG for ablation and left atrial appendage closure. And then the overall LAC market, is that -- do you think that market can kind of sustain this 20%-plus growth through -- before the indication expansions? Or do you kind of need to see those indication expansions at some point sooner rather than later? \nMichael Mahoney: I'll make comments and Dr. Stein. We're pleased with our WATCHMAN performance. We grew globally 19%. But keep in mind, that's coming off of nearly a 30% comp from first quarter 2023. And we still maintain, if not enhance, our strong share position. \n And we're excited not only with the share position but with the growth of WATCHMAN, but also some upcoming trials that can further highlight with OPTION and CHAMPION, which we believe, if successful, will significantly widen the market, TAM, for WATCHMAN. So Dr. Stein, if you want to comment on any of that and also the concomitant item. \nKen Stein: Yes. Thanks, Mike. Yes. So Travis, first on the trials, I mean, first of all, this is still a healthy market. This is still a very under-penetrated therapy when you look at patients who were at high risk for stroke and AF who stand to benefit from -- with the WATCHMAN procedure. \n The trials that Mike mentioned, right, the first one is the OPTION trial, that evaluates the use of WATCHMAN as an alternative to oral anticoagulants following ablation. And we hope to be able to present the results of that trial late this year or early next year. Then that's followed CHAMPION, which is the all-comers trial versus the novel oral anticoagulants. Again, we expect that to report out in 2026. So these are now -- in the relatively near term that we're going to see those data points. \n Before that, right, I think it is worth talking a little bit about that concomitant DRG that's part of the proposed rule from CMS. We're really gratified to see that. This is something that's good for everyone. This is good for patients. This is good for hospitals. When you think of valve outpatients who are undergoing an ablation procedure, first off, I'll tell you even back when I was doing these procedures, almost every patient who came in before wanted to know would they be able to stop their oral anticoagulants, and that is still true today. \n And when you think about it from a patient-centered perspective, right, being able to do this all at one setting and avoiding the incremental risks that you have in undergoing two procedures, it really just makes sense. It also makes sense from a hospital standpoint when you just look at the procedural efficiencies and how that's going to help hospitals improve capacity to be doing more AF ablations and doing more WATCHMAN procedures over time. \n So we're excited to see this. We think this is good for patients. We think this is good for hospitals. And we look forward to getting the data out from trials like OPTION and CHAMPION that's even going to further increase the impetus for doing these procedures. \nOperator: The next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with UBS. \nDanielle Antalffy: I'll also say congrats on a really strong quarter. For my one question, I wanted to look at some of the, I'll call them, legacy businesses, not sure if that's fair to describe the maybe slower-growth businesses. \n I mean, a CRM mid-single-digit growth is very strong. Interventional Cardiology of double digits, very strong. Just curious about how to think about those sort of slower growth in Interventional Cardiology. I'm thinking more on the drug-eluting stent portfolio, obviously, and then CRM. Can they sustain these kinds of growth profiles given that the end markets, or from a volume perspective, are arguably probably some of your slower-growth end markets? And what needs to happen from an innovation perspective to sustain that sort of growth? \nMichael Mahoney: Thanks, Danielle. Really appreciate you asking that question. I would say the innovation has already happened. Let me just explain a bit more. We call it ICTx, our interventional cardiology business essentially. And years ago, that was dominated by drug-eluting stents. \n Today, drug-eluting stents, I think, represent close to 4% of our overall mix and likely will be 3% and 2% in the following years. So it's really a very small portion of Boston Scientific and a smaller portion of ICTx. \n So what's driving the 13% growth within ICTx is our advanced imaging portfolio. So you're seeing more and more patients come with more complex calcium and the growing adoption of IVUS imaging, especially with our AVVIGO+ platform to identify that and help the effectiveness of these procedures. \n So you're seeing wide adoption in Europe of our imaging platform, wide adoption in Asia and growing adoption in the U.S. based on this new platform. So it's really the imaging capabilities as well as our complex coronary capabilities to break calcium with Wolverine and our other products. \n And then in Asia, they've been very successful in launching our AGENT drug-coated balloon and we recently received approval for that. We'll have some minor benefit in the second quarter '24 from that product in the U.S., where we expect enhanced growth from that product in the second half of '24 and particularly in 2025. \n So the team there has really done a great job of completely revamping the portfolio and the growth trajectory of ICTx. Also included in that is our Structural Heart business in Europe. \n And CRM, that grew 5% and we kind of essentially grow in line, I would say, with the market with pacemakers and defibrillators. S-ICD business continues to be quite robust. But the bigger growth driver in our CRM business is our diagnostics business. And we invested in that many years ago with our Preventice platform and also with our -- now our second-generation loop recorder ICM device. \n So we've really reshaped the portfolio significantly in both of those markets to continue to support the growth of the company. \nOperator: The next question comes from Josh Jennings with TD Cowen. \nJoshua Jennings: Wanted to ask about the EP business and just opening an update on your view of the diagnostic mapping opportunity. You initiated the NAVIGATE-PF study where the software module is going to be in play. \n I guess the question is really are you seeing increased demand in these early stages of PFA launch for RHYTHMIA? And just how are you viewing the opportunity for Boston to take share in this diagnostic mapping segment of the EP world? \nMichael Mahoney: Dr. Stein, if you could take that one? \nKen Stein: Yes. It's still early in the launch. And I think one thing that I do want to sort of emphasize as you look at how things are playing out in the launch is we're really working with accounts to say don't change a lot of your workflow at the outset. Get used to using FARAPULSE, see how it works in your cases and then start modifying your workflow. \n So really, what we've seen early in launch really are deliberately not a big shift in whether or not people are mapping. Not a big shift in what mapping platform they're using. \n Now having said that, right, we have deliberately built our next-generation product and that's the FARAWAVE Nav-enabled catheter, right, that interfaces with the FARAVIEW software. And as I think everyone has seen, we've initiated our first human use studies of that earlier this year. \n That really will bring some unique advantages to people who want to use a navigation system as they're using FARAPULSE. It is our desire and our belief, right, that there will be people who don't feel the need to use any mapping when they're doing pulmonary vein isolation with FARAPULSE who are adopting a very efficient workflow that's been used in a lot of centers in Europe. There will be others who want to continue to use a navigation mapping system. We have no intention of forcing people to use our system. We're not going to lock it down. But this new software platform really does bring some very compelling advantages to people who will use it. \nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Pasquale with Nephron Research. \nChristopher Pasquale: How are you thinking about the opportunity for AGENT in the U.S.? And you mentioned you're still working to ramp up manufacturing capacity. When do you expect to be in a position to move into a full launch with that product? \nMichael Mahoney: Sure. So we have the NICE approval, excellent trial design by the clinical team and the product is doing extremely well in Japan and we have high hopes for the product has impact in the second half and more in 2025. \n So currently, we're really going through the contracting process with most of the big accounts in the U.S. and that's initiated. And that's going well, given there is a high unmet clinical need with in-stent restenosis and the deliverability that's been proven with AGENT. So there's high physician demand for it. But we are going through the contracting process with the major health systems now, and you'll start seeing some sales in the second quarter. And we expect that to ramp more significantly throughout the second half of the year and accelerate more in '25. \nKen Stein: Yes. And Chris, and just to remind everyone, right? Our current label indication in the U.S. in-stent restenosis, that comprises approximately 10% of current PCI volume. Internationally, we also see DCBs used and we believe there is a potential use case outside of in-stent restenosis, small vessel disease, bifurcation lesions, potentially even some acute coronary syndrome. And once we launch in the U.S., we are evaluating opportunities to expand the label. And those expanded indications could potentially take us up to 20% of current PCI volume. \nOperator: The next question comes from Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler. \nMatthew O'Brien: I don't have perfect numbers here, but in looking at the U.S. EP number in Q1, it looks like you did somewhere around $40 million in FARAPULSE revenue between the generator and the catheter itself. Is that roughly the right number? \n And then when I start to carry this out through the rest of the year plus the guidance increase, I'm getting something more like $300 million to even $400 million of FARAPULSE this year. Is that around the right number? And can you manufacture enough product to support that? \nMichael Mahoney: Yes. We won't confirm your math. At this point, we're not going to be breaking out FARAPULSE cases, numbers, number of accounts, dollars and so forth yet. If you recall back to the WATCHMAN days, we really waited till it was about close to $1 billion platform before we provided that based on the materiality of the company. \n But it's going extremely well. And importantly, we made significant investments in the supply chain 2 and 3 years ago to be ready for where we are today. And the supply chain team continues to perform extremely well, and they're able thus far to meet the demand in Europe and the U.S. and the future in Asia. \nOperator: The next question comes from Matt Taylor with Jefferies. \nMatthew Taylor: I actually wanted to follow up on your AGENT commentary. Two small questions. One is, can you talk about the materiality in Japan? And when you mentioned the indication expansions, could you talk about what those could look like and when we could see them in the U.S.? \nMichael Mahoney: Just maybe really not a whole lot of new color in Japan. But they launched it last year and it was adopted very, very quickly and it's leading to the strong double-digit growth in Japan that we saw in the quarter. \n In terms of indication expansion, Dr. Stein, do you want to take that one? \nKen Stein: Yes, Matt. Again, I think probably the first new indications we think about looking for would be small vessel bifurcation lesions. Still working through regulatory strategy on that. So not prepared to give you a time line for when we would initiate any of that work. \nOperator: The next question comes from Matt Miksic with Barclays. \nMatthew Miksic: Just maybe one follow-up on the cadence for FARAPULSE this year in the U.S. and sort of how the RHYTHMIA adoption navigation kind of plays into that. Any color for what we can expect as you get into the rest of the quarters would be great. \nMichael Mahoney: Thanks, Matt. Probably not too much new commentary here. I think in FARAPULSE overall, it's -- we're developing very strong capabilities to install, support and train doctors and really scale that up in the U.S., given the high demand for it. And we're able -- resource-wise, we put a lot of focus on that as we continue to expand that. And there obviously are a lot of strong relationships we have with those EPs given our WATCHMAN experience and our CRM experience. So it's a lot of resource planning and training and executing every day in the field to open up new accounts. \n Dr. Stein gave some commentary on the mapping. So today, some accounts don't use mapping when they're driving maybe optimal workflow and many accounts are using their existing mapping system. And we don't intend to force our customers to move away. \n  However, we do -- as Dr. Stein mentioned, based on what we've seen with the our mapping navigation system, we do think there will be incremental clinical benefits and productivity gains in using that. \n So we are starting to see an increase in RHYTHMIA orders, and we anticipate enhanced RHYTHMIA -- FARAPULSE mapping orders as we go through the second half of this year because there will be clinical benefits from it. But as Dr. Stein mentioned, we really want to have hospitals choose the correct mapping system and FARAPULSE works excellent today with the competitors, but we would expect some enhanced benefit with ours. \nOperator: And just to verify, is there time for one last question? \nJonathan Monson: Yes, Drew. We'll take one more, please. \nOperator: That will come from Michael Polark with Wolfe Research. \nMichael Polark: I want to ask the gross margin commentary, the inventory charges, Dan. Can you quantify the impact in the quarter? And what's the nature of those charges? What's going on? And the other thing I heard was increased mix of capital in the quarter. I think it seems highly likely to be FARAPULSE generator driven, but if there's anything else underneath that comment, I'd welcome the color. \nDaniel Brennan: Sure. Thanks for the question, Mike. We're not going to quantify the inventory charges, but it was much more than we're used to in a given quarter, and that's why we called it out and it has an impact. \n I will say a piece of it, not an insignificant piece of it, is kind of due to the success of FARAPULSE. So it's not kind of all bad per se relative to our results, but it's still inventory charges and it still reduced the gross margin in the quarter. But that's what gives me the confidence and the optimism that heading into the rest of the year, we won't see inventory charges at the level that we saw them in Q1 as we go through 2024.\n On the capital, yes, a piece of that is related to FARAPULSE. But we also -- as Mike mentioned, we also have a really successful launch in our IVUS business, which has some capital with it. And not insignificantly as well, we have some in the Urology business associated with the Lumenis. \n So it was probably led by the launch of FARAPULSE, but we did have a little bit more in some of the other launches in some of the other businesses with respect to capital. But overall message should be 69.8%, a little lower than we would have liked, but still have a goal this year of getting back to that 70.7% or slightly below that for the year for gross margin. \nJonathan Monson: All right. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Boston Scientific. If we were unable to get to your question or if you have any follow-ups, please don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team.\n Before you disconnect, Drew will give you all the pertinent details for the replay. \nOperator: Please note a recording will be available in 1 hour by dialing either 1 (877) 344-7529 or 1 (412) 317-0088, using replay code 8726199 until May 1, 2024, at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time. \n The conference has now concluded.

            "name": "Michael Mahoney",
            "content": "Thanks, Jon. Thank you to everyone for joining us today. Our first quarter results surpassed our expectations, fueled by our innovative portfolio, including the nearly 90 new products we launched globally in 2023, the execution of our category leadership strategy and the winning spirit of our global team.  \n In the first quarter '24, total company operational sales grew 15% and organic sales grew 13% versus first quarter '23, which exceeds the high end of our guidance range of 7% to 9%. Our strong growth continues to be diversified across businesses and regions. In the quarter, 6 of our 8 business units in all of our regions grew double digits. We believe that most business units grew faster than their respective markets with differentiated portfolios and strong commercial execution, supported by healthy procedural demand.  \n First quarter adjusted EPS was $0.56, which grew 21% versus 2023, which exceeds the high end of our guidance range of $0.50 to $0.52. First quarter adjusted operating margin was 26.2%. \n Turning to our second quarter and full year '24 outlook. We are guiding to organic growth of 10% to 12% for second quarter '24 and raising our full year guidance from 8% to 9% to 10% to 12%, reflecting momentum from our innovative portfolio, healthy procedural volumes and continued execution by our global team.  \n Our second quarter '24 adjusted EPS guidance is $0.57 to $0.59 and we expect our full year adjusted EPS to be $2.29 to $2.34, representing growth of 12% to 14%. \n Dan will provide more details on our financials and I'll provide additional highlights on our first quarter, along with comments on our '24 outlook.  \n Regionally, on an operational basis, the U.S. grew 13% versus first quarter with particular strength in EP, fueled by the launch of FARAPULSE midway through the quarter, as well as on our WATCHMAN ICTx Urology and Endoscopy business units. \n Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 13% on an operational basis versus first quarter '23. This above-market growth was led by exceptional performance in EP as well as double-digit growth in our Endoscopy, Urology and PI businesses. We expect to continue to outpace the market, driven by continued broad-based momentum across our business and investment in emerging markets.  \n Asia Pac grew 26% operationally versus first quarter '23, led by strong double-digit performance in all of our Cardiovascular business units. Japan grew double digits driven by AGENT DCB, Rezum and our Access Solutions products. China delivered excellent results, growing strong double digits with 7 of our 8 business units growing double digits. \n I'll now provide some additional commentary on our business units.  In Urology, sales grew 10%, both operationally and organically versus first quarter '23, with double-digit growth in stone management as well as prosthetic urology. Rezum performed well in the quarter, both in the U.S. and internationally, and secured reimbursement status in France. We look forward to closing the previously announced acquisition of Axonics now expected in the second half of 2024.  \n Endoscopy sales grew 12% operationally and 10% organically versus first quarter '23. Strong first quarter results were driven by the breadth of our portfolio, underpinned by differentiated anchor products such as AXIOS and our single-use imaging products. \n Within the quarter, we also received CE Mark for our MANTIS Clip and NICE in the U.K. issued positive guidance for the ESG endoscopic bariatric surgery procedure, both expected to further momentum in our growing endoluminal surgery franchise.  \n Neuromodulation sales grew 10% operationally and declined 1% organically versus first quarter '23. Our brain franchise grew high single digits in the quarter with low double-digit U.S. growth driven by our comprehensive directional stimulation offering enabled by image-guided programming. \n In the first quarter, our pain franchise grew low double digits operationally, but declined mid-single digits on an organic basis, with continued pressure in our U.S. SCS business.  \n In the U.S., during the first quarter, we did receive FDA approval and recently launched the WaveWriter symptom (sic) [ system ] nonsurgical back pain indication and our next-generation FAST AutoDose. \n Importantly, the Relievant business continues to perform very well with steady expansion of payer coverage, and we expect sales from the novel Intracept procedure to grow about 50% in 2024.  \n Peripheral Intervention sales grew 16% operationally and 11% organically versus first quarter '23. Double-digit growth in arterial was bolstered by our drug-eluting portfolio supported by the strength of clinical evidence and global commercial execution. \n In venous, we saw continued above-market growth from Varithena and clot management continued to perform well, in line with expectations. \n Our interventional oncology franchise grew strong double digits in the first quarter, driven by our broad offering of embolization devices, including the Embold coil family in cancer therapies.  \n In the quarter, TheraSphere also grew double digits and data from the real-world study, PROACTIF, was presented, demonstrating positive outcomes in patients with intermediate and advanced HCC who were treated with TheraSphere.  \n Cardiology sales delivered another excellent quarter with both operational and organic sales growing 18% versus first quarter 2023. \n Within Cardiology, Interventional Cardiology Therapy sales grew an impressive 13% organically versus first quarter '23. \n Growth in Coronary Therapies was driven by continued strength in our international regions, led by our imaging portfolio and AGENT DCB in Japan. \n In the U.S., we're also pleased with the ongoing launch of AVVIGO+, which is our AI-guided imaging platform. We also received FDA approval of our AGENT DCB in first quarter, and we expect to initiate a limited launch in the second quarter as we ramp supply following the earlier-than-anticipated regulatory approval.  \n Our Structural Heart Valves franchise once again grew mid-teens in first quarter, led by ACURATE neo2, which continues to see growth from both new and existing accounts. We have now submitted for CE Mark for our next-generation ACURATE Prime valve, which we continue to expect to launch in Europe in 2025. \n WATCHMAN had another strong quarter, growing 19% organically and maintaining our market-leading share position. In the U.S., WATCHMAN FLX Pro moved into full launch and we received FDA clearance for the TruSteer steerable sheath, allowing physicians to achieve more optimal device positioning in the widest range of LAA anatomies. \n International growth was driven by ongoing momentum in -- ongoing momentum within the quarter, and we received approval and launched WATCHMAN FLX Pro in Japan and Canada, which will support continued growth in these markets.  \n Cardiac Rhythm Management sales grew 5% organically in the first quarter '23. In the first quarter, our Diagnostics franchise also grew double digits, led by strong market adoption of our second-generation LUX-Dx ICM device. \n In core CRM, our low-voltage business grew mid-single digits and our high-voltage business grew low single digits. Our Emblem S-ICD continues to maintain its strong share position and we've seen very limited impact in Europe or the U.S. from a recent competitor's launch. \n We expect to remain the clear market leader in this space and look forward to the upcoming data presentation at HRS of MODULAR ATP, which is a pivotal trial studying the use of the Emblem S-ICD in conjunction with our EMPOWER leadless pacemaker to function as a single-chamber pacemaker, as well as to provide anti-tachycardia pacing when needed. We anticipate FDA approval of the modular CRM system and stand-alone EMPOWER leadless pacemaker in '25.  \n Electrophysiology sales grew 72% both operationally and organically versus first quarter '23 driven by the adoption of the transformative FARAPULSE platform. \n International first quarter sales grew 59%, with continued FARAPULSE account openings and robust utilization in Europe. \n U.S. first quarter sales grew 85% organically, propelled by the mid-first quarter launch of FARAPULSE. We have already made good progress entering to high-volume accounts, supported by compelling clinical evidence, commercial execution and investment in our supply chain.  \n Early feedback on FARAPULSE has been extremely positive with rapid adoption from both RF and cryo users. Electrophysiologists appreciate FARAPULSE's unique safety profile, ease of use, effectiveness and efficiency of the procedure. We expect our broad EP portfolio, coupled with our other AF solutions, to drive significant global growth in '24 and beyond.  \n We also intend to extend our leadership in PFA by investing in innovation, clinical evidence and global capabilities. Within the quarter, we commenced enrollment of the NAVIGATE-PF clinical trial, studying integrated cardiac mapping with a FARAVIEW software and FARAWAVE non-enabled catheter, both of which are expected to launch in the U.S. during the second half of the year. \n We also completed enrollment of Phase II in the ADVANTAGE AF clinical trial, studying our FARAPOINT device for CTI ablations, which is expected to launch in the U.S. in 2025. And we also anticipate data from Phase I of the ADVANTAGE trial for persistent AF to be presented in fourth quarter 2024.  \n We also look forward to our clinical late-breakers at the upcoming HRS meeting in May, which aims to highlight the unique capabilities of FARAPULSE. \n Also of note, this week, we released our 2023 Performance Report, highlighting the company's actions to improve patient outcomes while prioritizing our environmental, social and governance goals. We continue to make progress in all 3 key areas: innovating care to meet patient needs, empowering people and shaping a healthier planet while performing with integrity. While we always have more to do, I know that our values-driven culture and the commitment of our global teams to challenge -- to this challenge of what's possible will continue to raise the bar. \n In closing, I'm very grateful to our global employees who work every day to advance science for life. We remain committed to investing for the long term while delivering top-tier financial performance in 2024 and beyond.  \n And with that, I'll hand over to Dan to provide more details on the financials. Yes. First, I want to shout out to early pioneering work by Chris O'Hara, the amazing work by the FARAPULSE team and really the work our team has done over multiple years. This is the most transformational product that I've seen in my career with the company. And Dr. Stein can comment on clinically, but we continue to invest significantly in the current platform and in future products and a significant amount of clinical science to really widen the gap in PFA with our FARAPULSE system.  \n And as I mentioned in the script, we're seeing very rapid adoption from both RF and cryo users. We continue to invest in our commercial footprint in the U.S. And we're able to meet the demand thus far with our talented supply chain teams. \n But we're also excited about the ongoing momentum in Europe, where we've been live for a number of years. But we continue to increase utilization in Europe and open new centers now that they have a bit more supply than they did in 2023. \n And we're also working diligently with our teams in Asia, in Japan and China, to train them up so they can also take advantage of FARAPULSE really kind of more of a fourth quarter 2025 story in Asia. \n So it really -- it's a remarkable platform and we're seeing excellent safety results, ease of use, rapid adoption and excellent effectiveness. Dr. Stein, if you want to comment? Yes. So we outlined at Investor Day the 8% to 10% and our goal to be a very high-performing med tech company. And so we're super pleased with the first quarter results that also led to -- and the business momentum led to the guidance you referred to at 10% to $12. So we're pleased with taking our full year guidance up. We did also receive FARAPULSE earlier than we expected. \n So at this point, we'll hold off and look at our 2025 guidance later in the year. But we're super pleased with the momentum that we have across all regions and all business units. But at this point, we're not going to commit to accelerating growth in 2025. Certainly, our aim would be to do that, but it would be premature to confirm that at this point. Sure. Thanks, Rick. We're very pleased with the results in Europe. We continue to grow above market in Europe and have excellent adoption across most major countries in Europe. And importantly, as you said, we've invested quite a bit in this portfolio and we're excited about the Prime submission that we just recently did in Europe, which will enhance the valve further and provide additional valve sizes as well. So we expect that to go well in Europe. \n In the U.S., there's really not going to be any new commentary that we haven't stated publicly. We are waiting for the full year follow-up. We also will be working with the regulators, and we'll communicate in the future date the timing of the release of that clinical data and our next steps in the U.S. Yes. So the results in the U.S., 85% as you mentioned, it was really a mid-quarter launch. So the teams moved pretty quickly to have some impact in the first quarter. And we look forward to good results, obviously, in the second quarter and the rest of the year based on momentum. \n So there's not any big onetime stocking. So this is driven by new account openings and I would say very rapid adoption of the technology, and therefore, continued utilization of the product once they have the platform. We're also seeing multiple hospitals buying their second console, which also is a great sign because it shows the adoption and using it routinely every day. \n And so it's really new account openings and increased adoption once they start using the platform, and that's driving the U.S. results. \n And as I mentioned, in Europe, which I think is impressive, now that they have a bit more supply, they continue to open more accounts and increase the utilization of existing accounts with the FARAPULSE platform. \n On the TPT, we think it's a bit less significant for FARAPULSE, but it's something we'll continue to evaluate. And we'll provide you updates as we see them. Dr. Stein? I'm sorry. I'll make comments and Dr. Stein. We're pleased with our WATCHMAN performance. We grew globally 19%. But keep in mind, that's coming off of nearly a 30% comp from first quarter 2023. And we still maintain, if not enhance, our strong share position. \n And we're excited not only with the share position but with the growth of WATCHMAN, but also some upcoming trials that can further highlight with OPTION and CHAMPION, which we believe, if successful, will significantly widen the market, TAM, for WATCHMAN. So Dr. Stein, if you want to comment on any of that and also the concomitant item. Thanks, Danielle. Really appreciate you asking that question. I would say the innovation has already happened. Let me just explain a bit more. We call it ICTx, our interventional cardiology business essentially. And years ago, that was dominated by drug-eluting stents. \n Today, drug-eluting stents, I think, represent close to 4% of our overall mix and likely will be 3% and 2% in the following years. So it's really a very small portion of Boston Scientific and a smaller portion of ICTx. \n So what's driving the 13% growth within ICTx is our advanced imaging portfolio. So you're seeing more and more patients come with more complex calcium and the growing adoption of IVUS imaging, especially with our AVVIGO+ platform to identify that and help the effectiveness of these procedures. \n So you're seeing wide adoption in Europe of our imaging platform, wide adoption in Asia and growing adoption in the U.S. based on this new platform. So it's really the imaging capabilities as well as our complex coronary capabilities to break calcium with Wolverine and our other products. \n And then in Asia, they've been very successful in launching our AGENT drug-coated balloon and we recently received approval for that. We'll have some minor benefit in the second quarter '24 from that product in the U.S., where we expect enhanced growth from that product in the second half of '24 and particularly in 2025. \n So the team there has really done a great job of completely revamping the portfolio and the growth trajectory of ICTx. Also included in that is our Structural Heart business in Europe. \n And CRM, that grew 5% and we kind of essentially grow in line, I would say, with the market with pacemakers and defibrillators. S-ICD business continues to be quite robust. But the bigger growth driver in our CRM business is our diagnostics business. And we invested in that many years ago with our Preventice platform and also with our -- now our second-generation loop recorder ICM device. \n So we've really reshaped the portfolio significantly in both of those markets to continue to support the growth of the company. Dr. Stein, if you could take that one? Sure. So we have the NICE approval, excellent trial design by the clinical team and the product is doing extremely well in Japan and we have high hopes for the product has impact in the second half and more in 2025. \n So currently, we're really going through the contracting process with most of the big accounts in the U.S. and that's initiated. And that's going well, given there is a high unmet clinical need with in-stent restenosis and the deliverability that's been proven with AGENT. So there's high physician demand for it. But we are going through the contracting process with the major health systems now, and you'll start seeing some sales in the second quarter. And we expect that to ramp more significantly throughout the second half of the year and accelerate more in '25. Yes. We won't confirm your math. At this point, we're not going to be breaking out FARAPULSE cases, numbers, number of accounts, dollars and so forth yet. If you recall back to the WATCHMAN days, we really waited till it was about close to $1 billion platform before we provided that based on the materiality of the company. \n But it's going extremely well. And importantly, we made significant investments in the supply chain 2 and 3 years ago to be ready for where we are today. And the supply chain team continues to perform extremely well, and they're able thus far to meet the demand in Europe and the U.S. and the future in Asia. Just maybe really not a whole lot of new color in Japan. But they launched it last year and it was adopted very, very quickly and it's leading to the strong double-digit growth in Japan that we saw in the quarter. \n In terms of indication expansion, Dr. Stein, do you want to take that one? Thanks, Matt. Probably not too much new commentary here. I think in FARAPULSE overall, it's -- we're developing very strong capabilities to install, support and train doctors and really scale that up in the U.S., given the high demand for it. And we're able -- resource-wise, we put a lot of focus on that as we continue to expand that. And there obviously are a lot of strong relationships we have with those EPs given our WATCHMAN experience and our CRM experience. So it's a lot of resource planning and training and executing every day in the field to open up new accounts. \n Dr. Stein gave some commentary on the mapping. So today, some accounts don't use mapping when they're driving maybe optimal workflow and many accounts are using their existing mapping system. And we don't intend to force our customers to move away. \n  However, we do -- as Dr. Stein mentioned, based on what we've seen with the our mapping navigation system, we do think there will be incremental clinical benefits and productivity gains in using that. \n So we are starting to see an increase in RHYTHMIA orders, and we anticipate enhanced RHYTHMIA -- FARAPULSE mapping orders as we go through the second half of this year because there will be clinical benefits from it. But as Dr. Stein mentioned, we really want to have hospitals choose the correct mapping system and FARAPULSE works excellent today with the competitors, but we would expect some enhanced benefit with ours."

            "name": "Ken Stein",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks. Thanks, Mike. Thanks, Robbie. Maybe the one thing I'd add, I'd just -- the caution here is against thinking of PFA in general, that every PFA system is very different and I think everyone really needs to be evaluated on its own. So the results you get with PFA are just completely dependent on catheter design, on waveform and on dosing strategy. And as Mike said, what people see when they use FARAPULSE clinically, when people see the data and we've now got published data including randomized clinical trial data, registry data, total data at well over 18,000 patients have reported at this point, and as Mike said, it just has compelling advantages in terms of safety, in terms of efficacy, in terms of ease of use and in terms of efficiency. And that's what you see driving the rapid uptake, both in the U.S. and globally. I described that, that's NTAP. Yes. And Vijay, I think just important maybe to point out. First off, right, the NTAP applies to inpatient Medicare fee-for-service, which is really a small minority of AF ablations today. Having said that, we still do believe that FARAPULSE can use the proposed NTAP related to one of our customers. \n And actually, I think it's important from a physician perspective and a hospital perspective, that we're not in a position of having to create unique ICD-10 codes that are product-specific. That's really not helpful to either the physicians or the hospitals. Yes. Thanks, Mike. Yes. So Travis, first on the trials, I mean, first of all, this is still a healthy market. This is still a very under-penetrated therapy when you look at patients who were at high risk for stroke and AF who stand to benefit from -- with the WATCHMAN procedure. \n The trials that Mike mentioned, right, the first one is the OPTION trial, that evaluates the use of WATCHMAN as an alternative to oral anticoagulants following ablation. And we hope to be able to present the results of that trial late this year or early next year. Then that's followed CHAMPION, which is the all-comers trial versus the novel oral anticoagulants. Again, we expect that to report out in 2026. So these are now -- in the relatively near term that we're going to see those data points. \n Before that, right, I think it is worth talking a little bit about that concomitant DRG that's part of the proposed rule from CMS. We're really gratified to see that. This is something that's good for everyone. This is good for patients. This is good for hospitals. When you think of valve outpatients who are undergoing an ablation procedure, first off, I'll tell you even back when I was doing these procedures, almost every patient who came in before wanted to know would they be able to stop their oral anticoagulants, and that is still true today. \n And when you think about it from a patient-centered perspective, right, being able to do this all at one setting and avoiding the incremental risks that you have in undergoing two procedures, it really just makes sense. It also makes sense from a hospital standpoint when you just look at the procedural efficiencies and how that's going to help hospitals improve capacity to be doing more AF ablations and doing more WATCHMAN procedures over time. \n So we're excited to see this. We think this is good for patients. We think this is good for hospitals. And we look forward to getting the data out from trials like OPTION and CHAMPION that's even going to further increase the impetus for doing these procedures. Yes. It's still early in the launch. And I think one thing that I do want to sort of emphasize as you look at how things are playing out in the launch is we're really working with accounts to say don't change a lot of your workflow at the outset. Get used to using FARAPULSE, see how it works in your cases and then start modifying your workflow. \n So really, what we've seen early in launch really are deliberately not a big shift in whether or not people are mapping. Not a big shift in what mapping platform they're using. \n Now having said that, right, we have deliberately built our next-generation product and that's the FARAWAVE Nav-enabled catheter, right, that interfaces with the FARAVIEW software. And as I think everyone has seen, we've initiated our first human use studies of that earlier this year. \n That really will bring some unique advantages to people who want to use a navigation system as they're using FARAPULSE. It is our desire and our belief, right, that there will be people who don't feel the need to use any mapping when they're doing pulmonary vein isolation with FARAPULSE who are adopting a very efficient workflow that's been used in a lot of centers in Europe. There will be others who want to continue to use a navigation mapping system. We have no intention of forcing people to use our system. We're not going to lock it down. But this new software platform really does bring some very compelling advantages to people who will use it. Yes. And Chris, and just to remind everyone, right? Our current label indication in the U.S. in-stent restenosis, that comprises approximately 10% of current PCI volume. Internationally, we also see DCBs used and we believe there is a potential use case outside of in-stent restenosis, small vessel disease, bifurcation lesions, potentially even some acute coronary syndrome. And once we launch in the U.S., we are evaluating opportunities to expand the label. And those expanded indications could potentially take us up to 20% of current PCI volume. Yes, Matt. Again, I think probably the first new indications we think about looking for would be small vessel bifurcation lesions. Still working through regulatory strategy on that. So not prepared to give you a time line for when we would initiate any of that work."

            "content": "Thanks, Mike. First quarter 2024 consolidated revenue of $3.856 billion represents 13.8% reported growth versus first quarter 2023 and includes a 120 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, in line with our expectations. Excluding this $40 million headwind from foreign exchange, operational revenue growth was 15% in the quarter. Sales from the closed acquisitions and divestitures contributed 190 basis points, resulting in 13.1% organic revenue growth, exceeding our first quarter guidance range of 7% to 9%.  \n Q1 2024 adjusted earnings per share of $0.56 grew 20.6% versus 2023 exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.50 to $0.52, primarily driven by our strong sales performance. \n Adjusted gross margin for the first quarter was 69.8%, which includes an approximate 30 basis point year-over-year headwind from foreign exchange. Adjusted gross margin was slightly lower than anticipated, primarily driven by inventory charges and less favorable product mix due to increased levels of capital placements in the quarter.  \n Despite a lower Q1, we continue to expect full year adjusted gross margin to be at or slightly below our 2023 full year rate, driven by increasing mix benefit from our new launches, lower inventory charges and the full recognition of our annual standard manufacturing cost improvements in the second half of the year. \n First quarter adjusted operating margin was 26.2%. We remain committed to expanding adjusted operating margin by 30 to 50 basis points in 2024 as we balance progress towards our long-range plan goal of 150 basis points of improvement from 2024 to 2026 with the flexibility to make critical investments to support key launches.  \n On a GAAP basis, first quarter operating margin was 17.5%.  \n Moving to below the line. First quarter adjusted interest and other expenses totaled $80 million. \n On an adjusted basis, our tax rate for the first quarter was 10.7%, which includes favorable discrete tax items and the benefit from stock compensation accounting. Our operational tax rate was 13.7% for the quarter. \n Fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding ended at 1.482 billion shares in the first quarter. \n Free cash flow for the first quarter was a negative $15 million with $164 million from operating activities less $179 million in net capital expenditures, which includes payments of $251 million related to acquisitions, restructuring, litigation and other special items.  \n In 2024, we continue to expect full year free cash flow to exceed $2 billion, which includes approximately $800 million of expected payments related to special items. \n As of March 31, 2024, we had cash on hand of $2.3 billion, inclusive of the $2 billion -- 2 billion euro-denominated senior note offering completed on February 27, which we intend to use to partially fund the Axonics acquisition.  \n During the first quarter, we repaid approximately $500 million of senior notes upon maturity, and our gross debt leverage was 2.5x as of March 31. \n Our top capital allocation priority remains strategic tuck-in M&A, followed by annual share repurchases to offset dilution from employee stock grants. In alignment with our acquisition strategy, we recently closed the acquisition of the endoluminal vacuum therapy portfolio from B. Braun, which complements our existing endoscopy portfolio and is expected to be immaterial to earnings per share in 2024.  \n Our legal reserve was $283 million as of March 31, a decrease of $94 million versus Q4 2023. And $71 million of this reserve is already funded through our qualified settlement funds. \n I'll now walk through guidance for Q2 and the full year 2024. We expect full year 2024 reported revenue growth to be in a range of 11% to 13% versus 2023. Excluding an approximate 50 basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates, we expect full year 2024 operational revenue growth to be 11.5% to 13.5%. Excluding a 150 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect full year 2024 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 10% to 12% versus 2023. \n We expect second quarter 2024 reported revenue growth to be in a range of 10.5% to 12.5% versus second quarter 2023. Excluding an approximate 100 basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates, we expect second quarter 2024 operational revenue growth to be 11.5% to 13.5%. And excluding a 150 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect second quarter 2024 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 10% to 12% versus 2023. \n We now expect full year 2024 adjusted below-the-line expense to be approximately $315 million.  \n Under current legislation, including enacted laws and issued guidance under OECD Pillar 2 rules, we continue to forecast a full year 2024 operational tax rate of approximately 14% and an adjusted tax rate of approximately 13%. \n We expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.29 and to $2.34, representing 12% to 14% growth versus 2023, including an approximate $0.04 headwind from foreign exchange, which is unchanged from our previous expectations. \n We expect second quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.57 to $0.59.  \n For more information, please check our Investor Relations website for Q1 2024 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more details on Q1 results and our 2024 guidance. \n And with that, I'll turn it back to Jon, who will moderate the Q&A. No, it was over -- it was -- not to interrupt you, Joanne. It was just over the 3-year period. 2024 to 2026 was 150 basis points. Yes. I think over the 3-year period, all lines will contribute. And I think it's really a great part of the history of the company and the kind of the DNA of the margin expansion story is that at any given point in time, all lines can contribute. So gross margin at that 69.8%, I didn't love that this quarter, but I'm optimistic that, that improves through the year. \n But we said at Investor Day and we reiterated it on our January call, that gross margin probably is not going to contribute this year to the 30 to 50 points. So this year, it's more of an OpEx leverage story. But absolutely, in '25 and '26, I think gross margin can contribute. Recall, we used to be at 72.4% gross margin back in 2019. We're maniacally focused on getting back and improving that from where it is today and have the plans to do that. \n So I think the summary is, as we look to improve the 150 basis points over the 3 years, it puts us kind of at the doorstep of 28% at the end of '26, which is a nice spot to be. It puts that 30% long-term goal that we have really in focus. And all lines of the P&L could contribute along that journey. Sure. Thanks for the question, Mike. We're not going to quantify the inventory charges, but it was much more than we're used to in a given quarter, and that's why we called it out and it has an impact. \n I will say a piece of it, not an insignificant piece of it, is kind of due to the success of FARAPULSE. So it's not kind of all bad per se relative to our results, but it's still inventory charges and it still reduced the gross margin in the quarter. But that's what gives me the confidence and the optimism that heading into the rest of the year, we won't see inventory charges at the level that we saw them in Q1 as we go through 2024.\n On the capital, yes, a piece of that is related to FARAPULSE. But we also -- as Mike mentioned, we also have a really successful launch in our IVUS business, which has some capital with it. And not insignificantly as well, we have some in the Urology business associated with the Lumenis. \n So it was probably led by the launch of FARAPULSE, but we did have a little bit more in some of the other launches in some of the other businesses with respect to capital. But overall message should be 69.8%, a little lower than we would have liked, but still have a goal this year of getting back to that 70.7% or slightly below that for the year for gross margin."
