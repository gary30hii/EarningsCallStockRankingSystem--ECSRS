Good morning everyone and welcome to the Quanta Services fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings conference call. On the call today I will provide operational and strategic commentary and will then turn it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta\u2019s Chief Financial Officer who will provide a review of our fourth quarter and full year results and full year 2021 financial expectations. Following Derrick's comments we welcome your questions.  As noted in our earnings release this morning we have renamed both of our segments to include solutions which we believe is an accurate word to describe the value creating and collaborative approach we take to working with our customers. Additionally, we renamed our pipeline and industrial segment to Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions which we believe is more reflective of the strategic changes we have made over the past five years to reposition this segment towards a greater level of resilient business services to our gas utility, pipeline integrity, and industrial customers. These services tend to be more visible and recurring in nature and are driven by safety, reliability, and environmental regulations. We continue to expand our capabilities in both segments to provide comprehensive end-to-end solutions with cross skilled labor at the core.  We're proud of our successful focus on base business activity over the last five years which now accounts for more than 90% of our revenues. We continue to view large projects as upside opportunities and are well positioned to safely execute them when they occur. Quanta performed well and delivered a solid year in 2020 which includes numerous accomplishments. This was due to the performance of our field leadership and the people of this organization, who continue to be exceptional. There are so many accomplishments in 2020. Electric power segment revenues achieved record levels and we earned our best operating margin performance in six years driven by strong execution across our operations. Included in these results were record storm response revenues from supporting our customers efforts to restore power to millions of people adversely impacted by numerous severe weather events during the year. Our ability to quickly mobilize this level of resources to support our customers in times of need even during a pandemic is unmatched in our industry.  After an 18-month competitive process LUMA Energy, our joint venture with ATCO was selected for a 15-year operation and maintenance agreement to operate, maintain, and modernize PREPA\u2019s more than 18,000 mile electric transmission and distribution system in Puerto Rico. LUMA and PREPA are making good progress towards transitioning operations of this system this year and we continue to believe this opportunity is transformative for Quanta.  We grew our communication services revenues by more than 40%, meaningfully improved profit margins and ended the year with a total backlog of approximately $900 million. We substantially completed the exit of our Latin American operations, despite the significant challenges and impact to these wind down activities from the effects of COVID-19. We continue to lead the industry in safety, which we believe starts with training. We continue to incrementally invest in our training efforts through our Northwest Line College and Quanta Advanced Training Center. Additionally, last year we began site preparation for a new line worker training campus in Puerto Rico that will be operated by Northwest Line College. The facility will provide world-class training to LUMA\u2019s employees and develop Puerto Rico's future cross skilled workforce. Our industry leading training and recruiting initiatives are driving improved productivity in the field and ensures that we have the very best craft skilled labor. This enhances our ability to collaborate with customers and labor affiliations on future workforce needs and further differentiates us and the marketplace as a strategic solutions provider.  We invested approximately $400 million in strategic acquisition of seven high quality companies with great management teams that expand or enhance our ability to provide solutions to our customers or additive to our base business and advance our strategic initiatives. These companies add to our self-perform capabilities, which typically accounts for approximately 85% of our work and are key to providing cost certainty to our customers. We believe our approach to acquisitions and our operating model helps de-risk our work portfolio through improved execution and results in more consistent earnings. We strengthened our financial position with the closing of our $1 billion investment grade senior notes offering, which we believe points to the resiliency and sustainability of our business model and positive multi-year outlook. We demonstrated our commitment to stockholder value and confidence in Quanta\u2019s financial strength and continued growth opportunities through the acquisition of approximately $250 million of common stock and a 25% increase in our dividend. And finally, the diversity of our services, proactive cost management, and execution through significant uncertainty caused by the pandemic and challenged energy markets allowed our underground utility and infrastructure solutions operations to perform well under the circumstances. We are optimistic that the most challenging market conditions are behind us, and we see opportunity for revenue and margin improvement in 2021, and continue to believe this segment can achieve upper single-digit operating income margin as operating conditions further normalized over time.  We believe our strategic position in the marketplace remains strong and we are well positioned for continued profitable growth over the near and longer-term. Despite unprecedented operating conditions and uncertainties caused by the global pandemic proportions of our business, the strong performance of our electric power and communications operations resulted in record adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, cash flow, and backlog in 2020. While we are proud of the achievements last year, we remain focused on getting better to ensure that Quanta continues to evolve to effectively collaborate with our customers and business partners and helping them achieve their goals and to capitalize on the opportunities ahead of us.  The recent severe weather conditions that impacted living conditions in Texas and other parts of the country shows how critical infrastructure that we design, build, and maintain is to our everyday wellbeing. The solutions Quanta provides supports our customers\u2019 efforts to increase reliability, safety, efficiency, and connectivity, all of which have a favorable environmental and social impact on both the markets that we serve and society. Additionally, our solutions facilitate policies and goals aimed at the adoption of new technologies and transitioning towards a carbon neutral economy. As a result, we believe our business is levered to favorable and sustainable long-term goals.  Our utility customers who account for more than 70% of our 2020 revenues are leaders in the effort to reduce carbon emissions with aggressive efforts to modernize and harden their systems, expand their renewable generation portfolios, and implement new technologies for current and future needs. A number of utilities have committed to providing 100% of their power by clean energy or achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Achieving these goals requires substantial incremental investment in transmission, substation and distribution infrastructure to interconnect new renewable generation facilities to the power grid and to ensure grid reliability due to the significant increase of intermittent power added to the system. Further developed economies are expected to be increasingly driven by electricity to meet carbon reduction goals over time. Vehicle electrification offers a large carbon reduction opportunity in addition to residential and commercial space and water heating and industrial and agriculture electrification. According to a report from the Wire's Group [ph], increased electrification and electric vehicle adoption in United States could require a 70 to 200 gigawatts of new power generation by 2030. The majority of which is expected to be renewables and could require incremental transmission investment of $30 billion to $90 billion by 2030. We believe these investment requirements associated with electrification are in addition to the significant multi-year investment programs already in place for the coming years to modernize the existing power grid to ensure reliable power delivery under current market conditions. The outlook for our communications operations, which is within the electric power segment remains bright. We expect to generate approximately $700 million in revenue this year, which would represent approximately 30% growth over 2020. Our communication services support the technology we use every day for work, education, entertainment, connecting with friends and family, all of which are critically important. To that end, the effects of COVID-19 have caused communication providers to increase investment in the fiber networks to ensure adequate speed, capacity, and reliability to meet these needs. Additionally, we believe Quanta is well positioned to leverage our electric power and communication solutions capabilities to assist many of our rural and municipal electric customers who are expected to participate in the rural digital opportunity fund. This fund provides more than $20 billion to bridge the digital divide that exists for millions of people living in rural America without access to adequate broadband connectivity. Further, we expect 5G deployments to accelerate in 2021, which will remain well positioned to continue to participate in. Our underground utility and infrastructure solutions segment experienced meaningful challenges during the year due to the effects of COVID-19 such as shutdowns in certain cities that had short-term impacts on our gas utility services and the significant reduction in demand for refined products that materially impacted our industrial service customers. As discussed previously, we believe the greatest impacts from these dynamics are behind us. Going forward, we expect to continue our focus on our gas utility, pipeline integrity, and industrial services businesses consistent with our strategy over the last five years due to the favorable long-term trends driven by safety, reliability, and environmental regulations. Our gas utility services supported with regulated programs to replace and modernize aging infrastructure, which can be [indiscernible] and pose potential safety concerns. They also support customer efforts to reduce methane emissions and positions the gas distribution systems to potentially deliver hydrogen to users in the future.  Our pipeline integrity services seek to ensure that existing pipelines operate safely and in an environmentally friendly manner. And many of our industrial services support customer\u2019s compliance with regulations aimed at minimizing environmental impacts caused by methane gas release and increase operational efficiency and safety. We believe these favorable safety, reliability, and environmental initiatives and long-term industry trends such as electrifications and technology implementations will continue to drive growth opportunities for Quanta for the foreseeable future. Quanta is actively engaged in collaborative conversations with many of our customers about their multi-year multi-billion dollar programs extending as far as 10 years. Regarding how Quanta can provide solutions throughout our customer's value chain to meet their strategic infrastructure investment goals in support of these initiatives.  In our earnings release this morning, we provided our 2021 guidance. We believe -- which we believe demonstrates the strength and sustainability of our business and long-term strategy, favorable end market trends, our ability to safely execute in a strong competitive position in the marketplace. Our expectations call for growth in revenues, adjusted EBITDA, and earnings per share and improve profit margins. Additionally, we see opportunity to achieve new record levels of backlog in 2021. In summary, we generated solid results in 2020 that we believe reflect the resiliency and sustainability of our business, the benefit of our strong financial position, the successful execution of our strategic initiatives, and the excellence of our people. The challenges we faced and the way we continue to support and collaborate with our customers last year, particularly as it relates to the pandemic, brought out the best of this organization and I believe made Quanta stronger. Overall, our end markets and multi-year visibility are solid, and we have built a strong platform that positions us well to capitalize on favorable long-term trends, particularly the transition towards a carbon neutral economy and the adoption of new technologies. Considering our organic growth opportunities and the levers available to us to allocate future cash flow generation and to creating opportunities such as stock repurchases, acquisitions, strategic investments in dividends, we believe Quanta will continue to generate meaningful stockholder value going forward.  Quanta is a portfolio of exceptional businesses with geographic and service line diversity. We are anchored by our commitment to craft skilled labor and our self-perform capabilities. We are focused on operating the business for the long-term and expect to continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best in class skilled leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta\u2019s base business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's diversity, unique operating model, and entrepreneurial mindset form the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for all our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO for his review of the fourth quarter and full year results and 2021 expectations. Derrick.\nDerrick Jensen: Thanks Duke and good morning, everyone. Today we announced fourth quarter 2020 revenues of $2.9 billion. Net income attributable to common stock was $170.1 million or $1.17 per diluted share and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Our non-GAAP measure was $1.22. Overall the fourth quarter closed out another exceptional year of operational performance for Quanta, a year in which we delivered record results across multiple metrics despite headwinds faced related to the pandemic. Our electric power revenues excluding Latin America were $2.11 billion, a 15.7% increase when compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. This increase was driven by mid-single-digit growth in our base business, increased contributions from the timing of certain larger projects, and $75 million in revenues from acquired businesses. Contributing to the base business growth was approximately 13% growth from our communications operations and record fourth quarter demand for our emergency restoration services of approximately $150 million primarily associated with efforts to restore infrastructure in the Southeastern and Midwestern United States although it came at the expense of certain other work in progress. Partially offsetting these increases was the expected reduction in fire hardening work in the Western United States during 4Q 2020, as compared to 4Q 2019.  Electric segment margins in 4Q 2020 were 11.6% and excluding our Latin American operations segment margins were 12.9% versus 9% in 4Q 2019. The robust operating margins were driven by increased profit contributions from the elevated emergency restoration services which typically present opportunities for higher margins due to higher equipment utilization and fixed cost absorption as well as improved margins in our Canadian operations primarily associated with certain larger transmission projects. However, although difficult to calculate the direct incremental effects, excluding revenues and profit from storm response efforts, our margins were still comfortably in double digits reflecting continued strong execution across all of our electric power operations. Of note, our communications margins continue to improve against the prior year with a margin of 9% during the quarter.  Regarding our Latin American operations included within the electric segment, we have substantially completed the wind down activities required to exit those markets. Our year-long effort to shut down our operations across the region was significantly impacted by COVID-19 dynamics, as well as political and regulatory uncertainties and customer challenges all of which contributed meaningfully higher losses than anticipated. In the fourth quarter we took the additional step of reserving remaining property, equipment, and inventory assets as the uncertain market conditions minimized likely recoveries upon disposition. As a reminder, we currently received no tax benefit for losses in Latin America so the $27 million in losses impacted the quarter by approximately $0.19. With minimal contractual obligations remaining, we feel comfortable that other than arbitration updates on the terminated Peruvian communications network project, we will no longer provide commentary on Latin America.  Revenues from our underground utility and infrastructure solution segment were $806 million, 36% lower than 4Q 2019. Similar to prior quarters, expected reduced contributions from larger diameter pipeline projects contributed to the decline. The variability attributable to larger pipeline projects is why we've taken strategic steps to reposition our service offerings around more predictable utility backed revenue streams. While we remain well positioned to opportunistically deploy resources for larger pipeline projects, we expect most future work will consist of smaller pipeline transmission and integrity oriented projects. Additionally, the lingering negative impacts of COVID-19 have reduced some level of demand for broader services across the segment with reduction in demand for refined products, substantially contributing to reduce quarter-over-quarter revenues from our industrial operations.  Operating margins for this segment were 5.1%. These margins were 190 basis points lower than 4Q 2019, primarily due to reduced revenues as well as some degree of execution challenges during the quarter and cost associated with the exit of certain ancillary pipeline operations. These negative impacts were partially offset by net positive project closeouts, primarily driven by the recognition of previously deferred suspension and milestone payments and the reduction of remaining contingency balances associated with the Atlantic coast pipeline project, which was officially terminated on December 31, 2020. Our total backlog was $15.1 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, slightly higher than 4Q 2019 and comparable to the third quarter of 2020 yet remains at record levels. 12 months backlog of $8.3 billion is an increase from both the fourth quarter of 2019 and the third quarter of 2020. As a reminder, the LUMA joint venture is accounted for as an equity method investment, and therefore does not contribute to revenue and is not included in backlog. However, assuming an operating margin profile consistent with our electric power operations LUMA's contribution over the 15-year operation and maintenance agreement would imply a backlog equivalent of more than $6 billion for Quanta. For the fourth quarter of 2020, we generated free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure of $200 million and although $381 million lower than 4Q 2019, it was higher than we anticipated driven by stronger profits in the quarter and the cash cycle consistent with our third quarter results. For the year we generated record free cash flow of $892 million. Day sales outstanding or DSO measured 83 days for the quarter, which was comparable to the third quarter of 2020 and fourth quarter of 2019. Cash flows in the fourth quarter and full year 2020 did partially benefit from the deferral of $37 million and $109 million of employer payroll tax payments permitted by the CARES Act with the payments due in equal installments at the end of 2021 and 2022. We had $185 million of cash at the end of the year with total liquidity of $2.2 billion and a debt to EBITDA ratio as calculated under our credit agreement of approximately 1.2 times. Turning to guidance, we continue to deal with some level of COVID-19 uncertainty as we assess the near-term prospects of our operations, primarily in our underground utility and infrastructure solution segment, and we've remained prudent with our expectations for 2021. However, as we look ahead to 2021 and beyond, we see the base business propelling multi-year growth opportunities for both segments. Electric segment revenues grew to $7.8 billion at the end of 2020 and we continue to see our base business providing mid-single to double-digit growth opportunities, coupled with some degree of increased contributions from larger projects, primarily associated with previously announced projects in Canada. In the aggregate, we expect electric power revenues to range between $8.3 billion and $8.5 billion, which includes expected revenues from our communications operations of around $700 million.  As it relates to electric power segment revenue seasonality, we expect revenue growth in each quarter of 2021 compared to 2020, with quarter-over-quarter growth in the first and second quarters, potentially exceeding 10%. We expect first quarter revenues to be the lowest of the year due to normal seasonal weather dynamics impacting certain construction activities. We expect the high end of our revenue range to represent greater revenue growth opportunities in the third and fourth quarters relative to 2020.  We expect 2021 operating margins for the electric power segment the range between 10.1% and 10.9%, which includes contributions of approximately $29 million or $0.20 per share from the LUMA joint venture and earnings from other integral unconsolidated affiliates. LUMA is expected to contribute around $9 million in the first half of the year, then increasing in the back half of the year as we exit the front-end [ph] transition services period. Although we are proud of our overall electric power performance in 2020, our 11.6% margins excluding Latin America, are above historical averages and are the highest since 2013 due in part to record annual emergency restoration service revenues of $450 million.  As outlined in our accompanying slides, our 2021 expectations for margins for this segment are consistent with historical averages, and are also based on expectations for more normalized emergency restoration service revenues of approximately $200 million, also in line with historical averages. As is typically the case, we expect that first quarter operating margins will be the lowest for the year, possibly slightly below 10%. However, we expect margins to increase into the second and third quarters and then slightly decline in the fourth quarter. We believe communications operating income margins which have been dilutive to segment margins in prior periods could be at parity with electric operations on a full year basis.  The underground utility and infrastructure solutions segment continues to be impacted by COVID-19 and the challenging energy market conditions. However, we are anticipating upper single-digit to double-digit revenue growth off of 2020 with full year revenues expected to range between $3.65 billion to $3.85 billion. Over 90% of our revenue expectations for 2021 represent base business with larger projects representing their lowest level of contributions in the last seven years. From a seasonality perspective, we see first quarter revenues being our lowest for the year, likely more than 20% lower than the first quarter of 2020. This decline is primarily due to significantly reduced industrial service revenues compared to the record results in 1Q 2020 as industrial customers are still dealing with lower demand stemming from decreased global travel activity associated with the pandemic, as well as reduced contributions from lower -- larger pipeline projects.  Revenues should increase sequentially into the third quarter then seasonally decline in the fourth quarter. Quarterly revenues for the second through the fourth quarters are expected to be higher on a quarter-over-quarter basis as compared to 2020 with double-digit growth expected for each quarter. Operating margin improvement for this segment continues to be a focus for us. We see segment margins ranging between 5.5% and 6% led primarily by continued execution within our gas LVC operations. Our full year margin expectations include a breakeven contribution from our industrial services operations in 2021, due to the continued challenging environment. However, to put our current segment margin guidance in context, if our industrial operations contributed at historical pre-COVID margin levels, our segment margin guidance would increase by over 100 basis points.  Consistent with years past and similar to electric power, our first quarter traditionally has lower activity in this segment due to weather seasonality, which impacts our revenues and pressures margin. With current inclement weather across much of the U.S. further pressuring those operations, we expect first quarter margins between breakeven and a small loss. However, we expect solid improvement into the second and third quarters with a seasonal decline in the fourth quarter. These segment operating ranges support our expectation for 2021 annual revenues of $11.95 billion to $12.35 billion and adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure of between $1.09 billion and $1.19 billion. This represents 8% growth at the midpoint of the range when compared to 2020\u2019s record adjusted EBITDA. With these operating results, we estimate our range of GAAP diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock for the year to be between $3.16 and $3.66 and anticipate non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $4.02 and $4.52.  Turning to cash flow, we expect free cash flow for 2021 to range between $400 million and $600 million with the standard disclaimer that quarterly free cash flow is subject to sizable movements due to various customer and project dynamic that occur in the normal course of operations. Included in our free cash flow expectation is the anticipated payment of $54 million in the fourth quarter related to payroll taxes that were deferred in 2020. As we have discussed during prior investor events, our cash flow generation moves counter to our revenue growth rates. For instance, a large driver of our significant free cash flow in 2020 was reduced revenues of approximately $900 million compared to 2019, decreasing working capital needs. However, higher revenue growth, like we're guiding for 2021 will likely require a meaningful investment in working capital to support the growth. While our 2021 free cash flow may be negatively impacted by increased working capital required to support our return to 2019 revenue levels, we believe that consistent, sustainable growth profile and solid margins of our base business provides for repeatable levels of free cash flow generation in line with our 2021 guidance in future periods. For additional information, please refer to our outlook summary which can be found on the IR website at quantaservices.com.  Looking back on our 2020 performance, although there were headwinds to the year, we ended the year with $11.2 billion in revenues, which represents an 8.1% revenue CAGR since 2015. More importantly, we ended the year with slightly over $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA, a record for Quanta and equal to our goal established five years ago, which represents a nearly 15% CAGR since 2015. Lastly, our record adjusted EPS of $3.82 represents a 28% CAGR since 2015, with our adjusted EPS growing faster than profits, which are growing faster than revenues. Over the last five years, we have deployed approximately $1.4 billion in cash for M&A and strategic investments, and $760 million for stock repurchases. While we acquire $250 million of common stock in 2020 and $7 million of common stock through February 24, 2021, we have approximately $530 million of availability remaining on our current stock repurchase program. Our first capital priority remains supporting the growth of our business through working capital and capital expenditures, however, we remain committed to the deployment of remaining available capital to stockholders through our stock repurchase and dividend programs and we continue to expect opportunistic acquisitions.  Our $1 billion bond offering in 2020 established a fixed level of debt that nicely complements our current EBITDA profile, which we believe is a repeatable, sustainable baseline of earnings. Simultaneously, we secured an expanded credit facility further enhancing our ability to meet incremental capital needs. Overall, we remain confident in the strength of our operations, our prospects for profitable growth, and the repeatable and sustainable nature of our core markets. We've developed a platform for Quanta to capitalize on the trends driving the spend in our markets, and we firmly believe delivering base business solutions to world class craft skilled labor, optimistic larger project deployments, and continued balance sheet strength will be the key to delivering long-term shareholder value. This concludes our formal presentation and we will now open the line for Q&A. Operator.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from Noelle Dilts of Stifel. Please go ahead. \nNoelle Dilts: Hi guys, good morning and congrats on a great quarter. Could you just expand a little bit on how things are progressing in Puerto Rico, how we're looking at the transition over to kind of full scale operations there and any change in how you're thinking about some of the opportunities around construction projects in the region? Thanks. \nDuke Austin: Yeah, in Puerto Rico we're making progress, we are staying on task on the timeline that we set forth within our bid process. And so I think we're making great strides there. We're continuing to transition the labor force as well as everything that comes with that from remediation plans and capital plans on the PREPA side of the business. And I -- from my standpoint, I think the third quarter sometime is when we expect to fully transition over into commencement. If not, it will just -- we have a supplemental agreement that will continue and will stay in the supplemental agreement. But the numbers and what we put forth does not change. We continue to be optimistic about the progress we're making as well as what we're doing for the island, the people. We've got our training facility very close to opening so we're seeing a lot of progress there and momentum around what we can do for the island, as far as the people as well as the economics for the island. So everything's on track, going well.\nNoelle Dilts: Okay, great. And then obviously kind of a lot of positive drivers on the electric T&D side. I guess, a couple of questions there; first, I think some of the grid hardening work that was particularly around fires that was kind of planned for 2020, maybe then pushed off -- could you -- had been pushed off, can you comment on how you're thinking about that for 2021? And then just kind of any thoughts on some of the Biden administration's goals around renewable energy and the potential for an infrastructure bill, sort of how are you thinking about one, the potential for an infrastructure bill, and if you could see some grid related initiatives there given the administration's initiative? Thanks.\nDuke Austin: Yeah, so I'll take the wild fire question to the West first. When we looked at it last year, we knew in our mind we have one of our larger utilities out there was coming out of bankruptcy, as well as putting a management team in. They are still putting that management team in place. We said all along that if we weren't working on that, we would be working somewhere in the West, that's still the case. It has not -- the demand for our services and what we're doing there from a solution provider to the wildfire assessment, as well as the construction thereafter still remains. I think it's a long-term build in the West around hardening, modernization, and all the things that are necessary when you want to move to more of a carbon free environment. And when we look at that to the West, I think they're a little farther along in their anticipation of being there. So we are still backed up by quite a bit of gas in the region. So I continue to believe that we'll continue to see modernization of that infrastructure as well as hardening for wildfires to the west. And the way we looked at it this year is, we took the normal approach, the same one we've taken in years past, and if we're not busy on the wildfire piece of it we will be busy doing other things in the West. So, I think all that's anticipated. If we start to move and expedite that it would be in the latter half of the year, and we comment on it as a move forward, move upward. So we took a prudent approach to that.  As far as the Biden administration, we've done well under both administrations. It doesn't, whether it be Republican or Democrat, we're really agnostic to that. When we look at it, I think if they follow the energy plan of the 2030-2050 type timeframe, as far as moving to a more carbon free footprint and certainly drives our business, I don't think that sentiment is going away. So we continue to see momentum around renewables and carbon free types of environment, whether it be hydrogen, batteries, whatever it may be that sentiment is there. The administration is certainly pushing that and I think it's beneficial for Quanta on all fronts. So that's where we [spend] [ph].\nNoelle Dilts: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Sean Eastman of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nSean Eastman: Hi, gentlemen. Nice work all around, great job. I wanted to start on the underground utility margins. So they're set at 5.5% to 6% for 2021. I think you said it would be a 100 basis points better if we had a normalized contribution from industrial services. So, I guess firstly, does that just mean we'd be 100 basis points higher if demand for refined products was normalized around the reopening? And second, I mean what is the sort of longer-term trajectory in this segment, maybe you could just refresh us on beyond just a normalization and in a reopening of the economy, what the longer-term target is for this business? \nDuke Austin: Yeah. So, I think when we look at the segment and look at what we're trying to accomplish there, we moved it away from large projects into a more of a base business. And you see that happening, as we sit today. When we look at the industrial business what we have it is flat for the year. We do see signs of life there. If the economy comes back, we will get into more normalized industrial sector and see more of the same type of work we've seen over our historical. So if you go back to 2008 and 2009 -- and you look after 2008 and 2009 we have very busy years in industrial space. I expected that will happen. Nothing's changed there, I really liked that business unit, I think we'll grow out of it. We have opportunities where others have left the space. So we continue to see greatest opportunity we've ever had there on a go forward basis. We like it and we'll continue to stay in it.  So again, as Derek commented, we do believe if that gets back and you get in the upper single digits there like it's operated in the past, it will move the whole segment up. And that's what we see. So I -- we're committed to operating this segment in upper single digits. We're making strides to get there every day based on base business and repetitive and resilient type framework with growth to our LDC markets that are regulated markets and that's backing that segment. I will say that the company itself is a portfolio and when you look at those individual segments or operating units that perform that work, it's not they can go perform electric work and do. They perform telecom work and do. So while it looks like in a segment, you get one -- you see it one way, it doesn't mean that we're not fully utilized as a company, and we're not moving forward as a portfolio. So you see the overall margins of the company lift and we've always said that our goal for the company is to be double-digit adjusted EBITDA. \nSean Eastman: Okay, got it. That's helpful Duke and maybe just continuing on the margin discussion with electric power. I guess firstly, is the trajectory from the 11.6 ex LATAM in 2020 to the 10.1 to 10.9 in the guidance for 2021 or just a normalization in storm revenue run rates? And second, I mean, relative to the 10.1 to 10.9, I mean, it seems like, LUMA in the out year, a full transition contribution in the out year is a tailwind, it seems like telecom is exiting -- is going to exit 2021 at a higher run rate in terms of margin. So, is there potential for expansion beyond this 2021 guidance range for electric power margins around those factors? \nDuke Austin: Yeah, I mean, when we look at the margins, and you look at it on a CAGR basis, you go back 20 years. We've operated in kind of double-digits and so for us, that's what we see historically. We have operated above that, we've talked about that. I think when we look at our guidance, we take a prudent approach to it. It's very early, we have seasonality, we have all kinds of events. We did pull back to 200 million of storm guidance. So if that's more obviously that would pick up the segment. We're operating really well there and I think, certainly there's opportunity, but as far as where we sit, the guidance that we gave is prudent. And I think if you look at it over time, that's where we will sit over time on a CAGR basis. So yes, there's always opportunity for us, and we're going to do everything we can to operate above that.\nDerrick Jensen: Yeah, Sean, one other bit of color. I mean, no, it's not really right to look at 2020 to 2021 being all as the storm pullback. Clearly, that is a component of it but that's what Duke is saying, the broader aspect of the operating model would average into that 10%. We've got a slide in there trying to illustrate that in the slide deck. And then relative to going forward though, yes, as it relates to the back half of the year performance for 2021 going into 2022 to the extent that you saw more of run rate type dynamics for LUMA in the back half of the year then yes, that would be accretive to thinking about the model going into 2022. \nSean Eastman: Okay, terrific. Thanks for the color and again, nice work. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Andy Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Please go ahead. \nAndy Kaplowitz: Hey, good morning, guys. \nDuke Austin: Good morning Andy. \nAndy Kaplowitz: Duke, can you update us on where you are in terms of your focus on capturing more of your customers programming -- programmatic spend, it looks like your estimated orders under MSA is within electric power up dramatically, which is a major reason for the positive move in your power -- electric power backlog in 2020. So would you expect that to continue to move up in 2021 and are you generally seeing customers more willing to outsource more of their operations to you given labor scarcity and job complexity?\nDuke Austin: No, we pride ourselves in self performance and kept craft skilled labor. And I think right now that is tight in the marketplace, in our training facilities, and the things that we've done allow us to collaborate with our customers there. So it's really driving the front side of the business and our ability to capture in a more holistic manner, the full value chain that we see in end to end solutions on utility base. So yes, I think we're making great progress there. I think it's something that we said we were going to do and pride ourselves going forward, and it will drive the business forward. So, the capital spends are also getting longer, when we talk about it, when we're talking to customers, our MSAs are lengthening, not getting shorter. So we're seeing more multi-year type MSAs versus one year basically to make sure that they had the craft skill labor and the ability to perform that CAPEX, OPEX on a go forward basis. And I like our position. I think we're doing very well on the utility side of the business as far as capturing more the front side.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Duke, that's helpful. And then you mentioned large projects in Canada in electric power contributing a little more in terms of revenue in 2021. So could you talk about the duration of these projects, I think they'll burn revenue in 2022 and then, given all the focus on energy transition and renewables, are you at least having more conversations at this point regarding larger transmission work, so when your bigger Canadian projects and you should be able to replace them and/or further grow in large transmission?\nDuke Austin: I mean, when we look at North America, if the sentiment stays to renewables and we continue down the path, there's no way around not putting in large transmission to move load-to-load centers. I think it's whether it be Canada or North America we will continue to see those type dynamics stack onto the base business as we move forward. The projects that are in Canada are performing well. And I -- at some parts of it will end in 2022 and parts of it will end in 2023. So it's a good base for us in Canada. We do see opportunities beyond that and other areas as well. So we continue to kind of see that. And as far as kind of the magnitude, we still see well above the 3 billion type framework in large projects of opportunity. And I think that continues on. It's well above that. I will just comment to that so no one will get excited that it's not that, above that so as we move forward.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Good color, appreciate it Duke.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Alex Rygiel of B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead.\nAlex Rygiel: Thank you and good morning, gentlemen. With regard to the revenue guidance for 2021 of 7% to 10%, what\u2019s the anticipated contribution from acquisitions completed in 2020 as well as ones completed early in 2021?\nDerrick Jensen: I would say that the incremental is probably around 200 or so for the full complement of acquisitions in 2020.\nAlex Rygiel: And then, as you think about capital allocation in 2021, can you quantify or bracket sort of what you're targeting for acquisitions in the coming year either from a revenue contribution basis or capital to purchase those businesses?\nDerrick Jensen: Yeah Alex, I think the strategy remains the same. You'll see us continuing to -- obviously, we're evaluating everything against the stock and what we can do with that and our organic growth. So we'll continue to make sure that we invest back in the business as far as working capital, where we still see plenty of acquisition type targets out there that come through. We're not hard pressed to make acquisitions but if we see the right company, management teams will certainly lean into them as we have in the past. And I think that will also be additive to anything we're trying to accomplish from a strategy standpoint. And I do think when we look at the way the company is running and the way that the capital allocation happens going forward, it does allow us to start thinking really -- the opportunity certainly for double-digit EPS growth year-over-year. And so we've seen much more than that and if you go back on a five year CAGR basis, it's much more than that. You see our guidance this year more than that. So I do think the company's ability to lean in and to pull all levers of the balance sheet to move us forward is certainly there and you'll see us do that. \nDerrick Jensen: Another way to fix that is to go back and look at our averages. I mean, you see that we averaged probably around 400 million or more in deployment of capital and acquisitions over the last four or five years. \nAlex Rygiel: Thank you. \nDuke Austin: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Steven Fisher of UBS. Please go ahead.\nSteve Fisher: Thanks and good morning. Just on the cash flow, your guidance of about 45% conversion of EBITDA seems a little bit higher than you were previously talking about when you get growth going into sort of the upper single-digits on a revenue basis. So I guess, is there anything in particular that's taking that cash flow above that maybe 35% to 40% conversion on a kind of a low single-digit, low to mid-single-digit basis or is this now sort of a new normal kind of cash conversion at a better level? \nDuke Austin: Yeah, thanks for the question, Steve. Actually, what I'd say is, it is a little bit higher. We ended up the year with probably running about a little over 12% working capital as a percentage of trailing four month revenues. Historically, we were really running probably about 13%. So I think we've done a good job of continuing to get some of that pressure down on the working capital side. I think we can maintain that throughout this year and that will give us a little bit higher conversion rate. As Alex has asked there is a little bit of M&A driving the revenue side, so that would factor the revenue growth up just a little bit. But, we've commented multiple times that in a moderated growth rate kind of that mid-single-digit that we could be in that 40% to 50% type conversion, which is largely what you're seeing with a little bit of an uptick based on expectations of maybe a little bit better cash conversion than what we've seen in recent periods. \nSteve Fisher: And then just on the telecom business, just curious what's the bookings potential looks like there, are there any opportunities out there to maybe drive a step function increase in that 900 million backlog it has today or should we now expect that as this business gets a little bit bigger, the growth rate kind of starts to have a moderating trend, both on the revenues and the backlog sides? \nDuke Austin: Yeah Steve, I think when we look at the telecom business we see the macro market, it's very good. And I think our ability to book is there, continue to book. What I would say is we've taken a measured approach to make sure that we kept our double-digit margins and hit those targets. And I think we've done that, we've grown it nicely. As long as we can hit kind of the double-digit target margins that we're after, then we'll continue to see the kind of growth rates but it will moderate at some point above big numbers, we'll get there. But in general, the markets there for us to continue to grow that business above the growth rate of the electric segment, for sure. So I think we see that going forward. And our ability -- what's happening with art -- the art work is that's also going in our municipal electric customer. So it's allowing us even more opportunity to grow the business with even our electrics not inside of the business as far as our crew sets and with 5G and the way that that's going into the -- on the electric space certainly it will push our telecom up even farther. So I'm optimistic, the markets good and we're doing well there. \nSteve Fisher: Perfect, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. \nJamie Cook: Hi, good morning, a nice quarter. I guess my first question back to underground utility infrastructure. Are there any sort of inorganic opportunities that you could do and acquisitions that we could think about in 2021 to somewhat accelerate the margin improvement in this business I know before, or historically Duke you talked about scale and perhaps not enough geographic diversification sort of weighing down on the margins in this business and wondering how opportunistic we can be there versus just waiting for the industrial services business to come back? And then on industrial services, I know you talked about if we normalized you would get margin improvement in that business. I guess what's the revenue growth that you need or can you remind us where industrial services revenues were ended in 2020 versus what you would need to get that margin improvement? Thanks.\nDuke Austin: Thanks, Jamie. To be clear, I want to make sure our goal is to operate that segment and we're doing what's necessary to operate that segment in upper single-digits the way it sits. That being said, our crews aren't sitting. I mean, many times they'll go and perform electric work, they'll do other things on the electric segment. So you're seeing the overall margins of the company move up. No matter what class of work they do, a bore rig for example can bore electric one day, gas the next, and telecom the next. So what we're doing is making sure that our offices are fully utilized. So it's driving the overall margins up of the company and we do anticipate that as we continue to grow out the utility side of that LDC business with integrity and pipe replacements that that will continue to be the largest piece of the segment, as well as move up our margin profile and resiliency of the business as we go forward. So those are 30 year builds. We like that business, where you have put in the Eastern seaboard, albeit it had some issues last year, and just now starting to kind of come back to full scale on the eastern seaboard. So I think when we see all that come together, you're going to start to see it move up fairly rapidly. I do think the industrial business when we acquired stronghold, it was around 500 million, we had anticipated that growing to a billion at some point. But that is back to more normalized level. But so when we look at that piece going forward, we like the pieces that are there, their critical path infrastructure, we've not scaled back to operate at the 500 million mark. We still believe when this moves out that there's greater opportunity for us. So we are holding on to some people to make sure that we can fulfill the customer's needs as we move forward. So there is a little drag on margin there in the industrial business by design. We've done it before in other areas, I think it's the right thing to do for the long-term vision that we have for that group.\nDerrick Jensen: Jamie, a couple of quick points there. Relative to the differential revenue Duke commented effectively, it's about like a couple $100 million. But I think another point that's worth noting is 2021 expectations are exacerbated by kind of a first quarter effect. Industrial is counter seasonal and so it oftentimes contributes a little bit more into the first quarter than the normal aspect of our business. When you look at the modeling, I think what you'll find is for you to get to a 5.5% to 6% margin profile for underground, based upon the breakeven to small loss in the first quarter. You're going to have to see second, third and fourth quarters operating effectively at around 7%. So it's really right now an exacerbated first quarter dynamic that's really creating the majority of the dilution, but otherwise you're seeing margin execution of that remaining portion of business ex industrial in the back half of the year still at kind of that 7% type plus performance.\nJamie Cook: Okay, thank you. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael Dudas of Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nMichael Dudas: Good morning, all. You had some rough weather down your neck in the woods last week to 10 days. Just share with us how you guys work through that and do you get the sense certainly and be in touch with your utility customers maybe for [indiscernible] area just in general and plus the news and the flow that's happened, is this going to accelerate some of the decisions and the problems that Arcot [ph] had to some other parts of the country and are you -- do you think you're going to get a sense of that here in the next couple months, even especially from a regulatory standpoint, not only just in Texas, but now some of the other regulators around the U.S.?\nDerrick Jensen: Yeah, thanks Mike. Thanks for the question. Yeah, we have some weather here for sure and I want to say that our employees, both at the corporate level and in the field does remarkable job of putting earnings out and being safe in the field and getting the lights back on. So that being said, when we look at that I think you're going to have to have some redundancy. No matter what you do, there's intermittency. So whether it be if you're still backed by gas, your pipe that froze out in West Texas you're going to have to see some redundancy and to backup the grid. And now whether you do it with batteries or new pipe, that's certainly there as well as transmission where you had load, you can't bring it out because you are constrained. So I think you're going to see transmission across North America. If we're going to go to more of a renewable sentiment state that's been stated, I've said it before and I'll say it again, the amount of transmission that's necessary to have a robust, redundant system to backup intermittency is large in nature much more than you can anticipate if you go to a European type environment, where you see large corridors of transmission. So I think those spend stay there. Batteries will come into play at some point and be more of take some of that intermittency out, but we're early in batteries as we move forward. So I -- those kind of things to build that modern grid, as you see electric vehicles come on the distribution system, our infrastructure that we have today, we continue to need to invest, to modernize. And you're going to -- our utility customers Capex and OPEX as well as our regulators will continue to put focus on those areas as we move forward.\nMichael Dudas: I appreciate that color. Thanks Duke.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Adam Thalhimer of Thompson Davis. Please go ahead.\nAdam Thalhimer: Hey, good morning guys. Congrats on a strong Q4. \nDuke Austin: Thank you. \nAdam Thalhimer: Hey, Duke, on the transmission side in the U.S. and Canada, just at a high level, what are you seeing in the bidding environment out there? \nDuke Austin: No, we're really busy. I -- most of the work we have are multi-year agreements across the board. So really, we're in multi type year agreements on the base business, and then your larger work, we continue to see a robust bidding environment and transmission side. And I -- from our standpoint we are certainly positioned well for those larger projects, both in Canada and lower 48. So it's a robust environment.\nAdam Thalhimer: And then I guess, sort of the same question on the gas side, where are you in your plans to kind of grow the base business on the gas side with gas utilities adding MSAs?\nDuke Austin: I mean, we're adding MSAs pretty much every year, probably every quarter for that matter. And it's really about us having the qualified personnel and continuing our training programs to get the folks in the field and remain productive and make sure that we keep our margin profile up and don't go past our margins. So it's more about a margin issue than the amount of macro work from a macro standpoint and not work that's out there. So, we'll be prudent about how we step into the gas piece of the LVC market, utility market. But it is certainly there and growing and I think we've grown it kind of upper single-digits to double-digits year-over-year, and you'll continue to see that. \nDerrick Jensen: Maybe -- well, one way to think about it, aggregate MSAs are now -- as it relates to the end of 2020 we're just about 50% or just over 50% of revenues, which has definitely grown from what you've seen three or four years ago. \nAdam Thalhimer: Yeah, good stat. Thanks, Derrick.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Chad Dillard of Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nChad Dillard: Alright, good morning guys. So my question is on the telecom margins and you guys are guiding to I guess, kind of in line with the segment levels through this year and on the revenue side, you are guiding about $700 million. I am just trying to understand, what sort of incremental leverage do you have going from this $700 million this year to your eventual $1 billion run rate and is there a potential upside beyond the second average for telecoms?\nDuke Austin: I think, again, when you see portfolio approach there when you start to use electric crews to not only for electric work, but also telecom work, you get some synergy there that would increase the margins on the telecom side. So as that comes into play in the years beyond when we start looking more 5G in the rural areas, I think you'll start to see margins increase as we go forward. And it's about utilization, PP utilizations and scale with offices from a managerial standpoint as well as a fleet standpoint. So the returns get better as well. \nChad Dillard: It's helpful and just a bigger picture question. So how much will gas transportation and distribution infrastructure need to change and how do you get introduced as a bigger part of the energy mix, just what infrastructure is on the pipe side and are there any parallels you can draw versus what we saw on the Shale gas revolution about a decade ago and in terms of the capabilities that Quanta is there anything you can be [indiscernible] in terms of natural skillset, geographic focus or customer coverage to realize opportunities ahead there?\nDuke Austin: Yeah, I think when you look at the segment, you look at as far as the gas distribution and hydrogen and how it mixes in. It's certainly more corrosive. So, when you're starting to blend it, we're working on those blends and things of that nature today. So that corrosiveness will cause work as well. So we see that going forward, it's early in my mind and we're still working on how that interacts in my mind with what's going on today, but we continue to see gas being utilized in new areas, as well as replacements in our older areas to reduce methane emissions. So that's been something that has gone somewhat unnoticed is the methane emissions that it's caused today from leak prone pipe, that's no longer there. So I think we're doing a good job from the environmental aspect as well by replacing it. And so I think about it like the systems that are in place are very valuable, because it's very difficult to build a new system today. And so the ones that are in place, what will happen is the integrity piece of our business will continue to flourish as we move forward due to you're using an older pipe because it's too difficult to build new pipe. So we'll continue to see our integrity piece move up. And we're looking at that as a strategy as we go forward. \nChad Dillard: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Brent Thielman of D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.\nBrent Thielman: Hey, great. Thank you and congrats on a great quarter and great year. Maybe similar to the last question, these themes of clean energy, electrical vehicles, and the infrastructure needed for that, they are meaningful for your business over the long-term, are there other capabilities or services that you don't have today that could be of interest to leverage those themes more, whether that's direct engagement in renewables development or things around the EV infrastructure arena, just wondering if you're looking at any of those sorts of things and sort of supplemental growth opportunities to the core business? \nDerrick Jensen: Yeah, when you think about everything that you've said, whether it be electric vehicles, automated vehicles, technology, renewables, hydrogen, we're in conversations and collaborations with helping build the modern infrastructure necessary to enable every one of the things that you hear every day. So the company is in a unique position to enable all those things to happen, whether it be electric vehicles on the distribution systems, to make sure that not only can we put charging stations in, but we can also make sure that grid behind it can handle the amount of electric vehicles that are going to be charging on a daily basis. And the intermittency that it causes is a tremendous step forward within the distribution systems that we see today on the electric side. Technology on the telecom side, as we move into 5G, the company is in a very unique position there to deploy resources there. So I think any way you look at it from a sentiment standpoint and how we're becoming more sustainable going forward as well as environmental friendly from a company, we're enabling all those things to happen. \nBrent Thielman: Okay, appreciate that. And then on communications, sorry if you touched on this earlier, but I guess I'm wondering with the completion of the C Band action, whether that's leading to much more meaningful dialogue with customers just around the build out of infrastructure, maybe what are you hearing from them now, now that that's completed?\nDuke Austin: I think we still see the same. I mean, it's a robust conversation on a daily basis about what's going to happen. Obviously, there's been with the pandemic some of the plants have moved and you see more fiber pushing into your suburbs. So that's certainly something that we see but on a go forward, the capital spends there are there and I think we're well positioned to take advantage of that as we move forward.\nBrent Thielman: Okay, thank you. \nDuke Austin: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing comments.\nDuke Austin: Yeah, I want to congratulate the company and the management teams that we have. They're exceptional. We've performed very, very well in tough conditions as well as the corporate office to push out earnings in tough times. And so I commend everyone in the organization. And I want to thank you for participating in the call. We appreciate your questions and ongoing interest in Quanta Services and thank you. This concludes the call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines and log out of the webcast at this time and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Duke Austin",
            "content": "Thanks Kip. Good morning everyone and welcome to the Quanta Services fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings conference call. On the call today I will provide operational and strategic commentary and will then turn it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer who will provide a review of our fourth quarter and full year results and full year 2021 financial expectations. Following Derrick's comments we welcome your questions.  As noted in our earnings release this morning we have renamed both of our segments to include solutions which we believe is an accurate word to describe the value creating and collaborative approach we take to working with our customers. Additionally, we renamed our pipeline and industrial segment to Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions which we believe is more reflective of the strategic changes we have made over the past five years to reposition this segment towards a greater level of resilient business services to our gas utility, pipeline integrity, and industrial customers. These services tend to be more visible and recurring in nature and are driven by safety, reliability, and environmental regulations. We continue to expand our capabilities in both segments to provide comprehensive end-to-end solutions with cross skilled labor at the core.  We're proud of our successful focus on base business activity over the last five years which now accounts for more than 90% of our revenues. We continue to view large projects as upside opportunities and are well positioned to safely execute them when they occur. Quanta performed well and delivered a solid year in 2020 which includes numerous accomplishments. This was due to the performance of our field leadership and the people of this organization, who continue to be exceptional. There are so many accomplishments in 2020. Electric power segment revenues achieved record levels and we earned our best operating margin performance in six years driven by strong execution across our operations. Included in these results were record storm response revenues from supporting our customers efforts to restore power to millions of people adversely impacted by numerous severe weather events during the year. Our ability to quickly mobilize this level of resources to support our customers in times of need even during a pandemic is unmatched in our industry.  After an 18-month competitive process LUMA Energy, our joint venture with ATCO was selected for a 15-year operation and maintenance agreement to operate, maintain, and modernize PREPA's more than 18,000 mile electric transmission and distribution system in Puerto Rico. LUMA and PREPA are making good progress towards transitioning operations of this system this year and we continue to believe this opportunity is transformative for Quanta.  We grew our communication services revenues by more than 40%, meaningfully improved profit margins and ended the year with a total backlog of approximately $900 million. We substantially completed the exit of our Latin American operations, despite the significant challenges and impact to these wind down activities from the effects of COVID-19. We continue to lead the industry in safety, which we believe starts with training. We continue to incrementally invest in our training efforts through our Northwest Line College and Quanta Advanced Training Center. Additionally, last year we began site preparation for a new line worker training campus in Puerto Rico that will be operated by Northwest Line College. The facility will provide world-class training to LUMA's employees and develop Puerto Rico's future cross skilled workforce. Our industry leading training and recruiting initiatives are driving improved productivity in the field and ensures that we have the very best craft skilled labor. This enhances our ability to collaborate with customers and labor affiliations on future workforce needs and further differentiates us and the marketplace as a strategic solutions provider.  We invested approximately $400 million in strategic acquisition of seven high quality companies with great management teams that expand or enhance our ability to provide solutions to our customers or additive to our base business and advance our strategic initiatives. These companies add to our self-perform capabilities, which typically accounts for approximately 85% of our work and are key to providing cost certainty to our customers. We believe our approach to acquisitions and our operating model helps de-risk our work portfolio through improved execution and results in more consistent earnings. We strengthened our financial position with the closing of our $1 billion investment grade senior notes offering, which we believe points to the resiliency and sustainability of our business model and positive multi-year outlook. We demonstrated our commitment to stockholder value and confidence in Quanta's financial strength and continued growth opportunities through the acquisition of approximately $250 million of common stock and a 25% increase in our dividend. And finally, the diversity of our services, proactive cost management, and execution through significant uncertainty caused by the pandemic and challenged energy markets allowed our underground utility and infrastructure solutions operations to perform well under the circumstances. We are optimistic that the most challenging market conditions are behind us, and we see opportunity for revenue and margin improvement in 2021, and continue to believe this segment can achieve upper single-digit operating income margin as operating conditions further normalized over time.  We believe our strategic position in the marketplace remains strong and we are well positioned for continued profitable growth over the near and longer-term. Despite unprecedented operating conditions and uncertainties caused by the global pandemic proportions of our business, the strong performance of our electric power and communications operations resulted in record adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, cash flow, and backlog in 2020. While we are proud of the achievements last year, we remain focused on getting better to ensure that Quanta continues to evolve to effectively collaborate with our customers and business partners and helping them achieve their goals and to capitalize on the opportunities ahead of us.  The recent severe weather conditions that impacted living conditions in Texas and other parts of the country shows how critical infrastructure that we design, build, and maintain is to our everyday wellbeing. The solutions Quanta provides supports our customers' efforts to increase reliability, safety, efficiency, and connectivity, all of which have a favorable environmental and social impact on both the markets that we serve and society. Additionally, our solutions facilitate policies and goals aimed at the adoption of new technologies and transitioning towards a carbon neutral economy. As a result, we believe our business is levered to favorable and sustainable long-term goals.  Our utility customers who account for more than 70% of our 2020 revenues are leaders in the effort to reduce carbon emissions with aggressive efforts to modernize and harden their systems, expand their renewable generation portfolios, and implement new technologies for current and future needs. A number of utilities have committed to providing 100% of their power by clean energy or achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Achieving these goals requires substantial incremental investment in transmission, substation and distribution infrastructure to interconnect new renewable generation facilities to the power grid and to ensure grid reliability due to the significant increase of intermittent power added to the system. Further developed economies are expected to be increasingly driven by electricity to meet carbon reduction goals over time. Vehicle electrification offers a large carbon reduction opportunity in addition to residential and commercial space and water heating and industrial and agriculture electrification. According to a report from the Wire's Group [ph], increased electrification and electric vehicle adoption in United States could require a 70 to 200 gigawatts of new power generation by 2030. The majority of which is expected to be renewables and could require incremental transmission investment of $30 billion to $90 billion by 2030. We believe these investment requirements associated with electrification are in addition to the significant multi-year investment programs already in place for the coming years to modernize the existing power grid to ensure reliable power delivery under current market conditions. The outlook for our communications operations, which is within the electric power segment remains bright. We expect to generate approximately $700 million in revenue this year, which would represent approximately 30% growth over 2020. Our communication services support the technology we use every day for work, education, entertainment, connecting with friends and family, all of which are critically important. To that end, the effects of COVID-19 have caused communication providers to increase investment in the fiber networks to ensure adequate speed, capacity, and reliability to meet these needs. Additionally, we believe Quanta is well positioned to leverage our electric power and communication solutions capabilities to assist many of our rural and municipal electric customers who are expected to participate in the rural digital opportunity fund. This fund provides more than $20 billion to bridge the digital divide that exists for millions of people living in rural America without access to adequate broadband connectivity. Further, we expect 5G deployments to accelerate in 2021, which will remain well positioned to continue to participate in. Our underground utility and infrastructure solutions segment experienced meaningful challenges during the year due to the effects of COVID-19 such as shutdowns in certain cities that had short-term impacts on our gas utility services and the significant reduction in demand for refined products that materially impacted our industrial service customers. As discussed previously, we believe the greatest impacts from these dynamics are behind us. Going forward, we expect to continue our focus on our gas utility, pipeline integrity, and industrial services businesses consistent with our strategy over the last five years due to the favorable long-term trends driven by safety, reliability, and environmental regulations. Our gas utility services supported with regulated programs to replace and modernize aging infrastructure, which can be [indiscernible] and pose potential safety concerns. They also support customer efforts to reduce methane emissions and positions the gas distribution systems to potentially deliver hydrogen to users in the future.  Our pipeline integrity services seek to ensure that existing pipelines operate safely and in an environmentally friendly manner. And many of our industrial services support customer's compliance with regulations aimed at minimizing environmental impacts caused by methane gas release and increase operational efficiency and safety. We believe these favorable safety, reliability, and environmental initiatives and long-term industry trends such as electrifications and technology implementations will continue to drive growth opportunities for Quanta for the foreseeable future. Quanta is actively engaged in collaborative conversations with many of our customers about their multi-year multi-billion dollar programs extending as far as 10 years. Regarding how Quanta can provide solutions throughout our customer's value chain to meet their strategic infrastructure investment goals in support of these initiatives.  In our earnings release this morning, we provided our 2021 guidance. We believe -- which we believe demonstrates the strength and sustainability of our business and long-term strategy, favorable end market trends, our ability to safely execute in a strong competitive position in the marketplace. Our expectations call for growth in revenues, adjusted EBITDA, and earnings per share and improve profit margins. Additionally, we see opportunity to achieve new record levels of backlog in 2021. In summary, we generated solid results in 2020 that we believe reflect the resiliency and sustainability of our business, the benefit of our strong financial position, the successful execution of our strategic initiatives, and the excellence of our people. The challenges we faced and the way we continue to support and collaborate with our customers last year, particularly as it relates to the pandemic, brought out the best of this organization and I believe made Quanta stronger. Overall, our end markets and multi-year visibility are solid, and we have built a strong platform that positions us well to capitalize on favorable long-term trends, particularly the transition towards a carbon neutral economy and the adoption of new technologies. Considering our organic growth opportunities and the levers available to us to allocate future cash flow generation and to creating opportunities such as stock repurchases, acquisitions, strategic investments in dividends, we believe Quanta will continue to generate meaningful stockholder value going forward.  Quanta is a portfolio of exceptional businesses with geographic and service line diversity. We are anchored by our commitment to craft skilled labor and our self-perform capabilities. We are focused on operating the business for the long-term and expect to continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best in class skilled leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's base business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's diversity, unique operating model, and entrepreneurial mindset form the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for all our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO for his review of the fourth quarter and full year results and 2021 expectations. Derrick. Yeah, in Puerto Rico we're making progress, we are staying on task on the timeline that we set forth within our bid process. And so I think we're making great strides there. We're continuing to transition the labor force as well as everything that comes with that from remediation plans and capital plans on the PREPA side of the business. And I -- from my standpoint, I think the third quarter sometime is when we expect to fully transition over into commencement. If not, it will just -- we have a supplemental agreement that will continue and will stay in the supplemental agreement. But the numbers and what we put forth does not change. We continue to be optimistic about the progress we're making as well as what we're doing for the island, the people. We've got our training facility very close to opening so we're seeing a lot of progress there and momentum around what we can do for the island, as far as the people as well as the economics for the island. So everything's on track, going well. Yeah, so I'll take the wild fire question to the West first. When we looked at it last year, we knew in our mind we have one of our larger utilities out there was coming out of bankruptcy, as well as putting a management team in. They are still putting that management team in place. We said all along that if we weren't working on that, we would be working somewhere in the West, that's still the case. It has not -- the demand for our services and what we're doing there from a solution provider to the wildfire assessment, as well as the construction thereafter still remains. I think it's a long-term build in the West around hardening, modernization, and all the things that are necessary when you want to move to more of a carbon free environment. And when we look at that to the West, I think they're a little farther along in their anticipation of being there. So we are still backed up by quite a bit of gas in the region. So I continue to believe that we'll continue to see modernization of that infrastructure as well as hardening for wildfires to the west. And the way we looked at it this year is, we took the normal approach, the same one we've taken in years past, and if we're not busy on the wildfire piece of it we will be busy doing other things in the West. So, I think all that's anticipated. If we start to move and expedite that it would be in the latter half of the year, and we comment on it as a move forward, move upward. So we took a prudent approach to that.  As far as the Biden administration, we've done well under both administrations. It doesn't, whether it be Republican or Democrat, we're really agnostic to that. When we look at it, I think if they follow the energy plan of the 2030-2050 type timeframe, as far as moving to a more carbon free footprint and certainly drives our business, I don't think that sentiment is going away. So we continue to see momentum around renewables and carbon free types of environment, whether it be hydrogen, batteries, whatever it may be that sentiment is there. The administration is certainly pushing that and I think it's beneficial for Quanta on all fronts. So that's where we [spend] [ph]. Yeah. So, I think when we look at the segment and look at what we're trying to accomplish there, we moved it away from large projects into a more of a base business. And you see that happening, as we sit today. When we look at the industrial business what we have it is flat for the year. We do see signs of life there. If the economy comes back, we will get into more normalized industrial sector and see more of the same type of work we've seen over our historical. So if you go back to 2008 and 2009 -- and you look after 2008 and 2009 we have very busy years in industrial space. I expected that will happen. Nothing's changed there, I really liked that business unit, I think we'll grow out of it. We have opportunities where others have left the space. So we continue to see greatest opportunity we've ever had there on a go forward basis. We like it and we'll continue to stay in it.  So again, as Derek commented, we do believe if that gets back and you get in the upper single digits there like it's operated in the past, it will move the whole segment up. And that's what we see. So I -- we're committed to operating this segment in upper single digits. We're making strides to get there every day based on base business and repetitive and resilient type framework with growth to our LDC markets that are regulated markets and that's backing that segment. I will say that the company itself is a portfolio and when you look at those individual segments or operating units that perform that work, it's not they can go perform electric work and do. They perform telecom work and do. So while it looks like in a segment, you get one -- you see it one way, it doesn't mean that we're not fully utilized as a company, and we're not moving forward as a portfolio. So you see the overall margins of the company lift and we've always said that our goal for the company is to be double-digit adjusted EBITDA. Yeah, I mean, when we look at the margins, and you look at it on a CAGR basis, you go back 20 years. We've operated in kind of double-digits and so for us, that's what we see historically. We have operated above that, we've talked about that. I think when we look at our guidance, we take a prudent approach to it. It's very early, we have seasonality, we have all kinds of events. We did pull back to 200 million of storm guidance. So if that's more obviously that would pick up the segment. We're operating really well there and I think, certainly there's opportunity, but as far as where we sit, the guidance that we gave is prudent. And I think if you look at it over time, that's where we will sit over time on a CAGR basis. So yes, there's always opportunity for us, and we're going to do everything we can to operate above that. Good morning Andy. No, we pride ourselves in self performance and kept craft skilled labor. And I think right now that is tight in the marketplace, in our training facilities, and the things that we've done allow us to collaborate with our customers there. So it's really driving the front side of the business and our ability to capture in a more holistic manner, the full value chain that we see in end to end solutions on utility base. So yes, I think we're making great progress there. I think it's something that we said we were going to do and pride ourselves going forward, and it will drive the business forward. So, the capital spends are also getting longer, when we talk about it, when we're talking to customers, our MSAs are lengthening, not getting shorter. So we're seeing more multi-year type MSAs versus one year basically to make sure that they had the craft skill labor and the ability to perform that CAPEX, OPEX on a go forward basis. And I like our position. I think we're doing very well on the utility side of the business as far as capturing more the front side. I mean, when we look at North America, if the sentiment stays to renewables and we continue down the path, there's no way around not putting in large transmission to move load-to-load centers. I think it's whether it be Canada or North America we will continue to see those type dynamics stack onto the base business as we move forward. The projects that are in Canada are performing well. And I -- at some parts of it will end in 2022 and parts of it will end in 2023. So it's a good base for us in Canada. We do see opportunities beyond that and other areas as well. So we continue to kind of see that. And as far as kind of the magnitude, we still see well above the 3 billion type framework in large projects of opportunity. And I think that continues on. It's well above that. I will just comment to that so no one will get excited that it's not that, above that so as we move forward. Thank you. Yeah, thanks for the question, Steve. Actually, what I'd say is, it is a little bit higher. We ended up the year with probably running about a little over 12% working capital as a percentage of trailing four month revenues. Historically, we were really running probably about 13%. So I think we've done a good job of continuing to get some of that pressure down on the working capital side. I think we can maintain that throughout this year and that will give us a little bit higher conversion rate. As Alex has asked there is a little bit of M&A driving the revenue side, so that would factor the revenue growth up just a little bit. But, we've commented multiple times that in a moderated growth rate kind of that mid-single-digit that we could be in that 40% to 50% type conversion, which is largely what you're seeing with a little bit of an uptick based on expectations of maybe a little bit better cash conversion than what we've seen in recent periods. Yeah Steve, I think when we look at the telecom business we see the macro market, it's very good. And I think our ability to book is there, continue to book. What I would say is we've taken a measured approach to make sure that we kept our double-digit margins and hit those targets. And I think we've done that, we've grown it nicely. As long as we can hit kind of the double-digit target margins that we're after, then we'll continue to see the kind of growth rates but it will moderate at some point above big numbers, we'll get there. But in general, the markets there for us to continue to grow that business above the growth rate of the electric segment, for sure. So I think we see that going forward. And our ability -- what's happening with art -- the art work is that's also going in our municipal electric customer. So it's allowing us even more opportunity to grow the business with even our electrics not inside of the business as far as our crew sets and with 5G and the way that that's going into the -- on the electric space certainly it will push our telecom up even farther. So I'm optimistic, the markets good and we're doing well there. Thanks, Jamie. To be clear, I want to make sure our goal is to operate that segment and we're doing what's necessary to operate that segment in upper single-digits the way it sits. That being said, our crews aren't sitting. I mean, many times they'll go and perform electric work, they'll do other things on the electric segment. So you're seeing the overall margins of the company move up. No matter what class of work they do, a bore rig for example can bore electric one day, gas the next, and telecom the next. So what we're doing is making sure that our offices are fully utilized. So it's driving the overall margins up of the company and we do anticipate that as we continue to grow out the utility side of that LDC business with integrity and pipe replacements that that will continue to be the largest piece of the segment, as well as move up our margin profile and resiliency of the business as we go forward. So those are 30 year builds. We like that business, where you have put in the Eastern seaboard, albeit it had some issues last year, and just now starting to kind of come back to full scale on the eastern seaboard. So I think when we see all that come together, you're going to start to see it move up fairly rapidly. I do think the industrial business when we acquired stronghold, it was around 500 million, we had anticipated that growing to a billion at some point. But that is back to more normalized level. But so when we look at that piece going forward, we like the pieces that are there, their critical path infrastructure, we've not scaled back to operate at the 500 million mark. We still believe when this moves out that there's greater opportunity for us. So we are holding on to some people to make sure that we can fulfill the customer's needs as we move forward. So there is a little drag on margin there in the industrial business by design. We've done it before in other areas, I think it's the right thing to do for the long-term vision that we have for that group. Thank you. No, we're really busy. I -- most of the work we have are multi-year agreements across the board. So really, we're in multi type year agreements on the base business, and then your larger work, we continue to see a robust bidding environment and transmission side. And I -- from our standpoint we are certainly positioned well for those larger projects, both in Canada and lower 48. So it's a robust environment. I mean, we're adding MSAs pretty much every year, probably every quarter for that matter. And it's really about us having the qualified personnel and continuing our training programs to get the folks in the field and remain productive and make sure that we keep our margin profile up and don't go past our margins. So it's more about a margin issue than the amount of macro work from a macro standpoint and not work that's out there. So, we'll be prudent about how we step into the gas piece of the LVC market, utility market. But it is certainly there and growing and I think we've grown it kind of upper single-digits to double-digits year-over-year, and you'll continue to see that. I think, again, when you see portfolio approach there when you start to use electric crews to not only for electric work, but also telecom work, you get some synergy there that would increase the margins on the telecom side. So as that comes into play in the years beyond when we start looking more 5G in the rural areas, I think you'll start to see margins increase as we go forward. And it's about utilization, PP utilizations and scale with offices from a managerial standpoint as well as a fleet standpoint. So the returns get better as well. Yeah, I think when you look at the segment, you look at as far as the gas distribution and hydrogen and how it mixes in. It's certainly more corrosive. So, when you're starting to blend it, we're working on those blends and things of that nature today. So that corrosiveness will cause work as well. So we see that going forward, it's early in my mind and we're still working on how that interacts in my mind with what's going on today, but we continue to see gas being utilized in new areas, as well as replacements in our older areas to reduce methane emissions. So that's been something that has gone somewhat unnoticed is the methane emissions that it's caused today from leak prone pipe, that's no longer there. So I think we're doing a good job from the environmental aspect as well by replacing it. And so I think about it like the systems that are in place are very valuable, because it's very difficult to build a new system today. And so the ones that are in place, what will happen is the integrity piece of our business will continue to flourish as we move forward due to you're using an older pipe because it's too difficult to build new pipe. So we'll continue to see our integrity piece move up. And we're looking at that as a strategy as we go forward. I think we still see the same. I mean, it's a robust conversation on a daily basis about what's going to happen. Obviously, there's been with the pandemic some of the plants have moved and you see more fiber pushing into your suburbs. So that's certainly something that we see but on a go forward, the capital spends there are there and I think we're well positioned to take advantage of that as we move forward. Thank you. Yeah, I want to congratulate the company and the management teams that we have. They're exceptional. We've performed very, very well in tough conditions as well as the corporate office to push out earnings in tough times. And so I commend everyone in the organization. And I want to thank you for participating in the call. We appreciate your questions and ongoing interest in Quanta Services and thank you. This concludes the call."

            "name": "Derrick Jensen",
            "content": "Thanks Duke and good morning, everyone. Today we announced fourth quarter 2020 revenues of $2.9 billion. Net income attributable to common stock was $170.1 million or $1.17 per diluted share and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Our non-GAAP measure was $1.22. Overall the fourth quarter closed out another exceptional year of operational performance for Quanta, a year in which we delivered record results across multiple metrics despite headwinds faced related to the pandemic. Our electric power revenues excluding Latin America were $2.11 billion, a 15.7% increase when compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. This increase was driven by mid-single-digit growth in our base business, increased contributions from the timing of certain larger projects, and $75 million in revenues from acquired businesses. Contributing to the base business growth was approximately 13% growth from our communications operations and record fourth quarter demand for our emergency restoration services of approximately $150 million primarily associated with efforts to restore infrastructure in the Southeastern and Midwestern United States although it came at the expense of certain other work in progress. Partially offsetting these increases was the expected reduction in fire hardening work in the Western United States during 4Q 2020, as compared to 4Q 2019.  Electric segment margins in 4Q 2020 were 11.6% and excluding our Latin American operations segment margins were 12.9% versus 9% in 4Q 2019. The robust operating margins were driven by increased profit contributions from the elevated emergency restoration services which typically present opportunities for higher margins due to higher equipment utilization and fixed cost absorption as well as improved margins in our Canadian operations primarily associated with certain larger transmission projects. However, although difficult to calculate the direct incremental effects, excluding revenues and profit from storm response efforts, our margins were still comfortably in double digits reflecting continued strong execution across all of our electric power operations. Of note, our communications margins continue to improve against the prior year with a margin of 9% during the quarter.  Regarding our Latin American operations included within the electric segment, we have substantially completed the wind down activities required to exit those markets. Our year-long effort to shut down our operations across the region was significantly impacted by COVID-19 dynamics, as well as political and regulatory uncertainties and customer challenges all of which contributed meaningfully higher losses than anticipated. In the fourth quarter we took the additional step of reserving remaining property, equipment, and inventory assets as the uncertain market conditions minimized likely recoveries upon disposition. As a reminder, we currently received no tax benefit for losses in Latin America so the $27 million in losses impacted the quarter by approximately $0.19. With minimal contractual obligations remaining, we feel comfortable that other than arbitration updates on the terminated Peruvian communications network project, we will no longer provide commentary on Latin America.  Revenues from our underground utility and infrastructure solution segment were $806 million, 36% lower than 4Q 2019. Similar to prior quarters, expected reduced contributions from larger diameter pipeline projects contributed to the decline. The variability attributable to larger pipeline projects is why we've taken strategic steps to reposition our service offerings around more predictable utility backed revenue streams. While we remain well positioned to opportunistically deploy resources for larger pipeline projects, we expect most future work will consist of smaller pipeline transmission and integrity oriented projects. Additionally, the lingering negative impacts of COVID-19 have reduced some level of demand for broader services across the segment with reduction in demand for refined products, substantially contributing to reduce quarter-over-quarter revenues from our industrial operations.  Operating margins for this segment were 5.1%. These margins were 190 basis points lower than 4Q 2019, primarily due to reduced revenues as well as some degree of execution challenges during the quarter and cost associated with the exit of certain ancillary pipeline operations. These negative impacts were partially offset by net positive project closeouts, primarily driven by the recognition of previously deferred suspension and milestone payments and the reduction of remaining contingency balances associated with the Atlantic coast pipeline project, which was officially terminated on December 31, 2020. Our total backlog was $15.1 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, slightly higher than 4Q 2019 and comparable to the third quarter of 2020 yet remains at record levels. 12 months backlog of $8.3 billion is an increase from both the fourth quarter of 2019 and the third quarter of 2020. As a reminder, the LUMA joint venture is accounted for as an equity method investment, and therefore does not contribute to revenue and is not included in backlog. However, assuming an operating margin profile consistent with our electric power operations LUMA's contribution over the 15-year operation and maintenance agreement would imply a backlog equivalent of more than $6 billion for Quanta. For the fourth quarter of 2020, we generated free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure of $200 million and although $381 million lower than 4Q 2019, it was higher than we anticipated driven by stronger profits in the quarter and the cash cycle consistent with our third quarter results. For the year we generated record free cash flow of $892 million. Day sales outstanding or DSO measured 83 days for the quarter, which was comparable to the third quarter of 2020 and fourth quarter of 2019. Cash flows in the fourth quarter and full year 2020 did partially benefit from the deferral of $37 million and $109 million of employer payroll tax payments permitted by the CARES Act with the payments due in equal installments at the end of 2021 and 2022. We had $185 million of cash at the end of the year with total liquidity of $2.2 billion and a debt to EBITDA ratio as calculated under our credit agreement of approximately 1.2 times. Turning to guidance, we continue to deal with some level of COVID-19 uncertainty as we assess the near-term prospects of our operations, primarily in our underground utility and infrastructure solution segment, and we've remained prudent with our expectations for 2021. However, as we look ahead to 2021 and beyond, we see the base business propelling multi-year growth opportunities for both segments. Electric segment revenues grew to $7.8 billion at the end of 2020 and we continue to see our base business providing mid-single to double-digit growth opportunities, coupled with some degree of increased contributions from larger projects, primarily associated with previously announced projects in Canada. In the aggregate, we expect electric power revenues to range between $8.3 billion and $8.5 billion, which includes expected revenues from our communications operations of around $700 million.  As it relates to electric power segment revenue seasonality, we expect revenue growth in each quarter of 2021 compared to 2020, with quarter-over-quarter growth in the first and second quarters, potentially exceeding 10%. We expect first quarter revenues to be the lowest of the year due to normal seasonal weather dynamics impacting certain construction activities. We expect the high end of our revenue range to represent greater revenue growth opportunities in the third and fourth quarters relative to 2020.  We expect 2021 operating margins for the electric power segment the range between 10.1% and 10.9%, which includes contributions of approximately $29 million or $0.20 per share from the LUMA joint venture and earnings from other integral unconsolidated affiliates. LUMA is expected to contribute around $9 million in the first half of the year, then increasing in the back half of the year as we exit the front-end [ph] transition services period. Although we are proud of our overall electric power performance in 2020, our 11.6% margins excluding Latin America, are above historical averages and are the highest since 2013 due in part to record annual emergency restoration service revenues of $450 million.  As outlined in our accompanying slides, our 2021 expectations for margins for this segment are consistent with historical averages, and are also based on expectations for more normalized emergency restoration service revenues of approximately $200 million, also in line with historical averages. As is typically the case, we expect that first quarter operating margins will be the lowest for the year, possibly slightly below 10%. However, we expect margins to increase into the second and third quarters and then slightly decline in the fourth quarter. We believe communications operating income margins which have been dilutive to segment margins in prior periods could be at parity with electric operations on a full year basis.  The underground utility and infrastructure solutions segment continues to be impacted by COVID-19 and the challenging energy market conditions. However, we are anticipating upper single-digit to double-digit revenue growth off of 2020 with full year revenues expected to range between $3.65 billion to $3.85 billion. Over 90% of our revenue expectations for 2021 represent base business with larger projects representing their lowest level of contributions in the last seven years. From a seasonality perspective, we see first quarter revenues being our lowest for the year, likely more than 20% lower than the first quarter of 2020. This decline is primarily due to significantly reduced industrial service revenues compared to the record results in 1Q 2020 as industrial customers are still dealing with lower demand stemming from decreased global travel activity associated with the pandemic, as well as reduced contributions from lower -- larger pipeline projects.  Revenues should increase sequentially into the third quarter then seasonally decline in the fourth quarter. Quarterly revenues for the second through the fourth quarters are expected to be higher on a quarter-over-quarter basis as compared to 2020 with double-digit growth expected for each quarter. Operating margin improvement for this segment continues to be a focus for us. We see segment margins ranging between 5.5% and 6% led primarily by continued execution within our gas LVC operations. Our full year margin expectations include a breakeven contribution from our industrial services operations in 2021, due to the continued challenging environment. However, to put our current segment margin guidance in context, if our industrial operations contributed at historical pre-COVID margin levels, our segment margin guidance would increase by over 100 basis points.  Consistent with years past and similar to electric power, our first quarter traditionally has lower activity in this segment due to weather seasonality, which impacts our revenues and pressures margin. With current inclement weather across much of the U.S. further pressuring those operations, we expect first quarter margins between breakeven and a small loss. However, we expect solid improvement into the second and third quarters with a seasonal decline in the fourth quarter. These segment operating ranges support our expectation for 2021 annual revenues of $11.95 billion to $12.35 billion and adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure of between $1.09 billion and $1.19 billion. This represents 8% growth at the midpoint of the range when compared to 2020's record adjusted EBITDA. With these operating results, we estimate our range of GAAP diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock for the year to be between $3.16 and $3.66 and anticipate non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $4.02 and $4.52.  Turning to cash flow, we expect free cash flow for 2021 to range between $400 million and $600 million with the standard disclaimer that quarterly free cash flow is subject to sizable movements due to various customer and project dynamic that occur in the normal course of operations. Included in our free cash flow expectation is the anticipated payment of $54 million in the fourth quarter related to payroll taxes that were deferred in 2020. As we have discussed during prior investor events, our cash flow generation moves counter to our revenue growth rates. For instance, a large driver of our significant free cash flow in 2020 was reduced revenues of approximately $900 million compared to 2019, decreasing working capital needs. However, higher revenue growth, like we're guiding for 2021 will likely require a meaningful investment in working capital to support the growth. While our 2021 free cash flow may be negatively impacted by increased working capital required to support our return to 2019 revenue levels, we believe that consistent, sustainable growth profile and solid margins of our base business provides for repeatable levels of free cash flow generation in line with our 2021 guidance in future periods. For additional information, please refer to our outlook summary which can be found on the IR website at quantaservices.com.  Looking back on our 2020 performance, although there were headwinds to the year, we ended the year with $11.2 billion in revenues, which represents an 8.1% revenue CAGR since 2015. More importantly, we ended the year with slightly over $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA, a record for Quanta and equal to our goal established five years ago, which represents a nearly 15% CAGR since 2015. Lastly, our record adjusted EPS of $3.82 represents a 28% CAGR since 2015, with our adjusted EPS growing faster than profits, which are growing faster than revenues. Over the last five years, we have deployed approximately $1.4 billion in cash for M&A and strategic investments, and $760 million for stock repurchases. While we acquire $250 million of common stock in 2020 and $7 million of common stock through February 24, 2021, we have approximately $530 million of availability remaining on our current stock repurchase program. Our first capital priority remains supporting the growth of our business through working capital and capital expenditures, however, we remain committed to the deployment of remaining available capital to stockholders through our stock repurchase and dividend programs and we continue to expect opportunistic acquisitions.  Our $1 billion bond offering in 2020 established a fixed level of debt that nicely complements our current EBITDA profile, which we believe is a repeatable, sustainable baseline of earnings. Simultaneously, we secured an expanded credit facility further enhancing our ability to meet incremental capital needs. Overall, we remain confident in the strength of our operations, our prospects for profitable growth, and the repeatable and sustainable nature of our core markets. We've developed a platform for Quanta to capitalize on the trends driving the spend in our markets, and we firmly believe delivering base business solutions to world class craft skilled labor, optimistic larger project deployments, and continued balance sheet strength will be the key to delivering long-term shareholder value. This concludes our formal presentation and we will now open the line for Q&A. Operator. Yeah, Sean, one other bit of color. I mean, no, it's not really right to look at 2020 to 2021 being all as the storm pullback. Clearly, that is a component of it but that's what Duke is saying, the broader aspect of the operating model would average into that 10%. We've got a slide in there trying to illustrate that in the slide deck. And then relative to going forward though, yes, as it relates to the back half of the year performance for 2021 going into 2022 to the extent that you saw more of run rate type dynamics for LUMA in the back half of the year then yes, that would be accretive to thinking about the model going into 2022. I would say that the incremental is probably around 200 or so for the full complement of acquisitions in 2020. Yeah Alex, I think the strategy remains the same. You'll see us continuing to -- obviously, we're evaluating everything against the stock and what we can do with that and our organic growth. So we'll continue to make sure that we invest back in the business as far as working capital, where we still see plenty of acquisition type targets out there that come through. We're not hard pressed to make acquisitions but if we see the right company, management teams will certainly lean into them as we have in the past. And I think that will also be additive to anything we're trying to accomplish from a strategy standpoint. And I do think when we look at the way the company is running and the way that the capital allocation happens going forward, it does allow us to start thinking really -- the opportunity certainly for double-digit EPS growth year-over-year. And so we've seen much more than that and if you go back on a five year CAGR basis, it's much more than that. You see our guidance this year more than that. So I do think the company's ability to lean in and to pull all levers of the balance sheet to move us forward is certainly there and you'll see us do that. Another way to fix that is to go back and look at our averages. I mean, you see that we averaged probably around 400 million or more in deployment of capital and acquisitions over the last four or five years. Jamie, a couple of quick points there. Relative to the differential revenue Duke commented effectively, it's about like a couple $100 million. But I think another point that's worth noting is 2021 expectations are exacerbated by kind of a first quarter effect. Industrial is counter seasonal and so it oftentimes contributes a little bit more into the first quarter than the normal aspect of our business. When you look at the modeling, I think what you'll find is for you to get to a 5.5% to 6% margin profile for underground, based upon the breakeven to small loss in the first quarter. You're going to have to see second, third and fourth quarters operating effectively at around 7%. So it's really right now an exacerbated first quarter dynamic that's really creating the majority of the dilution, but otherwise you're seeing margin execution of that remaining portion of business ex industrial in the back half of the year still at kind of that 7% type plus performance. Yeah, thanks Mike. Thanks for the question. Yeah, we have some weather here for sure and I want to say that our employees, both at the corporate level and in the field does remarkable job of putting earnings out and being safe in the field and getting the lights back on. So that being said, when we look at that I think you're going to have to have some redundancy. No matter what you do, there's intermittency. So whether it be if you're still backed by gas, your pipe that froze out in West Texas you're going to have to see some redundancy and to backup the grid. And now whether you do it with batteries or new pipe, that's certainly there as well as transmission where you had load, you can't bring it out because you are constrained. So I think you're going to see transmission across North America. If we're going to go to more of a renewable sentiment state that's been stated, I've said it before and I'll say it again, the amount of transmission that's necessary to have a robust, redundant system to backup intermittency is large in nature much more than you can anticipate if you go to a European type environment, where you see large corridors of transmission. So I think those spend stay there. Batteries will come into play at some point and be more of take some of that intermittency out, but we're early in batteries as we move forward. So I -- those kind of things to build that modern grid, as you see electric vehicles come on the distribution system, our infrastructure that we have today, we continue to need to invest, to modernize. And you're going to -- our utility customers Capex and OPEX as well as our regulators will continue to put focus on those areas as we move forward. Maybe -- well, one way to think about it, aggregate MSAs are now -- as it relates to the end of 2020 we're just about 50% or just over 50% of revenues, which has definitely grown from what you've seen three or four years ago. Yeah, when you think about everything that you've said, whether it be electric vehicles, automated vehicles, technology, renewables, hydrogen, we're in conversations and collaborations with helping build the modern infrastructure necessary to enable every one of the things that you hear every day. So the company is in a unique position to enable all those things to happen, whether it be electric vehicles on the distribution systems, to make sure that not only can we put charging stations in, but we can also make sure that grid behind it can handle the amount of electric vehicles that are going to be charging on a daily basis. And the intermittency that it causes is a tremendous step forward within the distribution systems that we see today on the electric side. Technology on the telecom side, as we move into 5G, the company is in a very unique position there to deploy resources there. So I think any way you look at it from a sentiment standpoint and how we're becoming more sustainable going forward as well as environmental friendly from a company, we're enabling all those things to happen."

With that, I would like to now turn the call over to Mr. Duke Austin, Quanta's President and CEO. Duke?\nDuke Austin: Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. On the call today, I will provide operational and strategic commentary and we'll then turn it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a review of our third quarter results and full year 2020 financial expectations. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions. This morning, we reported strong third quarter results, including profitability that meaningfully exceeded our expectations. The performance of our field leadership and the people of this organization continue to be nothing short of impressive. They have successfully adapted to working through a pandemic, while continuing to restore critical infrastructure in extreme conditions. The strength of our performance was reflected in our Electric Power segment margins, including our communications operations and our Pipeline and Industrial segment margins. It is also reflected in our record earnings per share and backlog, which continues to demonstrate the resiliency of our business and the operational excellence of our people during extraordinary economic and operating conditions. In addition, we strengthened our financial position with the closing of our $1 billion senior notes offering, expansion of the capacity and extension of the term of our credit facility and our receipt of an investment-grade credit rating, all of which, we believe, points to the resiliency and sustainability of our business model and positive multiyear outlook. Derrick and our finance and treasury team did an outstanding job, managing the simultaneous and successful financing processes and we're able to secure capital at attractive rates and terms. And finally, an important part of our value proposition to all our stakeholders is Quanta's commitment to corporate responsibility and sustainability. To that end, during the third quarter we published our first corporate responsibility report, which focuses on our commitment to people, planet and principles. Quanta has a great ESG story to tell and we are pleased with the progress we are making to provide increased transparency into our corporate responsibility and sustainability initiatives. Turning to our operating results. Our Electric Power operations produced record quarterly revenue and solid operating margins, driven by strong demand for our services, effective cost management, high utilizations, operational excellence and record levels of emergency response activity. Utilities continue to actively deploy capital into their systems to modernize, harden and expand them and to integrate renewable generation to transition towards a carbon-neutral or carbon-free environment. To that end, we are actively performing infrastructure work, including substations and transmission interconnects for onshore wind and solar projects and are seeing additional opportunities associated with offshore wind, battery projects and hydroelectric development. Large-scale deployment of renewable generation will require both upgrades to and expansion of the transmission backbone and we are well-positioned to perform these services. During the quarter, Quanta deployed significant resources to provide emergency response services to utilities in support of their efforts to restore power to millions of people that were impacted by severe weather events. These events included Hurricanes Isaias, Laura, Sally and Delta as well as a derecho storm in the Midwest. Quanta crews have worked more than 90 consecutive days restoring power and rebuilding damaged infrastructure in response to these events. With crew still out today in response to Hurricane Delta and now Hurricane Zeta, in the aggregate, we have deployed approximately 7,000 line workers and support staff from 20 different operating units in response to these severe weather events. Our ability to quickly mobilize this level of resources to support our customers in times of need is unmatched in our industry. These severe weather events and the devastating wildfires in the western region of the United States are examples of why many utilities are implementing system-hardening initiatives to make the power grid more resilient and safer. We believe there are many years of storm-hardening investments still to come and that we are in very early stages of fire hardening activity. These necessary investments in multi-year programs will cost tens of billions of dollars in the aggregate and Quanta is actively involved in supporting our customers with these initiatives. To that end, in the third quarter, we acquired a family-run utility contractor based in North Carolina that provides electric power distribution, transmission and substation maintenance and construction services primarily in the Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. This company increases our resources in the region and enhances our ability to serve our customers with our grid modernization, hardening and renewable programs. Since announcing in June that LUMA Energy was selected to operate, maintain and modernize the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority or PREPA's electric transmission and distribution system in Puerto Rico. LUMA has made good progress towards satisfying the necessary steps to facilitate the full transition of PREPA's T&D operations to LUMA in mid-2021. Additionally, we have begun site preparation for a new line worker training campus in Puerto Rico that will be operated by Northwest Line College. The LUMA College for Technical Training will use the facility to provide world-class training to its employees and to develop Puerto Rico's future craft-skilled workforce. The first on-island pre-apprentice class is scheduled to begin in the spring of 2021 and currently includes 32 Puerto Rican students. Quanta and ATCO also selected and sponsored several Puerto Rican students who are now in the pre-apprentice program at our Northwest Line College campus in Edgewater, Florida. Further, in September, the Trump administration announced that $12.8 billion had been allocated to the Puerto Rico -- to Puerto Rico primarily to rebuild the electric power grid through Federal Emergency Management Agency or FEMA. Post commencement, LUMA will work with PREPA, FEMA and other agencies to manage the deployment of these funds to modernize the Puerto Rico power grid over the coming years. Our communications infrastructure services operation, which are included in the Electric Power segment performed extremely well in the third quarter, with strong double-digit revenue growth and double-digit operating income margin. We continue to make progress and profitability scaling our operations. We believe our operations have the opportunity to achieve more than $500 million in revenue in 2020 reflecting double-digit revenue growth and upper single-digit operating margin. Total backlog at the end of the quarter for our communications operations was approximately $975 million a record. Additionally, in our press release this morning, we highlighted our recent acquisition of a Utah-based company that primarily serves the Mountain West region of the United States and specializes in the deployment of short and long-haul fiber optic cable and utilities, and the engineering and design of small and large-scale projects. This company enhances our capabilities in the region, and we expect to expand and grow their presence into new areas over time. The effects of COVID-19 continue to cause communication providers to increase investment in their fiber networks, to ensure adequate speed and capacity to meet work education and entertainment from home demands. We believe this incremental investment in their fiber network has shifted 5G deployment activity level somewhat. However, we expect 5G deployments to accelerate in 2021. COVID-19 has also highlighted the importance of broadband connectivity and digital divide that exists for millions of people living in rural America without access to adequate broadband connectivity. To bridge the gap, the Federal Communications Commission has established a rural digital opportunity fund to provide more than $20 billion in federal funds to bring high-speed fixed broadband service to underserved rural homes and small businesses. There are several hundred service providers that have qualified to pursue the funding, many of whom are rural electric cooperatives and municipal entities. Quanta has strong relationships with many of these rural electric providers and is well-positioned to provide turnkey solutions to help them deploy broadband services to their customers in rural markets. Turning to our Pipeline and Industrial segment. Our gas utility operations performed well during the quarter and are gradually returning to pre-COVID levels, executing on multi-decade modernization programs to replace aging gas distribution infrastructure in order to meet regulatory requirements that are aimed at improving reliability and safety. Demand for our pipeline integrity services is also solid as regulatory requirements for investment and the permitting challenges for new pipelines make existing pipeline infrastructure more valuable, increasing pipeline owners' desire to extend the useful life of existing pipeline assets through integrity initiatives. Perhaps the most challenging end market in this segment is the industrial services, which has been heavily impacted by reduced demand for refined products. Our industrial services operations are performing well in the current environment and are expected to be profitable for the year, but we currently do not anticipate a return to normalcy until the second half of 2021. However, we have a world-class management team leading our operations who have managed costs well and are using the current environment as an opportunity to strengthen our competitive positioning and emerge stronger as conditions improve. Although larger pipeline projects are a smaller portion of the segment, solid execution during the quarter led to early completion of some projects, which positively contributed to segment results. Going forward, we expect to continue our focus on growing the base gas utility pipeline integrity and industrial services business consistent with our strategy over the last five years. We believe there is opportunity for revenue and profitability improvement next year for the entire segment and continue to believe a post-COVID operating environment will allow us to achieve upper single-digit operating margins and improved returns. We have increased our financial expectations for the year due to our strong third quarter results, healthy end market drivers and the addition of recently announced acquisitions. Perhaps more importantly, we continue to believe we're in a multiyear upcycle with opportunity for continued profitable growth. While we provide our formal commentary and 2021 expectations on the fourth quarter earnings call next February, we currently expect growth in consolidated revenues, net income, adjusted EBITDA and earnings per share in 2021. And as we have commented on prior earnings calls, we would expect our adjusted EPS expectations to include $4 in its range. Over the past five years we have executed on our strategy and remain dedicated to growing and enhancing our portfolio of services, which strengthens our ability to capture more of the customers' large programmatic spending programs and to operate in a responsible and sustainable way. These efforts are designed to mitigate risk inherent in our business and prepare for unexpected events through diversification and by maintaining a strong financial profile. We believe Quanta has a long runway ahead of us for generating repeatable and sustainable earnings as we execute on our strategic initiatives. Considering our organic growth opportunities and the levers available to us to allocate future cash flow generation into value-creating opportunities such as stock repurchases, acquisitions and strategic investments and dividends, we believe Quanta can continue to generate meaningful stockholder value. We are focused on operating the business for the long-term and expect to continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class build leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's base business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's diversity unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset form the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for all our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO for his review of the third quarter results and 2020 expectations. Derrick?\nDerrick Jensen: Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today we announced third quarter 2020 revenues to $3 billion. Net income attributable to common stock was $163 million or $1.13 per diluted share and adjusted diluted earnings per share a non-GAAP measure was $1.40. The third quarter was strong for Quanta with numerous consolidated and segment records and performance during the quarter aggregating to record EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Our Electric Power revenues excluding Latin America were $2.1 billion, a 14% increase when compared to the third quarter of 2019. This increase was primarily driven by increased contributions from larger projects, as well as continued growth from our communications operations, which are included within the Electric Power segment and delivered a 40% increase compared to the third quarter of 2019. Also contributing to the increase were approximately $65 million in revenues from acquired businesses. Additionally, we had a record amount of emergency restoration services in the quarter, primarily associated with efforts to restore infrastructure along the Gulf Coast. Our results included approximately $200 million of revenues from those efforts. However, those revenues came at the expense of other work in progress. Our distribution work decreased over 20% compared to 3Q 2019 and largely offset the increase in storm revenues driven in part by utilization of crews from existing work being reallocated to emergency restoration efforts but also due to lower levels of fire hardening work compared to 2019. Electric segment margins in 3Q 2020 were 12.7% and excluding our Latin American operations segment margins were a record 13.5% versus 9.6% in 3Q 2019. The robust operating margins were driven by increased profit contributions from emergency restoration efforts, which typically present opportunities for higher margins than our normal base business activities due to higher utilization. However, excluding revenues and profit from storm response efforts, our margins still were comfortably in double-digit reflecting continued strong execution across our operations. Of note, our communications margins continue to improve both against last year and sequentially and exceeded 10% during the quarter. Regarding our Latin American operations included within the Electric Power segment, we continue to expedite the wind-down activities required to exit those markets. The continued COVID-19 dynamics coupled with customer challenges and local labor issues have significantly impacted our efforts and have resulted in losses in excess of our expectations. While work remains to fully shut down our operations, it's important to note that more than 80% of the active jobs at the beginning of 2020 have been completed with fewer than 50 open jobs remaining at the end of the quarter. We remain confident that will be largely complete with our exit by year-end. Of note, we currently received no tax benefit for losses in Latin America so the $15 million in losses impacted the quarter by approximately $0.11, $0.05 more than we anticipated. The Pipeline and Industrial segment continues to be negatively impacted by COVID-19 and the associated reduction in demand for refined products. Revenues for the segment were $913 million, 38% lower than 3Q 2019 due to reduced revenues from our industrial operations and a reduction in contributions from larger pipeline projects. Partially offsetting these declines were increased levels of gas distribution revenues including approximately $70 million from acquired companies. Despite the COVID-related headwinds, the segment delivered margins of 8.4%. These margins were 60 basis points lower than 3Q 2019, primarily due to the reduced revenues from larger pipeline projects and our industrial operations, but a solid performance given the continued challenges across the segment. Operating margins benefited from net favorable adjustments on certain larger pipeline projects associated with the recognition of previously deferred milestone payments and reduced contingencies due to a reduction in the scope of work to be completed on a project as well as certain projects completing earlier than anticipated with work accelerating into the third quarter. In addition, we had continued strong execution across much of our base business activity including gas distribution and integrity work. Our total backlog was $15.1 billion at the end of the third quarter, approximately $1.8 billion or 13% higher than 3Q 2019 and a $1.1 billion increase from the second quarter of 2020. 12-month backlog of $8.1 billion is an increase from both the third quarter of 2019 and the second quarter of 2020. The increase in total backlog is largely due to several new multiyear MSA arrangements from both electric and gas utility customers, again validating the continued favorable dynamics across our core utility market and our base business activities as well as approximately $290 million in total backlog associated with acquired companies. For the third quarter of 2020 we generated free cash flow a non-GAAP measure of $70 million, $40 million higher than 3Q 2019. Free cash flow was higher than we anticipated driven by stronger profits in the quarter and a cash cycle consistent with our second quarter results. As we mentioned in last quarter's call, we are prudently forecasting our DSO to increase due to uncertainty around COVID-19's potential impact on our customers. Ultimately, we did not experience any meaningful delays which positively contributed to the increased cash flow relative to our expectations. Days sales outstanding or DSO measured 82 days for the third quarter comparable to the second quarter, but a decrease of nine days compared to the third quarter of 2019 as 3Q 2019 was negatively impacted by higher retainage balances due to project timing and billing process changes for certain customers. Cash flows in the third quarter also benefited from the deferral of $41 million of payroll tax payments permitted by the CARES Act with the payments due in equal amount at the end of 2021 and 2022. We had approximately $220 million of cash at the end of the quarter. As of September 30, 2020 we had total liquidity of approximately $2.2 billion and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio as calculated under our credit agreement of approximately 1.3 times. As Duke mentioned, on September 22 we closed the sale of $1 billion aggregate principal amount of our 2.9% senior notes due 2030. We received net proceeds from the offering of $986.7 million, which together with cash on hand were used to repay the term loans outstanding under our credit agreement in the aggregate principal amount of $1.21 billion. Both Moody's and S&P independently assess our business and highlighting our highly trained workforce, favorable end market dynamics, consistent free cash flow and solid liquidity profile concluded that we are in investment-grade credit. I believe these ratings validate how we've strategically positioned the business around repeatable, sustainable revenue streams, anchored by construction-led solutions and our world-class craft-skilled workforce. We continue to emphasize the recurring nature of the services we provide to critical infrastructure owners and this rating reinforces that message. Also on September 22, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement that among other things, increased the aggregate revolving commitments from $2.14 billion to $2.51 billion and extended the maturity date from October 2022 to September 2025. It's important to note that successfully executing this expansion and extension of our credit facility during these uncertain times is another testament to the sustainability and positive long-term outlook of our business. Both the successful bond offering and amended credit facility were strategically important for our organization. The $1 billion bond offering established a fixed level of debt that nicely complements our current EBITDA profile, which we believe is a repeatable sustainable baseline of earnings. Simultaneously, we secured an expanded credit facility further enhancing our ability to meet incremental capital needs. While our previous capital structure provided adequate liquidity, the refinancing allowed us to diversify our capital sources, lock in a historically low cost of capital while staggering our maturities, giving us more flexibility and capital to support our growth expectations. Turning to our guidance. We continue to deal with some level of uncertainty as we assess the near-term prospects of our operations, particularly those that are susceptible to local stay-at-home orders, operate in close facilities or depend upon project teams having access to local permitting offices. As COVID-19 case counts continue to rise in many parts of the U.S., we've remained prudent with our expectations for the fourth quarter. We now expect full year revenues for the electric power segment to be between $7.7 billion and $7.8 billion. We are increasing full year operating margin expectations to around 10.2%, with Latin America contributing operating losses of $55 million to $60 million. Excluding Latin American losses, margins are now expected to be around 11%, which reflects continued successful project execution plus the incremental impact of the LUMA joint venture and other earnings from integral and consolidated affiliates. As a reminder, the LUMA joint venture is accounted for as an equity method investment and therefore will not contribute to revenues. However, we are including our equity and earnings of LUMA within operating income, since LUMA is operationally integral to our operations under accounting guidance. These results are presented after tax and are anticipated to positively contribute to operating income in 2020 by approximately $11 million or $0.07 to $0.08 per share. The P&I segment continues to be impacted by COVID-19 and the challenged energy market conditions and accordingly we are reducing our full year revenue expectations to range between $3.4 billion and $3.5 billion. The reduction is primarily attributable to reduced spend expectations for certain smaller capital projects as well as the delay of certain work into 2021. Full year operating margin for the P&I segment remains around 5%. With regard to the cancellation of the ACP pipeline project discussed last quarter, we continue to work with the customers to determine how the project will close out and expect termination by the end of the year. We believe potential upside associated with termination fees and other contract accounting exists. However the final contract closeout will not be determined until any closeout scopes of work and related termination items are determined by ACP and then agreed and allocated by the joint venture to Quanta. As noted in our earnings release this morning, we have increased our full year earnings per share expectations and now expect GAAP diluted earnings per share of between $2.61 and $2.72 and adjusted diluted earnings per share a non-GAAP measure of between $3.52 and $3.64. These earnings per share expectations include a loss per share of between $0.38 and $0.41 from our Latin American operations. Turning to cash flow. We are maintaining our free cash flow guidance for the year, expecting it to range between $600 million and $800 million. Third quarter cash flows were stronger than expected but we now expect a more modest fourth quarter than we originally forecasted. For the year, we expect working capital of approximately 13% of annual revenues consistent with our historical experience. That expectation assumes an increased DSO for the fourth quarter in part due to elevated amounts of emergency restoration receivables generated in the third quarter which oftentimes can have longer collection cycles. Additionally, while we have yet to experience meaningful payment delays related to COVID-19 through the first three quarters of the year, we remain cautious and accordingly are factoring in some pressure negatively impacting DSO in the fourth quarter. Overall, we are pleased with how we've continued to execute through these times of uncertainty and remain confident in the long-term prospects of our business. Our full year expectations include adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1 billion at the midpoint, which we believe is a baseline that is set to expand in 2021 and beyond, driven by the recurring sustainable demand for our base business services complemented by our large-project expertise. We fortified our balance sheet with the bond offering and amended credit facility, increasing our liquidity and enhancing our ability to pursue opportunistic deployments of capital for M&A and investments as well as returns of capital providing us with the foundation to continue delivering shareholder value. This concludes our formal presentation and we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Andy Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Please go ahead. \nAndy Kaplowitz: Hey. Good morning, guys. Nice quarter. Duke, you mentioned that you're actively pursuing additional opportunities in renewables, especially, as offshore battery solar ramp up. As you look at your core transmission distribution business are you already seeing an acceleration in your business as the focus on renewables increases? And then maybe put in perspective the backlog growth you're seeing in Electric Power as your MSAs continue to grow. I think your 12-month backlog is up more than 10%. So can you talk about your confidence that Electric Power growth could actually follow your 12-month backlog as you go into 2021?\nDuke Austin: Yes. Thanks Andy for the comments. When we look at renewables in the spaces that we play mainly around the interconnections, I think, when we think about it the sentiment around a carbon-free environment -- getting to a carbon-free environment, while we may think it takes longer than what's being said there's no question around the need for transmission, the interconnections, the redundancy in the grid to support the intermittency of any renewables with -- either with batteries or however you do it. But all those things for us -- we're working with our customers on those on a daily basis whether it be offshore wind and over on the eastern seaboard or just in general across the board. It's still ongoing. The pace is about the same in my mind, maybe a little bit expedited in certain areas. But in general, that pace continues. And any compression of time on that the need for transmission, interconnections, redundancy is only greater. So if you moved it from 2050 to 2030, you said you wanted to go more carbon-free, it would take longer. That being said, the way that the transmission system works today there's a lot of work to be done to make that more redundant as well as more modern as we move into more of a renewable footprint.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Thanks for that Duke. And then maybe you can put the quarter the $1.40 you just did in perspective for us because it's, obviously, way larger than I think you've recorded in the quarter, and still as you said has Latin American drag doesn't really include much LUMA work. So again, as we go into 2021 maybe you can talk about -- I know you mentioned storms. So how much was storm work in Q3? And outside of storm what does the result tell you about the thought process in 2020 because you already mentioned the confidence in $4, but given some of these headwinds seem to be abating as you go into next year shouldn't you have confidence that maybe you can do decently over $4?\nDuke Austin: Yes. Thanks for the comments. I think in general, we've talked about the programmatic spends of our customers the capital spends that we see. The increasing backlog -- I failed to get to that answer a minute ago, but in general we see -- continue to see record backlog. The opportunity for additional programmatic spends are there. So that piece of business continues to grow underneath and we talk about 85% to 90% of the business being that base business that backs that up. It gives us a great deal of confidence of the resiliency of the model when we set out four or five years ago. Now we've set out to build this model to be resilient and to be able to give you guidance and be able to not be so choppy. So when we talk about $4, it's based on that kind of capital spend within our utility customer -- our customer base and that's why you're seeing our backlog increased. There's opportunities for these larger project dynamics. They're there. We booked some in the quarter. You saw that with the clean line in there in Maine. So in general, you're seeing us book-stacking. We talked about the stacking effect on the base, but the base continues to grow. We talked mid single to \u2013 mid single-digits. We've been growing past that. But that's there. The storms it was $200 million somewhere in there. It's less than 10% of the overall segment right in there on the top side. It's typically not meaningful, but it was meaningful in the quarter. That being said, there was still broad-based execution above what we would consider normal margins for us due to utilization. We're doing a nice job with cost in the field and execution in the field. So real proud of the organization on how we've adapted to the pandemic.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Thanks, Duke. Appreciate it.\nDuke Austin: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Andrew Wittmann of Baird. Please go ahead. \nAndrew Wittmann: Great. Thanks and good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my question. I don't usually ask about telecom, but I feel like we're getting to the point where just talking a little bit more about your $1 billion in backlog, kind of, just struck me versus the $500 million of revenue that you guys are anticipating during this year and so given that the relationship between backlog and the revenues is pretty high here. I'm just wondering how do the visibility is shaping up for this business into 2021. I mean do you feel like the very strong growth rates that you saw here in 2020 off of a smaller base can these rates of growth continue? Or do they have to start to level? Just wondering how the amount of backlog that you have today informs that view.\nDuke Austin: Yes. I mean, I think you see the backlog increasing. And as we move into next year and later into this year, we had a record quarter for us this quarter. And I think we saw the margins at parity fairly close to the electric margins. And so, we're seeing double-digit margin profiles. We're doing the things that we said we would do from a scale standpoint in the field and our ability to execute. We needed to build the front side. We made an acquisition in the last quarter there on the front side of the business to help us gain traction there on the EPC side and also collaborate with the customer. That will benefit us as we move forward. We've talked about it being a $1 billion business. There's every opportunity for that to happen. The pace of growth will remain around the margin profile going forward. We want to continue the double-digit margin profile. And that's the -- that will pace our growth. But I'm optimistic that we'll continue to see these type of growth rates on a go-forward basis.\nAndrew Wittmann: Okay. Great. And then I guess I wanted to just dig in a little bit more on the P&I segment as well. And I just wanted to make sure that I understand. We all understood that the nature of the disruptions that you're experiencing I think that was the term that you used. Early on it was disruption from site issues where with shelter-in-place orders you couldn't get to the site. It doesn't sound like that's the issue. It sounds like more of the disruption that you're experiencing is just weak oil prices demand for refined products on the industrial segment. I just want to make sure we understood that correctly. Maybe you could expand on that. But I guess there's also an implication here on the larger diameter pipeline work that you have done again a small piece of the business. It sounds like you executed some of that really well. Got it done in the quarter. So is large diameter basically kind of cleaned up for now inside of the portfolio I guess is the question? Is there not more -- is there not a lot of backlog really to work off anymore now that you're done early? Or do you think that there still can be some contribution from that in 2021 recognizing that yesterday there was an announcement from TC Energy setting you as a contractor on KXL?\nDuke Austin: Yes. So the P&I segment. When we look at the industrial side of the business, I think that's the biggest unknown for us is just when does the economy come back? We've talked about it and communicated it. We felt like it would be later in the third quarter or later half of next year when we talk about P&I. We're doing okay. We're not where we want to be there in order to get the margins where we want them to be. So I think in general that would be the P&I segment. If economy comes back it's kind of like an '08 '09 effect for that type of business a little bit greater. But in general, we have some critical path solutions there that are necessary. It allows us to do things that others can't. And I think in general the business is good. But for us to get to those -- the margins that we've stated that we want to be our goal we need that business to pick up in the later half of next year. We've contemplated all that in the $4 number that we've talked about. On the larger diameter pipe, we talked about a $500 million number in guidance next year. That's kind of how you should think about the business, when we think about it same thing whether you hear announcements or not as we stand that's what we see. It certainly has the ability to expand and we have the opportunity to expand it within Canada and other places. We'll look at it from a risk standpoint. And if we book-work we'll let you know. But in general in our mind the $4 number and everything we're talking about contemplates that business being around $500 million not to say, there's not smaller projects not to say there's not opportunity because there is. And we did execute well through the quarter. We went through and had some milestones and contingency releases on different things. It's due to execution.\nAndrew Wittmann: All right. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Sean Eastman of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. \nSean Eastman: Hi, good job this quarter. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to go back on the Electric Power margins. I mean that was the real eyepopper for me around the results. You spoke to some juice from the storm response you spoke to good execution good utilization. I'm just wondering, if there's anything structural in there. Maybe just around the growth here and Quanta size whether there's any pricing benefit. And then I'm also just curious about the mix. If we look at New England Clean Energy Connect coming into the mix next year still executing a lot here. Is that sort of mix dynamic going to be accretive going into next year? Just rounding that out would be great.\nDuke Austin: That's correct. We're doing a nice job executing on the Electric Power segment both from -- our telecom is starting to be additive to the segment as well. And we have broad base. Just -- it's a strategy we had five years ago. We said we'd build a base business. We've scaled the operations in the field and really worked with the customer to collaborate in order to build on these programmatic spends that we've been talking about for a long period of time in order to modernize the system harden the systems for the events that you're seeing now. You see it in California at the West on the wildfires you see it with the hurricanes derechos whatever it may be. These events happen. I think in general we've got our heads around hardening the systems and modernizing them. So you're seeing all that, you're seeing our capital, but we're supporting our customer at a very high level, taking more of the programmatic spends and it's showing up in the electric segment as we move forward. I think we have every opportunity to continue this.  We talked about a kind of a double-digit margin there over time. We were working through it last year with California. You had some movement there with crews moving back and forth and it dragged margins down. Once we said, it would get stabilized and once it's stabilized you would see improvements. And I think we get set, we get things scaled and we can do our margins to improve.  So we get better utilizations, better execution and that's what you're seeing today. Can we stack more larger projects on there? Sure. As they come we'll look at them. We won't win them all. We're not there to win them all. We're there to provide a service to the customer based on risk and we'll look at the risk and bid the work. But I like our chances.\nSean Eastman : Okay. That's helpful. And on the utility LDC business it's just interested to see the utilities talking about replacement of LDC infrastructure playing into those carbon emission-reduction goals. So just given that very broad-based trend from your customer base, I'm wondering if you're seeing acceleration in growth in terms of the pipeline of opportunity on that side of the business.\nDuke Austin: I think it's a broad-based growth. Most of the LDC -- most of our LDC customers have a replacement program due to prone leaks things like that and may be out there or regulatory requirements. So they're 30-year type builds and it's across the eastern seaboard of the West Midwest. Wherever you look there's replacement programs and we're involved in that. It's a really nice business. It has a really nice backdrop. And you can see it it's resilient. And so I think that part of the business continues to grow.  We're performing nicely as we scale it. We like it a lot. We had -- in the second quarter you had this light switch effect in certain cities. But we've worked through those things as we stand today and I think they'll continue to build underneath the -- on that segment you'll continue to see that growth.\nSean Eastman : Got it. Helpful. Nice job again. Thanks for the time.\nDuke Austin: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Steven Fisher of UBS. Please go ahead.\nSteven Fisher: Thanks. Good morning. So Duke, how well would you say the labor market is keeping up with all this utility work? And how much tighter do you think it's going to get over the next couple of years as you and your customers contemplate completing all that renewables work and all the programmatic spending that you're talking about?\nDuke Austin: Yes, Steven. Thank you. I think in general when we looked at it and when we have looked at it, we worked quite a bit with our clients on how do we meet the demands of not only what you see from a capital spend, but attrition within the utility workforce. And the company spent $100 million on training colleges three, four, five years ago to get ready for these type builds and to set the company on a path for a multiyear 10, 20, 30 years beyond. And so in general we're in a really good spot here. We're meeting the demand of our client. From a constructability standpoint, it's one thing to say look, I'm an engineer and I can build this, but I don't have construction. And it's another thing to say I can take it from the start and then finish it with some certainty -- with certainty for that matter. And that's a big deal as we move forward and we have the ability to do that. I think you'll continue to see us take more of the programmatic spend and market share as we move forward.\nSteven Fisher: Okay. And then Derrick, the Q4 guidance was a little lighter than what the consensus had. And it seemed like it was more margin-related than revenues. I know you called out a few things when you gave your prepared remarks. Maybe you could just sort of revisit and summarize there.  I mean, do you have any particular margin headwinds that you're calling out for the quarter other than maybe it seems like there's another $0.05 additional for Latin America exit that you hadn't contemplated before? But what are some of the other kind of things that you're baking in as cautionary items or things in the fourth quarter?\nDerrick Jensen: Yes, Steve. So exactly Latin America is probably the primary component of that equation upping those costs a little bit in the fourth quarter. It's putting that pressure. And then secondly, a little bit of downtick on the margins on pipeline and revenues on pipeline. As my prepared remarks commented, we had some acceleration of the work from the fourth quarter. Expectations originally pulled into the third quarter both on the revenue side and the completion of those projects. So therefore the margin relative to the year it's basically a flat level of contribution has just accelerated in the third.  Then the last piece of it that's still on pipeline is the revenues are down just a little bit. We had some stuff pushed from kind of the fourth quarter into 2021, but nothing overall from a trend perspective changing, nothing from a margin perspective changing our expectations.\nSteven Fisher: Got it. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jamie Cook of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nJamie Cook : Hi. Good morning. Nice quarter. I guess first question, Derrick, is there any way you can help us understand the downstream business Stronghold how that's in more detail performing this year relative to sort of a normalized basis is I guess is my first question. And then I guess my -- and then the -- I guess the follow-up question on that is I mean I think you said by the end of the year with LatAm you expect to be 80% of the projects to be done or something to that effect. What's the risk that that goes into 2021 at all? Because I guess as I look at it today my third question would be understanding you guys are putting out a $4-ish number, but if I do all these add-backs I don't know Derrick I'm getting more to mid-$4s relative to earlier in the year when I was saying sort of low $4s. So, I'm just trying to do the math there but correct me if I'm wrong. Thanks.\nDuke Austin: Hey Jamie, good morning.\nJamie Cook: Good morning.\nDuke Austin: The P&I segment I think when we look at the industrial we had a record first quarter really nice quarter. It tailed off after that due to COVID. We are in critical path and it's -- in my mind, it's mainly the strong whole piece of it. If you don't have the ancillary things around there, it's more of a breakeven type. Maybe make a little money as we move forward right now. And that's the issue that we have kind of guiding that when it becomes more profitable. There are other pieces of that our high-voltage business things like that. So, our total industrial business is a nice business. I'm not going to get into the margin profile of the whole thing but it's nice and that will be additive. So, net between the two it's good. I do -- I hear what you're saying. We need it to increase back to normalized levels. There's opportunities for that to happen. We're unwilling to get in front of that at this point and get formal guidance. But, in general, if you saw the economy pick back up, air travel pick back up, all those kind of things certainly that would increase. I'm on that. I want to talk a little bit about LatAm and I'll let Derrick. LatAm for us it was really about the COVID impact there. It's much greater than it is in the U.S. It really shuts our crews down. The testing that goes on there is much greater than we anticipated so it has affected the work and our ability to close it out faster. We've taken all that into account as we look at this year for the closeouts and anything going forward. Not to say something won't trickle in, but I think we have our hands around the COVID impact that's going on now and our ability to execute through that that we -- I'm not sure that we quite understood the difference between what's going on in LatAm versus what's going on in the States. So, we have that in our head now. And I think we have the right number on guidance. And I'll let Derrick comment on the rest.\nDerrick Jensen: Yes. So, I'll just jump in there on that last part in Latin America and to maybe expand on it. Just to touch that the effects on there were exacerbated. I mean it's more so that when we're having those shutdown dynamics there since we are dealing with a low revenue base at this stage the cost dynamic gets quite accelerated as we try to ramp up those projects and bringing them down. Relative to the 80% reduction what I would tell you is between now and the end of the year we think that we can probably get to a spot where at end of the year we have only a low kind of single-digit type number of projects open four, five, six projects. That's what we think we can get to. So, it still has a dramatic reduction. And there will be a few that have some layover into 2021, but we believe that that's what we're still looking at in the fourth quarter is our ability to bring that down and having so few contracts roll into a 2021 dynamic at this stage. Touching back just to touch on the industrial side. I mean I will say historically that business has been able to operate in a kind of a double-digit margin EBITDA profile double-digit EBITDA and at this stage, that's clearly not where we're at. We're probably much closer to a breakeven-type dynamic. And so as we go forward past 2021 into a 2022-type dynamic where we think that we can see that then we would have every anticipation of being back into a more double-digit EBITDA profile. Last, I think probably just coloring as Duke said multiple times on that $4, we were very comfortable with it being within the range, but there's just a lot of things we still have to digest between now and then as much focused on what's happening that's unique to that industrial market in 2021.\nJamie Cook: Thank you. I thought I'd try.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael Dudas of Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nMichael Dudas: Good morning Duke, Derrick, Kip.\nDuke Austin: Good morning.\nMichael Dudas: Duke you talked about a couple of your acquisitions you highlighted in the quarter. You have this recapitalized very strong balance sheet and cash flow. Do you anticipate given the strong outlook for programmatic and other type spending amongst specialty E&P and the telecom customers that that pace subject to negotiation may accelerate over the next six to 12 months given the long-term opportunities that you're seeing in front of you?\nDuke Austin: Mike, thank you. In general I don't think our strategy has changed at all. I think in general everything is -- we look at our stock first. And well actually we look at our working capital needs then we'll look at everything else that's against our stock and evaluation there. So -- and we don't -- we never have and nor will be out marketing for acquisitions. They come as the nice family business in the Carolina. It's long-standing. When we knew very well right in our space it allowed us to do some really nice things. The other ones are strategies around regionals or building the front side of the business that allows us to capture more construction, or develop more services within the client base that are necessary for us to stay ahead, and to help them with their capital spend to make sure there's certainty in that as well. So we're really working on strategies. If we see something, or we see holes within those strategies, certainly we'll look at those. But in general, I don't think you should expect the company to deviate from what you've seen in the past, with stock buybacks, with the things that we've done with acquisitions. It will level out as we move forward all against like I said the valuation of the stock.\nMichael Dudas : So everything is opportunistic it still appears?\nDuke Austin: We've said we want to stay equity-neutral. And so you would anticipate us doing that year-over-year from a stock buyback standpoint. Derrick can comment more on that. But in general you should expect us to do that, and opportunistic, I would say, yes, that's a good word.\nMichael Dudas: Duke, my second question would be maybe you could share a little bit of some thoughts. There's been some noise coming out of Puerto Rico with the upcoming -- the U.S. election the gubernatorial elections there. Maybe remind us the structure of the contract and any issues that could arise given the results of the election or most of the stuff we're hearing appears to be noise, but I just want to get you to maybe address that a little bit.\nDuke Austin: Yeah. The contract in Puerto Rico is from -- there's one piece of it that we're in a transformation period where we're evaluating the current -- PREPA current and then they'll transform into LUMA mid next year. We're still on pace to do that. We're performing nicely against the contract. I like where we sit. Yes, it's more an election just like here in the States it's noisy. The underlying principles around the contract and the contract we have are very good. We can make a difference on the island. We are. We're building the line school there. We're doing some really nice things that I think will transform the infrastructure on the island, which will allow the economy to do much better. There's a lot of pharmaceuticals. There's a lot of other things on the island that I think it's something that we believe to make a big difference over the time frame of the contract which is 15 years. That being said, there are out clauses that's extremely expensive for them to get out, I would say. It's public. You can look at it. But in general, we don't anticipate that. We anticipate the election is going along, and we'll work with the incumbent governor to do good things there, which we anticipate happening here in the mid next year.\nMichael Dudas: Thanks, Duke.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Chad Dillard of AllianceBernstein. Please go ahead.\nChad Dillard : Hi. Good morning guys.\nDuke Austin: Good morning, Chad.\nChad Dillard: So can you comment on the level of renewable energy-driven transmission activity you're currently seeing maybe compared to like a year -- sounds like how much of your project pipeline does it represent? And is there any difference between a traditional versus a renewable job? Just trying to understand like whether you approach it differently from like execution pricing risk perspective.\nDuke Austin: I mean, primarily we're working for the utility on interconnections whether it be renewables load growth, load from one area to another. We don't define it as primarily renewables. But what I would tell you in general these grids, we're enabling renewables is what we're doing. I mean, in general when you modernize them when we're doing the things we're doing it's all around enabling that. So I don't know I can't put a percentage on how much of that is happening. Most of the larger projects you're seeing in the states are moving renewables. So you're seeing a lot of that. But a lot of -- you're also seeing a lot of grid mod and a lot of hardening. So it's just hard to put a number on it. But in general, I would tell you any of the larger transmissions call it over $100 million is typically moving renewables from -- into load areas from other areas. And if that -- the way the structure of the grid is set up if you saw that compressed such as you see in the Biden Administration on the 2030-type plan, you would see a multitude of large projects come out. It would be necessary to move that load.\nChad Dillard: That's helpful. And then just to what extent have you started to see some of the distribution spending that got delayed in the first wave of the pandemic coming back? Maybe you can kind of compare where you are today versus March like a year ago. And to what extent are you thinking about a potential catch-up spend as we go into 2021? And then just secondly just going back to the Stronghold. Let's just assume activity doesn't come back like you expect in the second half of next year. What levers do you have to pull to bring cost out so you go from breakeven to the higher margins?\nDuke Austin: I think in general when we look at the distribution business both gas and electric you had the light switch effect in the second quarter, which is not there now. But on the electric side, we performed through that. If you look at the business 85%, 90% we'll grow at kind of mid single to double-digits. We'll continue to do that under these scenarios what we see today both distribution and transmission. There's a big spend out there. It's no surprise to anyone. We've talked about it. The backdrop of our customers continues to grow. We're seeing their capital budgets grow. We're right there with them, modernizing these systems, electric vehicles enabling that. It's just starting. So that's a lot at the distribution level. When you start to enable the EV or even your telecom, your 5G deployments that's all around that distribution level spend. And when that starts to move, it really presses on those things. You'll also start to see undergrounding at the distribution level and years to come. So I do think in the outer years, you're going to start to see a big initiative around undergrounding because it's still going to be necessary when you start looking at the events that we're having with ice or fire or hurricanes that also is something that needs to be done over time. So I think you'll see some of that as well.\nCharles Dillard: Got it. And on Stronghold just what leverage do you have to pull to bring cost out?\nDuke Austin: I think we pulled the levers there to rightsize the business for what we see today. We have a great management team there. I think we'll come out stronger. As we look going in and we think of it a little bit worse than 2008 and 2009 and their best years were 2011 \u2013 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 had really nice years on through but in general if we go back to those time frames and look how history repeats itself. Refined products and things of that nature are still here whether you're in a renewable space or not, most of the things, batteries everything that we have today phones they're refined products and that's going to continue over time. The Gulf Coast has a really nice -- it's a really low base from a cost standpoint worldwide. We need the economy to pick back up, but you can only delay that stuff so much in general. And I do think it will pick up over time and catch back up and you'll see some robust years in the outer years.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Noelle Dilts of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nNoelle Dilts: Hi, guys. Thanks for fitting me in, and congratulations on a good quarter. So for my first question I wanted -- I was wondering if you could expand a little bit just on fire hardening. Given the continued fires in California and Colorado, how is that impacting both your near-term expectations relative to what you're expecting early in the year? And then how are you thinking about the longer term opportunity and what this could lead to?\nDuke Austin: I think it's much like we see on the Gulf Coast now with hurricanes. In general, it's necessary to harden those systems. We went through a bankruptcy there with one of the large utilities in California. As that comes out this year and into next, you'll start to see more programmatic spends in a paced way that utilities normally operate. And we're seeing that now. But the issue is you have fires out there now, which delays anything you could do because of what you're in fire season. And so you're at the mercy of that. But in general so you're doing some emergency work and things like that but over time we'll continue to see the utilities in the west harden the system for fires over time. And it's a long multiyear process that all of them are going through and we're all working through that together in a collaborative manner. It's a big state for us. The west is big for us and we'll continue to build resources out there for what's necessary to harden those systems for fire.\nNoelle Dilts: Okay, great. Thank you. And then second I just had a couple of project specific questions. So first given TC Energy's announcement on the Keystone XL contractors, I'm just kind of curious how you're thinking about that project from -- in terms of just both going into backlog and just the probability of the project moving forward given that they're still in limbo with the NWP 12 issue and the upcoming elections? And then secondly on the New England Clean Power project. I know that's a very big project. Just curious again that's been a tough geography for permits. So maybe you could give us a sense of how comfortable you are that that job kind of moves forward on time.\nDerrick Jensen: Yeah. We're comfortable with the Queensland project up there in May. I think it moves on time. We've been with that project for a while. We think the permits are in pretty good shape and it will get moving here in next year sometime. But -- so that one\u2019s that. And if not then there's a multitude more projects and I'm not concerned with that. The $4 that we contemplate, we think about all these kind of things. And in general when we look at big pipe, we have a customer base out there that we support. We'll continue to do so. We like the projects as they come. We talked about the business being around $500 million. We've transitioned the P&I segment away from big pipe as you know. I've stated it many times and I think we'll -- it can grow off the $500 million. It can be greater. But in general when we're talking about guidance and how to look at next year, you should think about the $500 million. If we start stocking projects, if things go our way, if things go good, we'll talk to you about it. And certainly that would be upside. But in general, we should look at $500 million in that piece of business. Yes we can expand it, but we're not going to take the risk. We're going to make sure it's risk -- the risk is conducive with the margins. And that's one of the things the company has been disciplined on and we'll stay that way.\nNoelle Dilts: Okay, great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Alex Rygiel of B. Riley. Please go ahead.\nAlex Rygiel: Thank you. Nice quarter, gentlemen.\nDuke Austin: Hey, Alex.\nAlex Rygiel: Other than Puerto Rico and Canada, and your businesses in Latin America, do you have any interest in any other international markets at this time? Mexico comes to mind, because it's been talked about for years.\nDuke Austin: Alex, so we have the Australian business. I think in general you've seen us exit Lat Am and it would have to be following a customer in there, a U.S. customer. But I don't see that as being somewhat a priority for us. We can grow North America nicely. And I think for us right now with the builds that we see, with the ability to grow on our base business and things of that nature we'll stay within the states and within the areas that we're in call it North America, Puerto Rico as an island and Australia.\nAlex Rygiel: And then a number of years ago maybe it was six or eight years ago there was definitely a step-up in increased regulation that complicated some of your projects slowed your projects impacts profitability of your projects. How has that changed under the Trump administration? And if Biden should win, do you have any concerns that the regulatory environment becomes increasingly more challenging?\nDuke Austin: What I would say is that, I think under the administration, they want to create jobs and we've seen that. But in general, I don't think from our standpoint, when we look at it, when we look at what the Biden administration energy plan from a clean energy plan, all that bodes well for us. We didn't really have issues on the base load work that we're doing today. I think the sentiment around carbon-free and how we enabled that whether it be from a distribution level or a transmission level the jobs that we're trying to put forth in the capital spends that we see we don't believe that under either administration the regulatory impact would be something that would give us problems actually probably benefits us in my mind. On the pipe \u2013 the big pipe side, we transitioned the company away from it years ago five years ago. So when we talk about the $500 million, and those projects are where you see the most \u2013 where the issues are really to be honest. And so that's where they were and that's where it's tough even \u2013 under any administration. So that's the issue there Alex. But the company is enabling a lot of things. Technology is well on 5G deployment and things of that nature. So I think everyone sees \u2013 you can see our conference call today. The need for bandwidth, the need for technology, the need for the things that we do from an infrastructure standpoint will continue for some time. We're optimistic and feel real good about where we sit.\nAlex Rygiel: Helpful. Thank you.\nDuke Austin: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, this brings us to the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing comments.\nDuke Austin: Yeah. First, I would like to say thanks to people in the field that are working today restoring power. It's been a long run there, and a lot of people without electricity. So we're working diligently and safely as an industry to pick those things up. And it's no easy task under a pandemic. So real proud of the industry, as well as our people. And thank you all for participating in the third quarter conference call. We appreciate your questions and your ongoing interest in Quanta Services. This concludes our call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Duke Austin",
            "content": "Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. On the call today, I will provide operational and strategic commentary and we'll then turn it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a review of our third quarter results and full year 2020 financial expectations. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions. This morning, we reported strong third quarter results, including profitability that meaningfully exceeded our expectations. The performance of our field leadership and the people of this organization continue to be nothing short of impressive. They have successfully adapted to working through a pandemic, while continuing to restore critical infrastructure in extreme conditions. The strength of our performance was reflected in our Electric Power segment margins, including our communications operations and our Pipeline and Industrial segment margins. It is also reflected in our record earnings per share and backlog, which continues to demonstrate the resiliency of our business and the operational excellence of our people during extraordinary economic and operating conditions. In addition, we strengthened our financial position with the closing of our $1 billion senior notes offering, expansion of the capacity and extension of the term of our credit facility and our receipt of an investment-grade credit rating, all of which, we believe, points to the resiliency and sustainability of our business model and positive multiyear outlook. Derrick and our finance and treasury team did an outstanding job, managing the simultaneous and successful financing processes and we're able to secure capital at attractive rates and terms. And finally, an important part of our value proposition to all our stakeholders is Quanta's commitment to corporate responsibility and sustainability. To that end, during the third quarter we published our first corporate responsibility report, which focuses on our commitment to people, planet and principles. Quanta has a great ESG story to tell and we are pleased with the progress we are making to provide increased transparency into our corporate responsibility and sustainability initiatives. Turning to our operating results. Our Electric Power operations produced record quarterly revenue and solid operating margins, driven by strong demand for our services, effective cost management, high utilizations, operational excellence and record levels of emergency response activity. Utilities continue to actively deploy capital into their systems to modernize, harden and expand them and to integrate renewable generation to transition towards a carbon-neutral or carbon-free environment. To that end, we are actively performing infrastructure work, including substations and transmission interconnects for onshore wind and solar projects and are seeing additional opportunities associated with offshore wind, battery projects and hydroelectric development. Large-scale deployment of renewable generation will require both upgrades to and expansion of the transmission backbone and we are well-positioned to perform these services. During the quarter, Quanta deployed significant resources to provide emergency response services to utilities in support of their efforts to restore power to millions of people that were impacted by severe weather events. These events included Hurricanes Isaias, Laura, Sally and Delta as well as a derecho storm in the Midwest. Quanta crews have worked more than 90 consecutive days restoring power and rebuilding damaged infrastructure in response to these events. With crew still out today in response to Hurricane Delta and now Hurricane Zeta, in the aggregate, we have deployed approximately 7,000 line workers and support staff from 20 different operating units in response to these severe weather events. Our ability to quickly mobilize this level of resources to support our customers in times of need is unmatched in our industry. These severe weather events and the devastating wildfires in the western region of the United States are examples of why many utilities are implementing system-hardening initiatives to make the power grid more resilient and safer. We believe there are many years of storm-hardening investments still to come and that we are in very early stages of fire hardening activity. These necessary investments in multi-year programs will cost tens of billions of dollars in the aggregate and Quanta is actively involved in supporting our customers with these initiatives. To that end, in the third quarter, we acquired a family-run utility contractor based in North Carolina that provides electric power distribution, transmission and substation maintenance and construction services primarily in the Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. This company increases our resources in the region and enhances our ability to serve our customers with our grid modernization, hardening and renewable programs. Since announcing in June that LUMA Energy was selected to operate, maintain and modernize the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority or PREPA's electric transmission and distribution system in Puerto Rico. LUMA has made good progress towards satisfying the necessary steps to facilitate the full transition of PREPA's T&D operations to LUMA in mid-2021. Additionally, we have begun site preparation for a new line worker training campus in Puerto Rico that will be operated by Northwest Line College. The LUMA College for Technical Training will use the facility to provide world-class training to its employees and to develop Puerto Rico's future craft-skilled workforce. The first on-island pre-apprentice class is scheduled to begin in the spring of 2021 and currently includes 32 Puerto Rican students. Quanta and ATCO also selected and sponsored several Puerto Rican students who are now in the pre-apprentice program at our Northwest Line College campus in Edgewater, Florida. Further, in September, the Trump administration announced that $12.8 billion had been allocated to the Puerto Rico -- to Puerto Rico primarily to rebuild the electric power grid through Federal Emergency Management Agency or FEMA. Post commencement, LUMA will work with PREPA, FEMA and other agencies to manage the deployment of these funds to modernize the Puerto Rico power grid over the coming years. Our communications infrastructure services operation, which are included in the Electric Power segment performed extremely well in the third quarter, with strong double-digit revenue growth and double-digit operating income margin. We continue to make progress and profitability scaling our operations. We believe our operations have the opportunity to achieve more than $500 million in revenue in 2020 reflecting double-digit revenue growth and upper single-digit operating margin. Total backlog at the end of the quarter for our communications operations was approximately $975 million a record. Additionally, in our press release this morning, we highlighted our recent acquisition of a Utah-based company that primarily serves the Mountain West region of the United States and specializes in the deployment of short and long-haul fiber optic cable and utilities, and the engineering and design of small and large-scale projects. This company enhances our capabilities in the region, and we expect to expand and grow their presence into new areas over time. The effects of COVID-19 continue to cause communication providers to increase investment in their fiber networks, to ensure adequate speed and capacity to meet work education and entertainment from home demands. We believe this incremental investment in their fiber network has shifted 5G deployment activity level somewhat. However, we expect 5G deployments to accelerate in 2021. COVID-19 has also highlighted the importance of broadband connectivity and digital divide that exists for millions of people living in rural America without access to adequate broadband connectivity. To bridge the gap, the Federal Communications Commission has established a rural digital opportunity fund to provide more than $20 billion in federal funds to bring high-speed fixed broadband service to underserved rural homes and small businesses. There are several hundred service providers that have qualified to pursue the funding, many of whom are rural electric cooperatives and municipal entities. Quanta has strong relationships with many of these rural electric providers and is well-positioned to provide turnkey solutions to help them deploy broadband services to their customers in rural markets. Turning to our Pipeline and Industrial segment. Our gas utility operations performed well during the quarter and are gradually returning to pre-COVID levels, executing on multi-decade modernization programs to replace aging gas distribution infrastructure in order to meet regulatory requirements that are aimed at improving reliability and safety. Demand for our pipeline integrity services is also solid as regulatory requirements for investment and the permitting challenges for new pipelines make existing pipeline infrastructure more valuable, increasing pipeline owners' desire to extend the useful life of existing pipeline assets through integrity initiatives. Perhaps the most challenging end market in this segment is the industrial services, which has been heavily impacted by reduced demand for refined products. Our industrial services operations are performing well in the current environment and are expected to be profitable for the year, but we currently do not anticipate a return to normalcy until the second half of 2021. However, we have a world-class management team leading our operations who have managed costs well and are using the current environment as an opportunity to strengthen our competitive positioning and emerge stronger as conditions improve. Although larger pipeline projects are a smaller portion of the segment, solid execution during the quarter led to early completion of some projects, which positively contributed to segment results. Going forward, we expect to continue our focus on growing the base gas utility pipeline integrity and industrial services business consistent with our strategy over the last five years. We believe there is opportunity for revenue and profitability improvement next year for the entire segment and continue to believe a post-COVID operating environment will allow us to achieve upper single-digit operating margins and improved returns. We have increased our financial expectations for the year due to our strong third quarter results, healthy end market drivers and the addition of recently announced acquisitions. Perhaps more importantly, we continue to believe we're in a multiyear upcycle with opportunity for continued profitable growth. While we provide our formal commentary and 2021 expectations on the fourth quarter earnings call next February, we currently expect growth in consolidated revenues, net income, adjusted EBITDA and earnings per share in 2021. And as we have commented on prior earnings calls, we would expect our adjusted EPS expectations to include $4 in its range. Over the past five years we have executed on our strategy and remain dedicated to growing and enhancing our portfolio of services, which strengthens our ability to capture more of the customers' large programmatic spending programs and to operate in a responsible and sustainable way. These efforts are designed to mitigate risk inherent in our business and prepare for unexpected events through diversification and by maintaining a strong financial profile. We believe Quanta has a long runway ahead of us for generating repeatable and sustainable earnings as we execute on our strategic initiatives. Considering our organic growth opportunities and the levers available to us to allocate future cash flow generation into value-creating opportunities such as stock repurchases, acquisitions and strategic investments and dividends, we believe Quanta can continue to generate meaningful stockholder value. We are focused on operating the business for the long-term and expect to continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class build leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's base business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's diversity unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset form the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for all our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO for his review of the third quarter results and 2020 expectations. Derrick? Yes. Thanks Andy for the comments. When we look at renewables in the spaces that we play mainly around the interconnections, I think, when we think about it the sentiment around a carbon-free environment -- getting to a carbon-free environment, while we may think it takes longer than what's being said there's no question around the need for transmission, the interconnections, the redundancy in the grid to support the intermittency of any renewables with -- either with batteries or however you do it. But all those things for us -- we're working with our customers on those on a daily basis whether it be offshore wind and over on the eastern seaboard or just in general across the board. It's still ongoing. The pace is about the same in my mind, maybe a little bit expedited in certain areas. But in general, that pace continues. And any compression of time on that the need for transmission, interconnections, redundancy is only greater. So if you moved it from 2050 to 2030, you said you wanted to go more carbon-free, it would take longer. That being said, the way that the transmission system works today there's a lot of work to be done to make that more redundant as well as more modern as we move into more of a renewable footprint. Yes. Thanks for the comments. I think in general, we've talked about the programmatic spends of our customers the capital spends that we see. The increasing backlog -- I failed to get to that answer a minute ago, but in general we see -- continue to see record backlog. The opportunity for additional programmatic spends are there. So that piece of business continues to grow underneath and we talk about 85% to 90% of the business being that base business that backs that up. It gives us a great deal of confidence of the resiliency of the model when we set out four or five years ago. Now we've set out to build this model to be resilient and to be able to give you guidance and be able to not be so choppy. So when we talk about $4, it's based on that kind of capital spend within our utility customer -- our customer base and that's why you're seeing our backlog increased. There's opportunities for these larger project dynamics. They're there. We booked some in the quarter. You saw that with the clean line in there in Maine. So in general, you're seeing us book-stacking. We talked about the stacking effect on the base, but the base continues to grow. We talked mid single to \u2013 mid single-digits. We've been growing past that. But that's there. The storms it was $200 million somewhere in there. It's less than 10% of the overall segment right in there on the top side. It's typically not meaningful, but it was meaningful in the quarter. That being said, there was still broad-based execution above what we would consider normal margins for us due to utilization. We're doing a nice job with cost in the field and execution in the field. So real proud of the organization on how we've adapted to the pandemic. Thank you. Yes. I mean, I think you see the backlog increasing. And as we move into next year and later into this year, we had a record quarter for us this quarter. And I think we saw the margins at parity fairly close to the electric margins. And so, we're seeing double-digit margin profiles. We're doing the things that we said we would do from a scale standpoint in the field and our ability to execute. We needed to build the front side. We made an acquisition in the last quarter there on the front side of the business to help us gain traction there on the EPC side and also collaborate with the customer. That will benefit us as we move forward. We've talked about it being a $1 billion business. There's every opportunity for that to happen. The pace of growth will remain around the margin profile going forward. We want to continue the double-digit margin profile. And that's the -- that will pace our growth. But I'm optimistic that we'll continue to see these type of growth rates on a go-forward basis. Yes. So the P&I segment. When we look at the industrial side of the business, I think that's the biggest unknown for us is just when does the economy come back? We've talked about it and communicated it. We felt like it would be later in the third quarter or later half of next year when we talk about P&I. We're doing okay. We're not where we want to be there in order to get the margins where we want them to be. So I think in general that would be the P&I segment. If economy comes back it's kind of like an '08 '09 effect for that type of business a little bit greater. But in general, we have some critical path solutions there that are necessary. It allows us to do things that others can't. And I think in general the business is good. But for us to get to those -- the margins that we've stated that we want to be our goal we need that business to pick up in the later half of next year. We've contemplated all that in the $4 number that we've talked about. On the larger diameter pipe, we talked about a $500 million number in guidance next year. That's kind of how you should think about the business, when we think about it same thing whether you hear announcements or not as we stand that's what we see. It certainly has the ability to expand and we have the opportunity to expand it within Canada and other places. We'll look at it from a risk standpoint. And if we book-work we'll let you know. But in general in our mind the $4 number and everything we're talking about contemplates that business being around $500 million not to say, there's not smaller projects not to say there's not opportunity because there is. And we did execute well through the quarter. We went through and had some milestones and contingency releases on different things. It's due to execution. That's correct. We're doing a nice job executing on the Electric Power segment both from -- our telecom is starting to be additive to the segment as well. And we have broad base. Just -- it's a strategy we had five years ago. We said we'd build a base business. We've scaled the operations in the field and really worked with the customer to collaborate in order to build on these programmatic spends that we've been talking about for a long period of time in order to modernize the system harden the systems for the events that you're seeing now. You see it in California at the West on the wildfires you see it with the hurricanes derechos whatever it may be. These events happen. I think in general we've got our heads around hardening the systems and modernizing them. So you're seeing all that, you're seeing our capital, but we're supporting our customer at a very high level, taking more of the programmatic spends and it's showing up in the electric segment as we move forward. I think we have every opportunity to continue this.  We talked about a kind of a double-digit margin there over time. We were working through it last year with California. You had some movement there with crews moving back and forth and it dragged margins down. Once we said, it would get stabilized and once it's stabilized you would see improvements. And I think we get set, we get things scaled and we can do our margins to improve.  So we get better utilizations, better execution and that's what you're seeing today. Can we stack more larger projects on there? Sure. As they come we'll look at them. We won't win them all. We're not there to win them all. We're there to provide a service to the customer based on risk and we'll look at the risk and bid the work. But I like our chances. I think it's a broad-based growth. Most of the LDC -- most of our LDC customers have a replacement program due to prone leaks things like that and may be out there or regulatory requirements. So they're 30-year type builds and it's across the eastern seaboard of the West Midwest. Wherever you look there's replacement programs and we're involved in that. It's a really nice business. It has a really nice backdrop. And you can see it it's resilient. And so I think that part of the business continues to grow.  We're performing nicely as we scale it. We like it a lot. We had -- in the second quarter you had this light switch effect in certain cities. But we've worked through those things as we stand today and I think they'll continue to build underneath the -- on that segment you'll continue to see that growth. Thank you. Yes, Steven. Thank you. I think in general when we looked at it and when we have looked at it, we worked quite a bit with our clients on how do we meet the demands of not only what you see from a capital spend, but attrition within the utility workforce. And the company spent $100 million on training colleges three, four, five years ago to get ready for these type builds and to set the company on a path for a multiyear 10, 20, 30 years beyond. And so in general we're in a really good spot here. We're meeting the demand of our client. From a constructability standpoint, it's one thing to say look, I'm an engineer and I can build this, but I don't have construction. And it's another thing to say I can take it from the start and then finish it with some certainty -- with certainty for that matter. And that's a big deal as we move forward and we have the ability to do that. I think you'll continue to see us take more of the programmatic spend and market share as we move forward. Hey Jamie, good morning. The P&I segment I think when we look at the industrial we had a record first quarter really nice quarter. It tailed off after that due to COVID. We are in critical path and it's -- in my mind, it's mainly the strong whole piece of it. If you don't have the ancillary things around there, it's more of a breakeven type. Maybe make a little money as we move forward right now. And that's the issue that we have kind of guiding that when it becomes more profitable. There are other pieces of that our high-voltage business things like that. So, our total industrial business is a nice business. I'm not going to get into the margin profile of the whole thing but it's nice and that will be additive. So, net between the two it's good. I do -- I hear what you're saying. We need it to increase back to normalized levels. There's opportunities for that to happen. We're unwilling to get in front of that at this point and get formal guidance. But, in general, if you saw the economy pick back up, air travel pick back up, all those kind of things certainly that would increase. I'm on that. I want to talk a little bit about LatAm and I'll let Derrick. LatAm for us it was really about the COVID impact there. It's much greater than it is in the U.S. It really shuts our crews down. The testing that goes on there is much greater than we anticipated so it has affected the work and our ability to close it out faster. We've taken all that into account as we look at this year for the closeouts and anything going forward. Not to say something won't trickle in, but I think we have our hands around the COVID impact that's going on now and our ability to execute through that that we -- I'm not sure that we quite understood the difference between what's going on in LatAm versus what's going on in the States. So, we have that in our head now. And I think we have the right number on guidance. And I'll let Derrick comment on the rest. Good morning. Mike, thank you. In general I don't think our strategy has changed at all. I think in general everything is -- we look at our stock first. And well actually we look at our working capital needs then we'll look at everything else that's against our stock and evaluation there. So -- and we don't -- we never have and nor will be out marketing for acquisitions. They come as the nice family business in the Carolina. It's long-standing. When we knew very well right in our space it allowed us to do some really nice things. The other ones are strategies around regionals or building the front side of the business that allows us to capture more construction, or develop more services within the client base that are necessary for us to stay ahead, and to help them with their capital spend to make sure there's certainty in that as well. So we're really working on strategies. If we see something, or we see holes within those strategies, certainly we'll look at those. But in general, I don't think you should expect the company to deviate from what you've seen in the past, with stock buybacks, with the things that we've done with acquisitions. It will level out as we move forward all against like I said the valuation of the stock. We've said we want to stay equity-neutral. And so you would anticipate us doing that year-over-year from a stock buyback standpoint. Derrick can comment more on that. But in general you should expect us to do that, and opportunistic, I would say, yes, that's a good word. Yeah. The contract in Puerto Rico is from -- there's one piece of it that we're in a transformation period where we're evaluating the current -- PREPA current and then they'll transform into LUMA mid next year. We're still on pace to do that. We're performing nicely against the contract. I like where we sit. Yes, it's more an election just like here in the States it's noisy. The underlying principles around the contract and the contract we have are very good. We can make a difference on the island. We are. We're building the line school there. We're doing some really nice things that I think will transform the infrastructure on the island, which will allow the economy to do much better. There's a lot of pharmaceuticals. There's a lot of other things on the island that I think it's something that we believe to make a big difference over the time frame of the contract which is 15 years. That being said, there are out clauses that's extremely expensive for them to get out, I would say. It's public. You can look at it. But in general, we don't anticipate that. We anticipate the election is going along, and we'll work with the incumbent governor to do good things there, which we anticipate happening here in the mid next year. Good morning, Chad. I mean, primarily we're working for the utility on interconnections whether it be renewables load growth, load from one area to another. We don't define it as primarily renewables. But what I would tell you in general these grids, we're enabling renewables is what we're doing. I mean, in general when you modernize them when we're doing the things we're doing it's all around enabling that. So I don't know I can't put a percentage on how much of that is happening. Most of the larger projects you're seeing in the states are moving renewables. So you're seeing a lot of that. But a lot of -- you're also seeing a lot of grid mod and a lot of hardening. So it's just hard to put a number on it. But in general, I would tell you any of the larger transmissions call it over $100 million is typically moving renewables from -- into load areas from other areas. And if that -- the way the structure of the grid is set up if you saw that compressed such as you see in the Biden Administration on the 2030-type plan, you would see a multitude of large projects come out. It would be necessary to move that load. I think in general when we look at the distribution business both gas and electric you had the light switch effect in the second quarter, which is not there now. But on the electric side, we performed through that. If you look at the business 85%, 90% we'll grow at kind of mid single to double-digits. We'll continue to do that under these scenarios what we see today both distribution and transmission. There's a big spend out there. It's no surprise to anyone. We've talked about it. The backdrop of our customers continues to grow. We're seeing their capital budgets grow. We're right there with them, modernizing these systems, electric vehicles enabling that. It's just starting. So that's a lot at the distribution level. When you start to enable the EV or even your telecom, your 5G deployments that's all around that distribution level spend. And when that starts to move, it really presses on those things. You'll also start to see undergrounding at the distribution level and years to come. So I do think in the outer years, you're going to start to see a big initiative around undergrounding because it's still going to be necessary when you start looking at the events that we're having with ice or fire or hurricanes that also is something that needs to be done over time. So I think you'll see some of that as well. I think we pulled the levers there to rightsize the business for what we see today. We have a great management team there. I think we'll come out stronger. As we look going in and we think of it a little bit worse than 2008 and 2009 and their best years were 2011 \u2013 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 had really nice years on through but in general if we go back to those time frames and look how history repeats itself. Refined products and things of that nature are still here whether you're in a renewable space or not, most of the things, batteries everything that we have today phones they're refined products and that's going to continue over time. The Gulf Coast has a really nice -- it's a really low base from a cost standpoint worldwide. We need the economy to pick back up, but you can only delay that stuff so much in general. And I do think it will pick up over time and catch back up and you'll see some robust years in the outer years. I think it's much like we see on the Gulf Coast now with hurricanes. In general, it's necessary to harden those systems. We went through a bankruptcy there with one of the large utilities in California. As that comes out this year and into next, you'll start to see more programmatic spends in a paced way that utilities normally operate. And we're seeing that now. But the issue is you have fires out there now, which delays anything you could do because of what you're in fire season. And so you're at the mercy of that. But in general so you're doing some emergency work and things like that but over time we'll continue to see the utilities in the west harden the system for fires over time. And it's a long multiyear process that all of them are going through and we're all working through that together in a collaborative manner. It's a big state for us. The west is big for us and we'll continue to build resources out there for what's necessary to harden those systems for fire. Hey, Alex. Alex, so we have the Australian business. I think in general you've seen us exit Lat Am and it would have to be following a customer in there, a U.S. customer. But I don't see that as being somewhat a priority for us. We can grow North America nicely. And I think for us right now with the builds that we see, with the ability to grow on our base business and things of that nature we'll stay within the states and within the areas that we're in call it North America, Puerto Rico as an island and Australia. What I would say is that, I think under the administration, they want to create jobs and we've seen that. But in general, I don't think from our standpoint, when we look at it, when we look at what the Biden administration energy plan from a clean energy plan, all that bodes well for us. We didn't really have issues on the base load work that we're doing today. I think the sentiment around carbon-free and how we enabled that whether it be from a distribution level or a transmission level the jobs that we're trying to put forth in the capital spends that we see we don't believe that under either administration the regulatory impact would be something that would give us problems actually probably benefits us in my mind. On the pipe \u2013 the big pipe side, we transitioned the company away from it years ago five years ago. So when we talk about the $500 million, and those projects are where you see the most \u2013 where the issues are really to be honest. And so that's where they were and that's where it's tough even \u2013 under any administration. So that's the issue there Alex. But the company is enabling a lot of things. Technology is well on 5G deployment and things of that nature. So I think everyone sees \u2013 you can see our conference call today. The need for bandwidth, the need for technology, the need for the things that we do from an infrastructure standpoint will continue for some time. We're optimistic and feel real good about where we sit. Thank you. Yeah. First, I would like to say thanks to people in the field that are working today restoring power. It's been a long run there, and a lot of people without electricity. So we're working diligently and safely as an industry to pick those things up. And it's no easy task under a pandemic. So real proud of the industry, as well as our people. And thank you all for participating in the third quarter conference call. We appreciate your questions and your ongoing interest in Quanta Services. This concludes our call."

Net income attributable to common stock was $163 million or $1.13 per diluted share and adjusted diluted earnings per share a non-GAAP measure was $1.40. The third quarter was strong for Quanta with numerous consolidated and segment records and performance during the quarter aggregating to record EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Our Electric Power revenues excluding Latin America were $2.1 billion, a 14% increase when compared to the third quarter of 2019. This increase was primarily driven by increased contributions from larger projects, as well as continued growth from our communications operations, which are included within the Electric Power segment and delivered a 40% increase compared to the third quarter of 2019. Also contributing to the increase were approximately $65 million in revenues from acquired businesses. Additionally, we had a record amount of emergency restoration services in the quarter, primarily associated with efforts to restore infrastructure along the Gulf Coast. Our results included approximately $200 million of revenues from those efforts. However, those revenues came at the expense of other work in progress. Our distribution work decreased over 20% compared to 3Q 2019 and largely offset the increase in storm revenues driven in part by utilization of crews from existing work being reallocated to emergency restoration efforts but also due to lower levels of fire hardening work compared to 2019. Electric segment margins in 3Q 2020 were 12.7% and excluding our Latin American operations segment margins were a record 13.5% versus 9.6% in 3Q 2019. The robust operating margins were driven by increased profit contributions from emergency restoration efforts, which typically present opportunities for higher margins than our normal base business activities due to higher utilization. However, excluding revenues and profit from storm response efforts, our margins still were comfortably in double-digit reflecting continued strong execution across our operations. Of note, our communications margins continue to improve both against last year and sequentially and exceeded 10% during the quarter. Regarding our Latin American operations included within the Electric Power segment, we continue to expedite the wind-down activities required to exit those markets. The continued COVID-19 dynamics coupled with customer challenges and local labor issues have significantly impacted our efforts and have resulted in losses in excess of our expectations. While work remains to fully shut down our operations, it's important to note that more than 80% of the active jobs at the beginning of 2020 have been completed with fewer than 50 open jobs remaining at the end of the quarter. We remain confident that will be largely complete with our exit by year-end. Of note, we currently received no tax benefit for losses in Latin America so the $15 million in losses impacted the quarter by approximately $0.11, $0.05 more than we anticipated. The Pipeline and Industrial segment continues to be negatively impacted by COVID-19 and the associated reduction in demand for refined products. Revenues for the segment were $913 million, 38% lower than 3Q 2019 due to reduced revenues from our industrial operations and a reduction in contributions from larger pipeline projects. Partially offsetting these declines were increased levels of gas distribution revenues including approximately $70 million from acquired companies. Despite the COVID-related headwinds, the segment delivered margins of 8.4%. These margins were 60 basis points lower than 3Q 2019, primarily due to the reduced revenues from larger pipeline projects and our industrial operations, but a solid performance given the continued challenges across the segment. Operating margins benefited from net favorable adjustments on certain larger pipeline projects associated with the recognition of previously deferred milestone payments and reduced contingencies due to a reduction in the scope of work to be completed on a project as well as certain projects completing earlier than anticipated with work accelerating into the third quarter. In addition, we had continued strong execution across much of our base business activity including gas distribution and integrity work. Our total backlog was $15.1 billion at the end of the third quarter, approximately $1.8 billion or 13% higher than 3Q 2019 and a $1.1 billion increase from the second quarter of 2020. 12-month backlog of $8.1 billion is an increase from both the third quarter of 2019 and the second quarter of 2020. The increase in total backlog is largely due to several new multiyear MSA arrangements from both electric and gas utility customers, again validating the continued favorable dynamics across our core utility market and our base business activities as well as approximately $290 million in total backlog associated with acquired companies. For the third quarter of 2020 we generated free cash flow a non-GAAP measure of $70 million, $40 million higher than 3Q 2019. Free cash flow was higher than we anticipated driven by stronger profits in the quarter and a cash cycle consistent with our second quarter results. As we mentioned in last quarter's call, we are prudently forecasting our DSO to increase due to uncertainty around COVID-19's potential impact on our customers. Ultimately, we did not experience any meaningful delays which positively contributed to the increased cash flow relative to our expectations. Days sales outstanding or DSO measured 82 days for the third quarter comparable to the second quarter, but a decrease of nine days compared to the third quarter of 2019 as 3Q 2019 was negatively impacted by higher retainage balances due to project timing and billing process changes for certain customers. Cash flows in the third quarter also benefited from the deferral of $41 million of payroll tax payments permitted by the CARES Act with the payments due in equal amount at the end of 2021 and 2022. We had approximately $220 million of cash at the end of the quarter. As of September 30, 2020 we had total liquidity of approximately $2.2 billion and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio as calculated under our credit agreement of approximately 1.3 times. As Duke mentioned, on September 22 we closed the sale of $1 billion aggregate principal amount of our 2.9% senior notes due 2030. We received net proceeds from the offering of $986.7 million, which together with cash on hand were used to repay the term loans outstanding under our credit agreement in the aggregate principal amount of $1.21 billion. Both Moody's and S&P independently assess our business and highlighting our highly trained workforce, favorable end market dynamics, consistent free cash flow and solid liquidity profile concluded that we are in investment-grade credit. I believe these ratings validate how we've strategically positioned the business around repeatable, sustainable revenue streams, anchored by construction-led solutions and our world-class craft-skilled workforce. We continue to emphasize the recurring nature of the services we provide to critical infrastructure owners and this rating reinforces that message. Also on September 22, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement that among other things, increased the aggregate revolving commitments from $2.14 billion to $2.51 billion and extended the maturity date from October 2022 to September 2025. It's important to note that successfully executing this expansion and extension of our credit facility during these uncertain times is another testament to the sustainability and positive long-term outlook of our business. Both the successful bond offering and amended credit facility were strategically important for our organization. The $1 billion bond offering established a fixed level of debt that nicely complements our current EBITDA profile, which we believe is a repeatable sustainable baseline of earnings. Simultaneously, we secured an expanded credit facility further enhancing our ability to meet incremental capital needs. While our previous capital structure provided adequate liquidity, the refinancing allowed us to diversify our capital sources, lock in a historically low cost of capital while staggering our maturities, giving us more flexibility and capital to support our growth expectations. Turning to our guidance. We continue to deal with some level of uncertainty as we assess the near-term prospects of our operations, particularly those that are susceptible to local stay-at-home orders, operate in close facilities or depend upon project teams having access to local permitting offices. As COVID-19 case counts continue to rise in many parts of the U.S., we've remained prudent with our expectations for the fourth quarter. We now expect full year revenues for the electric power segment to be between $7.7 billion and $7.8 billion. We are increasing full year operating margin expectations to around 10.2%, with Latin America contributing operating losses of $55 million to $60 million. Excluding Latin American losses, margins are now expected to be around 11%, which reflects continued successful project execution plus the incremental impact of the LUMA joint venture and other earnings from integral and consolidated affiliates. As a reminder, the LUMA joint venture is accounted for as an equity method investment and therefore will not contribute to revenues. However, we are including our equity and earnings of LUMA within operating income, since LUMA is operationally integral to our operations under accounting guidance. These results are presented after tax and are anticipated to positively contribute to operating income in 2020 by approximately $11 million or $0.07 to $0.08 per share. The P&I segment continues to be impacted by COVID-19 and the challenged energy market conditions and accordingly we are reducing our full year revenue expectations to range between $3.4 billion and $3.5 billion. The reduction is primarily attributable to reduced spend expectations for certain smaller capital projects as well as the delay of certain work into 2021. Full year operating margin for the P&I segment remains around 5%. With regard to the cancellation of the ACP pipeline project discussed last quarter, we continue to work with the customers to determine how the project will close out and expect termination by the end of the year. We believe potential upside associated with termination fees and other contract accounting exists. However the final contract closeout will not be determined until any closeout scopes of work and related termination items are determined by ACP and then agreed and allocated by the joint venture to Quanta. As noted in our earnings release this morning, we have increased our full year earnings per share expectations and now expect GAAP diluted earnings per share of between $2.61 and $2.72 and adjusted diluted earnings per share a non-GAAP measure of between $3.52 and $3.64. These earnings per share expectations include a loss per share of between $0.38 and $0.41 from our Latin American operations. Turning to cash flow. We are maintaining our free cash flow guidance for the year, expecting it to range between $600 million and $800 million. Third quarter cash flows were stronger than expected but we now expect a more modest fourth quarter than we originally forecasted. For the year, we expect working capital of approximately 13% of annual revenues consistent with our historical experience. That expectation assumes an increased DSO for the fourth quarter in part due to elevated amounts of emergency restoration receivables generated in the third quarter which oftentimes can have longer collection cycles. Additionally, while we have yet to experience meaningful payment delays related to COVID-19 through the first three quarters of the year, we remain cautious and accordingly are factoring in some pressure negatively impacting DSO in the fourth quarter. Overall, we are pleased with how we've continued to execute through these times of uncertainty and remain confident in the long-term prospects of our business. Our full year expectations include adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1 billion at the midpoint, which we believe is a baseline that is set to expand in 2021 and beyond, driven by the recurring sustainable demand for our base business services complemented by our large-project expertise. We fortified our balance sheet with the bond offering and amended credit facility, increasing our liquidity and enhancing our ability to pursue opportunistic deployments of capital for M&A and investments as well as returns of capital providing us with the foundation to continue delivering shareholder value. This concludes our formal presentation and we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator? Yes, Steve. So exactly Latin America is probably the primary component of that equation upping those costs a little bit in the fourth quarter. It's putting that pressure. And then secondly, a little bit of downtick on the margins on pipeline and revenues on pipeline. As my prepared remarks commented, we had some acceleration of the work from the fourth quarter. Expectations originally pulled into the third quarter both on the revenue side and the completion of those projects. So therefore the margin relative to the year it's basically a flat level of contribution has just accelerated in the third.  Then the last piece of it that's still on pipeline is the revenues are down just a little bit. We had some stuff pushed from kind of the fourth quarter into 2021, but nothing overall from a trend perspective changing, nothing from a margin perspective changing our expectations. Yes. So, I'll just jump in there on that last part in Latin America and to maybe expand on it. Just to touch that the effects on there were exacerbated. I mean it's more so that when we're having those shutdown dynamics there since we are dealing with a low revenue base at this stage the cost dynamic gets quite accelerated as we try to ramp up those projects and bringing them down. Relative to the 80% reduction what I would tell you is between now and the end of the year we think that we can probably get to a spot where at end of the year we have only a low kind of single-digit type number of projects open four, five, six projects. That's what we think we can get to. So, it still has a dramatic reduction. And there will be a few that have some layover into 2021, but we believe that that's what we're still looking at in the fourth quarter is our ability to bring that down and having so few contracts roll into a 2021 dynamic at this stage. Touching back just to touch on the industrial side. I mean I will say historically that business has been able to operate in a kind of a double-digit margin EBITDA profile double-digit EBITDA and at this stage, that's clearly not where we're at. We're probably much closer to a breakeven-type dynamic. And so as we go forward past 2021 into a 2022-type dynamic where we think that we can see that then we would have every anticipation of being back into a more double-digit EBITDA profile. Last, I think probably just coloring as Duke said multiple times on that $4, we were very comfortable with it being within the range, but there's just a lot of things we still have to digest between now and then as much focused on what's happening that's unique to that industrial market in 2021. Yeah. We're comfortable with the Queensland project up there in May. I think it moves on time. We've been with that project for a while. We think the permits are in pretty good shape and it will get moving here in next year sometime. But -- so that one's that. And if not then there's a multitude more projects and I'm not concerned with that. The $4 that we contemplate, we think about all these kind of things. And in general when we look at big pipe, we have a customer base out there that we support. We'll continue to do so. We like the projects as they come. We talked about the business being around $500 million. We've transitioned the P&I segment away from big pipe as you know. I've stated it many times and I think we'll -- it can grow off the $500 million. It can be greater. But in general when we're talking about guidance and how to look at next year, you should think about the $500 million. If we start stocking projects, if things go our way, if things go good, we'll talk to you about it. And certainly that would be upside. But in general, we should look at $500 million in that piece of business. Yes we can expand it, but we're not going to take the risk. We're going to make sure it's risk -- the risk is conducive with the margins. And that's one of the things the company has been disciplined on and we'll stay that way."

With that, I would like to now turn the call over to Mr. Duke Austin, Quanta\u2019s President and CEO. Duke?\nDuke Austin: Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Quanta Services Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today, I will provide operational and strategic commentary, and we\u2019ll then turn it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a review of our second quarter results and full year 2020 financial expectations. Following Derrick\u2019s comments, we welcome your questions. This morning, we reported solid second quarter results. Our electric power margins were exceptional due to broad-based execution. Pipeline and Industrial segment margins, adjusted EBITDA and earnings per share were all better than we expected. We continue to see opportunity for record backlog and earnings as evidenced by the signing of LUMA Energy contract. Cash flow was robust, and we ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity, all of which we believe demonstrates the resiliency of our business and the operational excellence of our people during extraordinary economic and operating conditions. We believe our resilient business model and strong financial position provides us the opportunity to, not only navigate through tough times of uncertainty, but to emerge better positioned. Our pandemic health and safety procedures in the field have matured, and we have reliable access to personal protective equipment for our crews. We continue to actively communicate with our customers and believe we have adapted effectively to the unprecedented health and economic environment caused by COVID-19. We recognize the strain that the pandemic is placing on our country, and, I, again, want to recognize and thank our incredible employees for all their hard work and let our customers know that we value our collaborative relationships with them. Our electric power operations performed well in the second quarter, with solid profitability, driven by our focus on cost management and operational excellence. Demand for our electric power services remains strong with Utilities actively deploying capital into their systems to modernize, harden, expand and adapt to current and future needs. We are actively performing infrastructure work related to renewables and are seeing incremental opportunity driven by renewable power generation associated with onshore and offshore wind and solar development, including substations, transmission interconnects and battery projects. These renewable energy developments are enabled by backbone transmission, which are also providing larger transmission project opportunities, which we are well positioned for. In June, we announced that the LUMA Energy, a joint venture between Quanta and Canadian Utilities Limited and ATCO company, was selected by the Puerto Rico Public-Private Partnership Authority for a 15-year operation and maintenance agreement with the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, or PREPA, to operate, maintain and modernize PREPA\u2019s more than 18,000-mile electric transmission and distribution system in Puerto Rico. LUMA\u2019s efforts under the agreement are intended to deliver long-term social and economic benefits to the people of Puerto Rico. We believe this opportunity is transformative for Quanta and supports our ongoing strategy of providing sophisticated and valuable solutions to the utility industry that benefit consumers. Following a transition period, which is expected to last approximately one year, this arrangement is anticipated to provide a visible, repeatable and sustainable long-term earnings and cash flow stream to Quanta, with upside opportunity while requiring no additional capital investment from Quanta or LUMA. Further, we believe there is opportunity for Quanta to compete for electric power and communications work in Puerto Rico, associated with its electric T&D system modernization efforts that are separate from Quanta\u2019s ownership interest in LUMA. Puerto Rico\u2019s electric T&D system is a \u2013 in \u2013 at a critical juncture after the destruction caused by Hurricanes Maria and Irma. As a result, the government of Puerto Rico has embarked on a plan to rebuild, modernize, harden and enable a green power grid, the majority of which is expected to be funded by U.S. federal disaster relief agencies and managed by LUMA. The P3 authority in Puerto Rico estimates that more than $18 billion of electric T&D capital investment could be required through 2028 for this initiative. Our communications infrastructure services operation, which are included in our Electric Power segment continued to perform well. We see ample opportunities for growth in the near and longer-term, driven by strong demand for fiber densification to reach homes and businesses and the early stages of 5G deployments. In our press release this morning, we highlighted our recent acquisition of a Chicago-based company that is a leader in providing engineering, design, permitting and utility locating services to electric utilities, gas utilities and communication services companies across the United States. This acquisition meaningfully enhances Quanta\u2019s proven engineering and programmatic delivery capabilities in our core utility markets. Additionally, engineering complexity is greater for 5G deployments as compared to previous wireless technologies, and we believe the increased communications engineering and design capabilities this acquisition brings will allow us to capture and execute on more fiber and 5G deployments. Our Latin American operations, which we are exiting, have been hardest hit by COVID-19. As a result, during the quarter, we accelerated our efforts to exit the Latin American region, which included terminating various contracts. These factors resulted and \u2013 in a greater-than-expected loss in the quarter. While uncertainties and challenges remain, we believe the most significant risk of ceasing our LatAm operations have been addressed by our actions and continue to believe our exit will largely be complete by the year-end. Turning to our Pipeline and Industrial segment. As we anticipated, portions of the segment experienced significant disruptions due to the pandemic in the second quarter. However, segment profitability was better-than-expected due to our rapid adjustment of resources to changing market conditions, effective cost management and operational excellence. Early in the quarter, our gas utility operations were shut down in several metro markets as shelter-in-place orders and work restrictions were implemented. Those restrictions begin \u2013 began to lift and our activity and utilization rates recovered better than expected through the balance of the quarter. As a result, our full year profit expectations for our gas utility operation remains largely unchanged despite our expectation that some customers\u2019 work is now likely to shift into 2021. Utilities remain in the early stages of multidecade modernization programs to replace aging gas distribution infrastructure in order to meet regulatory requirements aimed at improving reliability and safety, and expect an improved environment next year. Demand for our pipeline integrity services remained solid during the quarter, and did not experience meaningful impacts from COVID-19. Regulatory requirements continue to encourage our customers to test, inspect, repair, perform maintenance and replace pipeline infrastructure to ensure the safe, reliable and environmentally friendly delivery of energy. Further, permitting challenges for building new pipelines make existing pipeline infrastructure more valuable. Increasing pipeline owners\u2019 desire to extend the useful life of existing pipeline assets through integrity initiatives. Due to these dynamics, we expect demand for our pipeline integrity services will continue to grow. Our industrial services offering is diverse, which benefited us during a challenging quarter. Demand for our catalyst services and tank maintenance remained solid in the quarter. However, due to the negative influence of COVID-19 on the demand for refined products, customers\u2019 restricted on-site activity for our other services and deferred maintenance and certain turnaround in capital projects to later this year or 2021. Because this work is necessary for the operation of these facilities, we are confident the delayed work will return in the future as economic and market conditions improve. Thus far, our industrial operations are performing consistent with our expectations, and we continue to believe there is opportunity for stability during the balance of the year and improvement in 2021. For the remainder of this segment, portions of our midstream and ancillary services operations experienced softness in the quarter as expected. However, these operations did a good job managing costs to the market environment. And finally, larger pipeline projects continue to face permitting challenges. The Atlantic Coast pipeline, for example. Our larger pipeline project activity this year is not significant. However, we continue to pursue opportunities for 2020 and beyond that would be an additive to this segment and our outlook. For the last several years, we have been focused on increasing and gaining scale in the base business of the segment, and diversifying the services and geographies of the segment to create a more sustainable and consistent operation. To that end, the three primary service lines we have been focused on are gas utility services, pipeline integrity services and industrial services, which account for more than 70% of the segment\u2019s estimated 2020 revenues. Further, base business revenues are estimated to account for nearly 90% of the segment revenues this year. Going forward, we expect to continue our focus on growing the base gas utility, pipeline integrity and industrial services business, consistent with our strategy over the last five years, and continue to believe a post-COVID operating environment will offer opportunity for increased margins and returns for the overall segment. We have increased our financial expectations for the year and taken a prudent approach to our outlook. Additionally, we continue to pursue opportunities in the marketplace that are not incorporated into our expectations and remain positive and confident about Quanta\u2019s multiyear growth opportunities. Over the past five years, we have executed on our strategy and remain dedicated to growing and enhancing our portfolio of services, which strengthens our ability to capture more of our customers\u2019 large programmatic spending programs. These efforts are designed to mitigate risk inherent in our business and prepare for unexpected events through diversification and by maintaining a strong financial profile. We believe Quanta has a long runway ahead of us for generating repeatable and sustainable earnings as we execute on our strategic initiatives. Considering our organic growth opportunities and the levers available to us to allocate future cash flow generation into value-creating opportunities such as stock repurchases, acquisitions and strategic investments and dividends, we believe Quanta has the opportunity to generate meaningful stockholder value over time. To that end, this year, we have repurchased $200 million of our common stock and this morning, we announced that Quanta\u2019s Board of Directors has authorized the company to repurchase up to $500 million in shares of its outstanding common stock through June 30, 2023, under a new stock repurchase program. I would also note that over the past six years, we have repurchased approximately $2.4 billion of common stock, which equates to the retirement of more than 40% of the shares outstanding at the start of those repurchases. We believe these actions demonstrate our confidence in Quanta and our commitment to generating value for our stockholders. We are focused on operating the business for the long-term and expect to continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class field leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta\u2019s base business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta\u2019s diversity, unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset form the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for all our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his review of our second quarter results and 2020 expectations. Derrick?\nDerrick Jensen: Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced second quarter 2020 revenues of $2.5 billion. Net income attributable to common stock was $74 million or $0.52 per diluted share and adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure, was $0.74. As expected, our results for the second quarter were affected by the unprecedented economic environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and its compounding impact on the challenging energy market. We experienced significant challenges in certain of our operations that were disrupted by stay-at-home orders or job site access restrictions as well as customers pulling back capital deployment amidst all the uncertainty. However, we were able to successfully execute across the majority of our operations and deliver results that exceeded our estimates. Our Electric Power revenues, excluding Latin America, were $1.8 billion, a 2% increase when compared to the second quarter of 2019. This increase was primarily driven by continued growth from our communications operations, which are included within the Electric Power segment, delivering a 50% increase compared to the second quarter of 2019. Revenues from our electric operations were in line with 2019 levels, a meaningful accomplishment given the COVID-19-related disruptions and reduced levels of West Coast fire hardening activities, which we still expect will accelerate in the second half of 2020. Electric segment margins in 2Q 2020 were 10.3%, and excluding our Latin American operations, segment margins improved 130 basis points to 11.1% versus 9.8% in 2Q 2019. The operating margins reflect strong execution across our operation and improved performance from our Canadian operation due to increased revenue levels and asset utilization. In addition, communications margins continue to improve both against last year and sequentially despite the COVID-related headwinds. As Duke mentioned, we continue to take actions to expedite the wind down and exit of our Latin American operations. The challenges in Latin America have been exacerbated by stringent COVID-19 stay-at-home orders across the region, but particularly in Peru, which is our largest operation. This exceedingly uncertain environment caused us to purposefully accelerate early termination of various contracts to prudently avoid increasing losses due to the lack of customer activity. Additionally, certain MSA contracts had incurred costs to support the multiyear operations that upon contract termination, were no longer recoverable. Of note, we currently receive no tax benefit for losses in Latin America, so the $15 million in losses impacted the quarter by approximately $0.11, $0.08 more than we anticipated. We expected most of the negative impacts from COVID-19 and the challenging energy market to be experienced by our pipeline and industrial segment, and that proved to be the case. Revenues for the segment were $713 million, 35% lower than 2Q 2019. In addition, revenues were also lower compared to last year due to the reduction in contributions from larger pipeline projects. Partially offsetting these declines were increased levels of gas distribution revenues, including approximately $55 million from acquired companies. We expected that these headwinds would challenge P&I segment profitability, potentially resulting in a loss for the second quarter. However, we successfully operated through the challenging conditions and delivered segment margins of 3% and lower than 2Q 2019, but a significant accomplishment given the circumstances based across the segment. This performance was led by solid execution across our base business activities and proactive cost management activities in the field for those operations with significant revenue headwinds. Our total backlog was $13.9 billion at the end of the second quarter, approximately $1.2 billion or 9% higher than 2Q 2019. 12-month backlog of $7.7 billion is a slight increase from both the second quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020. Total backlog decreased from the first quarter, largely due to the removal of the remaining portion of our expected revenues associated with the Atlantic Coast pipeline project. Subsequent to June 30, 2020, project owners, Dominion Energy, Inc. and Duke Energy Corporation announced their intention to forego completion of the pipeline. Although the joint venture in which Quanta is participating has not received a notice of termination, based on the announcement, we have concluded that the revenues related to the original remaining performance obligation associated with the contract are no longer probable, and therefore, are excluded from remaining performance obligations and backlog as of June 30, 2020. As Duke mentioned, we continue to have robust conversations with our customers on multiyear spend programs, extensions of existing multiyear arrangements and new larger project opportunities in both the electric and P&I segments. We expect that as challenges associated with customer engagement normalize, those discussions will finalize and drive the opportunity for record backlog. More importantly, Duke mentioned the second quarter announcement of our LUMA Energy joint venture to operate, maintain and modernize Puerto Rico\u2019s electric transmission and distribution grid over the next 15 years. While this business show up in backlog, to the extent that we successfully move through the transition phase to commencement, our expected portion of LUMA\u2019s award would represent the largest cumulative contract value ever awarded to Quanta. If you assume our historical electric segment margin profile of 10%, the 15-year award would imply a backlog equivalent of over $6 billion. It is important to appreciate what this award represents as a predictable, sustainable contribution to our future earnings and cash flows as well as the potential opportunities that can arise as LUMA successfully executes against this award. For the second quarter of 2020, we generated free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, of $457 million. Our strong cash flow in 2Q 2020 was partly attributable to reduced levels of working capital requirements resulting from the sequential quarterly decline in revenues. Cash flow levels were also positively impacted by a reduction in days sales outstanding, or DSO, which measured 82 days for the second quarter, a decrease of nine days compared to the second quarter of 2019 and a sequential decline of three days compared to 1Q 2020. The DSO in 2Q 2020 is more in line with our historical average as compared to DSO last year, which were impacted by higher retainage balances due to project timing as well as billing process changes for certain customers that pressured DSO throughout 2019. We also benefited from the deferral of $89 million of tax payments permitted by the Cares Act, $58 million of which was paid in July and the remainder due in equal amounts at the end of 2021 and 2022. We had $530 million of cash at the end of the quarter. As of June 30, 2020, we had total liquidity of approximately $2.1 billion and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as calculated under our senior secured credit agreement of approximately 1.3 times, slightly below our preferred range of 1.5 to 2 times. Turning to our guidance. Similar to where we found ourselves last quarter, we are still dealing with some level of uncertainty as we assess the near-term prospects of our operations, particularly those that are susceptible to local stay-at-home orders, operate in enclosed facilities or depend upon project teams having access to local permitting offices. As COVID-19 cases continue to spread, we have approached our guidance with our typical prudence and a cautious expectation for what the remainder of the year will deliver. Our full year revenue expectations for the Electric Power segment are unchanged, expecting to range between $7.5 billion and $7.7 billion. However, we are increasing full year operating margin expectations to between 9.3% and 9.6%, with Latin America contributing operating losses of $40 million to $45 million. Excluding Latin America losses, margins are now expected to be around 10%, which reflects continued successful project execution, plus the incremental impact of the LUMA joint venture. The LUMA joint venture is accounted for as an equity method investment and therefore, will not contribute to revenues. However, we are including our equity and earnings of LUMA within operating income since LUMA is operationally integral to our operations under accounting guidance as compared to most of our other equity investments that are more positive in nature. LUMA\u2019s results are presented after tax and are anticipated to positively contribute to operating income in 2020 by approximately $10 million or $0.06 to $0.07 per share. We also anticipate that LUMA\u2019s earnings could be accretive to diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock by approximately $0.25 annually, after the approximately one year transition period with upside opportunity from performance-based incentives. The P&I segment continues to be impacted by COVID-19 and the challenged energy market conditions, and accordingly, we are reducing our full year revenue expectations to range between $3.5 billion and $3.7 billion. Customers have continued to evaluate this environment and have reduced spend expectations for certain smaller capital projects and gas distribution activities. In addition, certain larger pipeline project opportunities have been delayed, and we now expect they will contribute more meaningfully to 2021 results. We have increased our full year operating margin guidance for the P&I segment, which is now expected to range between 4.75% and 5.25%. Of note, with regard to the cancelation of ACP, we have yet to receive a formal termination notice, and we are working with the customers to determine how the project will close out. Although we believe potential upside associated with termination fees and other contract accounting exists, the final contract closeout will not be determined until the timing of project wind down is known, any closeout scopes of work are defined by ACP and then agreed and allocated by the joint venture to Quanta. Relative to seasonality, for both the electric and P&I segments in our current environment, we do not expect significant variability in revenue or operating margins across the third and fourth quarters. As noted in our earnings release this morning, we have increased our full year earnings per share expectations, and now expect GAAP diluted earnings per share of between $2.33 and $2.64. And adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure, of between $3.18 and $3.48. These earnings per share expectations include a loss per share of between $0.28 and $0.31 from our Latin American operations. Turning to cash flow. We are raising our free cash flow guidance for the year to range between $600 million and $800 million. The countercyclical nature of our cash flow was further validated by the strong cash flow for the first half of the year, with aggregate trailing 12-month free cash flow of $1.2 billion. However, we expect the ramp of revenues in the third quarter to increase working capital requirements and drive cash outflows for the quarter, followed by a recovery in the fourth quarter as is typically the case. While we have experiment \u2013 and while we\u2019ve experienced minimal payment delays related to COVID-19 through the second quarter, we remain cautious about the third and fourth quarters and have raised our DSO expectations through the rest of the year to account for capital preservation actions that may be taken by certain portions of our customer base if economic conditions deteriorate. I\u2019ll close my guidance commentary, reiterating the challenge that the combination of COVID-19 and the volatile energy market conditions present for our near-term outlook. Excluding our Latin America operations, we continue to estimate that at least 70% of the change in our 2020 expectations from the beginning of the year can be attributed to COVID-19-related disruptions, with the remaining 30%, largely associated with the residual effects that low oil prices have in our pipeline and industrial customers\u2019 capital budgets. Overall, we are pleased with the resilient second quarter performance and are excited about the long-term prospects of our business, particularly what the LUMA opportunity with Puerto Rico represents for Quanta\u2019s future and for the people of Puerto Rico. We\u2019ve continued to maintain a strong balance sheet with the flexibility to pursue opportunistic deployments of capital for M&A and investments as well as returns of capital. Our efforts to return capital to stockholders are further enhanced by the new $500 million share repurchase authorization, which, coupled with the $87 million remaining under our previous program, represents $587 million of aggregate authorizations. We believe the long-term repeatable, sustainable nature of the majority of our earnings streams provide stability to all of our stakeholders and ensures we have the foundation to deliver long-term shareholder value. This concludes our formal presentation, and we\u2019ll now open the line for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we\u2019ll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Noelle Dilts with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nNoelle Dilts: Hi guys, good morning, and congratulations on good performance in a tough environment.\nDuke Austin: Good morning. Thank you.\nNoelle Dilts: Good morning. So just given a lot of what\u2019s going on in 2020, COVID, the headwinds associated with Latin America, I was hoping you could just kind of give us some thoughts on how you\u2019re starting to think about 2021 and to what extent some of these headwinds, particularly on the oil side \u2013 oil-related side of the business, how you\u2019re thinking about whether to the degree to which they will or won\u2019t continue into next year. If you could just give us some sort of initial thoughts on how you\u2019re thinking about 2021, that would be helpful.\nDuke Austin: Yes. Thanks, Noelle. I think when we talked about Latin America early on. We talked about exiting this year. We\u2019re doing that in a prudent manner. We\u2019re trying to get that behind us. COVID certainly came in and cost rose. We did some things with contracts to exit earlier. So I do think that the majority of that will be out, and we\u2019ve guided for that in 2020. As we look forward, I \u2013 we talked about the base business being robust, being able to grow. It were largely intact on the Electric segment throughout the year, even pre-COVID. So our strategy is working. On the P&I side, we saw the light switch effect, some cities down. After that, we are largely intact. Everybody\u2019s back to work for the most part. We do have some shift where we\u2019re customer interfacing with utilities, so we\u2019re going in people\u2019s homes. That work has somewhat shift to next year and beyond. So that\u2019s a little bit of drag on there and the Canadian work pushed out into next year. But all in all, 90% of the base work, the baseload work, obviously, we added Puerto Rico, which I believe is transformational for the company and a lot of opportunity there into 2021. So in my mind, the company has gotten stronger through this. Our Industrial segment, you can\u2019t \u2013 you don\u2019t know where the economy is going to go. So the demand on the Industrial segment is certainly there long-term, but it will be predicated around the economy. And we\u2019ll continue to evaluate that. But sometimes in these areas of lulls, we\u2019re able to gain market share, and we have a really good management team down there. I like our chances to gain market share and come out of this way stronger on the other side.\nNoelle Dilts: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then just given the $500 million stock repurchase authorization announcement and the acquisition in the quarter. Could you just kind of give us some thoughts on how you\u2019re thinking about the prioritization of capital deployment, given where your stock is trading today? And then what I would think might be some opportunities to make potentially some attractive opportunities to pick up players that may be struggling a little bit more in the downturn. Thanks.\nDuke Austin: We\u2019ve never been a company to acquire companies that are struggling. So I think when we look at it, we buy in, in the strength in the \u2013 into our strategy. Our strategy has not changed over the last five years in the way we\u2019ve deployed capital. Everything is against our stock price and our strategy. So when we look at things, when we\u2019re looking at companies, their \u2013 its strength to a region to a strategy. The Chicago company that we bought was \u2013 will allow us to get on the front end of programmatic spends that are ongoing within our service lines as we expand. So that was very strategic to us. We like the company. It\u2019s an old historic company that will give us a lot of flexibility on the programmatic spend. That being said, everything is valued against our stock price. We continue to believe our earnings streams and our earnings power is much greater than its value today. It\u2019s more consistent, more resilient, and we\u2019ll continue to lean into it and drive EPS and EPS growth.\nNoelle Dilts: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Dudas: Yes. Good morning, everyone.\nDuke Austin: Good morning.\nDerrick Jensen: Good morning.\nMichael Dudas: Duke, as you convent with your relations with your electric power customers and gas power customers, as things get to normalize, are there any thoughts of acceleration in certain parts of the CapEx spend that\u2019s anticipated, that\u2019s going to be in your sweet spot relative to what you would have there, you would have thought, say, 12 months ago as some of the demand load factors and certainly coal plant closure and shutdowns and renewable drivers could certainly maybe impact some of that program expanding going forward?\nDuke Austin: Yes. I think when we talked about it at the first part of the year and even beyond, you\u2019re seeing multi-year T&D spends on CapEx on a go-forward basis. That\u2019s still there. It\u2019s still prevalent. We\u2019re working with our customers and collaborating with them. When you start putting EVs, electric vehicles, in order to enable that, you have to have a very modern grid. And so the modernization thereof and the CapEx that it takes to get there is something that\u2019s ongoing on the distribution side of the business, both gas and electric, for stability. As you see more renewables, the interconnections that are required in the amount of transmission and the redundancy within the grid, that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing most of our clients have both renewable expansion on the generation side as well as your transmission expansion on the other side. So really, in my mind, whether it\u2019s renewables that we\u2019re enabling or just the stability of the grid for electric vehicles. Either way, it\u2019s necessary to invest in \u2013 for a long period of time. People are talking about 2050 to be carbon-free and things of that nature. In order to do that, the amount of transmission and distribution expenditures to this grid is exponential of what you see today just to give you the flexibility to enable those enhancements.\nMichael Dudas: That\u2019s very helpful. And my follow-up would be with the success of your Puerto Rican joint venture, the \u2013 securing it and assuming going forward, it will be successful, is that model able to be replicated elsewhere in the U.S. or internationally, that could continue to enhance that kind of that earnings, sustainable earnings flow on top of your normal base business going forward? And is that something we could see in the next 12, 18 or 24 months?\nDuke Austin: I think it was a unique opportunity in Puerto Rico to collaborate with a great customer, that ATCO, that we have a great relationship with, and both their strengths and our strengths came together along with IEM, our partner there. It will allow us a unique opportunity. In my mind, what we\u2019re able to do there is strengthen the people of the island. It\u2019s \u2013 for me, it\u2019s a social thing because I think at the end of this, we\u2019re going to modernize the grid. We\u2019re going to stabilize an economy, and people are going to benefit. I mean lights are out every day there for periods of time. And for us, at the end, if we \u2013 when we get through this, I think we\u2019ll be able to look back and it will be so meaningful to Quanta, us, ATCO and also the whole industry of what we\u2019ve done in Puerto Rico. I know we can do it. We don\u2019t talk about things. We actually go out there and build things. So it will be unique. And the opportunities on the other side of that is the FEMA money that\u2019s coming in, which is $18 billion or, call it, $10 billion, call it $12 billion, whatever it is, it\u2019s meaningful on the other side of the contract that I think we\u2019ll have an opportunity and I like our chances on work because it \u2013 we do it cost certain, we do things right and economically for the consumer. So as that \u2013 as you see, that\u2019s a huge expansion for us. There\u2019s other islands. There\u2019s other ways that we can participate and collaborate with our customer. We\u2019re doing this all the time at \u2013 on different ways to enable technology, to enable EVs, to enable a grid that\u2019s sustainable under renewables and things of that nature. So we\u2019re around the edges all the time of what you hear about, and I was sitting on a call the other day, and they were talking about all this things around technology. In order to get there, everything that we\u2019re doing and everything as a company that we\u2019re doing, we\u2019re enabling all those things to happen. So in my mind, there\u2019ll be all kinds of opportunities for us, and we have a really nice base to grow off of.\nMichael Dudas: Well said. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Fisher: Thanks. Good morning. I got on the call a little bit late, so I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ve addressed this or not. So I apologize, but I wonder if you could talk about the strength in the margins in the Electric segment. How much of that was something from the electric side versus the communication side? And to what extent, if you\u2019re seeing a notable pickup in the communications side, do you think we\u2019re at an inflection point there on that business, really kind of ramping up over the next handful of quarters?\nDuke Austin: Yes. Thanks. The margins were impressive. The guys in the field are really operating well under extreme conditions. I\u2019ve said this before, and I want to make sure I say it again. The electric side of the business will operate in double digits over time. And we\u2019ll continue to say that if we operate in 11, we\u2019ve operated in 9, we\u2019ll operate in 12 at times. And so I would just, in my mind, we always think around double digits. That\u2019s the way to think about the Electric segment. They did have \u2013 we did have a nice quarter, and I think we\u2019re setting up for a nice year here. The telecom is certainly a part of this. And we are making incremental progress there. The opportunities are out there. They\u2019re large. We continue to build office, build strength. We added some engineering capabilities in the quarter, which will only help us as we EPC, and we do work in cities and metroplexes. That was extremely important for us to get the engineering in the front end, right on those things. And I \u2013 we\u2019ve done that through an acquisition. So I\u2019m proud of where we\u2019re at. I\u2019m proud of where we sit. We\u2019ll only get better as we move forward in the telecom.\nSteven Fisher: Okay. And then if you could just talk a little bit about what\u2019s happening at Stronghold on the downstream side to talk about the flow of opportunities you\u2019re seeing there and how you think of that business positioned in light of sort of the more challenging downstream conditions. Is the business rightsized for what you see going forward?\nDuke Austin: We have a great industrial business, both on the Hubble side as well as the Stronghold catalyst side that really is \u2013 it gives us a good base to grow off of. The management team\u2019s stronghold as well as our management team on the electric side, they\u2019re exceptional. They\u2019ll take advantage of these opportunities as we see them. We certainly rightsized the business, the G&A aspects of it. We had a record quarter in the first quarter and obviously fell off in the second. But again, we\u2019re still profitable. We\u2019re still doing well out there. And I think we\u2019ll only come out the other side stronger.\nSteven Fisher: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nJamie Cook: Hi, good morning, and nice quarter. I guess, just to follow \u2013 a couple of quick follow-ups. One, also \u2013 the Pipeline and Industrial margins were pretty good in the quarter, just considering the revenue declines that you saw. So maybe you can talk to anything that you\u2019re seeing there that\u2019s sort of a structural improvement in margins and whether it\u2019s fair to assume margin can continue to improve at a nice pace as we exit the year and into 2021. And then my follow-up question is sort of on what Noelle asked. And a little more specifically, Derrick, I think I asked you this last quarter, but if you take the base of 2020, add back LatAm, you adjust for the COVID disruption, you consider your share repurchase, and now we have Puerto Rico. Why isn\u2019t $4 a reasonable number to think about for 2021 on an adjusted basis?\nDuke Austin: Good morning, Jamie, I would say, in general, we\u2019ve made incremental progress on the pipeline side pre-COVID. I \u2013 we were 7%-plus guidance on it early on. And I think that progress is still there. We\u2019ve done the things right strategically to position the company ex-pipe to go forward at mid- to high-single digits, and that\u2019s where it stands. I think our goal is a portfolio, a double-digit EBITDA. We\u2019re not there yet. We\u2019re working on it. You can see the Electric margins pulling up. I could think you\u2019ll continue to see the pipe and the resiliency of the pipe \u2013 pipeline segment, P&I segment go forward. And it\u2019s utility-backed, it\u2019s industrial-based. And as that goes farther, you\u2019ll continue to see those margins rise and then the returns get better there. And as far as \u2013 I\u2019ll answer a little bit on the $4. I think when we talked about it last quarter, we stand by now. The opportunity is there. It\u2019s opportunity for more than $4. So \u2013 well that\u2019s where we\u2019re at. It\u2019s early. It\u2019s June. And it\u2019s August now. But we\u2019re giving June numbers. So we\u2019re not going to give 2021 guidance, but everything you\u2019re saying and everything you\u2019re inferring. We see the same thing. The company is in very, very good shape, and we\u2019re working hard at margins.\nJamie Cook: Thank you very much. Great job.\nDuke Austin: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Please proceed with your question.\nAdam Thalhimer: Hey, good morning, guys. Nice quarter.\nDuke Austin: Thanks.\nAdam Thalhimer: Hey, duke, did I hear you say that telecom was up 50% in Q2? And if so, was that new contracts? Or was that more work under existing contracts?\nDuke Austin: I don\u2019t know if I said that or Derrick said that. But I \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 I think that\u2019s accurate. It\u2019s under both. And in our mind, we talked about early on that we were having some \u2013 when we thought about it, we were doing a lot of front-end engineering. And as we went to the field, things would get better, revenues picked up, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing. We\u2019re starting to put people in the field. Our Canadian work strengthened some too in the quarter. So all those things kind of come together. And we\u2019ll continue to see those kind of ramps in the business. Not 50% ramps, but it will continue up as we go to the field with construction. There\u2019s a lot of opportunity there. We\u2019re growing the business quite nicely. And I like the things we\u2019re doing.\nDerrick Jensen: Yes. It\u2019s Derrick, also. I mean, keep in mind, we\u2019ve talked about it now for quite some time. We saw the ability to have a faster ramp, obviously, and I talk on compartment of our business than in other components. And we stand behind this year of still being able to see telecom revenues at or above $500 million.\nDuke Austin: And the acquisitions, really, we talked about this morning certainly enhances the front side of that and then it gives us the ability to move quicker into the field.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. And then just one more on telecom actually. You mentioned 5G. How does Quanta play in 5G? And how does that opportunity ramp?\nDuke Austin: I\u2019m \u2013 when we look at it, I mean, it\u2019s somewhat pulled back. The density \u2013 I mean, 5G is about seven components. But as you think about it, what enables 5G is your communication from your fiber to your cell towers and things of that nature. They need line of sight on the cells, the small cells, whatever it may be. But the fiber backbone and data on the edge, all those things are part of 5G. And every bit of that \u2013 and by the way, it takes quite a bit of power as well to enable those data centers and things of that nature. So we\u2019re around the edges on all of it and how we interface with our local electric utilities or \u2013 and gas utilities, along with the telecom and collaborate there on the middle grounds of those things, put us in a great position to enhance our ability to deploy 5G.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nSean Eastman: Good morning, gentlemen. Nice work this quarter. I just wanted to start with, yes, a really high level one. Going through Utility earnings releases this quarter, a lot of talk about hydrogen technologies. Is there any discussion \u2013 is Quanta part of any of those discussions? Just curious if that is something interesting for you guys to be looking at over the long-term.\nDuke Austin: Yes. We talk to them around all those things. I think in general, hydrogen is something, we talked about batteries a long time. We talked about solar a long time. It continues to be part of a carbon footprint that is environmentally friendly. So those things are all part of it. And I think we\u2019re around the edges on all those kind of conversations, whether we build any kind of hydrogen plant or something of those natures. It just depends on what it is. We\u2019re going to stay down the middle and do the things that we\u2019re very good at, like we\u2019ve done in the past. And certainly, we\u2019ll collaborate on all those kind of opportunities, such as hydrogen, solar, 5G, whatever it may be. We continue to talk to them and try to advance those technologies forward through enabling the grid and also your infrastructure.\nSean Eastman: Got it. And just as we think about the second halfs, just seeing all utilities maintain their capital budgets. I think I\u2019ve seen a couple increase their budgets and accelerate some stuff. But just trying to think about what that dynamic means for the second half. I just thought about this sort of prospect of maybe getting some work accelerated. So those customers are able to spend those budgets and what you guys have built in around a potential acceleration in the second half or catch up dynamic.\nDuke Austin: Yes. Sean, I think when we looked at it, where still many cities are within the COVID environment or different kinds of restrictions. So I think we took a prudent approach to guidance. We said the back half, the fire hardening in the back half of the Electric segment was strengthened, we still believe that. I mean, we\u2019re on a storm now in the East Coast. And so under Covid restrictions, where our guys are performing exceptional and so it\u2019s very difficult to say what the second half, if there\u2019s upside to it. I think we took a nice prudent approach like we do all the time. But we do have some strength there, and we continue to see opportunities with our clients and making sure that either their workforce is at home due to COVID. So we\u2019re backfilling and things of that nature. Or we\u2019re making sure that their capital budgets and what they see in the future, we\u2019re able to deliver on those capital plans. So lots of conversations going on. All in all, I think we gave good prudent guidance as we move forward.\nSean Eastman: Got it. Again, nice work guys, and thanks for the time.\nDuke Austin: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Justin Hauke with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nJustin Hauke: Thank you. Good morning. I\u2019ve got two quick ones here. First one, just to, I guess, level set on telecom to \u2013 as we think about 2021. I think the guidance originally for the year was that it would be about $500 million of revenue with margins getting close to the segment average. So I just was kind of hoping to get an update, year-to-date, what\u2019s the revenue as we\u2019re halfway through the year and where are those margins so we can think about the second half. And then also how we comp next year. That\u2019s my first question. And the second question is just to the extent that there\u2019s any update on the arbitration process in Peru. And if there\u2019s anything else that \u2013 as you\u2019ve exited these contracts, any other legal items that have come up related to those closures? Thank you.\nDuke Austin: I\u2019ll let Derrick take the margin questions, and I\u2019ll jump back in on Peru.\nDerrick Jensen: Yes. From a telecom perspective, we\u2019re still looking at revenues probably $500 million to slightly above for 2020 very much intact. On a year-to-date basis, I would tell you, we\u2019re probably about halfway there. We\u2019re probably in that $250 million range. On margins, we commented that margins are sequentially higher than the first and still had improvement over last year. They\u2019re above the mid single-digit range and continuing to improve. We see very much as we exit now through the rest of the year, our margin profile that\u2019s increasing. A little bit of COVID dynamic there in the second. So I think otherwise, you would have seen our margins kind of creeping up, I see it even further more in the second, but we still feel very confident in our ability to be that upper single-digit and double-digit by the time we exit the year.\nDuke Austin: As far as Peru goes, we\u2019ve physically handed over the network at this point. We\u2019ve done the things administratively that we needed to do to preserve our asset as well as our lawsuit there. We\u2019re incrementally more positive about where we\u2019re at. It\u2019s a long process. We continue to make what I think is the right decisions going forward that will allow us to recoup our investment down there. We\u2019ll see where it goes over the next 18 months.\nJustin Hauke: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Hey, good morning, guys. Nice quarter.\nDuke Austin: Thank you.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Duke, last quarter, you talked about expecting to book a number of MSA renewals as 2020 evolves and consequently book revenue have you seen any delays in these MSAs coming to fruition? And then you also have talked pretty much every quarter about having billions of potential large transmission projects. I hope that they\u2019d be booked. Do you see an opportunity to book a large project in the second half of this year?\nDuke Austin: Look, I don\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t press timing on those things. They just \u2013 again, we take our time. We\u2019re looking at them all the time. There\u2019s multiple opportunities out there. It depends on what you call large or not. I think when you go back and you look at what we\u2019ve booked this quarter, as Derrick said in his commentary, $6 billion is not too bad the way I see it and their earnings streams, they\u2019re off of it. And we worked on that for 18 months or better. And I would I just say, it\u2019s transformational in this company what we did in a quarter through a pandemic and the guys and the teams that have done that and what we\u2019ll be able to do on that island is something that will go down and is meaningful for, not only us, but the generations to come. So that being said, the opportunities are there. They\u2019re larger. The larger transmission opportunities remain robust. We continue \u2013 I will say this on pipe. It doesn\u2019t matter. Large pipe doesn\u2019t matter to us. It doesn\u2019t matter on this quarter, and it doesn\u2019t matter going forward. It\u2019s only incremental to anything we talk about. So the big pipe, when I think about it, it\u2019s incremental to anything we say. If it\u2019s there, we\u2019ll pick it up. If it\u2019s not, we won\u2019t. And it\u2019s fine. That\u2019s not what this company is built around on the future or today.\nAndy Kaplowitz: That\u2019s helpful. And obviously, you then can accelerate sort of getting out of Latin America. So as we sit here today, do you think you \u2013 when you go into 2021, you really should be out and the impact on EPS would be amenable to not being extended in 2021?\nDuke Austin: Yes. I mean, I think for the majority of it, you could have a little bit of linger, but I \u2013 we\u2019re hard-pressed to get that done, and we were able to negotiate contracts out. It costs us a little money in the quarter, but it was the right answer for our shareholders, the right answer for Quanta is to move through that, and we were able to do a multitude that within the quarter. Again, we\u2019re preserving the asset there in Peru. We\u2019re working through the other areas. But in my mind, we\u2019re on the other side of that, moving forward very quickly to get out.\nAndy Kaplowitz: And Duke, I just want to say that you mentioned the storm here in the tri-state area. We need more help so whatever you had for your expectations for the year in terms of revenue, maybe you\u2019re going to out that because you think there\u2019s more work to do in this area around this storm. So thanks, anyway. Good quarter.\nDuke Austin: Yes, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, I will turn the floor back to management for closing remarks.\nDuke Austin: Yes. Thanks, everyone. I \u2013 mainly, I want to thank our employees for the work that they\u2019ve done in the storm environment. I will say that our business is inherently risky due to COVID. It\u2019s even more still. I would say, in general, they\u2019ve done a great job. We\u2019ve collaborated great with the client here. And hopefully, we\u2019re all picking the lights back on at a pretty rapid pace. So that being said, the industry has made a ton of progress there. And we\u2019re proud of that and proud of what our guys have done in the field. We want to thank you, thank our customers, and I appreciate your questions and ongoing interest in Quanta.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Duke Austin",
            "content": "Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Quanta Services Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today, I will provide operational and strategic commentary, and we'll then turn it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a review of our second quarter results and full year 2020 financial expectations. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions. This morning, we reported solid second quarter results. Our electric power margins were exceptional due to broad-based execution. Pipeline and Industrial segment margins, adjusted EBITDA and earnings per share were all better than we expected. We continue to see opportunity for record backlog and earnings as evidenced by the signing of LUMA Energy contract. Cash flow was robust, and we ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity, all of which we believe demonstrates the resiliency of our business and the operational excellence of our people during extraordinary economic and operating conditions. We believe our resilient business model and strong financial position provides us the opportunity to, not only navigate through tough times of uncertainty, but to emerge better positioned. Our pandemic health and safety procedures in the field have matured, and we have reliable access to personal protective equipment for our crews. We continue to actively communicate with our customers and believe we have adapted effectively to the unprecedented health and economic environment caused by COVID-19. We recognize the strain that the pandemic is placing on our country, and, I, again, want to recognize and thank our incredible employees for all their hard work and let our customers know that we value our collaborative relationships with them. Our electric power operations performed well in the second quarter, with solid profitability, driven by our focus on cost management and operational excellence. Demand for our electric power services remains strong with Utilities actively deploying capital into their systems to modernize, harden, expand and adapt to current and future needs. We are actively performing infrastructure work related to renewables and are seeing incremental opportunity driven by renewable power generation associated with onshore and offshore wind and solar development, including substations, transmission interconnects and battery projects. These renewable energy developments are enabled by backbone transmission, which are also providing larger transmission project opportunities, which we are well positioned for. In June, we announced that the LUMA Energy, a joint venture between Quanta and Canadian Utilities Limited and ATCO company, was selected by the Puerto Rico Public-Private Partnership Authority for a 15-year operation and maintenance agreement with the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, or PREPA, to operate, maintain and modernize PREPA's more than 18,000-mile electric transmission and distribution system in Puerto Rico. LUMA's efforts under the agreement are intended to deliver long-term social and economic benefits to the people of Puerto Rico. We believe this opportunity is transformative for Quanta and supports our ongoing strategy of providing sophisticated and valuable solutions to the utility industry that benefit consumers. Following a transition period, which is expected to last approximately one year, this arrangement is anticipated to provide a visible, repeatable and sustainable long-term earnings and cash flow stream to Quanta, with upside opportunity while requiring no additional capital investment from Quanta or LUMA. Further, we believe there is opportunity for Quanta to compete for electric power and communications work in Puerto Rico, associated with its electric T&D system modernization efforts that are separate from Quanta's ownership interest in LUMA. Puerto Rico's electric T&D system is a \u2013 in \u2013 at a critical juncture after the destruction caused by Hurricanes Maria and Irma. As a result, the government of Puerto Rico has embarked on a plan to rebuild, modernize, harden and enable a green power grid, the majority of which is expected to be funded by U.S. federal disaster relief agencies and managed by LUMA. The P3 authority in Puerto Rico estimates that more than $18 billion of electric T&D capital investment could be required through 2028 for this initiative. Our communications infrastructure services operation, which are included in our Electric Power segment continued to perform well. We see ample opportunities for growth in the near and longer-term, driven by strong demand for fiber densification to reach homes and businesses and the early stages of 5G deployments. In our press release this morning, we highlighted our recent acquisition of a Chicago-based company that is a leader in providing engineering, design, permitting and utility locating services to electric utilities, gas utilities and communication services companies across the United States. This acquisition meaningfully enhances Quanta's proven engineering and programmatic delivery capabilities in our core utility markets. Additionally, engineering complexity is greater for 5G deployments as compared to previous wireless technologies, and we believe the increased communications engineering and design capabilities this acquisition brings will allow us to capture and execute on more fiber and 5G deployments. Our Latin American operations, which we are exiting, have been hardest hit by COVID-19. As a result, during the quarter, we accelerated our efforts to exit the Latin American region, which included terminating various contracts. These factors resulted and \u2013 in a greater-than-expected loss in the quarter. While uncertainties and challenges remain, we believe the most significant risk of ceasing our LatAm operations have been addressed by our actions and continue to believe our exit will largely be complete by the year-end. Turning to our Pipeline and Industrial segment. As we anticipated, portions of the segment experienced significant disruptions due to the pandemic in the second quarter. However, segment profitability was better-than-expected due to our rapid adjustment of resources to changing market conditions, effective cost management and operational excellence. Early in the quarter, our gas utility operations were shut down in several metro markets as shelter-in-place orders and work restrictions were implemented. Those restrictions begin \u2013 began to lift and our activity and utilization rates recovered better than expected through the balance of the quarter. As a result, our full year profit expectations for our gas utility operation remains largely unchanged despite our expectation that some customers' work is now likely to shift into 2021. Utilities remain in the early stages of multidecade modernization programs to replace aging gas distribution infrastructure in order to meet regulatory requirements aimed at improving reliability and safety, and expect an improved environment next year. Demand for our pipeline integrity services remained solid during the quarter, and did not experience meaningful impacts from COVID-19. Regulatory requirements continue to encourage our customers to test, inspect, repair, perform maintenance and replace pipeline infrastructure to ensure the safe, reliable and environmentally friendly delivery of energy. Further, permitting challenges for building new pipelines make existing pipeline infrastructure more valuable. Increasing pipeline owners' desire to extend the useful life of existing pipeline assets through integrity initiatives. Due to these dynamics, we expect demand for our pipeline integrity services will continue to grow. Our industrial services offering is diverse, which benefited us during a challenging quarter. Demand for our catalyst services and tank maintenance remained solid in the quarter. However, due to the negative influence of COVID-19 on the demand for refined products, customers' restricted on-site activity for our other services and deferred maintenance and certain turnaround in capital projects to later this year or 2021. Because this work is necessary for the operation of these facilities, we are confident the delayed work will return in the future as economic and market conditions improve. Thus far, our industrial operations are performing consistent with our expectations, and we continue to believe there is opportunity for stability during the balance of the year and improvement in 2021. For the remainder of this segment, portions of our midstream and ancillary services operations experienced softness in the quarter as expected. However, these operations did a good job managing costs to the market environment. And finally, larger pipeline projects continue to face permitting challenges. The Atlantic Coast pipeline, for example. Our larger pipeline project activity this year is not significant. However, we continue to pursue opportunities for 2020 and beyond that would be an additive to this segment and our outlook. For the last several years, we have been focused on increasing and gaining scale in the base business of the segment, and diversifying the services and geographies of the segment to create a more sustainable and consistent operation. To that end, the three primary service lines we have been focused on are gas utility services, pipeline integrity services and industrial services, which account for more than 70% of the segment's estimated 2020 revenues. Further, base business revenues are estimated to account for nearly 90% of the segment revenues this year. Going forward, we expect to continue our focus on growing the base gas utility, pipeline integrity and industrial services business, consistent with our strategy over the last five years, and continue to believe a post-COVID operating environment will offer opportunity for increased margins and returns for the overall segment. We have increased our financial expectations for the year and taken a prudent approach to our outlook. Additionally, we continue to pursue opportunities in the marketplace that are not incorporated into our expectations and remain positive and confident about Quanta's multiyear growth opportunities. Over the past five years, we have executed on our strategy and remain dedicated to growing and enhancing our portfolio of services, which strengthens our ability to capture more of our customers' large programmatic spending programs. These efforts are designed to mitigate risk inherent in our business and prepare for unexpected events through diversification and by maintaining a strong financial profile. We believe Quanta has a long runway ahead of us for generating repeatable and sustainable earnings as we execute on our strategic initiatives. Considering our organic growth opportunities and the levers available to us to allocate future cash flow generation into value-creating opportunities such as stock repurchases, acquisitions and strategic investments and dividends, we believe Quanta has the opportunity to generate meaningful stockholder value over time. To that end, this year, we have repurchased $200 million of our common stock and this morning, we announced that Quanta's Board of Directors has authorized the company to repurchase up to $500 million in shares of its outstanding common stock through June 30, 2023, under a new stock repurchase program. I would also note that over the past six years, we have repurchased approximately $2.4 billion of common stock, which equates to the retirement of more than 40% of the shares outstanding at the start of those repurchases. We believe these actions demonstrate our confidence in Quanta and our commitment to generating value for our stockholders. We are focused on operating the business for the long-term and expect to continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class field leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's base business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's diversity, unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset form the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for all our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his review of our second quarter results and 2020 expectations. Derrick? Good morning. Thank you. Yes. Thanks, Noelle. I think when we talked about Latin America early on. We talked about exiting this year. We're doing that in a prudent manner. We're trying to get that behind us. COVID certainly came in and cost rose. We did some things with contracts to exit earlier. So I do think that the majority of that will be out, and we've guided for that in 2020. As we look forward, I \u2013 we talked about the base business being robust, being able to grow. It were largely intact on the Electric segment throughout the year, even pre-COVID. So our strategy is working. On the P&I side, we saw the light switch effect, some cities down. After that, we are largely intact. Everybody's back to work for the most part. We do have some shift where we're customer interfacing with utilities, so we're going in people's homes. That work has somewhat shift to next year and beyond. So that's a little bit of drag on there and the Canadian work pushed out into next year. But all in all, 90% of the base work, the baseload work, obviously, we added Puerto Rico, which I believe is transformational for the company and a lot of opportunity there into 2021. So in my mind, the company has gotten stronger through this. Our Industrial segment, you can't \u2013 you don't know where the economy is going to go. So the demand on the Industrial segment is certainly there long-term, but it will be predicated around the economy. And we'll continue to evaluate that. But sometimes in these areas of lulls, we're able to gain market share, and we have a really good management team down there. I like our chances to gain market share and come out of this way stronger on the other side. We've never been a company to acquire companies that are struggling. So I think when we look at it, we buy in, in the strength in the \u2013 into our strategy. Our strategy has not changed over the last five years in the way we've deployed capital. Everything is against our stock price and our strategy. So when we look at things, when we're looking at companies, their \u2013 its strength to a region to a strategy. The Chicago company that we bought was \u2013 will allow us to get on the front end of programmatic spends that are ongoing within our service lines as we expand. So that was very strategic to us. We like the company. It's an old historic company that will give us a lot of flexibility on the programmatic spend. That being said, everything is valued against our stock price. We continue to believe our earnings streams and our earnings power is much greater than its value today. It's more consistent, more resilient, and we'll continue to lean into it and drive EPS and EPS growth. Good morning. Yes. I think when we talked about it at the first part of the year and even beyond, you're seeing multi-year T&D spends on CapEx on a go-forward basis. That's still there. It's still prevalent. We're working with our customers and collaborating with them. When you start putting EVs, electric vehicles, in order to enable that, you have to have a very modern grid. And so the modernization thereof and the CapEx that it takes to get there is something that's ongoing on the distribution side of the business, both gas and electric, for stability. As you see more renewables, the interconnections that are required in the amount of transmission and the redundancy within the grid, that's why you're seeing most of our clients have both renewable expansion on the generation side as well as your transmission expansion on the other side. So really, in my mind, whether it's renewables that we're enabling or just the stability of the grid for electric vehicles. Either way, it's necessary to invest in \u2013 for a long period of time. People are talking about 2050 to be carbon-free and things of that nature. In order to do that, the amount of transmission and distribution expenditures to this grid is exponential of what you see today just to give you the flexibility to enable those enhancements. I think it was a unique opportunity in Puerto Rico to collaborate with a great customer, that ATCO, that we have a great relationship with, and both their strengths and our strengths came together along with IEM, our partner there. It will allow us a unique opportunity. In my mind, what we're able to do there is strengthen the people of the island. It's \u2013 for me, it's a social thing because I think at the end of this, we're going to modernize the grid. We're going to stabilize an economy, and people are going to benefit. I mean lights are out every day there for periods of time. And for us, at the end, if we \u2013 when we get through this, I think we'll be able to look back and it will be so meaningful to Quanta, us, ATCO and also the whole industry of what we've done in Puerto Rico. I know we can do it. We don't talk about things. We actually go out there and build things. So it will be unique. And the opportunities on the other side of that is the FEMA money that's coming in, which is $18 billion or, call it, $10 billion, call it $12 billion, whatever it is, it's meaningful on the other side of the contract that I think we'll have an opportunity and I like our chances on work because it \u2013 we do it cost certain, we do things right and economically for the consumer. So as that \u2013 as you see, that's a huge expansion for us. There's other islands. There's other ways that we can participate and collaborate with our customer. We're doing this all the time at \u2013 on different ways to enable technology, to enable EVs, to enable a grid that's sustainable under renewables and things of that nature. So we're around the edges all the time of what you hear about, and I was sitting on a call the other day, and they were talking about all this things around technology. In order to get there, everything that we're doing and everything as a company that we're doing, we're enabling all those things to happen. So in my mind, there'll be all kinds of opportunities for us, and we have a really nice base to grow off of. Yes. Thanks. The margins were impressive. The guys in the field are really operating well under extreme conditions. I've said this before, and I want to make sure I say it again. The electric side of the business will operate in double digits over time. And we'll continue to say that if we operate in 11, we've operated in 9, we'll operate in 12 at times. And so I would just, in my mind, we always think around double digits. That's the way to think about the Electric segment. They did have \u2013 we did have a nice quarter, and I think we're setting up for a nice year here. The telecom is certainly a part of this. And we are making incremental progress there. The opportunities are out there. They're large. We continue to build office, build strength. We added some engineering capabilities in the quarter, which will only help us as we EPC, and we do work in cities and metroplexes. That was extremely important for us to get the engineering in the front end, right on those things. And I \u2013 we've done that through an acquisition. So I'm proud of where we're at. I'm proud of where we sit. We'll only get better as we move forward in the telecom. We have a great industrial business, both on the Hubble side as well as the Stronghold catalyst side that really is \u2013 it gives us a good base to grow off of. The management team's stronghold as well as our management team on the electric side, they're exceptional. They'll take advantage of these opportunities as we see them. We certainly rightsized the business, the G&A aspects of it. We had a record quarter in the first quarter and obviously fell off in the second. But again, we're still profitable. We're still doing well out there. And I think we'll only come out the other side stronger. Good morning, Jamie, I would say, in general, we've made incremental progress on the pipeline side pre-COVID. I \u2013 we were 7%-plus guidance on it early on. And I think that progress is still there. We've done the things right strategically to position the company ex-pipe to go forward at mid- to high-single digits, and that's where it stands. I think our goal is a portfolio, a double-digit EBITDA. We're not there yet. We're working on it. You can see the Electric margins pulling up. I could think you'll continue to see the pipe and the resiliency of the pipe \u2013 pipeline segment, P&I segment go forward. And it's utility-backed, it's industrial-based. And as that goes farther, you'll continue to see those margins rise and then the returns get better there. And as far as \u2013 I'll answer a little bit on the $4. I think when we talked about it last quarter, we stand by now. The opportunity is there. It's opportunity for more than $4. So \u2013 well that's where we're at. It's early. It's June. And it's August now. But we're giving June numbers. So we're not going to give 2021 guidance, but everything you're saying and everything you're inferring. We see the same thing. The company is in very, very good shape, and we're working hard at margins. Thanks. Thanks. I don't know if I said that or Derrick said that. But I \u2013 it's \u2013 I think that's accurate. It's under both. And in our mind, we talked about early on that we were having some \u2013 when we thought about it, we were doing a lot of front-end engineering. And as we went to the field, things would get better, revenues picked up, and that's what you're seeing. We're starting to put people in the field. Our Canadian work strengthened some too in the quarter. So all those things kind of come together. And we'll continue to see those kind of ramps in the business. Not 50% ramps, but it will continue up as we go to the field with construction. There's a lot of opportunity there. We're growing the business quite nicely. And I like the things we're doing. And the acquisitions, really, we talked about this morning certainly enhances the front side of that and then it gives us the ability to move quicker into the field. I'm \u2013 when we look at it, I mean, it's somewhat pulled back. The density \u2013 I mean, 5G is about seven components. But as you think about it, what enables 5G is your communication from your fiber to your cell towers and things of that nature. They need line of sight on the cells, the small cells, whatever it may be. But the fiber backbone and data on the edge, all those things are part of 5G. And every bit of that \u2013 and by the way, it takes quite a bit of power as well to enable those data centers and things of that nature. So we're around the edges on all of it and how we interface with our local electric utilities or \u2013 and gas utilities, along with the telecom and collaborate there on the middle grounds of those things, put us in a great position to enhance our ability to deploy 5G. Yes. We talk to them around all those things. I think in general, hydrogen is something, we talked about batteries a long time. We talked about solar a long time. It continues to be part of a carbon footprint that is environmentally friendly. So those things are all part of it. And I think we're around the edges on all those kind of conversations, whether we build any kind of hydrogen plant or something of those natures. It just depends on what it is. We're going to stay down the middle and do the things that we're very good at, like we've done in the past. And certainly, we'll collaborate on all those kind of opportunities, such as hydrogen, solar, 5G, whatever it may be. We continue to talk to them and try to advance those technologies forward through enabling the grid and also your infrastructure. Yes. Sean, I think when we looked at it, where still many cities are within the COVID environment or different kinds of restrictions. So I think we took a prudent approach to guidance. We said the back half, the fire hardening in the back half of the Electric segment was strengthened, we still believe that. I mean, we're on a storm now in the East Coast. And so under Covid restrictions, where our guys are performing exceptional and so it's very difficult to say what the second half, if there's upside to it. I think we took a nice prudent approach like we do all the time. But we do have some strength there, and we continue to see opportunities with our clients and making sure that either their workforce is at home due to COVID. So we're backfilling and things of that nature. Or we're making sure that their capital budgets and what they see in the future, we're able to deliver on those capital plans. So lots of conversations going on. All in all, I think we gave good prudent guidance as we move forward. Thanks. I'll let Derrick take the margin questions, and I'll jump back in on Peru. As far as Peru goes, we've physically handed over the network at this point. We've done the things administratively that we needed to do to preserve our asset as well as our lawsuit there. We're incrementally more positive about where we're at. It's a long process. We continue to make what I think is the right decisions going forward that will allow us to recoup our investment down there. We'll see where it goes over the next 18 months. Thank you. Look, I don't \u2013 we don't press timing on those things. They just \u2013 again, we take our time. We're looking at them all the time. There's multiple opportunities out there. It depends on what you call large or not. I think when you go back and you look at what we've booked this quarter, as Derrick said in his commentary, $6 billion is not too bad the way I see it and their earnings streams, they're off of it. And we worked on that for 18 months or better. And I would I just say, it's transformational in this company what we did in a quarter through a pandemic and the guys and the teams that have done that and what we'll be able to do on that island is something that will go down and is meaningful for, not only us, but the generations to come. So that being said, the opportunities are there. They're larger. The larger transmission opportunities remain robust. We continue \u2013 I will say this on pipe. It doesn't matter. Large pipe doesn't matter to us. It doesn't matter on this quarter, and it doesn't matter going forward. It's only incremental to anything we talk about. So the big pipe, when I think about it, it's incremental to anything we say. If it's there, we'll pick it up. If it's not, we won't. And it's fine. That's not what this company is built around on the future or today. Yes. I mean, I think for the majority of it, you could have a little bit of linger, but I \u2013 we're hard-pressed to get that done, and we were able to negotiate contracts out. It costs us a little money in the quarter, but it was the right answer for our shareholders, the right answer for Quanta is to move through that, and we were able to do a multitude that within the quarter. Again, we're preserving the asset there in Peru. We're working through the other areas. But in my mind, we're on the other side of that, moving forward very quickly to get out. Yes, thank you. Yes. Thanks, everyone. I \u2013 mainly, I want to thank our employees for the work that they've done in the storm environment. I will say that our business is inherently risky due to COVID. It's even more still. I would say, in general, they've done a great job. We've collaborated great with the client here. And hopefully, we're all picking the lights back on at a pretty rapid pace. So that being said, the industry has made a ton of progress there. And we're proud of that and proud of what our guys have done in the field. We want to thank you, thank our customers, and I appreciate your questions and ongoing interest in Quanta."

            "name": "Derrick Jensen",
            "content": "Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced second quarter 2020 revenues of $2.5 billion. Net income attributable to common stock was $74 million or $0.52 per diluted share and adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure, was $0.74. As expected, our results for the second quarter were affected by the unprecedented economic environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and its compounding impact on the challenging energy market. We experienced significant challenges in certain of our operations that were disrupted by stay-at-home orders or job site access restrictions as well as customers pulling back capital deployment amidst all the uncertainty. However, we were able to successfully execute across the majority of our operations and deliver results that exceeded our estimates. Our Electric Power revenues, excluding Latin America, were $1.8 billion, a 2% increase when compared to the second quarter of 2019. This increase was primarily driven by continued growth from our communications operations, which are included within the Electric Power segment, delivering a 50% increase compared to the second quarter of 2019. Revenues from our electric operations were in line with 2019 levels, a meaningful accomplishment given the COVID-19-related disruptions and reduced levels of West Coast fire hardening activities, which we still expect will accelerate in the second half of 2020. Electric segment margins in 2Q 2020 were 10.3%, and excluding our Latin American operations, segment margins improved 130 basis points to 11.1% versus 9.8% in 2Q 2019. The operating margins reflect strong execution across our operation and improved performance from our Canadian operation due to increased revenue levels and asset utilization. In addition, communications margins continue to improve both against last year and sequentially despite the COVID-related headwinds. As Duke mentioned, we continue to take actions to expedite the wind down and exit of our Latin American operations. The challenges in Latin America have been exacerbated by stringent COVID-19 stay-at-home orders across the region, but particularly in Peru, which is our largest operation. This exceedingly uncertain environment caused us to purposefully accelerate early termination of various contracts to prudently avoid increasing losses due to the lack of customer activity. Additionally, certain MSA contracts had incurred costs to support the multiyear operations that upon contract termination, were no longer recoverable. Of note, we currently receive no tax benefit for losses in Latin America, so the $15 million in losses impacted the quarter by approximately $0.11, $0.08 more than we anticipated. We expected most of the negative impacts from COVID-19 and the challenging energy market to be experienced by our pipeline and industrial segment, and that proved to be the case. Revenues for the segment were $713 million, 35% lower than 2Q 2019. In addition, revenues were also lower compared to last year due to the reduction in contributions from larger pipeline projects. Partially offsetting these declines were increased levels of gas distribution revenues, including approximately $55 million from acquired companies. We expected that these headwinds would challenge P&I segment profitability, potentially resulting in a loss for the second quarter. However, we successfully operated through the challenging conditions and delivered segment margins of 3% and lower than 2Q 2019, but a significant accomplishment given the circumstances based across the segment. This performance was led by solid execution across our base business activities and proactive cost management activities in the field for those operations with significant revenue headwinds. Our total backlog was $13.9 billion at the end of the second quarter, approximately $1.2 billion or 9% higher than 2Q 2019. 12-month backlog of $7.7 billion is a slight increase from both the second quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020. Total backlog decreased from the first quarter, largely due to the removal of the remaining portion of our expected revenues associated with the Atlantic Coast pipeline project. Subsequent to June 30, 2020, project owners, Dominion Energy, Inc. and Duke Energy Corporation announced their intention to forego completion of the pipeline. Although the joint venture in which Quanta is participating has not received a notice of termination, based on the announcement, we have concluded that the revenues related to the original remaining performance obligation associated with the contract are no longer probable, and therefore, are excluded from remaining performance obligations and backlog as of June 30, 2020. As Duke mentioned, we continue to have robust conversations with our customers on multiyear spend programs, extensions of existing multiyear arrangements and new larger project opportunities in both the electric and P&I segments. We expect that as challenges associated with customer engagement normalize, those discussions will finalize and drive the opportunity for record backlog. More importantly, Duke mentioned the second quarter announcement of our LUMA Energy joint venture to operate, maintain and modernize Puerto Rico's electric transmission and distribution grid over the next 15 years. While this business show up in backlog, to the extent that we successfully move through the transition phase to commencement, our expected portion of LUMA's award would represent the largest cumulative contract value ever awarded to Quanta. If you assume our historical electric segment margin profile of 10%, the 15-year award would imply a backlog equivalent of over $6 billion. It is important to appreciate what this award represents as a predictable, sustainable contribution to our future earnings and cash flows as well as the potential opportunities that can arise as LUMA successfully executes against this award. For the second quarter of 2020, we generated free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, of $457 million. Our strong cash flow in 2Q 2020 was partly attributable to reduced levels of working capital requirements resulting from the sequential quarterly decline in revenues. Cash flow levels were also positively impacted by a reduction in days sales outstanding, or DSO, which measured 82 days for the second quarter, a decrease of nine days compared to the second quarter of 2019 and a sequential decline of three days compared to 1Q 2020. The DSO in 2Q 2020 is more in line with our historical average as compared to DSO last year, which were impacted by higher retainage balances due to project timing as well as billing process changes for certain customers that pressured DSO throughout 2019. We also benefited from the deferral of $89 million of tax payments permitted by the Cares Act, $58 million of which was paid in July and the remainder due in equal amounts at the end of 2021 and 2022. We had $530 million of cash at the end of the quarter. As of June 30, 2020, we had total liquidity of approximately $2.1 billion and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as calculated under our senior secured credit agreement of approximately 1.3 times, slightly below our preferred range of 1.5 to 2 times. Turning to our guidance. Similar to where we found ourselves last quarter, we are still dealing with some level of uncertainty as we assess the near-term prospects of our operations, particularly those that are susceptible to local stay-at-home orders, operate in enclosed facilities or depend upon project teams having access to local permitting offices. As COVID-19 cases continue to spread, we have approached our guidance with our typical prudence and a cautious expectation for what the remainder of the year will deliver. Our full year revenue expectations for the Electric Power segment are unchanged, expecting to range between $7.5 billion and $7.7 billion. However, we are increasing full year operating margin expectations to between 9.3% and 9.6%, with Latin America contributing operating losses of $40 million to $45 million. Excluding Latin America losses, margins are now expected to be around 10%, which reflects continued successful project execution, plus the incremental impact of the LUMA joint venture. The LUMA joint venture is accounted for as an equity method investment and therefore, will not contribute to revenues. However, we are including our equity and earnings of LUMA within operating income since LUMA is operationally integral to our operations under accounting guidance as compared to most of our other equity investments that are more positive in nature. LUMA's results are presented after tax and are anticipated to positively contribute to operating income in 2020 by approximately $10 million or $0.06 to $0.07 per share. We also anticipate that LUMA's earnings could be accretive to diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock by approximately $0.25 annually, after the approximately one year transition period with upside opportunity from performance-based incentives. The P&I segment continues to be impacted by COVID-19 and the challenged energy market conditions, and accordingly, we are reducing our full year revenue expectations to range between $3.5 billion and $3.7 billion. Customers have continued to evaluate this environment and have reduced spend expectations for certain smaller capital projects and gas distribution activities. In addition, certain larger pipeline project opportunities have been delayed, and we now expect they will contribute more meaningfully to 2021 results. We have increased our full year operating margin guidance for the P&I segment, which is now expected to range between 4.75% and 5.25%. Of note, with regard to the cancelation of ACP, we have yet to receive a formal termination notice, and we are working with the customers to determine how the project will close out. Although we believe potential upside associated with termination fees and other contract accounting exists, the final contract closeout will not be determined until the timing of project wind down is known, any closeout scopes of work are defined by ACP and then agreed and allocated by the joint venture to Quanta. Relative to seasonality, for both the electric and P&I segments in our current environment, we do not expect significant variability in revenue or operating margins across the third and fourth quarters. As noted in our earnings release this morning, we have increased our full year earnings per share expectations, and now expect GAAP diluted earnings per share of between $2.33 and $2.64. And adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure, of between $3.18 and $3.48. These earnings per share expectations include a loss per share of between $0.28 and $0.31 from our Latin American operations. Turning to cash flow. We are raising our free cash flow guidance for the year to range between $600 million and $800 million. The countercyclical nature of our cash flow was further validated by the strong cash flow for the first half of the year, with aggregate trailing 12-month free cash flow of $1.2 billion. However, we expect the ramp of revenues in the third quarter to increase working capital requirements and drive cash outflows for the quarter, followed by a recovery in the fourth quarter as is typically the case. While we have experiment \u2013 and while we've experienced minimal payment delays related to COVID-19 through the second quarter, we remain cautious about the third and fourth quarters and have raised our DSO expectations through the rest of the year to account for capital preservation actions that may be taken by certain portions of our customer base if economic conditions deteriorate. I'll close my guidance commentary, reiterating the challenge that the combination of COVID-19 and the volatile energy market conditions present for our near-term outlook. Excluding our Latin America operations, we continue to estimate that at least 70% of the change in our 2020 expectations from the beginning of the year can be attributed to COVID-19-related disruptions, with the remaining 30%, largely associated with the residual effects that low oil prices have in our pipeline and industrial customers' capital budgets. Overall, we are pleased with the resilient second quarter performance and are excited about the long-term prospects of our business, particularly what the LUMA opportunity with Puerto Rico represents for Quanta's future and for the people of Puerto Rico. We've continued to maintain a strong balance sheet with the flexibility to pursue opportunistic deployments of capital for M&A and investments as well as returns of capital. Our efforts to return capital to stockholders are further enhanced by the new $500 million share repurchase authorization, which, coupled with the $87 million remaining under our previous program, represents $587 million of aggregate authorizations. We believe the long-term repeatable, sustainable nature of the majority of our earnings streams provide stability to all of our stakeholders and ensures we have the foundation to deliver long-term shareholder value. This concludes our formal presentation, and we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator? Good morning. Yes. It's Derrick, also. I mean, keep in mind, we've talked about it now for quite some time. We saw the ability to have a faster ramp, obviously, and I talk on compartment of our business than in other components. And we stand behind this year of still being able to see telecom revenues at or above $500 million. Yes. From a telecom perspective, we're still looking at revenues probably $500 million to slightly above for 2020 very much intact. On a year-to-date basis, I would tell you, we're probably about halfway there. We're probably in that $250 million range. On margins, we commented that margins are sequentially higher than the first and still had improvement over last year. They're above the mid single-digit range and continuing to improve. We see very much as we exit now through the rest of the year, our margin profile that's increasing. A little bit of COVID dynamic there in the second. So I think otherwise, you would have seen our margins kind of creeping up, I see it even further more in the second, but we still feel very confident in our ability to be that upper single-digit and double-digit by the time we exit the year."

With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Duke Austin, Quanta's President and CEO. Duke?\nEarl Austin, Jr.: Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services first quarter 2020 earnings conference call.  On the call today, I will provide commentary about our first quarter results, the operational steps we are taking to successfully navigate the current environment and resiliency and sustainability of Quanta's customers and business model. Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, will provide a review of our first quarter results and 2020 financial expectations. And then, I will provide additional remarks before we turn it to your questions.  Quanta is operating in an unprecedented health and economic environment with no predeveloped process or playbook to guide us through. This is when [indiscernible 0:03:45] our people who are the very core of Quanta. The tenacity and instincts we have witnessed throughout our operations over the past several weeks has been nothing short of inspiring. We believe our core competency is our ability to safely execute in a challenging environment. Our people work in harsh conditions every day, and we have managed through economic cycles and other challenges throughout our history. While each circumstance is different, our people rising to the occasion is nothing new to Quanta.  We have remained vigilant and have adapted to the unforeseen nature of this pandemic. We have remained committed to our operating and business model and to the successful execution of our objective. We believe our resilient business model and strong financial position provides us with the opportunity to not only navigate through times of uncertainty, like we are experiencing currently, but to come out the other side better positioned.  First and foremost, we remain focused on the health and safety of our employees. We implemented our existing pandemic plan in response to COVID-19 in February to protect our employees in the field and subsequently initiated work-from-home policies where appropriate. We developed our pandemic plan to be comprehensive and are confident it has been effective. We have collaborated with our customers and continue to enhance our plan as we move forward as shelter-in-place orders ease and the density of the general public in proximity to our work areas increase.  At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately 39,500 employees and, to date, have not experienced any meaningful health impacts on the availability of our workforce or key personnel as a result of COVID-19.  Quanta, our customers and the end markets we address are all considered critical infrastructure per government guidelines and are needed to continue to work during periods of community restriction which most states and localities have adhered to. Our proactive steps have not only protected the health and safety of our employees, but have allowed us to provide continuity of service to our customers.  Our services are needed, perhaps more than ever, as tens and millions of people are now working from home and sheltering in place and require reliable electricity, communications, Internet, heating and cooling services.  Our first quarter results were solid and would have put us on track to meet our pre-pandemic 2020 outlook. We ended the quarter with backlog near record levels. We expect record backlog during the year as we renew various master service agreements and secure additional projects, which demonstrates the resiliency of Quanta's business and our favorable positioning going forward.  Demand for our services during the quarter remained high in most service lines tough in the later part of March we began to experience some impacts from COVID-19 and challenges in the energy and industrial market.  Shelter-in-place restrictions in some areas have created disruptions to portions of our operations, particularly in major metro markets, especially those that have been meaningfully impacted by COVID-19. This dynamic has also compounded challenges that the broader energy market is experiencing, which is affecting portions of our Pipeline and Industrial segment. We believe April will prove to be our most challenging month of the year due to shelter-in-place declarations throughout North America and their impacts on our operations in some areas.  However, cities and states are beginning to ease community restrictions. And as a result, we are planning with our customers for the disruptions to our work to moderate. We have been and continue to communicate closely, collaborate with our customers, while we are experiencing some minor permitting delays. We are not experiencing and do not expect to experience significant supply chain disruptions or workforce availability issues. We have proactively implemented certain steps to manage costs, given the uncertain macroenvironment.  Some of the cost management steps we have taken include suspension of hiring and raises at various operations, discretionary spending, non-essential travel and deferral of non-essential capital expenditures. We have also taken tough, but necessary, actions to manage headcount at operations that are facing challenges and uncertainty under the current environment. While we believe Quanta's business will remain resilient and flexible, and we continue to see opportunity for profitable growth going forward, we believe these prudent actions given the circumstances.  We have worked diligently over the past several years to create a more repeatable and sustainable business model. Our portfolio of companies, geographic and services diversity and focus on growing our base business gives us confidence in the resiliency of our business. We estimate 80% to 90% of our revenues are derived from utility, communications and certain pipeline and industrial infrastructure services that we believe will be resilient even in today's environment. The remaining less resilient portion of our revenues, some of which are currently under pressure, could stabilize in the second half of this year, and we believe provide multiyear growth opportunities and reasonable returns. Derrick will provide additional details in his commentary regarding our outlook. Demand for our electric power services remain solid, and we have not seen meaningful reductions in the utility CapEx budgets. Utilities continue to actively deploy capital into their systems to modernize, harden, expand and adapt to current and future needs. Long-time Quanta utility customers across our service offerings are investing tens of billions of dollars to modernize and create sustainable systems for end users over the medium term.  Work on our Watay and East-West Tie Line electric transmission project in Canada is proceeding and to date is not meaningfully impacted by COVID-19. Additionally, throughout our service territories, we continue to actively pursue billions of dollars of larger electric transmission projects, some of which have recently made incremental progress for its final permitting and construction. We are confident we are well positioned for many of these projects. Our communications infrastructure services operation, which are included in Electric Power segment, had a good first quarter with double-digit revenue growth and solid profitability.  Our projects are moving forward with minimal disruption, and we continue to see strong demand for overall fiber densification to reach homes and businesses and the early stages of 5G deployment.  Utilities and electric cooperatives also continue to evaluate opportunities for their involvement in 5G and fiber capacity, and we're actively collaborating with them on solution.  Turning to our Pipeline and Industrial segment. In the first quarter, our gas utility operations performed well in what is seasonally the weakest quarter of the year. Utilities are in the early stages of multi-decade modernization programs to replace aging gas distribution infrastructure to meet regulatory requirements aimed at improving reliability and safety.  However, as shelter-in-place orders were implemented across North America, community restrictions impacted our operations in certain metro markets beginning in the last week of March that continues to date. As a result, we have managed headcount in those markets to match meaningfully reduced utilization rates. However, these restrictions are beginning to lift and our activity and utilizations are gradually increasing as we rehire employees and get back to work. Our industrial and services operations had a record first quarter, driven by broad demand for our services, primarily from refinery customers.  Our core catalyst services are a critical path and necessary for our customers to efficiently refine product. As we entered the second quarter, demand for our catalyst services remains solid. However, due to COVID-19 and challenging overall energy markets, customers began restricting onsite activity for our other services, and deferred maintenance and certain turnaround projects to later this year or 2021.  We believe our industrial services operations will be significantly impacted in the second quarter due to these factors, and we have been implementing initiatives to manage costs to the current environment.  However, we're confident that this delayed work will return in the future as economic and market conditions improve, and we are cautiously optimistic that there is opportunity for stability in the second half of this year.  Certain portions of our midstream ancillary services operations in the United States and Canada began to experience softness in the later part of the first quarter primarily due to challenging energy market conditions, which are amplified by COVID-19 and we have continuing into the second quarter. Quanta has some, but not significant, midstream services exposure to oil-focused areas. At this point, we expect midstream activities in oil-focused areas to be impacted through at least the balance of this year. As a result, we have reduced headcount and are actively implementing cost management initiatives at impacted operations.  On the plus side, we continue to actively pursue billions of dollars of larger pipeline project opportunities, most of which are for natural gas transportation. These larger pipeline projects are needed for long-term transportation of hydrocarbons, are underpinned by long-term commercial agreements with producers and tend to be resilient to the short-term fluctuations in commodity prices. However, permitting and regulatory approvals remain the gating factor for when these larger pipeline projects move forward.  Over the past five years, we have executed on our strategy to mitigate risk inherent in our business and prepare for unexpected events through diversification and maintaining a strong financial profile. We have a diverse, high-quality customer base with low customer concentration, a broad and diverse geographic presence and a diverse and expanding line of services. We believe our diversification strategy, favorable and resilient industry dynamics, and the strategic investments we have made will continue to benefit Quanta during favorable and challenging times and will allow us to continue to serve all our stakeholders.  I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his review of our first quarter results and 2020 expectations. Derrick?\nDerrick Jensen: Thanks, Duke. And good morning, everyone. I'm going to talk briefly about financial highlights of the first quarter and spend more of my prepared remarks discussing the current environment and our forward-looking financial expectations.  Today, we announced first quarter 2020 revenues of $2.8 billion. Net income attributable to common stock was $39 million or $0.26 per diluted share and adjusted diluted earnings per share \u2013 a non-GAAP measure \u2013 was $0.47. From an operational perspective, the first quarter results largely met our expectations. Our Electric Power revenues, excluding Latin America, were $1.8 billion, an 8% increase when compared to the first quarter of 2019, reflecting continued base business strength prior to COVID-related disruption.  Electric segment margins were 7.3%, and excluding Latin American operations, were 8.2%, in line with our previous commentary which anticipated lower margins in 1Q due to seasonality as well as fire hardening activities being weighted toward the second half of the year.  Recall that these fire hardening activities were running at substantial levels throughout every quarter of last year and the back half weighting in 2020 resulted in some level of cost absorption pressure in the first quarter. Our communications operations, which are included in our Electric segment, grew revenues almost 40% compared to the first quarter of 2019 and delivered operating margins in the mid-single digits.  Our Pipeline and Industrial revenues were $1 billion, 13% lower than 1Q 2019 due to an expected reduction in revenues from larger pipeline projects, the contribution from which was $170 million less than 1Q 2019. Partially offsetting this decline were increased levels of base business activity, including approximately $100 million from acquired companies.  Operating margins for the P&I segment were 3.1%, lower than 1Q 2019, but within our range of expectations for the quarter despite having been impacted by adverse weather across our Canadian pipeline operations. The orderly exit of our Latin American operations progressed during the first quarter. However, the $16.3 million of operating losses exceeded our expectations. The losses primarily relate to early termination and closeout costs associated with projects in the region, exacerbated by stringent COVID-19 stay-at-home orders in the second quarter, necessitating a loss recognition on certain projects in 1Q.  We received no tax benefit for losses in Latin America, so the approximately $16 million in losses impacted the quarter by approximately $0.11, $0.04 more than what we had originally anticipated. Our total backlog was $14.7 billion at the end of the first quarter, slightly below year-end, but $2 billion higher than 1Q 2019. 12-month backlog at $7.6 billion is approximately $685 million higher than 1Q 2019. We continue to see opportunities for backlog growth. However, timing of awards for certain customers could be delayed in the current environment. For the first quarter of 2020, we generated free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, of $164 million, which included $82 million of insurance proceeds associated with the settlement of two pipeline project claims, as we mentioned on our last quarter's call.  Days sales outstanding, or DSO, for the quarter was 85 days, a decrease of 3 days compared to the first quarter of 2019 due to lower levels of retainage balances associated with larger projects, but slightly higher than the 81 days at year-end.  We had experienced some administrative impacts throughout the business at the end of March, which has continued into the second quarter due to various stay-at-home dynamics. However, we haven't seen any significant pressure on extending payment terms thus far. Due to volatile capital market conditions in March, as a cautionary measure, we borrowed $250 million against our revolving credit facility to ensure we had adequate access to cash to fund our operations in what was a rapidly changing and unpredictable environment. As a result, we had approximately $380 million of cash at the end of the quarter.  Our net interest expense was slightly higher in the first quarter due to this drawdown and, to a lesser extent, due to the deployment of $200 million for the repurchase of 6 million shares of our common stock during the quarter.  As the capital markets improved and risk associated with daily liquidity requirements moderated, we reduced our cash position substantially by paying off outstanding borrowings on our revolver at the end of April and resumed routine funding of daily cash requirements. From a balance sheet and liquidity perspective, we believe we are well positioned to handle the disruptions to our operations associated with COVID-19 and the challenging energy market environment.  As of March 31, 2020, we had total liquidity of approximately $1.7 billion.  Our debt facilities do not mature until October 31, 2022. And as of March 31, 2020, we had a debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as calculated under our senior secured credit agreement, of approximately 1.7 times, within our preferred range of 1.5 to 2 times and well below the 3 times maximum provided for in our credit facility. At the end of the first quarter, we were comfortably in compliance with all of the financial covenants in our credit facility.  The combination of COVID-19 and the challenging energy market environment represents an unprecedented economic impact in the modern era. However, Quanta successfully navigated through the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 and through the challenging energy market and operating conditions of 2015 and 2016. In both circumstances, Quanta remained solidly profitable, maintained a strong balance sheet, generated solid cash flow, and came out of these periods a stronger and better competitively positioned company. Turning to our guidance. I'll start by saying that our decision to provide guidance and our approach was developed through much internal debate. We concluded that the value of providing a level of meaningful commentary and financial expectations to the investment community outweighed the risk that doing so implies certainty in a very uncertain environment.  Given the circumstances, our outlook commentary should be considered as directional and is meant to be helpful to understand the nature of what we see today. Currently, our expectations for the Electric Power segment remain largely intact. We expect revenues for this segment between $7.5 billion and $7.7 billion and operating margins between 9% and 9.3%, with Latin America contributing operating losses of $25 million to $30 million. Excluding Latin America losses, margins are expected to range between 9.4% and 9.7%.  Certain markets have seen some level of COVID-19 impact to operations in the second quarter, both in our electric and communications services operation, and our slight reduction in annual revenue and margin guidance is largely expected to occur in the second quarter. Annual margins are also somewhat impacted by reductions in electrical work in certain industrial facilities and by slightly higher than previously expected Latin America costs in 1Q and the rest of the year. Having said that, we see the opportunity for this segment to be at or near our double-digit target margins in the third and fourth quarters.  Our largest change in expectations is within our Pipeline and Industrial segment. As opposed to the Electric Power segment, where we've had limited impacts from stay-at-home orders, for the P&I segment, COVID-19 has impacted certain metro markets such as New York, Detroit and Seattle, where despite our services being deemed essential, local governments are restricting and shutting down our work which is creating a material impact. The exacerbating effect of COVID-19 on the challenged energy market is resulting in a meaningful revenue reduction in almost all of our pipeline and industrial services in the second quarter.  Revenues for the second quarter are expected to be as low as $700 million to $800 million, roughly 40% lower than our original expectations, likely resulting in a small operating loss for this segment in the second quarter.  The combined impacts of COVID-19 and the challenged energy market are expected to continue to negatively impact segment margins in our third and fourth quarter. This is particularly true for our industrial services operations as customers are reducing and deferring regularly scheduled maintenance and turnaround activities as a lack of demand for their refined products is pressuring budget. For the remainder of the year, we have assumed a substantial pullback in these areas.  Also, we expect reduced revenue from smaller pipeline and industrial capital projects throughout 2020 to weigh on segment margins as we expect to experience a prolonged effect from the current energy market and its impact on our customers' capital budget.  For the remainder of the year, we see the opportunity for segment revenues to exceed $1 billion in each of the third and fourth quarters and for our margins to range between 6% and 8%. Our annual expectations are for approximately $4 billion of revenues, with operating margins not likely exceeding 5% for the full year of 2020. However, for this to occur, it assumes we have ramped to normal activities early in the third quarter within the metro markets currently impacted by stay-at-home orders and normal activity levels continue for the remainder of the year.  We are aware that investors have at times had difficulty assessing the repeatable and sustainable nature of the Pipeline and Industrial segment, specifically. We believe the complexity of the current landscape only adds to that difficulty. As such, we've attempted to aid investors by providing additional service level detail within this segment in our earnings release and slide presentation, which is viewable through the webcast and is also available on the Investor Relations section of Quanta's website. We've defined these service areas as gas distribution, maintenance and integrity, larger pipeline projects, and other pipeline and industrial infrastructure services. Importantly, the revenue range associated with each area is directional and intended to provide a deeper understanding of the activities performed within this segment, but is not meant to provide a precise view of the revenue expectations by category.  Our expectations for reduced gas distribution revenues and most of the reduced maintenance and integrity revenues are COVID-19 related, either by the previously discussed stay-at-home orders or reduced fuel demand. These services represent the largest component for segment revenues and are the largest component of our base business activity in the segment. We consider these portions of our work as highly resilient and have not changed our confidence in their multiyear repeatable and sustainable contribution.  We think it is valuable to consider that although the COVID-19 dynamic did not exist during the 2015 and 2016 commodity price collapse and we did not own Stronghold at the time, they are our largest provider of industrial maintenance and integrity services today.  During that period, Stronghold was able to grow revenues each year at a double-digit compound annual growth rate and achieved margins within their historical ranges despite the challenging energy market.  We remain comfortable with our expectations to generate approximately $500 million of larger pipeline project revenue in 2020. Although additional project awards are needed to achieve these expectations, we are in advanced discussions with customers on several opportunities that provide us with good visibility. The timing and potential award of these projects is not currently anticipated to be impacted by the economic factors we have discussed.  Our other Pipeline and Industrial revenues represents the portion of the segment that is most impacted by lower oil prices, and therefore, we would consider to be the least resilient. This includes industrial capital projects, midstream work and certain less critical maintenance work. Turning to cash flow. We are maintaining our free cash flow expectations for the year, expecting to generate between $400 million and $600 million. While a reduction of revenue would normally result in increased cash flow due to working capital converting to cash as well as lower levels of capital expenditures, that dynamic is primarily being offset by the expected reduction of earnings due to COVID-19.  Additionally, given the uncertainty across our end markets and the broader economy, we're taking a cautious approach to working capital expectations for the remainder of the year. I'll close my guidance commentary with the belabored point that our expectations are as of today and are based on our ability to ramp to normal levels early in the third quarter. Those and other factors are not within our control and prolonged or reinstituted restrictions on our ability to perform services or the implementation of new restrictions for COVID-19 hotspots that may develop in other metro markets or even at project sites could negatively impact our EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA expectations.  As we described throughout our commentary, the combination of COVID-19 and the incremental pressure that's applied to already unstable oil prices makes it difficult to quantify the distinct impact each of these factors has had on our revised outlook.  That being said, we would estimate at least 70% of the change in our expectations can be attributed to COVID-19 related disruptions, with the remaining 30% largely associated with the residual effects that low oil prices have on our pipeline and industrial customers' capital budget and, to a lesser extent, the increased losses attributable to our Latin American operations. Overall, maintaining a strong balance sheet remains a foundational principle for us as we execute our operational strategies and navigate uncertain market dynamics. Our strong balance sheet has supported our growth, opportunistic deployments of capital and now will be relied upon for resilience through these challenging times.  We see the opportunity for strong cash generation now and in future periods and we will continue to prudently manage our balance sheet and capital deployment to maintain our current strength, provide stability to employees and customers, and to ensure we deliver long-term shareholder value.  I'll turn it back to Duke for closing comments.\nEarl Austin, Jr. : Thanks, Derrick. Though we expect our second quarter results will reflect the near-term disruptions we are experiencing and will be the most challenging quarter of the year, we are optimistic that the activity levels and near-term visibility will improve as community restrictions ease and the economy begins to reopen.  As Derrick discussed, we have taken a prudent approach to our outlook for the year based on what we know today. However, we are pursuing opportunities in the marketplace that are not incorporated into our expectations, but that we believe we are well positioned for. And we are just as positive and confident today about Quanta's multiyear opportunities as we were on our year-end 2019 call just a couple of months ago.  We believe our operating leadership and employees are the best in the business and that we will continue to successfully perform through the current environment. Importantly, we remain focused on the successful execution of five key objectives, which are \u2013 focus and grow our base business; improve margins; create growth platforms through service line expansions in the utility, communications and industrial industries and adjacent industries where craft-skilled labor is critical to providing cost certain solutions; be the industry leader in safety and training by investing in craft-skilled labor; and finally, deploy capital in a disciplined and value-creating manner.  When considering our commentary about the repeatable and sustainable nature of our operations, we believe our adjusted EBITDA before the effects of Latin America operations and COVID-19 on our 2020 expectations continue to trend towards the $1 billion level that we have spoken about the last several years. Quanta was built for times like this, and we are confident in the resiliency and sustainability of our business model. Despite the near-term challenges, we believe Quanta has a long runway for generating repeatable and sustainable earnings ahead of us as we execute on strategic initiatives.  Considering our organic growth opportunities and the levers available to us to allocate future cash flow generation into value-creating opportunities such as stock repurchases, acquisitions and strategic investments in dividends, we believe Quanta has the opportunity to generate meaningful stockholder value over time.  As we have discussed many times in prior investor communications, our people are the heart of Quanta, and it is their hard work and dedication that has produced several years of record results and will be critical to our success going forward. I again want to recognize and thank them for their hard work and dedication during this challenging time. We are focused on operating the business for the long term and expect to continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class field leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's base business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers.  We believe Quanta's diversity, unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset form the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for all of our stakeholders. With that, we're happy to take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Duke, if we look at the breakdown of your expected revenue for 2020, given that gas distribution and maintenance and integrity are now big businesses for you, it appears a little more than half of the revenue hit is expected to come from these businesses despite them being relatively resilient. So, my question is, given the critical nature of this type of work, is this really just pushing this revenue and its relatively high-margin into 2021 and you should get it back or could some of it actually be lost revenue for you guys?\nEarl Austin, Jr.: Yeah. Good morning, Andy. Thanks for the question. I think when you look at our business and you look at that piece of business, what we had is, in the quarter as well as in the year in our guidance, you had the light switch effect of cities closing. And so, when you think about it, when you think about \u2013 just take our New York business, that business, relatively 90% of that work shut down in that area because of the COVID-related impacts. And we worked with the governor, worked with our clients there. That type of work. We had to deal with the customer when you shut gas off and things like that, you're dealing with the customer you're interfacing. So, that type would shut down. What we have seen is that work come back and start to come back. Let's say, it will ramp back. It won't be like on and off. It goes off really quick and you start ramping back. So, that's what you'll see coming back in all the cities. It was not only in New York. It was Seattle, Detroit, others. So, that's the impact there in the quarter. And some of that is not going into the year. So, when you look at the total, it's majority of the second quarter is that when you think about the impact there. So you had that.  You also had lower fuel pricing on oil. And then you had the demand side of that as well, which that's more so what we're seeing in outer quarters. So, the original impact and the demand, and it's about 70% of what we're looking at is COVID-related for our guidance going forward as well as in the quarter, it's the majority of the quarter which is a light switch effect. Derrick can provide some more numbers on it in the guidance. Derrick?\nDerrick Jensen: Yeah. Actually, I want to come back to a part of the question, Andy, on the relatively high margins. I also think it's very important to recognize that these are contribution margin type dynamics, not necessarily the overall margin profile of the work. When you have, as Duke mentioned, a light switch type event on the revenue side, the cost structure doesn't change quite so rapidly. So, the contribution margins become quite high because it's right at the incremental stage. As you deal with costs, holding on to costs because you think you're going to be turning around. And to your point, ramping back up and dealing with work on a more recurring basis in 2021. So, important to recognize it's the contribution margin, not necessarily the margin overall of the work.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Derrick, they can't really cancel this stuff, right? They can just defer it or can they just like a push, an inspection or something like that and not do it, right? It's more deferred than canceled, right?\nEarl Austin, Jr.: Yeah. When you think about our gas \u2013 our LDC business and our gas distribution business which is \u2013 we've given some level of guidance on that, well over $1 billion. That business, we feel, was very resilient. It will be in outer quarters.  This was just the fact that when Governor Cuomo decides to shut down New York, many of you are there, you understand it's shut down the city. And so, in certain cities, we adhere to the policy. We did keep some staff. But I would say, all in all, you won't see that going forward. We put in place PPE, things like that in the future. I believe those things \u2013 those crews and that piece of business will stay resilient even throughout New York. So, yes, deferral.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Yeah. Got it. That's helpful. And then, Duke, you mentioned that you still expect record backlog this year, which means you still have visibility to grow backlog despite the lower oil price and the pandemic. So, maybe you could talk about where the conviction is coming from. You mentioned some bigger MSA renewables. You can give us some more color there. But do you still see good opportunity for large transmission bookings in 2020?  And given you do expect record backlog, it would stand to reason that you don't expect a big hit to your oil and gas backlog. Is that because of the oil sensitivity now, the backlog really is at low levels?\nEarl Austin, Jr.: When you look at the business, we still remain highly optimistic and convicted to our strategy. And that strategy is around the longer-term MSAs that you see on programmatic spends within the oil and gas segment or the P&I segment as well as the Electric segment. We're relatively intact in the Electric segment, which shows you the resiliency there. We've talked about the backdrop of the utility business. And almost all of our clients, 95% of them, their three-year capital budgets or long-term capital budgets have remained intact. You've had some push out maybe to year two versus year one, very little. But we see that business strong. Continue to see great opportunities in the programs there. There's opportunities for larger projects. The larger project piece of our electric transmission business has been robust, the bidding, and so we have not seen any pullback there. We talked about the fire hardening work on the programs being in the later half of the year, we're starting to see signs of that ramping now. So, it's all intact.\nDerrick Jensen: One other way to think about this is that, when you think about kind of from that top-down perspective, we had talked post year-end call throughout that we saw \u2013 roughly, let's say, 10% of our business was kind of commodity-related. And that means that the vast majority of our business is not. And of that commodity-related component that might get impacted because of headwind to oil, we said that we found it very unlikely that roughly that $1 billion levels would go to zero. I think that you can see kind of in some of the numbers we've laid out here now. We've laid out that there is a headwind effect, but there's still a substantial amount of those revenues we think are still yet ongoing. So, there's kind of a somewhat muted revenue effect.  From a backlog perspective, what we'd say is that that component of the business is reasonably quickly book and burn, and so it doesn't represent a significant portion of our overall backlog. So much of our backlog relates to those longer-term perspectives that are more resilient. So that I think maybe colors how we continue to feel about the strength of the backlog as we move forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nJamie Cook: Hi. Good morning. Glad to hear everyone is healthy and well. I guess my first question is short term. To achieve your guidance, what are you expecting in terms of the cadence of easing of shelter-in-place? Like, I'm just trying to understand what you're assuming there and just if you could talk to how bad April was. And then my second question is longer term and it's directed more toward you, Derrick, I guess. I'm just trying to think about normalized EPS for Quanta. Even if I look at the guide today and then I add back what was related to COVID and then I add back the $0.20 or so headwind from LatAm which is one-time, I think it's easy to paint a case that normalized EPS, with the backlog that you're talking about too, is $4, isn't a crazy number to throw out there, Derrick. So, any comments or am I way off base there? Thanks.\nEarl Austin, Jr.: I'll comment too, in generalities. I think when you look at the business, Jamie, we've built a resilient business that we feel like we talked in the script about $1 billion kind of run rate on it from an adjusted EBITDA standpoint. I think you see that. I think we're convicted to those kind of numbers.  Derrick talked about the COVID effect and what it did to the second quarter margins on P&I. So, if you look at that and you think about it and you think about the second half of the year, you get some COVID one-time effect, which is, call it, 70% of the whole revision in guidance. And then, the majority of that 70% is in the second-quarter and it's a one-time effect. So, when you look at that, you're right, the run rate gets back to a more normalized basis and you have a rate base going forward. So, it's a one-time light switch type effect in many ways.  There's some impact on demand. So, there's a demand impact you have out there when oil goes to negative. You just don't know how fast that industrial business ramps back, but we have a really good management team there that will take advantage of some opportunities out there and grow that business even through this, in my mind. So, I'm not concerned. They did it in the past. And they had a record quarter. We have a critical path business there that's our base. So, I'm extremely pleased with where we sit, and we'll come out stronger. But, Derrick, you can comment on the rest.\nDerrick Jensen: I agree with everything you said. And as well as, Jamie, I don't take really exception with your perspective kind of the multi-year. The Latin America, as we called out very explicitly, has no tax benefits. So, those things are fairly pronounced. We clearly don't look at that as being a repeatable, sustainable component of our business. So, the midpoint of our guidance, by definition, as you go forward, would have some level of add-back for Latin America.  When we go through and talk about the adjusted EBITDA, in fact, we did our best effort to quantify how that COVID, very much April, exactly as you called out, very much second quarter in total, call it, roughly 70% of the number. When you start looking at that component being non-recurring and our expectations looking at 2021 and 2022 being regular operations that would add back into that, and you start to really ramp up into the numbers that we're talking about. We would largely consider the headwind we're dealing with right now is kind of on the oil side. And we think we've otherwise shown up in the past our ability to execute through that. So, I don't take exception with your math.\nJamie Cook: Great. Thank you. Stay well.\nEarl Austin, Jr.: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Noelle Dilts with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nNoelle Dilts: Hi. Thanks. Good morning.\nEarl Austin, Jr.: Good morning, Noelle.\nNoelle Dilts: Good morning. For my first question, I was hoping you could expand on the three acquisitions in the quarter. And then, if you look at kind of difficult market conditions, particularly with some challenges on the oil side of the business, I would think that some of the smaller competitors in the market might be under pressure. So, I was curious, as you think about M&A moving forward and the potential for some consolidation in the industry, kind of the markets that you view as most interesting and where you might look to expand. Thanks.\nEarl Austin, Jr.: Yeah. Thanks, Noelle. It was two acquisitions. Two small ones, I think combined, less than $20 million. One was a telecom business in the underground side of the business that we felt regionally that could add value there. And the other was to support some catalyst stuff in the industrial side of the business.  So, two small ones that we believe that the synergies and they support kind of our strategy. I think that's that. What was the other part of it?\nNoelle Dilts: If you look at everything that's going on in the market, COVID and oil, I would think a lot of \u2013 some of your smaller competitors in the market may be under strain. So, where you might look to potentially acquire or expand if you do see some of your smaller competitors come under pressure?\nEarl Austin, Jr.: Yeah. Thanks, Noelle. Yeah. When we look at it, I think we talked about the industrial business was able to grow the last time that you saw this kind of impact. So, I think we have a good opportunity there to organically grow areas. I would say we'll be measured in that approach. We have a real nice business, and so we'll watch it. But all around, you are seeing people start to get nervous about their jobs and things of that nature. So, we'll have opportunities to organically grow. There'll be opportunities for M&A. We'll be selective and smart. Obviously, we'll use our balance sheet like we have in the past, given the backdrop of what we see from a demand side of the virus. So, we'll be measured and conservative as we always are, but I think there will be opportunities when we look at the businesses. And we'll come out stronger, as we said.  I like our chances. I like what we're doing. Our customer base is really looking at big balance sheets and things of that nature. We've done a nice job protecting that. We're collaborating quite a bit on their capital budget.  The one thing that is perplexing is some of the smaller companies have taken loans and things like that. And I don't know the impacts of that. So, it's a little bit of imbalance from that standpoint. So, I don't know what the effects of that will be and how long that will last. But, normally, you would see capitulation in some of the smaller stuff. I don't understand the dynamics of the loans or grants, whatever you may call it at this point.\nNoelle Dilts: Okay. Okay, thanks. And then when you look at the markets that were completely shut down, any chance you have that \u2013 how much those markets represented as a percentage of sales? And then, if you could just comment on how flexible the workforce has been there. If you could comment on \u2013 in a market that's completely shut down, for example, are you holding on to some of your folks in anticipation that those markets are coming back quickly? How do we sort of think about the underutilization element of some of those market shutdowns?\nEarl Austin, Jr.: Yeah. I'll go backwards on it. The people aspect, we have a long-time companies. And I think this really \u2013 you see our portfolio and you see how we run in the field, decentralized, and we're very, very close to our employees as well as our clients and government officials. So, it allows us to stay very vigilant. We can go down and we can ramp back fairly quickly. We self-perform 85% to 90%. I continue to say that's the strength of Quanta, is that self-perform capabilities. We ramp right back. And I think we'll just go at the pace that our customers allow us to start that. It's somewhat of a seasonality effect, in my mind. If you take out COVID, we're starting to see the seasonality kind of where you would ramp back quickly when you shut off for winter. It's similar to that in the pandemic. And we're ramping back in a gradual step in some areas. But as we said, it only affected a certain piece, certain cities, not the majority of the business. The Electric business stayed intact. It is mainly the LDC and some industrial where people took different approaches.  As you've seen on the news, you see how states are opening things like that, our major metro areas where we had concentration in a few places, Seattle, Detroit, Pennsylvania, New York, other areas, it just affected us a little more. And that's the major impact, the majority of the impact in the quarter.\nDerrick Jensen: And, Noelle, it's difficult to quantify that as to what percentage of sales because we do other activities in those business. A great example, in Seattle, we do a lot of electric work up there. We do a lot of electric work in the Midwest. So, quantifying like that is very difficult.  What I would tell you is that, as you look at the supplemental information we provided on gas distribution and maintenance, the pullback there, that's where you'd see kind of that market impact. So, if you saw those markets move, you'd probably see it in our expectations of gas distribution and maintenance [indiscernible 0:50:49] clearly. And it could be, let's just say, revenue-wise comparable to what some of the numbers that you saw in our expectation changed in the supplemental segment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman with D. A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question.\nBrent Thielman: Great. Thank you. Good morning. I actually had a non-COVID question. And, Duke, this is more around the executive order to sort of blacklist certain equipment vendors utilities can use for the grid. Do they have a contingency for that? And I'm just wondering if that might mean anything for Quanta either in the short-term or long term?\nEarl Austin, Jr.: We work with the clients on it. I have not seen \u2013 a lot of the major transformers and some of the communication equipment within your systems come from areas that the government has deemed \u2013 it's on the blacklist, to put it that way. I think for the most part, we've seen the ability to overcome those kind of type orders and move forward. I understand what they're saying at this point. In my mind, we're an American company. We're not really relying on the equipment that they're talking about to progress forward in our workforce. It's really the back -- the front side of it, I guess, what I would say is how the system communicates more so than the actual hardware and things of that nature. So, we're in good shape as it sits today.\nBrent Thielman: Got it. Okay. And then, I guess, as every company is kind of looking at the cost profile these days, I'm just wondering if utilities probably look to tighten belts at least in some areas. Does that potentially accelerate the outsourcing movement? Is that something you saw coming out of the financial crisis? Just curious your thoughts there.\nEarl Austin, Jr.: Every utility is different and every city is different. It just depends on where you're at on your pendulum mark. I think most have really looked at their capital budgets and said, yes, we're going to go forward with it. In the past, a lot of it had to do with demand. What we're seeing for the most part on that side of the business has a lot to do with modernization and things of that nature. It's not contingent on demand. I won't say demand doesn't create some issues for us. But for the most part, a lot of the things that we do and doing is we're shifting to renewables. I don't think that changes. We're not going to see technology stop. Electric vehicles is going to continue to move forward. All the things that we've been doing and been talking about really show up in this time frame even in somewhat depressed type demand. So, I feel good about it, and I feel good about everything we talked about. Our customers continue to talk about the long-term nature of their capital programs, and that's us. And so, we're right there with them, trying to collaborate to get it moving.\nBrent Thielman: Okay, thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Wittmann with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Wittmann: Great. Thanks. I think my first question is probably for Derrick. And, Derrick, I wanted to ask about management of receivables, particularly in the Pipeline and Industrial business. Obviously, this is a business that has historically consumed more working capital than the other businesses and the credit quality of some of those customers has degraded pretty significantly. I was wondering what you're doing today to make sure that you don't get burned on the back end.  And in terms of things that you're putting in the contract, are you shortening terms on collections? Are you expecting prepayments? Anything to that nature to protect shareholders, I'd be curious as to how you're managing that.\nDerrick Jensen: Sure. So, the reality is that \u2013 I think a major portion of your question is how much of that is in this oil-related environment, do we have exposure to things like MLPs and the like. And honestly, the majority of the things that we do still yet is with larger customers with substantial credit profile. So, we do go through and monitor that. We're seeing fairly minimal exposure, as it stands today, associated with anything that is with kind of lower credit quality customers because the nature of our customers are really again back on more of the higher quality dynamics. So, we don't see anything right now. We're not really concerned any more incrementally in pipeline than we were before based upon the backdrop of the quality of those customers.  We're always mindful of our contract terms, and we'll continue to be mindful of as new work comes about, looking at the credit quality. But right now, we have no incremental significant concern.\nAndrew Wittmann: Okay. That's helpful. And then, my follow-up question, I just wanted to ask about the kind of remaining steps to get out of Peru. How much more, I guess, maybe backlog is left to do there to finish up? And how much more capital needs to be extended from you guys at this point?\nEarl Austin, Jr.: Yeah. When we look at it, I think we've sped it up in the quarter. So, we're really driving to get that largely complete this year and be out of LatAm, for that matter. We'll still have some ongoing legal concerns. We're still trying to opportunistically divest some areas and things of that nature. But I would say largely, this year, we'll be out of there and took some steps in the quarter to move it faster, not slower. It's our desire to move that quicker. And some of the COVID impacts, they shut down certain areas that just shut it down. And I'm glad that we had already moved as fast as we had or would have been more impact. It's our desire to certainly move there. And the legal implications there will go on for 18, 24 months. So, that will be going.\nDerrick Jensen: Relative to the additional project demand, we have no sizable things left to do on the individual Peru project. Overall, in Latin America, we do have other operations than just Peru, which is some of the shutdown costs we have.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sean Eastman with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.\nSean Eastman: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. High level one for me to start. I'm just curious what you're seeing from the federal government here just in terms of potential growth opportunities around stimulus measures and just this focus on reshoring of critical supply chains. Any kind of incremental opportunities you guys are seeing there? Anything you'd point out that we should be tracking?\nEarl Austin, Jr.: When we look at what the government has done with liquidity and things of that nature, certainly, we see the ability \u2013 our customers are sustaining their capital. The current administration certainly wants people to work. Manufacturing, all those kind of things that would help with load. I'm not sure what will happen on oil pricing. And we have seen some rebound there. We'll just have to wait and see on that.  But really, it's a demand side. When the airlines get going back and the COVID part of that will create that demand once we get going back in the later half of the year. So, I think just the impacts of them, of the administration putting in liquidity certainly helps all of our clients and our customer base. It remains robust. We haven't seen much change. I think the opportunity is, if we get some infrastructure builds, the ancillary effects of those things certainly help us. Everything that we've seen from them and have discussed with them is to get jobs moving. We self-construct 85% of our business \u2013 90% of our business probably at this point. So, those jobs are great jobs. And I think where we sit is in a really good spot here. So, we'll move that forward as they come out with stimulus packages.\nSean Eastman: Okay. Thanks, Duke. And next one for me is just trying to understand this industrial services piece a little bit better. What do we need to see happen for a recovery in the back half year? I'm just curious what was the driver behind Stronghold's ability to grow revenue through the last energy downturn? Just trying to get a sense for oil price sensitivity on this piece of the business.\nEarl Austin, Jr.: Yeah. When you look at Stronghold, they are critical pieces of the catalyst replacement, things of that nature. Also, our high voltage side of the business, that's necessary. So, those guys continue to stay out there. It allows us a great base to build off of and to do other services. Those smaller guys, they can't stay. We tend to go into more programmatic type arrangements with them on turnarounds and things of that nature. We can be more efficient. We can do a lot more things quicker. So, they really look at time and things of that nature on a go-forward basis. So, we can really come off the strength of really the core and grow it here. It's pretty easy in good times. People don't really look at how their supply chains work. In times like this, people are really looking at how their supply chains work. So, they can become more efficient. We feel like we're in a really good spot there. That's why they grew last time. The second half of the year, we're not losing money there. It's just we don't have the same outlook as we had in the past. Part of it is the unknown. Anytime you're dealing with unknown, we'll take a prudent approach to it, and we did. We'll see where the demand goes in the second half of the year. But it's all based on refining capacity and things of that nature toward airlines, everything. So, when the whole economy shuts, it just creates that. We'll have to see how quickly that comes back in the refining business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Fisher: Thanks very much. Good morning. Just looking out beyond 2020, you talked today about the fire hardening visibility picking up. At this point, do you think you can get that back to the pretty solid 2019 levels that you had when you look at some of the plans from your customers and their spending? And any other thoughts on things like Puerto Rico?\nEarl Austin, Jr.: Yeah. So, hey, Steve. I think when you look at the fire hardening and what we've seen recently in some of the larger customers, we've seen them basically look at their CapEx out. They've either grown their CapEx from what they said last year.  Going forward, I just think the spend has become more utility like. One of our larger customers there is coming out of bankruptcy. I said in the past, on past calls, as they come out, it will be more traditionally and we'll get our crews levelized in the west. So, I think we've done that largely through the first quarter. We've got more levelization there. And we'll ramp to their CapEx budgets that will start in the second half of the year. And that should maintain for the foreseeable future at very heightened levels.  If you think about it, like anything that we have, we can also work more over time. We can do some things in the back half if customers want to move capital budgets into this year or to next. So, we're able to move up and down with that. That was part of what happened last year, had to get a lot of work done very quickly. So, it created a lot of overtime and things like that. You could see those kind of dynamics happen in the back half. We've not built anything like that into guidance.  As far as Puerto Rico, we've said it before, we'll say it again. The opportunity there is significant, and we're highly optimistic that we're in a good spot, and we maintain that. We've maintained our dialogue with Puerto Rico. So, we're optimistic there.  It just shows the breadth of Quanta and all the opportunities that we do have. And we have a really good repeatable service business that would fall in line with that over the long term.\nSteven Fisher: And just a couple of clarifications on some of the guidance items. What will now determine the upper end or lower end of the cash flow range? Is one, you still need that $500 million of pipeline work, when do you expect to book and break ground on that? And then, can you give us where you stand on the utilization of your LDC assets right now relative to where it was at its worst? Thanks.\nEarl Austin, Jr.: Yeah. I think we talked about April being our worst month, and we're starting to see the manhours move the other direction. We're in constant contact with our clients. It will ramp from, call it, now till it stops, sooner rather than later, hopefully, but we'll just have to see how that ramp goes on that piece. It's really basically making sure that the cities and \u2013 protect our employees and also our customers and users. So, that's the main thing, safety. And that concern is something that we'll look at as we move in those cities. And it will be a gradual ramp, somewhat like seasonality. And I'll let Derrick comment on the cash flows.\nDerrick Jensen: Yeah. I think that it's really the growth dynamic. If we end up seeing the back half of the year, Duke just laid out that there were some additional opportunities that were there, that we at the time be prudent on it, to the extent that those opportunities are realized and you see greater levels of whether it be MSA, fire hardening, whether it be the utility dynamics. That would put a draw of working capital. That would be on the low end of free cash flow.  And then, as well as just what happens from rate of pay. We do not see anything currently. But to the extent that as we get out into the third quarter, whatever you could see rate of pay slow for some of our customers, and we've factored some of that in. So, I think that would put us in the low end of our free cash flow.  High ends are kind of the opposite. If the prudency that we've tried to address of that is the rate of pace stays the same, I think you start to see less pressure there, and you start to see a little bit more free cash flow conversion.\nEarl Austin, Jr.: Yeah. We're not concerned with the $500 million. I think from my standpoint, we'll book that. And that's in good shape and it'll start kind of mid second quarter, and you'll see some ramp from there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Please proceed with your question.\nAdam Thalhimer: Hey. Good morning, guys. Congrats on Q1 and thanks for giving guidance.\nEarl Austin, Jr.: Hey. Thanks, Adam.\nAdam Thalhimer: On the first question, I wanted to ask on the electric side, how resilient do you think the CapEx budgets are going to be next couple of quarters?\nEarl Austin, Jr.: They've all maintained pretty much their guidance and gave multiyear. I think the biggest thing that we've continued to try to feed home is, if you look at our customer base, they continue \u2013 it's not this year. They continue to give multi-year guidance. And it's different than it was previously where utilities were more demand-driven and that's based on power plants, things of that nature, new build, new capital. What you have \u2013 why we're confident, why we've been confident on the backdrop of that is most of the work has to do with interconnections of renewables, with grid hardening, with getting ready for electric vehicles, with technology, those kind of things. And that maintains. I think America will maintain that. We want that and it will move forward. And we see it. It's very visible. And every one of them maintains their three-year outlook, four-year outlook on that.  Our telecom business as well is \u2013 I would just say there's opportunities there really as dynamic as anything we have in any service line we have, and we did a nice job in the quarter. And I think you'll see that continue to ramp rapidly.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. And then, I wanted to ask on the \u2013 on Stronghold's business, this isn't a normal economic downturn. So, as the shelter-in-place orders get lifted and miles driven goes up, why wouldn't that business snap back faster?\nEarl Austin, Jr.: We can always take a prudent approach to it. I just can't tell you \u2013 it's basically how fast does airlines get moving, how fast do we move, how fast does the demand come back. It's us being measured about it. And we can't \u2013 turnarounds can push a little bit. They can push into 2021. So, from our standpoint, we're doing the best we can with the shutdown piece or the turnaround piece of the business.  When you look at the Gulf Coast, we refine for the world. It's not just North America. And this refining capacity and where we fit in it is really the hub of the world. So, we have to make sure that the world comes back as well.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Blake Hirschman with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.\nBlake Hirschman: Yeah. Good morning, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just a quick one for me. The free cash flow was real strong. The outlook good as well. It looks like you bought back a lot of stock. Is that going to be the primary kind of use of the free cash flow that you expect to generate this year?\nEarl Austin, Jr.: Yeah. I think when you look at it, we'll be measured with our capital. We'll be measured with our cash. So, we want to make sure that we \u2013 this is unprecedented times. We'll continue to look at it, but I would say with the same discipline that we've had in the past. We do have some strategies around what we're trying to grow and things with our M&A. But there's nothing imminent there. There's nothing that I would say would be large there, and we would also be patient and prudent when we look to deploy on M&A. But, obviously, we leaned into the stock. We felt comfortable doing that in the first quarter. So, we've always kind of had a traditional approach to that. And I don't think that changes other than the fact that we'll be more prudent about it and make sure that the economy comes back and our cash position is in good shape.\nDerrick Jensen: You've seen us, definitely, over the years move opportunistically in the buybacks. And there are times when we've moved opportunistically, we'll move sizably. As we look forward, to the extent there are M&A opportunities, we'll measure those through yet against the burden of how do we think deployment into our \u2013 buying back ourselves work because we always want M&A to be something that ultimately would create more value than buying back our stock, and we will continue to do that. And then, like we've said, we'll be measured against how that plays into the working capital dynamics, making sure we still position ourselves to be able to manage this. But we think multiyear is the repeatable sustainable business with growth.\nBlake Hirschman: All right. That make sense. That's it for me. Thanks.\nEarl Austin, Jr.: Thanks, Blake.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research Capital. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Dudas: Good morning, Kip, Duke, Derrick. First question, maybe you can elaborate a little bit more on your pretty good success you're seeing in comms business with 5G. COVID situation, the new normal, do you think we're going to \u2013 have you seen any evidence or expect to see evidence of ramping up or really pushing some of that work through maybe at a better pace than anticipated going forward?\nEarl Austin, Jr.: We've taken a measured approach to it. We're getting scale in most of our cities that we're in. We have certainly some larger opportunities there. I do think that the amount \u2013 we've certainly changed through this as we look at it and look at the demand of data at home. When you're trying to have conference calls and things of that nature and you have intermittent fee and all those kind of things as everybody uses Zoom and whatever else we're using. I personally haven't got quite there yet, but I'm working on it. And I think you'll continue to see that as we move forward. And the data that's really needed there to get the right kind of interaction between people is the bandwidth that's necessary. Certainly, we've got a long way to go. And we'll continue to do that deployment across the board and we're in current discussions all the time with our clients on that end to build up broadband.\nMichael Dudas: Duke, you've got to get Zoom compliant. It's the 21st century here.\nEarl Austin, Jr.: I hear you.\nMichael Dudas: My follow-up is, as we look towards a 2021 time frame, a normalization hopefully in the economy, in your businesses, can you speak to craft labor access going to change? Obviously, with big unemployment levels, but you still think some of the skilled positions might be relatively in demand. How do you see that playing out? And do you anticipate that maybe gaining some more folks to come to your colleges and get more involved in your business relative to the longer-term view that you have with your client? Thank you.\nEarl Austin, Jr.: It helps us. I think it helps recruiting. And we're looking at young folks getting into the workforce when they see stability. It always helps us. Typically, the oilfields draw out people that would normally come into our businesses. So, if you see some decline in the midstream business and things like that, they tend to move back into more sustainable type businesses, which ours is that. So, it should help us in that area.  But I think we've invested quite a bit there. We continue to get people there. And so, I'm optimistic on our workforce. And the model that we have, it really helps us to be localized in long-standing companies in regional areas. People resonate with a logo that's been there 50, 80, 100 years. They get it. And so, they want to go there to go to work, and it really helps us in this environment.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Alex Rygiel with B. Riley. Please proceed with your question.\nAlex Rygiel: Surprisingly, I don't think I've heard too much talk about Keystone. Could you address your capabilities, availability of crews and equipment, the possible timeline of Keystone and how that can play out as it relates to bid, award, construction opportunities, etc.?\nEarl Austin, Jr.: Yeah. Alex, obviously, it's something we've \u2013 it's been around since 2009. So, we bought rights to fight right there with TransCanada with them. So, we'll stay with them. We obviously are in constant conversations on time frames and things like that with \u2013 we have capacity and we have not baked any of that into the guidance at this point. And I think the logistics piece is kind of moving forward. So we are seeing some signs of life in Keystone. I don't want to get overly optimistic about it, but that's certainly there. I do think it's one of those projects, is a critical project for Canada as you saw Alberta go in and support the Alberta piece of it. So, that's a great sign there in Canada.  So, I'm optimistic about it. It seems in this time frame that we've seen the tougher projects to kind of move forward. And I don't know whether it's because of media or coverage or things of that, but some of our tougher projects have moved forward that I would have thought wouldn't have moved as fast. So, I'm optimistic about it.\nAlex Rygiel: I also want to thank you for taking the hard path of providing guidance. Very helpful here.\nEarl Austin, Jr.: Yeah. Thanks, Alex. Derrick and I debated quite a bit about it. I think it's the right thing to do. So, we'll move forward with it and give you better clarity in second half of the year.\nOperator: Since there are no further questions left in the queue, I would like to pass the floor back over to management for any closing remarks.\nEarl Austin, Jr.: Yeah. First, I want to thank everyone for participating in the call. I can't say enough about our employees, our customer base that we have that have been through many, many times that are tough. And we've made it through the other side together and collaborating. And I think you'll continue to see Quanta do that.  So, thanks for participating with us today and your ongoing interest in Quanta.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. And have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Derrick Jensen",
            "content": "Thanks, Duke. And good morning, everyone. I'm going to talk briefly about financial highlights of the first quarter and spend more of my prepared remarks discussing the current environment and our forward-looking financial expectations.  Today, we announced first quarter 2020 revenues of $2.8 billion. Net income attributable to common stock was $39 million or $0.26 per diluted share and adjusted diluted earnings per share \u2013 a non-GAAP measure \u2013 was $0.47. From an operational perspective, the first quarter results largely met our expectations. Our Electric Power revenues, excluding Latin America, were $1.8 billion, an 8% increase when compared to the first quarter of 2019, reflecting continued base business strength prior to COVID-related disruption.  Electric segment margins were 7.3%, and excluding Latin American operations, were 8.2%, in line with our previous commentary which anticipated lower margins in 1Q due to seasonality as well as fire hardening activities being weighted toward the second half of the year.  Recall that these fire hardening activities were running at substantial levels throughout every quarter of last year and the back half weighting in 2020 resulted in some level of cost absorption pressure in the first quarter. Our communications operations, which are included in our Electric segment, grew revenues almost 40% compared to the first quarter of 2019 and delivered operating margins in the mid-single digits.  Our Pipeline and Industrial revenues were $1 billion, 13% lower than 1Q 2019 due to an expected reduction in revenues from larger pipeline projects, the contribution from which was $170 million less than 1Q 2019. Partially offsetting this decline were increased levels of base business activity, including approximately $100 million from acquired companies.  Operating margins for the P&I segment were 3.1%, lower than 1Q 2019, but within our range of expectations for the quarter despite having been impacted by adverse weather across our Canadian pipeline operations. The orderly exit of our Latin American operations progressed during the first quarter. However, the $16.3 million of operating losses exceeded our expectations. The losses primarily relate to early termination and closeout costs associated with projects in the region, exacerbated by stringent COVID-19 stay-at-home orders in the second quarter, necessitating a loss recognition on certain projects in 1Q.  We received no tax benefit for losses in Latin America, so the approximately $16 million in losses impacted the quarter by approximately $0.11, $0.04 more than what we had originally anticipated. Our total backlog was $14.7 billion at the end of the first quarter, slightly below year-end, but $2 billion higher than 1Q 2019. 12-month backlog at $7.6 billion is approximately $685 million higher than 1Q 2019. We continue to see opportunities for backlog growth. However, timing of awards for certain customers could be delayed in the current environment. For the first quarter of 2020, we generated free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, of $164 million, which included $82 million of insurance proceeds associated with the settlement of two pipeline project claims, as we mentioned on our last quarter's call.  Days sales outstanding, or DSO, for the quarter was 85 days, a decrease of 3 days compared to the first quarter of 2019 due to lower levels of retainage balances associated with larger projects, but slightly higher than the 81 days at year-end.  We had experienced some administrative impacts throughout the business at the end of March, which has continued into the second quarter due to various stay-at-home dynamics. However, we haven't seen any significant pressure on extending payment terms thus far. Due to volatile capital market conditions in March, as a cautionary measure, we borrowed $250 million against our revolving credit facility to ensure we had adequate access to cash to fund our operations in what was a rapidly changing and unpredictable environment. As a result, we had approximately $380 million of cash at the end of the quarter.  Our net interest expense was slightly higher in the first quarter due to this drawdown and, to a lesser extent, due to the deployment of $200 million for the repurchase of 6 million shares of our common stock during the quarter.  As the capital markets improved and risk associated with daily liquidity requirements moderated, we reduced our cash position substantially by paying off outstanding borrowings on our revolver at the end of April and resumed routine funding of daily cash requirements. From a balance sheet and liquidity perspective, we believe we are well positioned to handle the disruptions to our operations associated with COVID-19 and the challenging energy market environment.  As of March 31, 2020, we had total liquidity of approximately $1.7 billion.  Our debt facilities do not mature until October 31, 2022. And as of March 31, 2020, we had a debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as calculated under our senior secured credit agreement, of approximately 1.7 times, within our preferred range of 1.5 to 2 times and well below the 3 times maximum provided for in our credit facility. At the end of the first quarter, we were comfortably in compliance with all of the financial covenants in our credit facility.  The combination of COVID-19 and the challenging energy market environment represents an unprecedented economic impact in the modern era. However, Quanta successfully navigated through the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 and through the challenging energy market and operating conditions of 2015 and 2016. In both circumstances, Quanta remained solidly profitable, maintained a strong balance sheet, generated solid cash flow, and came out of these periods a stronger and better competitively positioned company. Turning to our guidance. I'll start by saying that our decision to provide guidance and our approach was developed through much internal debate. We concluded that the value of providing a level of meaningful commentary and financial expectations to the investment community outweighed the risk that doing so implies certainty in a very uncertain environment.  Given the circumstances, our outlook commentary should be considered as directional and is meant to be helpful to understand the nature of what we see today. Currently, our expectations for the Electric Power segment remain largely intact. We expect revenues for this segment between $7.5 billion and $7.7 billion and operating margins between 9% and 9.3%, with Latin America contributing operating losses of $25 million to $30 million. Excluding Latin America losses, margins are expected to range between 9.4% and 9.7%.  Certain markets have seen some level of COVID-19 impact to operations in the second quarter, both in our electric and communications services operation, and our slight reduction in annual revenue and margin guidance is largely expected to occur in the second quarter. Annual margins are also somewhat impacted by reductions in electrical work in certain industrial facilities and by slightly higher than previously expected Latin America costs in 1Q and the rest of the year. Having said that, we see the opportunity for this segment to be at or near our double-digit target margins in the third and fourth quarters.  Our largest change in expectations is within our Pipeline and Industrial segment. As opposed to the Electric Power segment, where we've had limited impacts from stay-at-home orders, for the P&I segment, COVID-19 has impacted certain metro markets such as New York, Detroit and Seattle, where despite our services being deemed essential, local governments are restricting and shutting down our work which is creating a material impact. The exacerbating effect of COVID-19 on the challenged energy market is resulting in a meaningful revenue reduction in almost all of our pipeline and industrial services in the second quarter.  Revenues for the second quarter are expected to be as low as $700 million to $800 million, roughly 40% lower than our original expectations, likely resulting in a small operating loss for this segment in the second quarter.  The combined impacts of COVID-19 and the challenged energy market are expected to continue to negatively impact segment margins in our third and fourth quarter. This is particularly true for our industrial services operations as customers are reducing and deferring regularly scheduled maintenance and turnaround activities as a lack of demand for their refined products is pressuring budget. For the remainder of the year, we have assumed a substantial pullback in these areas.  Also, we expect reduced revenue from smaller pipeline and industrial capital projects throughout 2020 to weigh on segment margins as we expect to experience a prolonged effect from the current energy market and its impact on our customers' capital budget.  For the remainder of the year, we see the opportunity for segment revenues to exceed $1 billion in each of the third and fourth quarters and for our margins to range between 6% and 8%. Our annual expectations are for approximately $4 billion of revenues, with operating margins not likely exceeding 5% for the full year of 2020. However, for this to occur, it assumes we have ramped to normal activities early in the third quarter within the metro markets currently impacted by stay-at-home orders and normal activity levels continue for the remainder of the year.  We are aware that investors have at times had difficulty assessing the repeatable and sustainable nature of the Pipeline and Industrial segment, specifically. We believe the complexity of the current landscape only adds to that difficulty. As such, we've attempted to aid investors by providing additional service level detail within this segment in our earnings release and slide presentation, which is viewable through the webcast and is also available on the Investor Relations section of Quanta's website. We've defined these service areas as gas distribution, maintenance and integrity, larger pipeline projects, and other pipeline and industrial infrastructure services. Importantly, the revenue range associated with each area is directional and intended to provide a deeper understanding of the activities performed within this segment, but is not meant to provide a precise view of the revenue expectations by category.  Our expectations for reduced gas distribution revenues and most of the reduced maintenance and integrity revenues are COVID-19 related, either by the previously discussed stay-at-home orders or reduced fuel demand. These services represent the largest component for segment revenues and are the largest component of our base business activity in the segment. We consider these portions of our work as highly resilient and have not changed our confidence in their multiyear repeatable and sustainable contribution.  We think it is valuable to consider that although the COVID-19 dynamic did not exist during the 2015 and 2016 commodity price collapse and we did not own Stronghold at the time, they are our largest provider of industrial maintenance and integrity services today.  During that period, Stronghold was able to grow revenues each year at a double-digit compound annual growth rate and achieved margins within their historical ranges despite the challenging energy market.  We remain comfortable with our expectations to generate approximately $500 million of larger pipeline project revenue in 2020. Although additional project awards are needed to achieve these expectations, we are in advanced discussions with customers on several opportunities that provide us with good visibility. The timing and potential award of these projects is not currently anticipated to be impacted by the economic factors we have discussed.  Our other Pipeline and Industrial revenues represents the portion of the segment that is most impacted by lower oil prices, and therefore, we would consider to be the least resilient. This includes industrial capital projects, midstream work and certain less critical maintenance work. Turning to cash flow. We are maintaining our free cash flow expectations for the year, expecting to generate between $400 million and $600 million. While a reduction of revenue would normally result in increased cash flow due to working capital converting to cash as well as lower levels of capital expenditures, that dynamic is primarily being offset by the expected reduction of earnings due to COVID-19.  Additionally, given the uncertainty across our end markets and the broader economy, we're taking a cautious approach to working capital expectations for the remainder of the year. I'll close my guidance commentary with the belabored point that our expectations are as of today and are based on our ability to ramp to normal levels early in the third quarter. Those and other factors are not within our control and prolonged or reinstituted restrictions on our ability to perform services or the implementation of new restrictions for COVID-19 hotspots that may develop in other metro markets or even at project sites could negatively impact our EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA expectations.  As we described throughout our commentary, the combination of COVID-19 and the incremental pressure that's applied to already unstable oil prices makes it difficult to quantify the distinct impact each of these factors has had on our revised outlook.  That being said, we would estimate at least 70% of the change in our expectations can be attributed to COVID-19 related disruptions, with the remaining 30% largely associated with the residual effects that low oil prices have on our pipeline and industrial customers' capital budget and, to a lesser extent, the increased losses attributable to our Latin American operations. Overall, maintaining a strong balance sheet remains a foundational principle for us as we execute our operational strategies and navigate uncertain market dynamics. Our strong balance sheet has supported our growth, opportunistic deployments of capital and now will be relied upon for resilience through these challenging times.  We see the opportunity for strong cash generation now and in future periods and we will continue to prudently manage our balance sheet and capital deployment to maintain our current strength, provide stability to employees and customers, and to ensure we deliver long-term shareholder value.  I'll turn it back to Duke for closing comments. Yeah. Actually, I want to come back to a part of the question, Andy, on the relatively high margins. I also think it's very important to recognize that these are contribution margin type dynamics, not necessarily the overall margin profile of the work. When you have, as Duke mentioned, a light switch type event on the revenue side, the cost structure doesn't change quite so rapidly. So, the contribution margins become quite high because it's right at the incremental stage. As you deal with costs, holding on to costs because you think you're going to be turning around. And to your point, ramping back up and dealing with work on a more recurring basis in 2021. So, important to recognize it's the contribution margin, not necessarily the margin overall of the work. One other way to think about this is that, when you think about kind of from that top-down perspective, we had talked post year-end call throughout that we saw \u2013 roughly, let's say, 10% of our business was kind of commodity-related. And that means that the vast majority of our business is not. And of that commodity-related component that might get impacted because of headwind to oil, we said that we found it very unlikely that roughly that $1 billion levels would go to zero. I think that you can see kind of in some of the numbers we've laid out here now. We've laid out that there is a headwind effect, but there's still a substantial amount of those revenues we think are still yet ongoing. So, there's kind of a somewhat muted revenue effect.  From a backlog perspective, what we'd say is that that component of the business is reasonably quickly book and burn, and so it doesn't represent a significant portion of our overall backlog. So much of our backlog relates to those longer-term perspectives that are more resilient. So that I think maybe colors how we continue to feel about the strength of the backlog as we move forward. I agree with everything you said. And as well as, Jamie, I don't take really exception with your perspective kind of the multi-year. The Latin America, as we called out very explicitly, has no tax benefits. So, those things are fairly pronounced. We clearly don't look at that as being a repeatable, sustainable component of our business. So, the midpoint of our guidance, by definition, as you go forward, would have some level of add-back for Latin America.  When we go through and talk about the adjusted EBITDA, in fact, we did our best effort to quantify how that COVID, very much April, exactly as you called out, very much second quarter in total, call it, roughly 70% of the number. When you start looking at that component being non-recurring and our expectations looking at 2021 and 2022 being regular operations that would add back into that, and you start to really ramp up into the numbers that we're talking about. We would largely consider the headwind we're dealing with right now is kind of on the oil side. And we think we've otherwise shown up in the past our ability to execute through that. So, I don't take exception with your math. And, Noelle, it's difficult to quantify that as to what percentage of sales because we do other activities in those business. A great example, in Seattle, we do a lot of electric work up there. We do a lot of electric work in the Midwest. So, quantifying like that is very difficult.  What I would tell you is that, as you look at the supplemental information we provided on gas distribution and maintenance, the pullback there, that's where you'd see kind of that market impact. So, if you saw those markets move, you'd probably see it in our expectations of gas distribution and maintenance [indiscernible 0:50:49] clearly. And it could be, let's just say, revenue-wise comparable to what some of the numbers that you saw in our expectation changed in the supplemental segment. Sure. So, the reality is that \u2013 I think a major portion of your question is how much of that is in this oil-related environment, do we have exposure to things like MLPs and the like. And honestly, the majority of the things that we do still yet is with larger customers with substantial credit profile. So, we do go through and monitor that. We're seeing fairly minimal exposure, as it stands today, associated with anything that is with kind of lower credit quality customers because the nature of our customers are really again back on more of the higher quality dynamics. So, we don't see anything right now. We're not really concerned any more incrementally in pipeline than we were before based upon the backdrop of the quality of those customers.  We're always mindful of our contract terms, and we'll continue to be mindful of as new work comes about, looking at the credit quality. But right now, we have no incremental significant concern. Relative to the additional project demand, we have no sizable things left to do on the individual Peru project. Overall, in Latin America, we do have other operations than just Peru, which is some of the shutdown costs we have. Yeah. I think that it's really the growth dynamic. If we end up seeing the back half of the year, Duke just laid out that there were some additional opportunities that were there, that we at the time be prudent on it, to the extent that those opportunities are realized and you see greater levels of whether it be MSA, fire hardening, whether it be the utility dynamics. That would put a draw of working capital. That would be on the low end of free cash flow.  And then, as well as just what happens from rate of pay. We do not see anything currently. But to the extent that as we get out into the third quarter, whatever you could see rate of pay slow for some of our customers, and we've factored some of that in. So, I think that would put us in the low end of our free cash flow.  High ends are kind of the opposite. If the prudency that we've tried to address of that is the rate of pace stays the same, I think you start to see less pressure there, and you start to see a little bit more free cash flow conversion. You've seen us, definitely, over the years move opportunistically in the buybacks. And there are times when we've moved opportunistically, we'll move sizably. As we look forward, to the extent there are M&A opportunities, we'll measure those through yet against the burden of how do we think deployment into our \u2013 buying back ourselves work because we always want M&A to be something that ultimately would create more value than buying back our stock, and we will continue to do that. And then, like we've said, we'll be measured against how that plays into the working capital dynamics, making sure we still position ourselves to be able to manage this. But we think multiyear is the repeatable sustainable business with growth."

On the call today, I will provide commentary about our first quarter results, the operational steps we are taking to successfully navigate the current environment and resiliency and sustainability of Quanta's customers and business model. Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, will provide a review of our first quarter results and 2020 financial expectations. And then, I will provide additional remarks before we turn it to your questions.  Quanta is operating in an unprecedented health and economic environment with no predeveloped process or playbook to guide us through. This is when [indiscernible 0:03:45] our people who are the very core of Quanta. The tenacity and instincts we have witnessed throughout our operations over the past several weeks has been nothing short of inspiring. We believe our core competency is our ability to safely execute in a challenging environment. Our people work in harsh conditions every day, and we have managed through economic cycles and other challenges throughout our history. While each circumstance is different, our people rising to the occasion is nothing new to Quanta.  We have remained vigilant and have adapted to the unforeseen nature of this pandemic. We have remained committed to our operating and business model and to the successful execution of our objective. We believe our resilient business model and strong financial position provides us with the opportunity to not only navigate through times of uncertainty, like we are experiencing currently, but to come out the other side better positioned.  First and foremost, we remain focused on the health and safety of our employees. We implemented our existing pandemic plan in response to COVID-19 in February to protect our employees in the field and subsequently initiated work-from-home policies where appropriate. We developed our pandemic plan to be comprehensive and are confident it has been effective. We have collaborated with our customers and continue to enhance our plan as we move forward as shelter-in-place orders ease and the density of the general public in proximity to our work areas increase.  At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately 39,500 employees and, to date, have not experienced any meaningful health impacts on the availability of our workforce or key personnel as a result of COVID-19.  Quanta, our customers and the end markets we address are all considered critical infrastructure per government guidelines and are needed to continue to work during periods of community restriction which most states and localities have adhered to. Our proactive steps have not only protected the health and safety of our employees, but have allowed us to provide continuity of service to our customers.  Our services are needed, perhaps more than ever, as tens and millions of people are now working from home and sheltering in place and require reliable electricity, communications, Internet, heating and cooling services.  Our first quarter results were solid and would have put us on track to meet our pre-pandemic 2020 outlook. We ended the quarter with backlog near record levels. We expect record backlog during the year as we renew various master service agreements and secure additional projects, which demonstrates the resiliency of Quanta's business and our favorable positioning going forward.  Demand for our services during the quarter remained high in most service lines tough in the later part of March we began to experience some impacts from COVID-19 and challenges in the energy and industrial market.  Shelter-in-place restrictions in some areas have created disruptions to portions of our operations, particularly in major metro markets, especially those that have been meaningfully impacted by COVID-19. This dynamic has also compounded challenges that the broader energy market is experiencing, which is affecting portions of our Pipeline and Industrial segment. We believe April will prove to be our most challenging month of the year due to shelter-in-place declarations throughout North America and their impacts on our operations in some areas.  However, cities and states are beginning to ease community restrictions. And as a result, we are planning with our customers for the disruptions to our work to moderate. We have been and continue to communicate closely, collaborate with our customers, while we are experiencing some minor permitting delays. We are not experiencing and do not expect to experience significant supply chain disruptions or workforce availability issues. We have proactively implemented certain steps to manage costs, given the uncertain macroenvironment.  Some of the cost management steps we have taken include suspension of hiring and raises at various operations, discretionary spending, non-essential travel and deferral of non-essential capital expenditures. We have also taken tough, but necessary, actions to manage headcount at operations that are facing challenges and uncertainty under the current environment. While we believe Quanta's business will remain resilient and flexible, and we continue to see opportunity for profitable growth going forward, we believe these prudent actions given the circumstances.  We have worked diligently over the past several years to create a more repeatable and sustainable business model. Our portfolio of companies, geographic and services diversity and focus on growing our base business gives us confidence in the resiliency of our business. We estimate 80% to 90% of our revenues are derived from utility, communications and certain pipeline and industrial infrastructure services that we believe will be resilient even in today's environment. The remaining less resilient portion of our revenues, some of which are currently under pressure, could stabilize in the second half of this year, and we believe provide multiyear growth opportunities and reasonable returns. Derrick will provide additional details in his commentary regarding our outlook. Demand for our electric power services remain solid, and we have not seen meaningful reductions in the utility CapEx budgets. Utilities continue to actively deploy capital into their systems to modernize, harden, expand and adapt to current and future needs. Long-time Quanta utility customers across our service offerings are investing tens of billions of dollars to modernize and create sustainable systems for end users over the medium term.  Work on our Watay and East-West Tie Line electric transmission project in Canada is proceeding and to date is not meaningfully impacted by COVID-19. Additionally, throughout our service territories, we continue to actively pursue billions of dollars of larger electric transmission projects, some of which have recently made incremental progress for its final permitting and construction. We are confident we are well positioned for many of these projects. Our communications infrastructure services operation, which are included in Electric Power segment, had a good first quarter with double-digit revenue growth and solid profitability.  Our projects are moving forward with minimal disruption, and we continue to see strong demand for overall fiber densification to reach homes and businesses and the early stages of 5G deployment.  Utilities and electric cooperatives also continue to evaluate opportunities for their involvement in 5G and fiber capacity, and we're actively collaborating with them on solution.  Turning to our Pipeline and Industrial segment. In the first quarter, our gas utility operations performed well in what is seasonally the weakest quarter of the year. Utilities are in the early stages of multi-decade modernization programs to replace aging gas distribution infrastructure to meet regulatory requirements aimed at improving reliability and safety.  However, as shelter-in-place orders were implemented across North America, community restrictions impacted our operations in certain metro markets beginning in the last week of March that continues to date. As a result, we have managed headcount in those markets to match meaningfully reduced utilization rates. However, these restrictions are beginning to lift and our activity and utilizations are gradually increasing as we rehire employees and get back to work. Our industrial and services operations had a record first quarter, driven by broad demand for our services, primarily from refinery customers.  Our core catalyst services are a critical path and necessary for our customers to efficiently refine product. As we entered the second quarter, demand for our catalyst services remains solid. However, due to COVID-19 and challenging overall energy markets, customers began restricting onsite activity for our other services, and deferred maintenance and certain turnaround projects to later this year or 2021.  We believe our industrial services operations will be significantly impacted in the second quarter due to these factors, and we have been implementing initiatives to manage costs to the current environment.  However, we're confident that this delayed work will return in the future as economic and market conditions improve, and we are cautiously optimistic that there is opportunity for stability in the second half of this year.  Certain portions of our midstream ancillary services operations in the United States and Canada began to experience softness in the later part of the first quarter primarily due to challenging energy market conditions, which are amplified by COVID-19 and we have continuing into the second quarter. Quanta has some, but not significant, midstream services exposure to oil-focused areas. At this point, we expect midstream activities in oil-focused areas to be impacted through at least the balance of this year. As a result, we have reduced headcount and are actively implementing cost management initiatives at impacted operations.  On the plus side, we continue to actively pursue billions of dollars of larger pipeline project opportunities, most of which are for natural gas transportation. These larger pipeline projects are needed for long-term transportation of hydrocarbons, are underpinned by long-term commercial agreements with producers and tend to be resilient to the short-term fluctuations in commodity prices. However, permitting and regulatory approvals remain the gating factor for when these larger pipeline projects move forward.  Over the past five years, we have executed on our strategy to mitigate risk inherent in our business and prepare for unexpected events through diversification and maintaining a strong financial profile. We have a diverse, high-quality customer base with low customer concentration, a broad and diverse geographic presence and a diverse and expanding line of services. We believe our diversification strategy, favorable and resilient industry dynamics, and the strategic investments we have made will continue to benefit Quanta during favorable and challenging times and will allow us to continue to serve all our stakeholders.  I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his review of our first quarter results and 2020 expectations. Derrick? Thanks, Derrick. Though we expect our second quarter results will reflect the near-term disruptions we are experiencing and will be the most challenging quarter of the year, we are optimistic that the activity levels and near-term visibility will improve as community restrictions ease and the economy begins to reopen.  As Derrick discussed, we have taken a prudent approach to our outlook for the year based on what we know today. However, we are pursuing opportunities in the marketplace that are not incorporated into our expectations, but that we believe we are well positioned for. And we are just as positive and confident today about Quanta's multiyear opportunities as we were on our year-end 2019 call just a couple of months ago.  We believe our operating leadership and employees are the best in the business and that we will continue to successfully perform through the current environment. Importantly, we remain focused on the successful execution of five key objectives, which are \u2013 focus and grow our base business; improve margins; create growth platforms through service line expansions in the utility, communications and industrial industries and adjacent industries where craft-skilled labor is critical to providing cost certain solutions; be the industry leader in safety and training by investing in craft-skilled labor; and finally, deploy capital in a disciplined and value-creating manner.  When considering our commentary about the repeatable and sustainable nature of our operations, we believe our adjusted EBITDA before the effects of Latin America operations and COVID-19 on our 2020 expectations continue to trend towards the $1 billion level that we have spoken about the last several years. Quanta was built for times like this, and we are confident in the resiliency and sustainability of our business model. Despite the near-term challenges, we believe Quanta has a long runway for generating repeatable and sustainable earnings ahead of us as we execute on strategic initiatives.  Considering our organic growth opportunities and the levers available to us to allocate future cash flow generation into value-creating opportunities such as stock repurchases, acquisitions and strategic investments in dividends, we believe Quanta has the opportunity to generate meaningful stockholder value over time.  As we have discussed many times in prior investor communications, our people are the heart of Quanta, and it is their hard work and dedication that has produced several years of record results and will be critical to our success going forward. I again want to recognize and thank them for their hard work and dedication during this challenging time. We are focused on operating the business for the long term and expect to continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class field leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's base business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers.  We believe Quanta's diversity, unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset form the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for all of our stakeholders. With that, we're happy to take your questions. Operator? Yeah. Good morning, Andy. Thanks for the question. I think when you look at our business and you look at that piece of business, what we had is, in the quarter as well as in the year in our guidance, you had the light switch effect of cities closing. And so, when you think about it, when you think about \u2013 just take our New York business, that business, relatively 90% of that work shut down in that area because of the COVID-related impacts. And we worked with the governor, worked with our clients there. That type of work. We had to deal with the customer when you shut gas off and things like that, you're dealing with the customer you're interfacing. So, that type would shut down. What we have seen is that work come back and start to come back. Let's say, it will ramp back. It won't be like on and off. It goes off really quick and you start ramping back. So, that's what you'll see coming back in all the cities. It was not only in New York. It was Seattle, Detroit, others. So, that's the impact there in the quarter. And some of that is not going into the year. So, when you look at the total, it's majority of the second quarter is that when you think about the impact there. So you had that.  You also had lower fuel pricing on oil. And then you had the demand side of that as well, which that's more so what we're seeing in outer quarters. So, the original impact and the demand, and it's about 70% of what we're looking at is COVID-related for our guidance going forward as well as in the quarter, it's the majority of the quarter which is a light switch effect. Derrick can provide some more numbers on it in the guidance. Derrick? Yeah. When you think about our gas \u2013 our LDC business and our gas distribution business which is \u2013 we've given some level of guidance on that, well over $1 billion. That business, we feel, was very resilient. It will be in outer quarters.  This was just the fact that when Governor Cuomo decides to shut down New York, many of you are there, you understand it's shut down the city. And so, in certain cities, we adhere to the policy. We did keep some staff. But I would say, all in all, you won't see that going forward. We put in place PPE, things like that in the future. I believe those things \u2013 those crews and that piece of business will stay resilient even throughout New York. So, yes, deferral. When you look at the business, we still remain highly optimistic and convicted to our strategy. And that strategy is around the longer-term MSAs that you see on programmatic spends within the oil and gas segment or the P&I segment as well as the Electric segment. We're relatively intact in the Electric segment, which shows you the resiliency there. We've talked about the backdrop of the utility business. And almost all of our clients, 95% of them, their three-year capital budgets or long-term capital budgets have remained intact. You've had some push out maybe to year two versus year one, very little. But we see that business strong. Continue to see great opportunities in the programs there. There's opportunities for larger projects. The larger project piece of our electric transmission business has been robust, the bidding, and so we have not seen any pullback there. We talked about the fire hardening work on the programs being in the later half of the year, we're starting to see signs of that ramping now. So, it's all intact. I'll comment too, in generalities. I think when you look at the business, Jamie, we've built a resilient business that we feel like we talked in the script about $1 billion kind of run rate on it from an adjusted EBITDA standpoint. I think you see that. I think we're convicted to those kind of numbers.  Derrick talked about the COVID effect and what it did to the second quarter margins on P&I. So, if you look at that and you think about it and you think about the second half of the year, you get some COVID one-time effect, which is, call it, 70% of the whole revision in guidance. And then, the majority of that 70% is in the second-quarter and it's a one-time effect. So, when you look at that, you're right, the run rate gets back to a more normalized basis and you have a rate base going forward. So, it's a one-time light switch type effect in many ways.  There's some impact on demand. So, there's a demand impact you have out there when oil goes to negative. You just don't know how fast that industrial business ramps back, but we have a really good management team there that will take advantage of some opportunities out there and grow that business even through this, in my mind. So, I'm not concerned. They did it in the past. And they had a record quarter. We have a critical path business there that's our base. So, I'm extremely pleased with where we sit, and we'll come out stronger. But, Derrick, you can comment on the rest. Thanks. Good morning, Noelle. Yeah. Thanks, Noelle. It was two acquisitions. Two small ones, I think combined, less than $20 million. One was a telecom business in the underground side of the business that we felt regionally that could add value there. And the other was to support some catalyst stuff in the industrial side of the business.  So, two small ones that we believe that the synergies and they support kind of our strategy. I think that's that. What was the other part of it? Yeah. Thanks, Noelle. Yeah. When we look at it, I think we talked about the industrial business was able to grow the last time that you saw this kind of impact. So, I think we have a good opportunity there to organically grow areas. I would say we'll be measured in that approach. We have a real nice business, and so we'll watch it. But all around, you are seeing people start to get nervous about their jobs and things of that nature. So, we'll have opportunities to organically grow. There'll be opportunities for M&A. We'll be selective and smart. Obviously, we'll use our balance sheet like we have in the past, given the backdrop of what we see from a demand side of the virus. So, we'll be measured and conservative as we always are, but I think there will be opportunities when we look at the businesses. And we'll come out stronger, as we said.  I like our chances. I like what we're doing. Our customer base is really looking at big balance sheets and things of that nature. We've done a nice job protecting that. We're collaborating quite a bit on their capital budget.  The one thing that is perplexing is some of the smaller companies have taken loans and things like that. And I don't know the impacts of that. So, it's a little bit of imbalance from that standpoint. So, I don't know what the effects of that will be and how long that will last. But, normally, you would see capitulation in some of the smaller stuff. I don't understand the dynamics of the loans or grants, whatever you may call it at this point. Yeah. I'll go backwards on it. The people aspect, we have a long-time companies. And I think this really \u2013 you see our portfolio and you see how we run in the field, decentralized, and we're very, very close to our employees as well as our clients and government officials. So, it allows us to stay very vigilant. We can go down and we can ramp back fairly quickly. We self-perform 85% to 90%. I continue to say that's the strength of Quanta, is that self-perform capabilities. We ramp right back. And I think we'll just go at the pace that our customers allow us to start that. It's somewhat of a seasonality effect, in my mind. If you take out COVID, we're starting to see the seasonality kind of where you would ramp back quickly when you shut off for winter. It's similar to that in the pandemic. And we're ramping back in a gradual step in some areas. But as we said, it only affected a certain piece, certain cities, not the majority of the business. The Electric business stayed intact. It is mainly the LDC and some industrial where people took different approaches.  As you've seen on the news, you see how states are opening things like that, our major metro areas where we had concentration in a few places, Seattle, Detroit, Pennsylvania, New York, other areas, it just affected us a little more. And that's the major impact, the majority of the impact in the quarter. We work with the clients on it. I have not seen \u2013 a lot of the major transformers and some of the communication equipment within your systems come from areas that the government has deemed \u2013 it's on the blacklist, to put it that way. I think for the most part, we've seen the ability to overcome those kind of type orders and move forward. I understand what they're saying at this point. In my mind, we're an American company. We're not really relying on the equipment that they're talking about to progress forward in our workforce. It's really the back -- the front side of it, I guess, what I would say is how the system communicates more so than the actual hardware and things of that nature. So, we're in good shape as it sits today. Every utility is different and every city is different. It just depends on where you're at on your pendulum mark. I think most have really looked at their capital budgets and said, yes, we're going to go forward with it. In the past, a lot of it had to do with demand. What we're seeing for the most part on that side of the business has a lot to do with modernization and things of that nature. It's not contingent on demand. I won't say demand doesn't create some issues for us. But for the most part, a lot of the things that we do and doing is we're shifting to renewables. I don't think that changes. We're not going to see technology stop. Electric vehicles is going to continue to move forward. All the things that we've been doing and been talking about really show up in this time frame even in somewhat depressed type demand. So, I feel good about it, and I feel good about everything we talked about. Our customers continue to talk about the long-term nature of their capital programs, and that's us. And so, we're right there with them, trying to collaborate to get it moving. Yeah. When we look at it, I think we've sped it up in the quarter. So, we're really driving to get that largely complete this year and be out of LatAm, for that matter. We'll still have some ongoing legal concerns. We're still trying to opportunistically divest some areas and things of that nature. But I would say largely, this year, we'll be out of there and took some steps in the quarter to move it faster, not slower. It's our desire to move that quicker. And some of the COVID impacts, they shut down certain areas that just shut it down. And I'm glad that we had already moved as fast as we had or would have been more impact. It's our desire to certainly move there. And the legal implications there will go on for 18, 24 months. So, that will be going. When we look at what the government has done with liquidity and things of that nature, certainly, we see the ability \u2013 our customers are sustaining their capital. The current administration certainly wants people to work. Manufacturing, all those kind of things that would help with load. I'm not sure what will happen on oil pricing. And we have seen some rebound there. We'll just have to wait and see on that.  But really, it's a demand side. When the airlines get going back and the COVID part of that will create that demand once we get going back in the later half of the year. So, I think just the impacts of them, of the administration putting in liquidity certainly helps all of our clients and our customer base. It remains robust. We haven't seen much change. I think the opportunity is, if we get some infrastructure builds, the ancillary effects of those things certainly help us. Everything that we've seen from them and have discussed with them is to get jobs moving. We self-construct 85% of our business \u2013 90% of our business probably at this point. So, those jobs are great jobs. And I think where we sit is in a really good spot here. So, we'll move that forward as they come out with stimulus packages. Yeah. When you look at Stronghold, they are critical pieces of the catalyst replacement, things of that nature. Also, our high voltage side of the business, that's necessary. So, those guys continue to stay out there. It allows us a great base to build off of and to do other services. Those smaller guys, they can't stay. We tend to go into more programmatic type arrangements with them on turnarounds and things of that nature. We can be more efficient. We can do a lot more things quicker. So, they really look at time and things of that nature on a go-forward basis. So, we can really come off the strength of really the core and grow it here. It's pretty easy in good times. People don't really look at how their supply chains work. In times like this, people are really looking at how their supply chains work. So, they can become more efficient. We feel like we're in a really good spot there. That's why they grew last time. The second half of the year, we're not losing money there. It's just we don't have the same outlook as we had in the past. Part of it is the unknown. Anytime you're dealing with unknown, we'll take a prudent approach to it, and we did. We'll see where the demand goes in the second half of the year. But it's all based on refining capacity and things of that nature toward airlines, everything. So, when the whole economy shuts, it just creates that. We'll have to see how quickly that comes back in the refining business. Yeah. So, hey, Steve. I think when you look at the fire hardening and what we've seen recently in some of the larger customers, we've seen them basically look at their CapEx out. They've either grown their CapEx from what they said last year.  Going forward, I just think the spend has become more utility like. One of our larger customers there is coming out of bankruptcy. I said in the past, on past calls, as they come out, it will be more traditionally and we'll get our crews levelized in the west. So, I think we've done that largely through the first quarter. We've got more levelization there. And we'll ramp to their CapEx budgets that will start in the second half of the year. And that should maintain for the foreseeable future at very heightened levels.  If you think about it, like anything that we have, we can also work more over time. We can do some things in the back half if customers want to move capital budgets into this year or to next. So, we're able to move up and down with that. That was part of what happened last year, had to get a lot of work done very quickly. So, it created a lot of overtime and things like that. You could see those kind of dynamics happen in the back half. We've not built anything like that into guidance.  As far as Puerto Rico, we've said it before, we'll say it again. The opportunity there is significant, and we're highly optimistic that we're in a good spot, and we maintain that. We've maintained our dialogue with Puerto Rico. So, we're optimistic there.  It just shows the breadth of Quanta and all the opportunities that we do have. And we have a really good repeatable service business that would fall in line with that over the long term. Yeah. I think we talked about April being our worst month, and we're starting to see the manhours move the other direction. We're in constant contact with our clients. It will ramp from, call it, now till it stops, sooner rather than later, hopefully, but we'll just have to see how that ramp goes on that piece. It's really basically making sure that the cities and \u2013 protect our employees and also our customers and users. So, that's the main thing, safety. And that concern is something that we'll look at as we move in those cities. And it will be a gradual ramp, somewhat like seasonality. And I'll let Derrick comment on the cash flows. Yeah. We're not concerned with the $500 million. I think from my standpoint, we'll book that. And that's in good shape and it'll start kind of mid second quarter, and you'll see some ramp from there. Hey. Thanks, Adam. They've all maintained pretty much their guidance and gave multiyear. I think the biggest thing that we've continued to try to feed home is, if you look at our customer base, they continue \u2013 it's not this year. They continue to give multi-year guidance. And it's different than it was previously where utilities were more demand-driven and that's based on power plants, things of that nature, new build, new capital. What you have \u2013 why we're confident, why we've been confident on the backdrop of that is most of the work has to do with interconnections of renewables, with grid hardening, with getting ready for electric vehicles, with technology, those kind of things. And that maintains. I think America will maintain that. We want that and it will move forward. And we see it. It's very visible. And every one of them maintains their three-year outlook, four-year outlook on that.  Our telecom business as well is \u2013 I would just say there's opportunities there really as dynamic as anything we have in any service line we have, and we did a nice job in the quarter. And I think you'll see that continue to ramp rapidly. We can always take a prudent approach to it. I just can't tell you \u2013 it's basically how fast does airlines get moving, how fast do we move, how fast does the demand come back. It's us being measured about it. And we can't \u2013 turnarounds can push a little bit. They can push into 2021. So, from our standpoint, we're doing the best we can with the shutdown piece or the turnaround piece of the business.  When you look at the Gulf Coast, we refine for the world. It's not just North America. And this refining capacity and where we fit in it is really the hub of the world. So, we have to make sure that the world comes back as well. Yeah. I think when you look at it, we'll be measured with our capital. We'll be measured with our cash. So, we want to make sure that we \u2013 this is unprecedented times. We'll continue to look at it, but I would say with the same discipline that we've had in the past. We do have some strategies around what we're trying to grow and things with our M&A. But there's nothing imminent there. There's nothing that I would say would be large there, and we would also be patient and prudent when we look to deploy on M&A. But, obviously, we leaned into the stock. We felt comfortable doing that in the first quarter. So, we've always kind of had a traditional approach to that. And I don't think that changes other than the fact that we'll be more prudent about it and make sure that the economy comes back and our cash position is in good shape. Thanks, Blake. We've taken a measured approach to it. We're getting scale in most of our cities that we're in. We have certainly some larger opportunities there. I do think that the amount \u2013 we've certainly changed through this as we look at it and look at the demand of data at home. When you're trying to have conference calls and things of that nature and you have intermittent fee and all those kind of things as everybody uses Zoom and whatever else we're using. I personally haven't got quite there yet, but I'm working on it. And I think you'll continue to see that as we move forward. And the data that's really needed there to get the right kind of interaction between people is the bandwidth that's necessary. Certainly, we've got a long way to go. And we'll continue to do that deployment across the board and we're in current discussions all the time with our clients on that end to build up broadband. I hear you. It helps us. I think it helps recruiting. And we're looking at young folks getting into the workforce when they see stability. It always helps us. Typically, the oilfields draw out people that would normally come into our businesses. So, if you see some decline in the midstream business and things like that, they tend to move back into more sustainable type businesses, which ours is that. So, it should help us in that area.  But I think we've invested quite a bit there. We continue to get people there. And so, I'm optimistic on our workforce. And the model that we have, it really helps us to be localized in long-standing companies in regional areas. People resonate with a logo that's been there 50, 80, 100 years. They get it. And so, they want to go there to go to work, and it really helps us in this environment. Yeah. Alex, obviously, it's something we've \u2013 it's been around since 2009. So, we bought rights to fight right there with TransCanada with them. So, we'll stay with them. We obviously are in constant conversations on time frames and things like that with \u2013 we have capacity and we have not baked any of that into the guidance at this point. And I think the logistics piece is kind of moving forward. So we are seeing some signs of life in Keystone. I don't want to get overly optimistic about it, but that's certainly there. I do think it's one of those projects, is a critical project for Canada as you saw Alberta go in and support the Alberta piece of it. So, that's a great sign there in Canada.  So, I'm optimistic about it. It seems in this time frame that we've seen the tougher projects to kind of move forward. And I don't know whether it's because of media or coverage or things of that, but some of our tougher projects have moved forward that I would have thought wouldn't have moved as fast. So, I'm optimistic about it. Yeah. Thanks, Alex. Derrick and I debated quite a bit about it. I think it's the right thing to do. So, we'll move forward with it and give you better clarity in second half of the year. Yeah. First, I want to thank everyone for participating in the call. I can't say enough about our employees, our customer base that we have that have been through many, many times that are tough. And we've made it through the other side together and collaborating.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings conference call. On the call today, I will provide operational and strategic commentary and will then turn it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a review of our fourth quarter results and full year 2022 financial expectations. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions. This morning, we reported strong fourth quarter results, which complete another year of solid, safe execution, profitable growth. These results were built off a strong operational and financial platform and we believe demonstrates the dedication of the best employees in the industry.  Our portfolio of companies, diversity of service lines and field leadership has allowed us to endure the uncertainties and challenges presented by the global pandemic over the past couple of years while still delivering four consecutive years of record adjusted EBITDA and five consecutive years of record adjusted earnings per share. We accomplished a great deal in 2021 through the successful implementation of our strategic initiatives, and our past success positions us well for the future. We remain focused on continuing to provide collaborative solutions to our customers and business partners to help them achieve their goals and to capitalize on opportunities to enable the energy transition that is unfolding. Here are some of our accomplishments in 2021. We continue to advance our front-end solution strategy both organically and through acquisitions, which is focused on strengthening our design, engineering, permitting, environmental and program management capabilities. This strategy allows us to expand our solutions to our customers, enhances risk management and increases our total addressable market.  We expanded our emergency response capabilities and generated another year of record revenues by supporting our customers' efforts to restore power to millions of people adversely impacted by several severe weather events during the year. Our ability to quickly mobilize significant resources to support our customers in times of need is unmatched in our industry. LUMA Energy, our joint venture with ATCO, successfully transitioned to managing Puerto Rico's more than 18,000-mile electric transmission and distribution systems. Though many years of challenges and work were made, LUMA has made significant progress in improving customer service, response times, customer communication and system reliability. We continue to believe this opportunity is transformative for Quanta and the people of Puerto Rico and remain committed to supporting LUMA's mission to provide reliable electricity while building a modern and sustainable transmission and distribution system. In support of our commitment to the people of Puerto Rico, we, along with ATCO, bundled and commenced the LUMA College for Technical Training in Puerto Rico, and the first class of electric utility line workers graduated in October. Since opening the college, which is supported by Northwest Lineman College, hundreds of workers from LUMA have received additional training with the support of Quanta. We are proud of our commitment to the advancement of craft-skilled workforce in Puerto Rico. We grew our communications services revenue by approximately 25% and ended the year with record communications total backlog of approximately $1.3 billion. We also developed and rolled out wireless infrastructure solutions to strengthen our opportunities to capitalize on 5G network deployment and ongoing enhancement of 4G wireless networks. We expect to profitably grow the business and are booking incremental wireless revenue. We completed the acquisition of Blattner, a premier utility-scale renewable energy infrastructure solutions provider in North America with decades of experience and strong safety culture. This is Quanta's largest acquisition to date, and we believe it positions Quanta to be a leader in the energy transition and transforms our ability to collaborate early with our customers on their energy transition strategies. The integration of Blattner is going well, and we have increasing confidence in our ability to create meaningful growth and cost synergies together over time. We made meaningful progress in our initiative to apply certain skill sets and expertise from operations within the Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment to perform certain aspects of electric power and telecom-related work. We believe the resource expansion and operating leverage we gain through this initiative is a significant opportunity for Quanta to reinforce our self-perform capabilities, improve operating efficiency and profitability and demonstrates the strength of our portfolio approach. In addition to the acquisition of Blattner, we invested approximately $350 million in strategic acquisitions of nine high-quality companies, which primarily support our electric power and front-end service solutions. We believe the acquired companies are additive to our base business, advance our strategic initiatives and enhance our self-perform capabilities, which typically accounts for approximately 80% of our work and are key to providing cost certainty to our customers. We maintained our investment-grade credit rating while issuing $1.5 billion of senior notes and expanded our credit facility to fund the Blattner acquisition, which we believe points to the merits of the transaction, our strong financial profile, the resiliency and sustainability of our business model and positive multiyear outlook. We demonstrated our commitment to stockholder value and our confidence in Quanta's financial strength and continued growth opportunities through the repurchase of approximately $64 million of common stock and a 20% increase of our dividend. And finally, we continue to increase our efforts and dedicate resources toward implementing sustainable business practices throughout the organization and to improve the data we capture to manage our operations' sustainability and better communicate our ESG impact and initiatives to our stakeholders. It is easy to take for granted the reliability of the power grid, access to abundant sources of affordable energy and internet connectivity for commerce and entertainment. The impact of a hurricane, winter storm, wildfire or other events that shut off power affects our ability to heat or cool our homes and disrupts our quality of life, quickly changes this perspective and highlights how critical the infrastructure that we design, build and maintain is to our everyday well-being. The solutions Quanta provide support our customers' efforts to increase reliability, safety, efficiency and connectivity, all of which have a favorable environmental and social impact. Additionally, our services are at the forefront of providing the infrastructure solutions necessary to enable the energy transition and the adoption of new technology. As a result, we believe our business is levered to favorable and sustainable long-term trends. Demand for grid modernization, system hardening, electric vehicle charging, infrastructure and renewable energy interconnection services is robust and we believe will remain so for the foreseeable future. This activity drove our electric power results and backlog strength during 2021, primarily through significant multiyear master service agreements with utilities. Further, we believe we are in the early stages of utilities' undergrounding transmission and distribution lines to protect them from the effects of severe weather events and wildfires. For example, several utilities in the Western United States are planning to invest tens of billions of dollars in the aggregate to underground thousands of miles of electric power lines in high fire-threat areas. Electric utilities in other areas of the country are pursuing initiatives to underground critical infrastructure. Examples include electric transmission projects in the Northeast, distribution circuits along the coastlines and electric transmission line projects for offshore wind generation. Many of these initiatives are part of the large-scale multiyear storm hardening programs. We also believe North America is at an inflection point for significant investment in electric vehicle-related infrastructure, including charging infrastructure and the electric distribution system upgrades necessary to support the anticipated increase in the adoption of electric cars, trucks and commercial fleet vehicles in the coming years. Quanta continues its work with multiple leading electrical vehicle charging companies and utilities to build out infrastructure necessary to make fast, affordable charging possible in numerous states across the country. Quanta is presently working on the rollout of hundreds of charging stations. In many of these locations, Quanta is serving as the program manager, providing a full suite of engineering, development and construction services. With our scope and scale and turnkey program management capabilities, we are pursuing additional EV charging program management opportunities with other charging infrastructure companies, automakers and utilities. Our communications operations, which are within the electric power segment, grew revenues and backlog nicely in 2021, but our profitability levels did not achieve our goals. We are working constructively with our customers on certain items that have impacted profitability and believe these issues are approaching resolution. With the exception of these issues, the remainder of the communications operations are operating close to our target margin profile for the year. The demand for our communication services remains high, and we expect double-digit revenue growth and a return to upper single-digit operating income margin for our communications operations in 2022. With the addition of Blattner to our portfolio, we have begun reporting through three segments by adding a new Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions segment. This platform consists of services and solutions for infrastructure supporting the delivery of renewable energy, including renewable generation, electric transmission, substations and battery storage with Blattner's operations representing the majority of those solutions.  We are strategically positioned to collaborate with our customers to lead North America's energy transition and capitalize on the growing and significant amount of expenditure expected to be invested in renewable generation and related infrastructure as part of these efforts. Renewable developers and utilities are leading the effort to reduce carbon emissions, many with carbon-neutral commitments through aggressive efforts to expand their renewable generation portfolios and implement new technologies for current and future needs. Achieving their goals will also require substantial incremental investment in transmission and substation infrastructure to interconnect new renewable generation facilities to the power grid and to ensure grid reliability due to the significant increase of intermittent power added to the system. For example, we highlighted in our earnings release this morning our recent selection to build more than 400 miles of high-voltage electric transmission across several states for our customer in the Western United States. This project is designed to improve operational flexibility in conjunction with future generation resources, including renewable energy to meet the load growth and provide increased reliability. Also of note, this is the largest electric transmission line contract ever awarded to Quanta in the United States. Over the near and longer term, we believe substantial load growth, public policy and the overall positive sentiment supporting a greener environment will continue to drive North America's power generation mix increasingly towards renewables. Quanta's utility-scale renewable generation solutions, coupled with Quanta's existing holistic grid solutions, creates a unique value proposition and opportunity to collaborate with our customers to shape their energy transition initiatives. We are increasingly confident in the gross synergy opportunities we have with the addition of Blattner, and to that end, believe we have only scratched the surface on what is possible. Our Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment faced challenges last year, primarily due to circumstances outside of our control, such as impacts from the global pandemic, work disruptions along the Gulf Coast due to hurricane and impact on results from a customer bankruptcy.  Despite these challenges, our operations persevered in our gas utility and pipeline integrity operations performed well. We believe the recovery of certain of our markets and operations have begun. In particular, we expect our industrial services, Canadian and Australian operations to meaningfully improve this year both in revenue and margins.  We expect to continue our focus on growing our gas utility, pipeline integrity and industrial services businesses, consistent with our strategy over the last five years due to the favorable long-term trends driven by safety, reliability and environmental regulations. Looking to the coming years, we believe Quanta has meaningful opportunities with customers in this segment as they increasingly pursue strategies to reduce their carbon footprint and transition their operations and assets towards greener business opportunities. For example, gas utilities are implementing system modernization initiatives to reduce methane emissions and that position them to blend hydrogen into their natural gas flow and certain refiners. Utilities and developers are building renewable natural gas and biofuel processing facilities. We are also actively pursuing sizable carbon sequestration projects. In our earnings release this morning, we provided our 2022 guidance, which we believe demonstrates the strength and sustainability of our business and long-term strategy, favorable end-market trends, our ability to safely execute and our strong and strengthening competitive position in the marketplace. Further, our ongoing investment and commitment to workforce training continues to positively impact our performance and positions us well to capitalize on future opportunities.  Our expectations call for another year of meaningful growth, record revenues, adjusted EBITDA and earnings per share and improved profit margins. Additionally, we see opportunity to achieve new record levels of backlog in 2022. Derrick will provide additional detail about our guidance in his commentary. In summary, the strong performance of our electric power and Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions operations and the contribution of acquisitions during the year yielded record results in 2021 and has given us a leading platform to collaborate with our customers to shape the energy transition. We believe our strategic position in the marketplace remains strong, which has been further enhanced by the acquisition of Blattner, and that we are all well positioned for continued profitable growth over the near and longer term. We continue to make meaningful progress on growing our portfolio of services within each of our units to further leverage our operating results. The recent promotion of Redgie Probst to Chief Operating Officer is intended to support and promote this strategy, and we look forward to continuing to work with him on this important initiative. Considering our organic growth opportunities and the levers available to us to allocate future cash flow generation into value-creating opportunities such as stock repurchases, acquisitions, strategic investments and dividends, we believe Quanta will continue to generate meaningful value for our stakeholders going forward.  We are focused on operating the business for the long term and expect to continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class field leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's base business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's diversity, unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset form the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his review of our fourth quarter and full year results and 2022 expectations. Derrick?\nDerrick Jensen: Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced record quarterly revenues of $3.9 billion for the fourth quarter of 2021. Net income attributable to common stock was $104.8 million or $0.71 per diluted share and adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure, was a record $1.54. Overall, the fourth quarter closed out another exceptional year of operational performance for Quanta. Our fourth quarter results include the introduction of our Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions segment, largely due to the inclusion of Blattner in our operating results beginning in October. At a high level, this segment primarily represents the solutions we're providing associated with interconnection, substation and generation infrastructure directly supporting the delivery of renewable electricity. Historically, these activities were included within our electric segment. However, as the same market forces driving Blattner's growth will drive growth in these related areas, which included the aggregation of these services provided incremental clarity to the investment community. Our reported results exceeded our expectations for the fourth quarter in numerous areas, including revenues, adjusted EBITDA, EPS and adjusted EPS, with revenues and adjusted EBITDA delivering significant growth as compared to last year. I'll cover a few items impacting the quarter. Revenues continued to show significant growth compared to last year, in part due to record emergency storm response revenues, although only slightly above last year's ERS revenues. Additionally, revenues from acquired businesses were approximately $500 million in 4Q '21, the majority of which was attributable to Blattner. Operating margins in the quarter benefited from continued strong execution across our electric operations with margins exceeding 12%. Also contributing were the operating results of our integral unconsolidated affiliates. This primarily relates to the LUMA joint venture, but also includes contributions from a business that provides specialty site preparation and access solutions in which we acquired a 44% interest during the quarter, as we commented on in our third quarter earnings release, and they performed quite well during the quarter.  Partially offsetting those dynamics were our communications operations, which had negative margins during the quarter due to the challenges experienced in certain regions. Specifically, one customer reduced the previously expected scope of work in certain markets, while the requirements to evidence the completion of the work have been subject to multiple changes. Due to the elimination of future scope and associated construction activities, we were required to recognize in the quarter the full cost necessary for the preparation and submission of the modified closeout packages. For two other contracts with another customer, we recognized losses due to ongoing permitting delays, which were substantially hindering production as well as increased cost to meet schedule commitments. These two projects are near completion. Importantly, our remaining aggregate communications operations are operating in the upper single-digit range, giving us the confidence that our longer-term margin profiles are achievable. Our previous guidance included expected contributions from transactions made in 3Q '21 and 4Q '21 through the date of our November earnings release of between $40 million and $60 millions of adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure. Ultimately, our fourth quarter results included contributions towards the higher end of this range. We recognized an incremental $8.1 million provision for credit loss or $0.04 per diluted share related to outstanding receivables owed by Line 3 refining that declared bankruptcy in July 2021 as we do not anticipate the receipt of any funds through the bankruptcy proceeding. We no longer have any exposure related to receivables owed from this customer. Operating margin in 4Q '21 was negatively impacted by $146 million associated with amortization, deal costs and fair market value adjustments to earn-out liabilities, a combined 370 basis point impact, compared to $28 million of comparable costs and approximately 100 basis point impact in 4Q '20.  Also of note, the tax expense and effective rate for the fourth quarter and full year of 2021 were significantly lower than our previous guidance. This reduction was largely driven by the favorable IRS clarification on per diem deductions for 2021 and the reversal of certain reserves for uncertain tax positions upon expiration of certain statutes of limitations. Our total backlog was $19.3 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, another record level. $1.6 billion of the backlog is attributable to fourth quarter acquisitions, the majority of which was from Blattner. But excluding those contributions, total backlog were still up over $600 million compared to 3Q '21.  12-month backlog of $11.3 billion includes close to $1.5 billion of acquired backlog, but excluding those contributions still represents record 12-month backlog on an organic basis. We believe these increases continue to reinforce the repeatable and sustainable nature of the largest portion of our revenues and earnings and the demand for our industry-leading infrastructure solutions. For the fourth quarter of 2021, we generated free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, of $111 million, resulting in $246 million of free cash flow for the year. Our previous expectations of $350 million to $500 million of free cash flow for the year excluded significant change-in-control-related disbursements associated with acquired liabilities during the quarter associated with the Blattner transaction, which aggregated to $72 million and are required to be treated as operating cash outflow items in our GAAP calculation. We also took the opportunity in the fourth quarter of 2021 to accelerate the opportunistic and strategic procurement of around $50 million of equipment. Given the ongoing supply chain challenges in the equipment and vehicle markets, we felt it was the right long-term action to take to support the ongoing needs of our operations. Days sales outstanding, or DSO, measured 80 days for the fourth quarter, which is a reduction of nine days compared to the third quarter of 2021 and three days compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. The decreases were primarily due to the favorable impact of the acquisition of Blattner, which typically has lower DSO in certain of our other larger operating companies.  This positive impact was partially offset by continued elevated working capital requirements associated with two larger Canadian transmission projects driving an increase in contract assets, which we've discussed in prior quarters. Both projects have been impacted by work stoppage protocols in Canada associated with COVID mitigation as well as delays attributable to, among other things, wildfires' impact access to work sites. Discussions with both customers regarding change orders associated with these increased costs are ongoing, with multiple change orders already approved. The remaining amounts are being pursued in the normal course. We had total liquidity of $2.1 billion at year-end and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.3 as calculated under our credit agreement. While our leverage profile remains above our target range due to the acquisition financing, as we stated in prior calls, we expect to efficiently delever over the following quarters while continuing to create shareholder value through our dividend and repurchase programs as well as strategic acquisitions. To that end, during the fourth quarter, in addition to the three transactions we announced during our last earnings release, we acquired four additional businesses for a total combined consideration of approximately $230 million. These four acquisitions all closed late in December and other than incremental deal costs were immaterial to our 4Q results. Turning to guidance. First, forecasting and providing specific commentary on the classification of uncommitted revenues between electric power versus renewables can be challenging. Accordingly, it's possible that as we progress through the year and gain more visibility into the nature of the work we'll be performing, there could be movements outside these initial segment ranges simply due to the type of infrastructure our activities will be supporting.  As Duke commented, we deliver our portfolio of services, and we are comfortable with our aggregate expectations. Additionally, by following seasonality commentary addresses our expectations for 2022 as compared to our recast quarterly results for 2021, which align prior reported numbers to our new segmentation. And these 2021 recasted segment numbers have been included in today's earnings release. As it relates to the electric power segment specifically, we see 2022 revenues ranging between $8.2 billion and $8.3 billion. Our base business continues to lead the growth in the segment driven primarily by North American utilities outsourcing activities required to replace, rebuild and upgrade existing infrastructure.  Notably, these growth expectations are tempered by reduced storm revenues, $250 million of which are included in our current expectations compared to over $450 million in 2021. Additionally, revenue contributions from larger electric projects are forecasted to be around $200 million lower in 2022 as we expect to reach substantial completion on one of our larger Canadian projects in the first quarter. Included within the segment are our communications operations, which we expect to grow double digits over 2021 levels to around $750 million of revenue in 2022. While we expect 2022 operating margins for the electric power segment to range between 10.7% and 11.3%, which includes contributions of between $45 million and $50 millions of earnings from our integral unconsolidated affiliates, the largest portion of which relates to the LUMA joint venture in Puerto Rico. 2021 represented another exceptional year for our electric operations, and our margin profile was again above our historical norms and our original expectations due in part to the record emergency restoration service revenues. Our 2022 expectations for margins for the segment remain elevated but are more consistent with historical averages and are tempered by normalized storm revenues as well as our communications operations, which are expected to operate in the upper single digits in 2022. As is typically the case, we expect that first quarter operating margins will be the lowest for the year, likely around 10%, with margins increasing into the second and third quarters and then slightly declining in the fourth quarter. The Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions segment full year revenues are expected to range between $3.8 billion and $4 billion, with the largest portion of the growth due to the acquisition of Blattner. As it relates to Blattner, we remain confident in the initial range of expectations for 2022 included in the September deal announcement. From a revenue seasonality perspective in 2022, we expect segment revenues to be between $900 million and $950 million in the first quarter, then growing sequentially into the third quarter with a slight decline in the fourth quarter. We expect 2022 operating margins for the renewable energy segment to be around 9% for the year, translating into double-digit EBITDA margins, which is what we would expect from the segment. Due to the slightly higher project-oriented nature of this segment, margins will be more variable on a quarterly basis. As it stands today, similar to our other segments, we expect margins for the first quarter to be the lowest for the year, likely around 8%. Margins, therefore, have the opportunity to strengthen in subsequent quarters as volumes increase and we successfully execute through individual project contingencies throughout the year. The Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment has been heavily impacted by the uncertainties in the energy market and economy caused by COVID-19. However, we expect far fewer headwinds in 2022. We are currently anticipating double-digit revenue growth of off of 2021, with full year revenues expected to range between $4 billion and $4.2 billion. This growth is expected to be led by our industrial, Canadian and Australian operations, each of which has dealt with significant challenges associated with COVID-related impacts for the last two years. Additionally, our gas utility business continues to see nice year-over-year growth opportunities. Operating margins are expected to improve meaningfully in 2022. We see segment margins ranging between 6.5% and 7.5%, led primarily by recovery from our industrial and Canadian operations. Consistent with years past, our first quarter traditionally has lower activity in the segment due to weather seasonality, which impacts our revenues and precious margins to slightly below mid-single digits. However, we expect solid improvement into the second and third quarters with a seasonal decline in the fourth quarter. The number and size of acquisitions in 2021 will significantly change the magnitude of amortization, acquisition and integration costs and certain other corporate and unallocated costs as well as the quarter-to-quarter timing of these items. We've included some additional information on these as well as further segment seasonality comments and other guidance items in the outlook summary that was posted in connection with the earnings release and can be found on our IR website at quantaservices.com. One incremental item for 2022. Early last year, Quanta made a $90 million minority investment in a private company that provides broadband technology. The company has entered into an agreement with a special-purpose acquisition company and pursuant to the transaction is expected to emerge as a publicly traded company in the first half of the year.  Once effective, our current interest would become common equity and would be subject to mark-to-market accounting, with changes in value recorded in other income. We expect to adjust for these changes in value when reporting adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS but have not forecasted any valuation movements curve. These segment operating ranges support our expectation for 2022 annual consolidated revenues of $16 billion to $16.5 billion and adjusted EBITDA of between $1.59 billion and $1.7 billion. This represents another record level of adjusted EBITDA and full year adjusted EBITDA margins over 10%. With these operating results, we estimate our range of GAAP diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock for 2022 to be between $3.56 and $4.06 and anticipate non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $6 and $6.50. Turning to cash flow. The contract assets I spoke of earlier associated with the Canadian transmission project impacted our operating cash flows in 2021 but are expected to represent inflows of cash in 2022 as components reach resolution. These positive effects will be partially offset by the payment of approximately $46 million of change-in-control-related payments associated with the Blattner acquisition and the payment of $54 million of previously deferred payroll taxes in accordance with the CARES Act in 2020.  As such, we currently expect 2022 free cash flow to range between $650 million and $850 million with capital expenditures of around $400 million. As we caution every year, quarterly free cash flow is subject to sizable movements due to various customer and project dynamics that occur in the normal course of operations. Reflecting on our 2021 performance, we delivered another exceptional year, led by solid execution in the field and highlighted by the transformational acquisition of Blattner during the fourth quarter. We ended the year with approximately $1.3 billion of adjusted EBITDA, a record for Quanta, which represents a nearly 16.8% CAGR since 2016. More importantly, our record adjusted EPS of $4.92 represents a 26.6% CAGR since 2016. Looking forward, we continue to see the opportunity to deliver adjusted EPS growth that outpaces our adjusted EBITDA growth, led by margin expansion and operating leverage in the field, coupled with strategic capital deployments focused on delivering long-term returns to our stockholders. Over the last five years, we have deployed approximately $3.9 billion in cash for M&A and strategic investments, $827 million for stock repurchases and $86 million on dividends. Against this backdrop, our financial strategy and consistent performance have been acknowledged by our rating agencies, which reiterated our investment-grade rating subsequent to the debt raised to fund the Blattner acquisition. Going into 2022, we have significant liquidity available and approximately $473 million of availability remaining on our current stock repurchase program. Now we are focused on deleveraging in the near term. We remain committed to delivering the shareholder value through strategic acquisitions and opportunistic repurchase activity. Overall, we continue to believe we are in the early stages of a significant infrastructure investment cycle and that we are uniquely positioned in the markets we serve to deliver comprehensive end-to-end solutions to support North America's transition to carbon-neutral energy infrastructure. This concludes our formal presentation, and we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our first question is coming from Michael Dudas of Vertical Research. Please go ahead. \nMichael Dudas: Good morning, Kip, Derrick, Duke. I think in your prepared remarks, I was quite intrigued about -- you talked about expanding service offerings at several operating units. I assume you've made quite a few acquisitions to expand that, especially on your front-end work and advisory stuff. Can you share a little bit more what's going on and how that's going to be -- I would expect strategically because of what you can add to your clients, but I would also think maybe a mix or margin or financial aspect? So I thought that would be something that you could be like to get more clarity on?\nDuke Austin: Yes. Thanks, Mike. We've talked about it quite a bit, about the company being a portfolio and truly believe we operate in that manner. As we think about the regionality and how we sit, we -- what we've done is in our underground segments, our utilized segments, you continue to see us look at underground electric, look at underground telecom. It doesn't matter to us what median or what service we're providing. The equipment is very similar. The people are very similar. So we believe we can expand those offerings as well as on the front-end services across the board really at a regional level. And so the segmentation may look one way, but how we're operating in the field to get the leverage at the unit, which will ultimately produce the margins that they're seeing and enhance the margins that you're seeing will allow that leverage at that level. So it's just from our standpoint, that's the way that we will continue to operate the company and offer various service lines to the customer and really what's driving that as a customer demand on the local level for expanded services that we can offer. So really, it's us trying to make sure that we're leveraging that at the very field level, which will ultimately increase margins.\nMichael Dudas: Thanks Duke.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Justin Hauke of Baird. Please go ahead. \nJustin Hauke: I guess I have two questions. I'll start with kind of maybe the bigger one, and then I've got just a quick technical one. But just -- maybe just a little more details on the Las Vegas project. It's EPC. I'm just wondering, are you -- do you have partners on this project or is that all you? And just any comments on kind of the risk terms or how it would be different. And then you talked about it being the largest U.S. contract you've ever had. I think the Canadian ones you had were just over $1 billion of revenue. So would that be a good benchmark to kind of think about maybe the size of this project?\nDuke Austin: Yes. So the project we discussed to the West, that's not Las Vegas. But in general, what I would say is we're performing that holistically internally, probably still performing 90% of it. We're proud of the project, nice mill project. So in our mind, an example of us stacking on to our existing base business there in the West. And we don't have partners, and it's not necessary for us to have partners given the size of the company.  So again, we're trying to really work on the synergy transition, and we're going in a holistic fashion. This is something where had several operating units coming together and able to perform the whole project for the client and give them the best service offering, in our mind. So real proud of the project to the west. And again, it's just an example of where the company is going. And way I do believe it's in the renewable segment, as we discussed. And I do think you'll see more of this moving renewables to the west. And so those type of projects will definitely stack on to our existing base business. We're proud of it. And as far as the size of it, we talked about it being the largest in the business in North -- in the Lower 48. So ultimately, a large project for us. We're not going to get into the size of it.\nDerrick Jensen: Yes. We'll only frame it by saying that had it been awarded prior to year-end, our total backlog would have exceeded $20 billion.\nJustin Hauke: Okay. That's helpful. I guess, Derrick, maybe the other question. So on the equity income this quarter, it jumped to $22 million. You guys called out the minority investment that you did. It sounds like maybe that's part of it. I'm just curious, was there anything that was like a -- that was associated with LUMA being at full transition that we should think as kind of a run rate for that? Because it looks like the implied guidance for '22 would have run at a much lower rate than what it was in the quarter.\nDerrick Jensen: Yes. I mean, actually, the majority of the difference was the joint venture-type dynamic. It had a very nice fourth quarter. There is a little bit of an uptick in the fourth quarter associated LUMA, which just has to do with the timing of kind of internal administrative costs rather than anything associated with the fixed fee itself. On a go-forward basis, I would tell you that it's -- that range that I provided, $45 million to $50 million, is a little bit of the increment associated with the joint venture contribution and fairly close to our original expectations for the remaining LUMA.\nJustin Hauke: Great. Thank you very much guys. Appreciated. \nOperator: Our next question is coming from Sean Eastman of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. \nSean Eastman: Hi, team. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to hone in on the new renewables segment. It sounded like the underlying outlook for Blattner embedded in there is consistent with what you guys communicated before. But it'd be helpful just -- since we only really had historicals on an EBITDA level for Blattner, it would be great to just kind of walk through the sort of normative or targeted margin profile we should be thinking about for this new segment since it includes some other stuff as well.\nDuke Austin: Yes. Sean, it's Duke. In general, I would think, in our mind, it's double-digit EBITDA, even some uplift in margins if we can operate through some contingencies on the way through it. So we're proud of the segment. We think it highlights where the company is at. Certainly, Blattner is the big piece of that segment. We've stated the guidance there before around 2.6. So that's where we stand on that. And I do think you'll see those type of margins that are previously stated with Blattner in that segment. So we had a nice business in Florida. We talked about a lot, how we're enabling the infrastructure with substations and interconnections and long transmission lines. I do think that segment will continue to build. You'll continue to see nice work, nice backlog. It is lumpier than what you would consider our base business. But it's just timing -- days timing, not years timing in my mind. So I do think it is fairly predictable at this point. And we've given good guidance on Blattner out to '25. So I do think we're able to not only show the power of what we can do in that sector but also give you some visibility. And I'll let Derrick comment.\nDerrick Jensen: Yes. I think you've said it fine. The only thing I'd add additional color, you could think all way back to when we did the original deal announcement for the largest portion of a decade, Blattner has been able to operate at a double-digit EBITDA. They had some very good performance within the last few years, kind of pressing that number up a little bit. But we look to kind of those historical dynamics to think about our multiyear expectations. So consistent with the '22 and in the outer-years, we think they continue to operate it was double-digit EBITDA. Aggregate for the segment, we think we've tried to be prudent on how to think about that in '22 when you think about it at the operating level of that 9%. I think that between the Blattner execution as well as our own, as we execute through contingencies, that gives us the ability to see a margin expansion. Duke made reference to it within our prepared remarks. We do believe that there's a bit more variability that you'll see within the segment. There's a smaller number of overall projects as compared to, as an example, the larger remaining electric power group as a whole, which can create a bit of variability in the timing to work, but largely very confident in our ability to execute.\nSean Eastman: Okay. That's helpful. And the underground segment, it looks like no changes to the segment reporting there. The revenue and margins came in a little better than I was expecting in terms of the outlook. So just a bit of a flavor on what type of operating environment and kind of underlying assumptions for the bigger buckets in there, namely industrial and the LDC business, would be helpful as we think about what bridges less to this 2022 outlook for that segment.\nDuke Austin: Yes, Sean. I think you've seen the rebound in some of the oil pricing and things of that nature. So the industrial business seems really going to uplift. We thought it would be anyway. So I think it will stack on to the current demand that we're seeing on the industrial side. So we're confident in that business in '22 as it stands. That's certainly something that we were watching very closely. So we feel good about it. Our Canadian business is also rebounding. We like where we stand there. So all in all, I would say, incrementally, we're more positive on the underground segment than we have been. But we stated before, we're running it as a portfolio, the LDC business. We may be doing telecom, we may be doing electric, and some of that business will be blended within the electric segment, telecom segment in the field as a portfolio.  So I wouldn't get too caught up in the segmentation. The overall business will continue to rise, and we're producing double-digit margins, double-digit growth, those kind of things at the bottom. And so what I'm really looking at is that bottom number, and they continue to grow. So we're proud of it.\nSean Eastman: Okay, excellent thanks guys. I\u2019ll turn it over there.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. \nJamie Cook: I guess my question is on Blattner. Understanding the revenue guide and guidance for Blattner is unchanged, is -- can you talk about what they're sort of seeing on the supply chain side? Any difference in what you're expecting, solar versus wind, or perhaps revenue synergies are starting to come through? So just an update on what Blattner is seeing? Thank you.\nDuke Austin: Good morning Jamie. So in general, I would say we're confident in Blattner, confident in the guidance. Obviously, we've given outward year guidance as well. The demand on renewable business balance of plant is certainly there across the board, both solar and wind. We have really nice high-demand clients that customers that we believe really have the supply chain figured out for the most part, not to say there's not some small areas where you're seeing things happen. But in general, we took all that into account when we gave guidance originally. We've taken into account now. We believe we can execute through it. Certain things may show up a little later, but we've done a really nice job. I think what I would tell you is I think it's an advantage for Quanta when there is the supply chain disruptions. It allows us to show the breadth of the company and be able to move where a panel may be delayed a little bit, but we can build everything up to the panel and move to where the panels are and just move around. So it shows the scale and scope of the company and how we operate, and it doesn't affect us, which allows us to collaborate with the client. So I mean, I think we're using it to our advantage. Honestly, we like where we sit in the market.\nJamie Cook: Congratulations. Thank you.\nDuke Austin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. \nNeil Mehta: Good morning team, and strong quarter as well here from my end. First question is about the supply chain. Can you talk about how supply chain issues could affect Quanta in 2022? Is there a risk around project delays this year? And how has Quanta been able to scale its labor force in conjunction with revenue opportunities amid a relatively tight labor market?\nDuke Austin: I think the company in the past -- over the past six, seven years has really focused on labor, our craft-skilled labor, and so it's the core of the business and really invested in it. So that investment certainly pays off in tight labor markets. And I think when we look at it, it's to our advantage. We continue to grow the business nicely. We work on how we perform our labor where we are able to train, get people to the field faster, safer. So those things are something that we've worked on quite a bit and believe it's core to us. So yes, we like where we sit and we like how we're performing. The supply chain with the breadth of the company and the scale that we have, we're able to move pretty nimble through this. And I think, yes, there is some supply chain issues in certain areas. But in general, we're able to work with the client well before there's a problem or an issue and move project to project or help them become nimble as well.  So I do think it's us working with the client, knowing that we see some supply chain constraints and make sure that we're operating properly. And we've done that in the past. You can see the margins in the fourth quarter. We've operated through, we believe, in '22. We'll do the same thing. We have leaned into some of the issues on fleet being the third, fourth largest fleet in North America, we're able to really stretch ourselves there and make sure that we have the fleet necessary to get in front of some of those issues. So we've done a nice job across the board of mitigating the risk of supply chain, not to say that it's not out there.\nNeil Mehta: The follow-up is just on the high-voltage project award that you announced in January. Can you talk about the opportunity set for additional high-voltage transmission projects at a similar scale through this year and beyond? And could you see additional opportunities this year? And as you talk about that, maybe you talk about the regulatory environment because the not-in-my-backyard syndrome is certainly something that's affected the rollout of these transmission lines.\nDuke Austin: Yes. I think when you look at the company, we've stated before, the base business to 80% to 85% on the electric side and underground given Blattner guidance. So if you think about it, those projects will stack. There's a multitude of projects out there. The list is long. I do think we've talked about where the company sits in those type of projects, and we've always said we would be around the edges and lack of chances. We continue to refine how we deliver to the client. The programmatic spends of the client are larger. And our ability to execute on time, on budget was 85% to 90% self-performed has given us advantages across the board, and we like where we sit in that spectrum. So as those projects become -- come to market, they get FID, we get approvals. Not to say there's not the normal problems around permitting because there is. It's getting better, but there's still issues. And many of these projects have been on the books for decades. When I look back, we had looked at it 10 years ago, and it's just now coming to market. So we're not going to get chase shiny objects all the time, but we are there in the edges. And we will, I believe, have a great service offering to the client when those become available, and we'll stack on top of what you already see in the growth rates that you see below. So we're excited about where we sit. And obviously, the project to the West is just, in our mind, something that as it comes available, we like our chances to win those type of projects.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks Duke.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Adam Thalhimer of Thompson, Davis. Please go ahead. \nAdam Thalhimer: Hey good morning guys. Duke, I wanted to ask two questions, both on Blattner. Number one, are you seeing any revenue synergies yet? And then number two, can you talk about whether you see and how you're thinking about any kind of long-term service opportunity in the renewables business?\nDuke Austin: Yes. I think when you look at it, Blattner really, in many ways, transformed where we sat in the energy transition. It certainly puts us in front of the client across the board, both sides from energy all the way to utilities to developers. So it allows us a broad spectrum at a very early stage within a project. Blattner's ability, their self-perform capabilities, how they think was much like us on the transmission/distribution side of the utility business. So when we put our heads together, there's not a day that goes by we don't think of a synergy or something that we believe was transitional to the market. So we're in front of this. We think a lot alike. We've enjoyed the management team, and our ability to collaborate has been exceptional.  So the opportunities that not only what we would call renewable but also clean energy, and how we think about how Blattner helps us transition ourselves as Quanta to really lead the way in that transition is much more than 1 plus 1, in my mind. It will really allow us to help our client, which is ultimately, both companies are focused on the client. And I say it over and over again, but very much aligned on that. So we really want to get in there and help the client move forward at a very early stage, and it allows a lot of benefits to both sides on the backside of this. You see tight markets like this when both of us are in there with our existing clients, we're able to really produce a nice project for the client at a low cost that, in my mind, it doesn't escalate or we're not having the issues that others may have because we self-perform. So in my mind, we did risk a lot of things that a normal E&C does not. We said that many, many times. And the resiliency of the company shows with Blattner and where we're at -- where we sit in the energy transition.\nAdam Thalhimer: Thanks Duke. Congrats on the quarter.\nDuke Austin: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Ian MacPherson of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. \nIan MacPherson: Good morning gentlemen. Congratulations. This has sort of already been passed a little bit by Jamie and others, but I wanted to revisit. If we look at the tape with renewables, and we see the negative sentiment in the market regarding the impact of rising interest rates and political gridlock in Washington and supply chain cost risk that's impacting utility-scale development, there is implied fear, I think, with respect to the Blattner order momentum throughout this year. And I know you're not guiding on orders and backlog. But Duke, would you refute that negative cinema regarding an air pocket in renewables order activity for this year despite those factors?\nDuke Austin: We've had a robust market over the last few years, and you continue to have one. You're talking days, months if you're moving things. So I'll just give you an example. If solar panels are delayed, the last thing we're really accomplishing in a solar field will be putting the panels on. So if we build everything else and then put the panels on at the end, it's not a big deal. Does it disrupt a little bit? Yes. Can we get through it? Yes. So it's not -- the things that you're seeing, the disruptions you may see is not something that's insurmountable nor do we believe has affected our ability to capture work or the way that Blattner looks long term, short term. We gave guidance with that in mind, that there would be some balance and some, I would say, lumpiness in the market. We felt like it was there. That's why we gave the guidance we gave. We also gave guidance in 2025 of $3.6 billion. So the market, the overall, where we're going with the energy transition, I don't believe that's changed. I believe all the clients that we have, have said the same. So we really -- we're going to a greener environment where load growth is going up. There's no doubt about it. And the carbon-free, the way that we're going to deliver energy, will be much different. And we're sitting at the very front of that transition over the next decade. We're just getting started. So we really like where we sit.\nIan MacPherson: Good result, good answer. Thanks Duke. \nOperator: Our next question is coming from Steven Fisher of UBS. Please go ahead. \nSteven Fisher: Thanks, good morning. And you may have really just answered this, but wanted to ask you again about the renewable segment margin because you do have a decline there assumed. And I'm just wondering, is that for what you just talked about you're baking in -- is it declining because you're now baking in some more of these kind of timing issues where you have to put the panels on later? And I guess the follow-on to that would be, what's the potential for that business segment margin to start growing again as we look beyond 2022?\nDuke Austin: Yes. If you look at the renewable segment -- I think if you look back, we recast this last year, 13%, I believe, is what it looked like, a little bit over that. Obviously, we've guided differently with the Blattner acquisition, 2 -- a couple of things. Last year, you had some contingency releases, things like that. And the recast as well as when you go forward, we talked about double-digit EBITDA at Blattner, as we said. Can we operate through -- do we think we have given prudent guidance in our renewable segment? Yes. So we'll be prudent about it. We've thought about it. We've thought about the guidance that we've given and our ability to grow. We've talked about Blattner going to 3.6. It's a segment that we believe will grow.  Certainly, with both companies doing the things that we're doing, the backlog and things of that nature in this segment, similar to the project that we announced today, I believe, that will go into backlog in the first quarter. So you'll continue to see the growth there, in my mind, on these projects as utility-scale renewables come in as well as the -- our ability to enable that through substations and transmission. So I really like where that segment is, and I do believe it's a growth segment for us. And we talked about if we got over $1 billion in the segment, we would segment them, and that's what we did. So we want to give the investor base a good look at it and allow you to see it. So I'll let Derrick comment more.\nDerrick Jensen: Yes. I don't know that I have anything too incremental other than kind of we comment on the things we said earlier. The Blattner dynamic, again, in the last 10 years has operated at a double-digit margin profile. That gives us the multiyear confidence. More specifically, again, the more recent period, they've executed quite strongly above that.  So yes, do we believe that we can see an upward potential against our guidance on a multiyear basis? I think the answer is yes. Whether that be because of our legacy electric operations that are now within this group, we think that we continue to see double-digit operating income-type performance of some of those legacy operations and then now thinking about Blattner. So we remain quite confident in our ability to execute on those margins with the level of upside opportunity. But we want to see the mix of work, right? There's a procurement component of it that can put pressure on margins. So very much, I think that it's the right thing to be looking at this year and being kind of prudent guidance. We want to get more visibility. And on a go-forward basis, very confident in our ability to execute at this level and then giving us the upside opportunities as we execute through contingencies.\nSteven Fisher: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Alex Rigel of B. Riley. Please go ahead.\nAlex Rigel: Very nice quarter, gentlemen. Just one quick question here. How do you view the federal regulatory environment currently? At times in the past, it hampered growth; at other times, it enhanced growth. How do you see it developing here one year into a Biden administration?\nDuke Austin: Thanks, Alex. When we look at it, the overall transition, the energy transition, I believe, is intact. Under any administration, we believe that the sentiment towards carbon-free is certainly there, whether it be hydrogen renewables, balance of plant solar, it doesn't matter. We believe that ship has settled. As far as trying to help with different -- as far as siting, permitting, certainly Build Back Better, those things are all helpful. But either way, I mean, the programmatic spend underneath, if you go into electric vehicles, if you're going to put that many electric vehicles in the systems, your distribution system has to move in a much, much different manner with decades worth of work to be done to modernize as well as the same with renewables coming on to the systems. The modernization, the way it has to work and the interconnections are something that I think goes unnoticed in the amount of work that needs to be done on the grid. So with those type of things are there. Obviously, if we push an interest way high, it would concern everyone. And we were certainly cognizant of hiatus, what it does to an economy and can push it down. So we're certainly watching that as well.\nAlex Rigel: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Noelle Dilts of Stifel. Please go ahead. \nNoelle Dilts: Just quickly on underground. Could you walk through the key factors that are allowing you to guide for record margins in 2022, though revenues are about 20% less than the 2019 peak? And is this a full recovery or is there still more recovery in '23 that you're expecting?\nDuke Austin: Thanks, Noelle. I think when we looked at our underground segment, we thought the industrial business would come back strong. And certainly, as it sits today, it's coming back strongly. And so that's a turnaround. We also -- the Line 3 adjustment that was in their last year, it was not there on a go-forward basis. So you get some movement there as well. Those 2 things are really driving it up. Canada, Australia, both are energy economies that have been depressed over the last 24 months and are certainly moving in the right direction. And so we really like what we said in both Australia and Canada. You add all it up and what we've done on the LDC business and how we're leveraging at the operating level in the field allows all segments to move up. So I do believe as we operate as a portfolio, it will ultimately pull up all segments as we go forward. Was that\u2019s helpful.\nDerrick Jensen: Yes. The only thing I'd comment to is that thinking all the way back to a pre-COVID environment, we actually were guiding to a similar type of margin expectations. And so it's just taking us down in a couple of years to get through both on the industrial, Canada and Australia. So I'd argue that we're very similar to where we were in a pre-COVID environment. And I think this is a good step towards us getting to that upper single digits we've been talking about being able to return to as we look forward on a multiyear basis.\nDuke Austin: Yes. And I think where we're at now is we're early in a way that we're operating the portfolio of the companies. For us to guide there, that's good. We're getting there. But certainly, we're not satisfied with that. We believe we can operate the segment in upper single digits.\nNoelle Dilts: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our final question today is coming from Gus Richard of Northland. Please go ahead.\nGus Richard: Yes, thanks for filling me in and congratulations on a good quarter. I was curious about the underground business. And how much are you seeing in the energy transition to hydrogen? And how much are you seeing Integrity as people try to mitigate the methane leaks?\nDuke Austin: Yes. I mean we saw that early, and I think we invested in the LDC business quite a bit. We've grown it, and there's certainly a multitude of capital deployment there over 30-year periods across the board. So the methane release that we've seen, certainly, that's part of that LDC business that's growing nicely. Hydrogen and carbon sequestration is certainly a few other we were sorting going to lead the way there on many teams that are doing that. We're early, but I do think hydrogen blend, hydrogen, green hydrogen will be something we talk about quite a bit. As you saw batteries 3 or 4 years ago, 5 years ago, we were talking about batteries. And I think they're certainly prevalent today and moving forward. So the same thing with hydrogen, we're just -- we're a little early. But I do think the company sees that and is in front of that in many ways to make sure that we capture that market share in that segment. So certainly, when we think through it, we'll definitely see hydrogen as being a part of the solution of energy transition.\nGus Richard: Got it. Thanks.\nOperator: At this time, I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing comments.\nDuke Austin: Yes. I want to thank the men and women on the field that are out in the inclement weather doing the things that they do rate the storm here, tough environments. They continue to execute at very, very high levels safely. So we're proud of that and proud of them. With that, I'd like to thank you all for participating in our conference call. We appreciate your questions and your ongoing interest in Quanta Services. Thank you. This concludes our call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and enjoy the rest of your day",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Duke Austin",
            "content": "Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings conference call. On the call today, I will provide operational and strategic commentary and will then turn it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a review of our fourth quarter results and full year 2022 financial expectations. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions. This morning, we reported strong fourth quarter results, which complete another year of solid, safe execution, profitable growth. These results were built off a strong operational and financial platform and we believe demonstrates the dedication of the best employees in the industry.  Our portfolio of companies, diversity of service lines and field leadership has allowed us to endure the uncertainties and challenges presented by the global pandemic over the past couple of years while still delivering four consecutive years of record adjusted EBITDA and five consecutive years of record adjusted earnings per share. We accomplished a great deal in 2021 through the successful implementation of our strategic initiatives, and our past success positions us well for the future. We remain focused on continuing to provide collaborative solutions to our customers and business partners to help them achieve their goals and to capitalize on opportunities to enable the energy transition that is unfolding. Here are some of our accomplishments in 2021. We continue to advance our front-end solution strategy both organically and through acquisitions, which is focused on strengthening our design, engineering, permitting, environmental and program management capabilities. This strategy allows us to expand our solutions to our customers, enhances risk management and increases our total addressable market.  We expanded our emergency response capabilities and generated another year of record revenues by supporting our customers' efforts to restore power to millions of people adversely impacted by several severe weather events during the year. Our ability to quickly mobilize significant resources to support our customers in times of need is unmatched in our industry. LUMA Energy, our joint venture with ATCO, successfully transitioned to managing Puerto Rico's more than 18,000-mile electric transmission and distribution systems. Though many years of challenges and work were made, LUMA has made significant progress in improving customer service, response times, customer communication and system reliability. We continue to believe this opportunity is transformative for Quanta and the people of Puerto Rico and remain committed to supporting LUMA's mission to provide reliable electricity while building a modern and sustainable transmission and distribution system. In support of our commitment to the people of Puerto Rico, we, along with ATCO, bundled and commenced the LUMA College for Technical Training in Puerto Rico, and the first class of electric utility line workers graduated in October. Since opening the college, which is supported by Northwest Lineman College, hundreds of workers from LUMA have received additional training with the support of Quanta. We are proud of our commitment to the advancement of craft-skilled workforce in Puerto Rico. We grew our communications services revenue by approximately 25% and ended the year with record communications total backlog of approximately $1.3 billion. We also developed and rolled out wireless infrastructure solutions to strengthen our opportunities to capitalize on 5G network deployment and ongoing enhancement of 4G wireless networks. We expect to profitably grow the business and are booking incremental wireless revenue. We completed the acquisition of Blattner, a premier utility-scale renewable energy infrastructure solutions provider in North America with decades of experience and strong safety culture. This is Quanta's largest acquisition to date, and we believe it positions Quanta to be a leader in the energy transition and transforms our ability to collaborate early with our customers on their energy transition strategies. The integration of Blattner is going well, and we have increasing confidence in our ability to create meaningful growth and cost synergies together over time. We made meaningful progress in our initiative to apply certain skill sets and expertise from operations within the Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment to perform certain aspects of electric power and telecom-related work. We believe the resource expansion and operating leverage we gain through this initiative is a significant opportunity for Quanta to reinforce our self-perform capabilities, improve operating efficiency and profitability and demonstrates the strength of our portfolio approach. In addition to the acquisition of Blattner, we invested approximately $350 million in strategic acquisitions of nine high-quality companies, which primarily support our electric power and front-end service solutions. We believe the acquired companies are additive to our base business, advance our strategic initiatives and enhance our self-perform capabilities, which typically accounts for approximately 80% of our work and are key to providing cost certainty to our customers. We maintained our investment-grade credit rating while issuing $1.5 billion of senior notes and expanded our credit facility to fund the Blattner acquisition, which we believe points to the merits of the transaction, our strong financial profile, the resiliency and sustainability of our business model and positive multiyear outlook. We demonstrated our commitment to stockholder value and our confidence in Quanta's financial strength and continued growth opportunities through the repurchase of approximately $64 million of common stock and a 20% increase of our dividend. And finally, we continue to increase our efforts and dedicate resources toward implementing sustainable business practices throughout the organization and to improve the data we capture to manage our operations' sustainability and better communicate our ESG impact and initiatives to our stakeholders. It is easy to take for granted the reliability of the power grid, access to abundant sources of affordable energy and internet connectivity for commerce and entertainment. The impact of a hurricane, winter storm, wildfire or other events that shut off power affects our ability to heat or cool our homes and disrupts our quality of life, quickly changes this perspective and highlights how critical the infrastructure that we design, build and maintain is to our everyday well-being. The solutions Quanta provide support our customers' efforts to increase reliability, safety, efficiency and connectivity, all of which have a favorable environmental and social impact. Additionally, our services are at the forefront of providing the infrastructure solutions necessary to enable the energy transition and the adoption of new technology. As a result, we believe our business is levered to favorable and sustainable long-term trends. Demand for grid modernization, system hardening, electric vehicle charging, infrastructure and renewable energy interconnection services is robust and we believe will remain so for the foreseeable future. This activity drove our electric power results and backlog strength during 2021, primarily through significant multiyear master service agreements with utilities. Further, we believe we are in the early stages of utilities' undergrounding transmission and distribution lines to protect them from the effects of severe weather events and wildfires. For example, several utilities in the Western United States are planning to invest tens of billions of dollars in the aggregate to underground thousands of miles of electric power lines in high fire-threat areas. Electric utilities in other areas of the country are pursuing initiatives to underground critical infrastructure. Examples include electric transmission projects in the Northeast, distribution circuits along the coastlines and electric transmission line projects for offshore wind generation. Many of these initiatives are part of the large-scale multiyear storm hardening programs. We also believe North America is at an inflection point for significant investment in electric vehicle-related infrastructure, including charging infrastructure and the electric distribution system upgrades necessary to support the anticipated increase in the adoption of electric cars, trucks and commercial fleet vehicles in the coming years. Quanta continues its work with multiple leading electrical vehicle charging companies and utilities to build out infrastructure necessary to make fast, affordable charging possible in numerous states across the country. Quanta is presently working on the rollout of hundreds of charging stations. In many of these locations, Quanta is serving as the program manager, providing a full suite of engineering, development and construction services. With our scope and scale and turnkey program management capabilities, we are pursuing additional EV charging program management opportunities with other charging infrastructure companies, automakers and utilities. Our communications operations, which are within the electric power segment, grew revenues and backlog nicely in 2021, but our profitability levels did not achieve our goals. We are working constructively with our customers on certain items that have impacted profitability and believe these issues are approaching resolution. With the exception of these issues, the remainder of the communications operations are operating close to our target margin profile for the year. The demand for our communication services remains high, and we expect double-digit revenue growth and a return to upper single-digit operating income margin for our communications operations in 2022. With the addition of Blattner to our portfolio, we have begun reporting through three segments by adding a new Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions segment. This platform consists of services and solutions for infrastructure supporting the delivery of renewable energy, including renewable generation, electric transmission, substations and battery storage with Blattner's operations representing the majority of those solutions.  We are strategically positioned to collaborate with our customers to lead North America's energy transition and capitalize on the growing and significant amount of expenditure expected to be invested in renewable generation and related infrastructure as part of these efforts. Renewable developers and utilities are leading the effort to reduce carbon emissions, many with carbon-neutral commitments through aggressive efforts to expand their renewable generation portfolios and implement new technologies for current and future needs. Achieving their goals will also require substantial incremental investment in transmission and substation infrastructure to interconnect new renewable generation facilities to the power grid and to ensure grid reliability due to the significant increase of intermittent power added to the system. For example, we highlighted in our earnings release this morning our recent selection to build more than 400 miles of high-voltage electric transmission across several states for our customer in the Western United States. This project is designed to improve operational flexibility in conjunction with future generation resources, including renewable energy to meet the load growth and provide increased reliability. Also of note, this is the largest electric transmission line contract ever awarded to Quanta in the United States. Over the near and longer term, we believe substantial load growth, public policy and the overall positive sentiment supporting a greener environment will continue to drive North America's power generation mix increasingly towards renewables. Quanta's utility-scale renewable generation solutions, coupled with Quanta's existing holistic grid solutions, creates a unique value proposition and opportunity to collaborate with our customers to shape their energy transition initiatives. We are increasingly confident in the gross synergy opportunities we have with the addition of Blattner, and to that end, believe we have only scratched the surface on what is possible. Our Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment faced challenges last year, primarily due to circumstances outside of our control, such as impacts from the global pandemic, work disruptions along the Gulf Coast due to hurricane and impact on results from a customer bankruptcy.  Despite these challenges, our operations persevered in our gas utility and pipeline integrity operations performed well. We believe the recovery of certain of our markets and operations have begun. In particular, we expect our industrial services, Canadian and Australian operations to meaningfully improve this year both in revenue and margins.  We expect to continue our focus on growing our gas utility, pipeline integrity and industrial services businesses, consistent with our strategy over the last five years due to the favorable long-term trends driven by safety, reliability and environmental regulations. Looking to the coming years, we believe Quanta has meaningful opportunities with customers in this segment as they increasingly pursue strategies to reduce their carbon footprint and transition their operations and assets towards greener business opportunities. For example, gas utilities are implementing system modernization initiatives to reduce methane emissions and that position them to blend hydrogen into their natural gas flow and certain refiners. Utilities and developers are building renewable natural gas and biofuel processing facilities. We are also actively pursuing sizable carbon sequestration projects. In our earnings release this morning, we provided our 2022 guidance, which we believe demonstrates the strength and sustainability of our business and long-term strategy, favorable end-market trends, our ability to safely execute and our strong and strengthening competitive position in the marketplace. Further, our ongoing investment and commitment to workforce training continues to positively impact our performance and positions us well to capitalize on future opportunities.  Our expectations call for another year of meaningful growth, record revenues, adjusted EBITDA and earnings per share and improved profit margins. Additionally, we see opportunity to achieve new record levels of backlog in 2022. Derrick will provide additional detail about our guidance in his commentary. In summary, the strong performance of our electric power and Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions operations and the contribution of acquisitions during the year yielded record results in 2021 and has given us a leading platform to collaborate with our customers to shape the energy transition. We believe our strategic position in the marketplace remains strong, which has been further enhanced by the acquisition of Blattner, and that we are all well positioned for continued profitable growth over the near and longer term. We continue to make meaningful progress on growing our portfolio of services within each of our units to further leverage our operating results. The recent promotion of Redgie Probst to Chief Operating Officer is intended to support and promote this strategy, and we look forward to continuing to work with him on this important initiative. Considering our organic growth opportunities and the levers available to us to allocate future cash flow generation into value-creating opportunities such as stock repurchases, acquisitions, strategic investments and dividends, we believe Quanta will continue to generate meaningful value for our stakeholders going forward.  We are focused on operating the business for the long term and expect to continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class field leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's base business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's diversity, unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset form the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his review of our fourth quarter and full year results and 2022 expectations. Derrick? Yes. Thanks, Mike. We've talked about it quite a bit, about the company being a portfolio and truly believe we operate in that manner. As we think about the regionality and how we sit, we -- what we've done is in our underground segments, our utilized segments, you continue to see us look at underground electric, look at underground telecom. It doesn't matter to us what median or what service we're providing. The equipment is very similar. The people are very similar. So we believe we can expand those offerings as well as on the front-end services across the board really at a regional level. And so the segmentation may look one way, but how we're operating in the field to get the leverage at the unit, which will ultimately produce the margins that they're seeing and enhance the margins that you're seeing will allow that leverage at that level. So it's just from our standpoint, that's the way that we will continue to operate the company and offer various service lines to the customer and really what's driving that as a customer demand on the local level for expanded services that we can offer. So really, it's us trying to make sure that we're leveraging that at the very field level, which will ultimately increase margins. Yes. So the project we discussed to the West, that's not Las Vegas. But in general, what I would say is we're performing that holistically internally, probably still performing 90% of it. We're proud of the project, nice mill project. So in our mind, an example of us stacking on to our existing base business there in the West. And we don't have partners, and it's not necessary for us to have partners given the size of the company.  So again, we're trying to really work on the synergy transition, and we're going in a holistic fashion. This is something where had several operating units coming together and able to perform the whole project for the client and give them the best service offering, in our mind. So real proud of the project to the west. And again, it's just an example of where the company is going. And way I do believe it's in the renewable segment, as we discussed. And I do think you'll see more of this moving renewables to the west. And so those type of projects will definitely stack on to our existing base business. We're proud of it. And as far as the size of it, we talked about it being the largest in the business in North -- in the Lower 48. So ultimately, a large project for us. We're not going to get into the size of it. Yes. Sean, it's Duke. In general, I would think, in our mind, it's double-digit EBITDA, even some uplift in margins if we can operate through some contingencies on the way through it. So we're proud of the segment. We think it highlights where the company is at. Certainly, Blattner is the big piece of that segment. We've stated the guidance there before around 2.6. So that's where we stand on that. And I do think you'll see those type of margins that are previously stated with Blattner in that segment. So we had a nice business in Florida. We talked about a lot, how we're enabling the infrastructure with substations and interconnections and long transmission lines. I do think that segment will continue to build. You'll continue to see nice work, nice backlog. It is lumpier than what you would consider our base business. But it's just timing -- days timing, not years timing in my mind. So I do think it is fairly predictable at this point. And we've given good guidance on Blattner out to '25. So I do think we're able to not only show the power of what we can do in that sector but also give you some visibility. And I'll let Derrick comment. Yes, Sean. I think you've seen the rebound in some of the oil pricing and things of that nature. So the industrial business seems really going to uplift. We thought it would be anyway. So I think it will stack on to the current demand that we're seeing on the industrial side. So we're confident in that business in '22 as it stands. That's certainly something that we were watching very closely. So we feel good about it. Our Canadian business is also rebounding. We like where we stand there. So all in all, I would say, incrementally, we're more positive on the underground segment than we have been. But we stated before, we're running it as a portfolio, the LDC business. We may be doing telecom, we may be doing electric, and some of that business will be blended within the electric segment, telecom segment in the field as a portfolio.  So I wouldn't get too caught up in the segmentation. The overall business will continue to rise, and we're producing double-digit margins, double-digit growth, those kind of things at the bottom. And so what I'm really looking at is that bottom number, and they continue to grow. So we're proud of it. Good morning Jamie. So in general, I would say we're confident in Blattner, confident in the guidance. Obviously, we've given outward year guidance as well. The demand on renewable business balance of plant is certainly there across the board, both solar and wind. We have really nice high-demand clients that customers that we believe really have the supply chain figured out for the most part, not to say there's not some small areas where you're seeing things happen. But in general, we took all that into account when we gave guidance originally. We've taken into account now. We believe we can execute through it. Certain things may show up a little later, but we've done a really nice job. I think what I would tell you is I think it's an advantage for Quanta when there is the supply chain disruptions. It allows us to show the breadth of the company and be able to move where a panel may be delayed a little bit, but we can build everything up to the panel and move to where the panels are and just move around. So it shows the scale and scope of the company and how we operate, and it doesn't affect us, which allows us to collaborate with the client. So I mean, I think we're using it to our advantage. Honestly, we like where we sit in the market. Thank you. I think the company in the past -- over the past six, seven years has really focused on labor, our craft-skilled labor, and so it's the core of the business and really invested in it. So that investment certainly pays off in tight labor markets. And I think when we look at it, it's to our advantage. We continue to grow the business nicely. We work on how we perform our labor where we are able to train, get people to the field faster, safer. So those things are something that we've worked on quite a bit and believe it's core to us. So yes, we like where we sit and we like how we're performing. The supply chain with the breadth of the company and the scale that we have, we're able to move pretty nimble through this. And I think, yes, there is some supply chain issues in certain areas. But in general, we're able to work with the client well before there's a problem or an issue and move project to project or help them become nimble as well.  So I do think it's us working with the client, knowing that we see some supply chain constraints and make sure that we're operating properly. And we've done that in the past. You can see the margins in the fourth quarter. We've operated through, we believe, in '22. We'll do the same thing. We have leaned into some of the issues on fleet being the third, fourth largest fleet in North America, we're able to really stretch ourselves there and make sure that we have the fleet necessary to get in front of some of those issues. So we've done a nice job across the board of mitigating the risk of supply chain, not to say that it's not out there. Yes. I think when you look at the company, we've stated before, the base business to 80% to 85% on the electric side and underground given Blattner guidance. So if you think about it, those projects will stack. There's a multitude of projects out there. The list is long. I do think we've talked about where the company sits in those type of projects, and we've always said we would be around the edges and lack of chances. We continue to refine how we deliver to the client. The programmatic spends of the client are larger. And our ability to execute on time, on budget was 85% to 90% self-performed has given us advantages across the board, and we like where we sit in that spectrum. So as those projects become -- come to market, they get FID, we get approvals. Not to say there's not the normal problems around permitting because there is. It's getting better, but there's still issues. And many of these projects have been on the books for decades. When I look back, we had looked at it 10 years ago, and it's just now coming to market. So we're not going to get chase shiny objects all the time, but we are there in the edges. And we will, I believe, have a great service offering to the client when those become available, and we'll stack on top of what you already see in the growth rates that you see below. So we're excited about where we sit. And obviously, the project to the West is just, in our mind, something that as it comes available, we like our chances to win those type of projects. Yes. I think when you look at it, Blattner really, in many ways, transformed where we sat in the energy transition. It certainly puts us in front of the client across the board, both sides from energy all the way to utilities to developers. So it allows us a broad spectrum at a very early stage within a project. Blattner's ability, their self-perform capabilities, how they think was much like us on the transmission/distribution side of the utility business. So when we put our heads together, there's not a day that goes by we don't think of a synergy or something that we believe was transitional to the market. So we're in front of this. We think a lot alike. We've enjoyed the management team, and our ability to collaborate has been exceptional.  So the opportunities that not only what we would call renewable but also clean energy, and how we think about how Blattner helps us transition ourselves as Quanta to really lead the way in that transition is much more than 1 plus 1, in my mind. It will really allow us to help our client, which is ultimately, both companies are focused on the client. And I say it over and over again, but very much aligned on that. So we really want to get in there and help the client move forward at a very early stage, and it allows a lot of benefits to both sides on the backside of this. You see tight markets like this when both of us are in there with our existing clients, we're able to really produce a nice project for the client at a low cost that, in my mind, it doesn't escalate or we're not having the issues that others may have because we self-perform. So in my mind, we did risk a lot of things that a normal E&C does not. We said that many, many times. And the resiliency of the company shows with Blattner and where we're at -- where we sit in the energy transition. Thank you. We've had a robust market over the last few years, and you continue to have one. You're talking days, months if you're moving things. So I'll just give you an example. If solar panels are delayed, the last thing we're really accomplishing in a solar field will be putting the panels on. So if we build everything else and then put the panels on at the end, it's not a big deal. Does it disrupt a little bit? Yes. Can we get through it? Yes. So it's not -- the things that you're seeing, the disruptions you may see is not something that's insurmountable nor do we believe has affected our ability to capture work or the way that Blattner looks long term, short term. We gave guidance with that in mind, that there would be some balance and some, I would say, lumpiness in the market. We felt like it was there. That's why we gave the guidance we gave. We also gave guidance in 2025 of $3.6 billion. So the market, the overall, where we're going with the energy transition, I don't believe that's changed. I believe all the clients that we have, have said the same. So we really -- we're going to a greener environment where load growth is going up. There's no doubt about it. And the carbon-free, the way that we're going to deliver energy, will be much different. And we're sitting at the very front of that transition over the next decade. We're just getting started. So we really like where we sit. Yes. If you look at the renewable segment -- I think if you look back, we recast this last year, 13%, I believe, is what it looked like, a little bit over that. Obviously, we've guided differently with the Blattner acquisition, 2 -- a couple of things. Last year, you had some contingency releases, things like that. And the recast as well as when you go forward, we talked about double-digit EBITDA at Blattner, as we said. Can we operate through -- do we think we have given prudent guidance in our renewable segment? Yes. So we'll be prudent about it. We've thought about it. We've thought about the guidance that we've given and our ability to grow. We've talked about Blattner going to 3.6. It's a segment that we believe will grow.  Certainly, with both companies doing the things that we're doing, the backlog and things of that nature in this segment, similar to the project that we announced today, I believe, that will go into backlog in the first quarter. So you'll continue to see the growth there, in my mind, on these projects as utility-scale renewables come in as well as the -- our ability to enable that through substations and transmission. So I really like where that segment is, and I do believe it's a growth segment for us. And we talked about if we got over $1 billion in the segment, we would segment them, and that's what we did. So we want to give the investor base a good look at it and allow you to see it. So I'll let Derrick comment more. Thanks, Alex. When we look at it, the overall transition, the energy transition, I believe, is intact. Under any administration, we believe that the sentiment towards carbon-free is certainly there, whether it be hydrogen renewables, balance of plant solar, it doesn't matter. We believe that ship has settled. As far as trying to help with different -- as far as siting, permitting, certainly Build Back Better, those things are all helpful. But either way, I mean, the programmatic spend underneath, if you go into electric vehicles, if you're going to put that many electric vehicles in the systems, your distribution system has to move in a much, much different manner with decades worth of work to be done to modernize as well as the same with renewables coming on to the systems. The modernization, the way it has to work and the interconnections are something that I think goes unnoticed in the amount of work that needs to be done on the grid. So with those type of things are there. Obviously, if we push an interest way high, it would concern everyone. And we were certainly cognizant of hiatus, what it does to an economy and can push it down. So we're certainly watching that as well. Thanks, Noelle. I think when we looked at our underground segment, we thought the industrial business would come back strong. And certainly, as it sits today, it's coming back strongly. And so that's a turnaround. We also -- the Line 3 adjustment that was in their last year, it was not there on a go-forward basis. So you get some movement there as well. Those 2 things are really driving it up. Canada, Australia, both are energy economies that have been depressed over the last 24 months and are certainly moving in the right direction. And so we really like what we said in both Australia and Canada. You add all it up and what we've done on the LDC business and how we're leveraging at the operating level in the field allows all segments to move up. So I do believe as we operate as a portfolio, it will ultimately pull up all segments as we go forward. Was that's helpful. Yes. And I think where we're at now is we're early in a way that we're operating the portfolio of the companies. For us to guide there, that's good. We're getting there. But certainly, we're not satisfied with that. We believe we can operate the segment in upper single digits. Yes. I mean we saw that early, and I think we invested in the LDC business quite a bit. We've grown it, and there's certainly a multitude of capital deployment there over 30-year periods across the board. So the methane release that we've seen, certainly, that's part of that LDC business that's growing nicely. Hydrogen and carbon sequestration is certainly a few other we were sorting going to lead the way there on many teams that are doing that. We're early, but I do think hydrogen blend, hydrogen, green hydrogen will be something we talk about quite a bit. As you saw batteries 3 or 4 years ago, 5 years ago, we were talking about batteries. And I think they're certainly prevalent today and moving forward. So the same thing with hydrogen, we're just -- we're a little early. But I do think the company sees that and is in front of that in many ways to make sure that we capture that market share in that segment. So certainly, when we think through it, we'll definitely see hydrogen as being a part of the solution of energy transition. Yes. I want to thank the men and women on the field that are out in the inclement weather doing the things that they do rate the storm here, tough environments. They continue to execute at very, very high levels safely. So we're proud of that and proud of them. With that, I'd like to thank you all for participating in our conference call. We appreciate your questions and your ongoing interest in Quanta Services. Thank you. This concludes our call."

            "name": "Derrick Jensen",
            "content": "Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced record quarterly revenues of $3.9 billion for the fourth quarter of 2021. Net income attributable to common stock was $104.8 million or $0.71 per diluted share and adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure, was a record $1.54. Overall, the fourth quarter closed out another exceptional year of operational performance for Quanta. Our fourth quarter results include the introduction of our Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions segment, largely due to the inclusion of Blattner in our operating results beginning in October. At a high level, this segment primarily represents the solutions we're providing associated with interconnection, substation and generation infrastructure directly supporting the delivery of renewable electricity. Historically, these activities were included within our electric segment. However, as the same market forces driving Blattner's growth will drive growth in these related areas, which included the aggregation of these services provided incremental clarity to the investment community. Our reported results exceeded our expectations for the fourth quarter in numerous areas, including revenues, adjusted EBITDA, EPS and adjusted EPS, with revenues and adjusted EBITDA delivering significant growth as compared to last year. I'll cover a few items impacting the quarter. Revenues continued to show significant growth compared to last year, in part due to record emergency storm response revenues, although only slightly above last year's ERS revenues. Additionally, revenues from acquired businesses were approximately $500 million in 4Q '21, the majority of which was attributable to Blattner. Operating margins in the quarter benefited from continued strong execution across our electric operations with margins exceeding 12%. Also contributing were the operating results of our integral unconsolidated affiliates. This primarily relates to the LUMA joint venture, but also includes contributions from a business that provides specialty site preparation and access solutions in which we acquired a 44% interest during the quarter, as we commented on in our third quarter earnings release, and they performed quite well during the quarter.  Partially offsetting those dynamics were our communications operations, which had negative margins during the quarter due to the challenges experienced in certain regions. Specifically, one customer reduced the previously expected scope of work in certain markets, while the requirements to evidence the completion of the work have been subject to multiple changes. Due to the elimination of future scope and associated construction activities, we were required to recognize in the quarter the full cost necessary for the preparation and submission of the modified closeout packages. For two other contracts with another customer, we recognized losses due to ongoing permitting delays, which were substantially hindering production as well as increased cost to meet schedule commitments. These two projects are near completion. Importantly, our remaining aggregate communications operations are operating in the upper single-digit range, giving us the confidence that our longer-term margin profiles are achievable. Our previous guidance included expected contributions from transactions made in 3Q '21 and 4Q '21 through the date of our November earnings release of between $40 million and $60 millions of adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure. Ultimately, our fourth quarter results included contributions towards the higher end of this range. We recognized an incremental $8.1 million provision for credit loss or $0.04 per diluted share related to outstanding receivables owed by Line 3 refining that declared bankruptcy in July 2021 as we do not anticipate the receipt of any funds through the bankruptcy proceeding. We no longer have any exposure related to receivables owed from this customer. Operating margin in 4Q '21 was negatively impacted by $146 million associated with amortization, deal costs and fair market value adjustments to earn-out liabilities, a combined 370 basis point impact, compared to $28 million of comparable costs and approximately 100 basis point impact in 4Q '20.  Also of note, the tax expense and effective rate for the fourth quarter and full year of 2021 were significantly lower than our previous guidance. This reduction was largely driven by the favorable IRS clarification on per diem deductions for 2021 and the reversal of certain reserves for uncertain tax positions upon expiration of certain statutes of limitations. Our total backlog was $19.3 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, another record level. $1.6 billion of the backlog is attributable to fourth quarter acquisitions, the majority of which was from Blattner. But excluding those contributions, total backlog were still up over $600 million compared to 3Q '21.  12-month backlog of $11.3 billion includes close to $1.5 billion of acquired backlog, but excluding those contributions still represents record 12-month backlog on an organic basis. We believe these increases continue to reinforce the repeatable and sustainable nature of the largest portion of our revenues and earnings and the demand for our industry-leading infrastructure solutions. For the fourth quarter of 2021, we generated free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, of $111 million, resulting in $246 million of free cash flow for the year. Our previous expectations of $350 million to $500 million of free cash flow for the year excluded significant change-in-control-related disbursements associated with acquired liabilities during the quarter associated with the Blattner transaction, which aggregated to $72 million and are required to be treated as operating cash outflow items in our GAAP calculation. We also took the opportunity in the fourth quarter of 2021 to accelerate the opportunistic and strategic procurement of around $50 million of equipment. Given the ongoing supply chain challenges in the equipment and vehicle markets, we felt it was the right long-term action to take to support the ongoing needs of our operations. Days sales outstanding, or DSO, measured 80 days for the fourth quarter, which is a reduction of nine days compared to the third quarter of 2021 and three days compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. The decreases were primarily due to the favorable impact of the acquisition of Blattner, which typically has lower DSO in certain of our other larger operating companies.  This positive impact was partially offset by continued elevated working capital requirements associated with two larger Canadian transmission projects driving an increase in contract assets, which we've discussed in prior quarters. Both projects have been impacted by work stoppage protocols in Canada associated with COVID mitigation as well as delays attributable to, among other things, wildfires' impact access to work sites. Discussions with both customers regarding change orders associated with these increased costs are ongoing, with multiple change orders already approved. The remaining amounts are being pursued in the normal course. We had total liquidity of $2.1 billion at year-end and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.3 as calculated under our credit agreement. While our leverage profile remains above our target range due to the acquisition financing, as we stated in prior calls, we expect to efficiently delever over the following quarters while continuing to create shareholder value through our dividend and repurchase programs as well as strategic acquisitions. To that end, during the fourth quarter, in addition to the three transactions we announced during our last earnings release, we acquired four additional businesses for a total combined consideration of approximately $230 million. These four acquisitions all closed late in December and other than incremental deal costs were immaterial to our 4Q results. Turning to guidance. First, forecasting and providing specific commentary on the classification of uncommitted revenues between electric power versus renewables can be challenging. Accordingly, it's possible that as we progress through the year and gain more visibility into the nature of the work we'll be performing, there could be movements outside these initial segment ranges simply due to the type of infrastructure our activities will be supporting.  As Duke commented, we deliver our portfolio of services, and we are comfortable with our aggregate expectations. Additionally, by following seasonality commentary addresses our expectations for 2022 as compared to our recast quarterly results for 2021, which align prior reported numbers to our new segmentation. And these 2021 recasted segment numbers have been included in today's earnings release. As it relates to the electric power segment specifically, we see 2022 revenues ranging between $8.2 billion and $8.3 billion. Our base business continues to lead the growth in the segment driven primarily by North American utilities outsourcing activities required to replace, rebuild and upgrade existing infrastructure.  Notably, these growth expectations are tempered by reduced storm revenues, $250 million of which are included in our current expectations compared to over $450 million in 2021. Additionally, revenue contributions from larger electric projects are forecasted to be around $200 million lower in 2022 as we expect to reach substantial completion on one of our larger Canadian projects in the first quarter. Included within the segment are our communications operations, which we expect to grow double digits over 2021 levels to around $750 million of revenue in 2022. While we expect 2022 operating margins for the electric power segment to range between 10.7% and 11.3%, which includes contributions of between $45 million and $50 millions of earnings from our integral unconsolidated affiliates, the largest portion of which relates to the LUMA joint venture in Puerto Rico. 2021 represented another exceptional year for our electric operations, and our margin profile was again above our historical norms and our original expectations due in part to the record emergency restoration service revenues. Our 2022 expectations for margins for the segment remain elevated but are more consistent with historical averages and are tempered by normalized storm revenues as well as our communications operations, which are expected to operate in the upper single digits in 2022. As is typically the case, we expect that first quarter operating margins will be the lowest for the year, likely around 10%, with margins increasing into the second and third quarters and then slightly declining in the fourth quarter. The Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions segment full year revenues are expected to range between $3.8 billion and $4 billion, with the largest portion of the growth due to the acquisition of Blattner. As it relates to Blattner, we remain confident in the initial range of expectations for 2022 included in the September deal announcement. From a revenue seasonality perspective in 2022, we expect segment revenues to be between $900 million and $950 million in the first quarter, then growing sequentially into the third quarter with a slight decline in the fourth quarter. We expect 2022 operating margins for the renewable energy segment to be around 9% for the year, translating into double-digit EBITDA margins, which is what we would expect from the segment. Due to the slightly higher project-oriented nature of this segment, margins will be more variable on a quarterly basis. As it stands today, similar to our other segments, we expect margins for the first quarter to be the lowest for the year, likely around 8%. Margins, therefore, have the opportunity to strengthen in subsequent quarters as volumes increase and we successfully execute through individual project contingencies throughout the year. The Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment has been heavily impacted by the uncertainties in the energy market and economy caused by COVID-19. However, we expect far fewer headwinds in 2022. We are currently anticipating double-digit revenue growth of off of 2021, with full year revenues expected to range between $4 billion and $4.2 billion. This growth is expected to be led by our industrial, Canadian and Australian operations, each of which has dealt with significant challenges associated with COVID-related impacts for the last two years. Additionally, our gas utility business continues to see nice year-over-year growth opportunities. Operating margins are expected to improve meaningfully in 2022. We see segment margins ranging between 6.5% and 7.5%, led primarily by recovery from our industrial and Canadian operations. Consistent with years past, our first quarter traditionally has lower activity in the segment due to weather seasonality, which impacts our revenues and precious margins to slightly below mid-single digits. However, we expect solid improvement into the second and third quarters with a seasonal decline in the fourth quarter. The number and size of acquisitions in 2021 will significantly change the magnitude of amortization, acquisition and integration costs and certain other corporate and unallocated costs as well as the quarter-to-quarter timing of these items. We've included some additional information on these as well as further segment seasonality comments and other guidance items in the outlook summary that was posted in connection with the earnings release and can be found on our IR website at quantaservices.com. One incremental item for 2022. Early last year, Quanta made a $90 million minority investment in a private company that provides broadband technology. The company has entered into an agreement with a special-purpose acquisition company and pursuant to the transaction is expected to emerge as a publicly traded company in the first half of the year.  Once effective, our current interest would become common equity and would be subject to mark-to-market accounting, with changes in value recorded in other income. We expect to adjust for these changes in value when reporting adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS but have not forecasted any valuation movements curve. These segment operating ranges support our expectation for 2022 annual consolidated revenues of $16 billion to $16.5 billion and adjusted EBITDA of between $1.59 billion and $1.7 billion. This represents another record level of adjusted EBITDA and full year adjusted EBITDA margins over 10%. With these operating results, we estimate our range of GAAP diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock for 2022 to be between $3.56 and $4.06 and anticipate non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $6 and $6.50. Turning to cash flow. The contract assets I spoke of earlier associated with the Canadian transmission project impacted our operating cash flows in 2021 but are expected to represent inflows of cash in 2022 as components reach resolution. These positive effects will be partially offset by the payment of approximately $46 million of change-in-control-related payments associated with the Blattner acquisition and the payment of $54 million of previously deferred payroll taxes in accordance with the CARES Act in 2020.  As such, we currently expect 2022 free cash flow to range between $650 million and $850 million with capital expenditures of around $400 million. As we caution every year, quarterly free cash flow is subject to sizable movements due to various customer and project dynamics that occur in the normal course of operations. Reflecting on our 2021 performance, we delivered another exceptional year, led by solid execution in the field and highlighted by the transformational acquisition of Blattner during the fourth quarter. We ended the year with approximately $1.3 billion of adjusted EBITDA, a record for Quanta, which represents a nearly 16.8% CAGR since 2016. More importantly, our record adjusted EPS of $4.92 represents a 26.6% CAGR since 2016. Looking forward, we continue to see the opportunity to deliver adjusted EPS growth that outpaces our adjusted EBITDA growth, led by margin expansion and operating leverage in the field, coupled with strategic capital deployments focused on delivering long-term returns to our stockholders. Over the last five years, we have deployed approximately $3.9 billion in cash for M&A and strategic investments, $827 million for stock repurchases and $86 million on dividends. Against this backdrop, our financial strategy and consistent performance have been acknowledged by our rating agencies, which reiterated our investment-grade rating subsequent to the debt raised to fund the Blattner acquisition. Going into 2022, we have significant liquidity available and approximately $473 million of availability remaining on our current stock repurchase program. Now we are focused on deleveraging in the near term. We remain committed to delivering the shareholder value through strategic acquisitions and opportunistic repurchase activity. Overall, we continue to believe we are in the early stages of a significant infrastructure investment cycle and that we are uniquely positioned in the markets we serve to deliver comprehensive end-to-end solutions to support North America's transition to carbon-neutral energy infrastructure. This concludes our formal presentation, and we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator? Yes. We'll only frame it by saying that had it been awarded prior to year-end, our total backlog would have exceeded $20 billion. Yes. I mean, actually, the majority of the difference was the joint venture-type dynamic. It had a very nice fourth quarter. There is a little bit of an uptick in the fourth quarter associated LUMA, which just has to do with the timing of kind of internal administrative costs rather than anything associated with the fixed fee itself. On a go-forward basis, I would tell you that it's -- that range that I provided, $45 million to $50 million, is a little bit of the increment associated with the joint venture contribution and fairly close to our original expectations for the remaining LUMA. Yes. I think you've said it fine. The only thing I'd add additional color, you could think all way back to when we did the original deal announcement for the largest portion of a decade, Blattner has been able to operate at a double-digit EBITDA. They had some very good performance within the last few years, kind of pressing that number up a little bit. But we look to kind of those historical dynamics to think about our multiyear expectations. So consistent with the '22 and in the outer-years, we think they continue to operate it was double-digit EBITDA. Aggregate for the segment, we think we've tried to be prudent on how to think about that in '22 when you think about it at the operating level of that 9%. I think that between the Blattner execution as well as our own, as we execute through contingencies, that gives us the ability to see a margin expansion. Duke made reference to it within our prepared remarks. We do believe that there's a bit more variability that you'll see within the segment. There's a smaller number of overall projects as compared to, as an example, the larger remaining electric power group as a whole, which can create a bit of variability in the timing to work, but largely very confident in our ability to execute. Yes. I don't know that I have anything too incremental other than kind of we comment on the things we said earlier. The Blattner dynamic, again, in the last 10 years has operated at a double-digit margin profile. That gives us the multiyear confidence. More specifically, again, the more recent period, they've executed quite strongly above that.  So yes, do we believe that we can see an upward potential against our guidance on a multiyear basis? I think the answer is yes. Whether that be because of our legacy electric operations that are now within this group, we think that we continue to see double-digit operating income-type performance of some of those legacy operations and then now thinking about Blattner. So we remain quite confident in our ability to execute on those margins with the level of upside opportunity. But we want to see the mix of work, right? There's a procurement component of it that can put pressure on margins. So very much, I think that it's the right thing to be looking at this year and being kind of prudent guidance. We want to get more visibility. And on a go-forward basis, very confident in our ability to execute at this level and then giving us the upside opportunities as we execute through contingencies. Yes. The only thing I'd comment to is that thinking all the way back to a pre-COVID environment, we actually were guiding to a similar type of margin expectations. And so it's just taking us down in a couple of years to get through both on the industrial, Canada and Australia. So I'd argue that we're very similar to where we were in a pre-COVID environment. And I think this is a good step towards us getting to that upper single digits we've been talking about being able to return to as we look forward on a multiyear basis."

With that, I would like to now turn the call over to Mr. Duke Austin, Quanta's President and CEO. Duke?\nDuke Austin: Thanks Kip. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Quanta Services Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today, I will provide operational and strategic commentary and will then turn it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer. We will provide a review of our third quarter results and full year 2021 financial expectations. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions. This morning, we reported solid third quarter results, which included a number of record financial metrics, including revenues, adjusted EBITDA, and earnings per share. Additionally, total backlog of $17 billion at the end of the quarter was also a record, which we believe reflects the benefits of our collaborative approach with the customers, favorable in market dynamics, and continued advancement of our long-term growth strategies. As many of you are aware, several weeks ago, we completed the previously announced acquisition of Blattner, which is a premier utility-scale renewable energy infrastructure solutions provider in North America with decades of experience and a strong safety culture. We believe the energy to transition in North America is on the cusp of a significant acceleration, and that moving to a carbon neutral economy will require sizeable and decade's long investment in renewable generation and related infrastructure. We believe this transaction fits Quanta in a unique position to enable the energy infrastructure for North America's energy transition. Since announcing our intention to acquirer Blattner in early September, customer reactions and conversations across our customer base have been overwhelmingly positive and supportive. Further, we previously commented about how remarkably similar Quanta and Blattner are, operationally and culturally, which has become increasingly apparent through working with the Blattner management team on integration. We were all excited about our combined growth opportunities when we first announced the transaction. And I can tell you that today, we're even more excited and increasingly confident in the value proposition, innovative solutions, and growth synergy opportunities that Quanta and Blattner are positioned to provide existing and new customers. Now, turning the call to our operating results. Our Electric Power Solutions operations continue to perform well with record revenues and strong margins driven by robust demand for our services, solid and safe execution, high utilization of our resources and operational excellence. We're proud of our execution and confident that our strong market position will allow us to capitalize on future opportunities created by a favorable long-term trends driving utility investment, and demand for our comprehensive solutions. Demand for grid modernization, system hardening, and renewable energy interconnection services remain active. And discussions around opportunities for our electric vehicle infrastructure installation, and program management capabilities continue to advance. Our electric power backlog remains strong, driven primarily by significant multiyear master service agreements with utilities, which adds to the substantial MSA backlog growth we generated in the first half of this year. During the quarter, Hurricane Ida made landfall over Louisiana, which ultimately left 1.2 million customers across 8 States without power, including 1 million outages in Louisiana alone. One of deployed significant resource is to support utility customers whose electric power infrastructure was damaged or destroyed by the hurricane, including more than 2,500 line workers and front-end support services and engineering staff. Our comprehensive response resulted in record emergency restoration revenue and highlights our ability to quickly mobilize substantial resources to support our customers in times of need. Our customers continue to advance their efforts to achieve carbon neutrality over the coming decades, which is planned to be achieved and large part through increasing renewable generation investment. We believe public policy and that the positive general sentiment supporting a greener environment will drive North America's power generation mix increasingly towards renewables over the near and longer-term. Blattner's utility-scale renewable generation solutions, coupled with Quanta's complimentary and holistic grid solutions, creates a unique value proposition and opportunity to collaborate with our customers to shape their energy transition initiatives. For example, Blattner is currently constructing more than 30 utility-scale renewable energy projects across the country and another Quanta Company is currently working on the largest solar powered battery storage project in North America. Additionally, we're seeing accelerated demand for our services that enable renewable generation, including transmission interconnections and substations. We continue to scale our communication operations and progress our strategy. For example, we have developed a wireless capabilities and are expanding our wireless services into certain markets. Communications revenues grew significantly in the third quarter as compared to last year. And though we incurred higher costs in certain jobs due to descoping of certain contracts and project closeouts which impacted profitability for these operations, these issues were not meaningful to the overall electric power segment or Quanta as a whole. Nevertheless, demand for our communication services remains high and the majority of our communication operations are performing at or near our double-digit margin targets. Our underground utility and infrastructure solutions segment generally performed well in the quarter, despite being impacted by work disruptions along the Gulf Coast due to Hurricane Ida and work inefficiencies associated with the recent surge of the COVID-19 Delta variant in certain areas. We continue to experience solid demand for our gas utility and pipeline integrity services, which are driven by regulated spend to modernize systems, reduced methane emissions, and certain environmental compliance, and improved safety and reliability. We expect our industrial services to strengthen through next year along with the continued recovery of the global economy and demand for refined products, as well as the return of our customer maintenance and capital spending that was previously deferred due to the effects of COVID-19 on the downstream market. Looking to the coming years, we believe the opportunity Quanta has with customers in this segment as they increasingly pursue strategies to reduce their carbon footprint and diversify their operations and assets towards greener business opportunities may be underestimated. There are several examples of such initiatives and project opportunities. Gas utilities are implementing system modernization initiatives that position them to blend hydrogen into their natural gas flow. To that end, Quanta is working with several gas utility customers on hydrogen pilot programs. Certain refiners are building renewable and bio-fuel processing facilities, which could create opportunities for our Industrial services. Natural gas power plants are also exploring blending hydrogen with natural gas as a fuel source to power their turbines, which could create opportunities for our Pipeline Infrastructure services. Lastly, we are actively pursuing carbon sequestration projects in the U.S., which could utilize our Engineering and Pipeline Construction services. In Canada, Pembina Pipeline and TC Energy have proposed a plan to jointly develop a carbon transportation and sequestration system called the Alberta Carbon Grid, which is envisioned to serve as the backbone of Alberta's carbon capture utilization and storage industry and could include participation by other pipeline companies. The initiative with leverage existing pipelines requires a new pipeline and facility investments, which when fully constructed, would be capable of transporting more than 20 million tons of carbon dioxide annually. The North American energy transition is just that, a transition process. The role our Electric Power Infrastructure Solutions play in the energy transition is clear. However, we believe Quanta's underground utility and infrastructure solutions operations could play in an evolving and increasing role, in this transition in support of our customers carbon reduction initiatives. Progress continues in Washington DC towards enacting the bipartisan infrastructure bill and to build back better plan. As commented on prior calls, our positive multi-year outlook and strategic plan are not reliant on either of these packages. But if either or both enacted, they could provide incremental opportunity for Quanta over both the near and longer term. These packages include funding and policies to encourage new infrastructure development and modernization and several of our core markets. In particular to build back better plan currently contains policy and [Indiscernible] representing the largest clean energy legislative package in American history. While additional political steps are still required, we're encouraged by what we've seen recently. We have profitably grown the Company and executed well this year and expecting to continue to do so. We are confident in the strategic initiatives we are executing on, like the better position we have in the marketplace and our positive multi-year outlook. We also believe that our business and opportunities for profitable growth in 2022 are gaining momentum, driven by our solution-based approach, the growth of programmatic spending with existing and new customers, opportunities for larger electric transmission projects, the addition of Blattner's renewable generation solutions, and the opportunity for recovery of certain portions of our business that have been affected by the global pandemic. Looking to the medium and longer-term, as energy transition and carbon reduction initiatives are increasingly implemented, and addition to the primary drivers of our business currently, we believe our visibility could increase and our growth opportunities could expand and accelerate. We believe the infrastructure investment and renewable generation necessary to support these initiatives are still in the early stages of deployment and that this is arguably the most exciting time in Quanta's history. We are focused on operating the business for the long term and expect to continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class field leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's base business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's diversity, unique operating model, and entrepreneurial mindset for and the foundation, that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO for his review of our third quarter results and 2021 expectations. Derrick\nDerrick Jensen: Thanks, Duke. And good morning, everyone. Today we announced record third quarter 2021 revenues the $3.4 billion. Net income attributable to common stock was $174 million or $1.21 per diluted share and adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure was $1.48. Our Electric Power revenues were $2.3 billion, a quarterly record and a 10% increase when compared to the third quarter of 2020. This increase was driven by continued favorable dynamics across our core utility and communications markets and associated demand for our services. Also contributing to the increase were revenues from acquired businesses of approximately $55 million. Electric segment operating income margins in 3Q21 were 12.4%, slightly lower than 12.7% in 3Q20, but better than our initial expectations. Operating margins benefitted from record emergency restoration revenues of approximately $230 million, which typically present opportunities for higher margins than our normal base business activities due to higher utilization, as well as overall solid execution across our electric operations. Additionally, segment margins benefited from approximately $10 million of income associated with our LUMA joint venture. Otherwise, a slight reduction in operating margin versus prior year was attributable to normal job variability and mix of work and our communication operations, which delivered mid-single-digit margins during the quarter. As a reminder, last year's third quarter Electric Power results also included, what was at the time, a record level of emergency restoration revenues. Underground Utility and Infrastructure segment revenues were $1.02 billion for the quarter, 12% higher than 3Q '20 due primarily to increased revenues from gas distribution and industrial services. Though our operations experienced increased activity year-over-year, current quarter revenues and margins in our industrial operations were negatively impacted by disruptions along the Gulf Coast attributable to Hurricane Ida, and both our industrial and non-U.S. markets within this segment remain pressured by COVID-19 dynamics. Third quarter operating income margins for the segment were 6.7%, 107 basis points lower than 3Q 20, but generally in line with our expectations. Margins for the year -- margin for the third quarter of 2020, benefited from favorable adjustments on certain larger pipeline projects with both scope changes and favorable closeouts in the quarter. Our total backlog was $17 billion at the end of the third quarter, the fifth consecutive quarter we posted record total backlog. Additionally, 12 month backlog of $9.8 billion also represents a quarterly record. Our backlog growth continues to be driven primarily by multi-year MSA programs with North American utilities, which we believe reinforces the repeatable and sustainable nature of the largest portion of our revenues and earnings. The Blattner acquisition occurred after September 30th, and accordingly, their backlog is not included in our current reportedly levels. However, the total backlog from Blattner and the other 4Q acquisitions is approximately $1.8 billion. For the third quarter of 2021, we generated negative free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, of $40 million, compared to $70 million of positive free cash flow in 3Q '20. Net cash provided by operating activities during the third quarter of 2021, although largely in line with our expectations, was down due to higher revenues and corresponding increases in working capital demands compared to prior year, which benefited from lower revenues and a corresponding lower use of working capital. Also, 3Q '20 benefited from the deferral of $41 million of payroll taxes in accordance with the Cares Act, 50% of which are due by December 31, 2021, with the remainder due by December 31, 2022. Partially offsetting these dynamics was a favorable impact of increased earnings as compared to 3Q '20. Days sales outstanding, or DSO, measured 89 days for the third quarter of 2021, an increase of 7 days compared to the third quarter of 2020, and an increase of 6 days compared to December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to elevated working capital requirements associated with 2 large Canadian transmission projects driving an increase in contract assets. Specific to the Canadian projects, both continue to encounter work stoppage protocols in Canada associated with COVID mitigation, as well as delays attributable to, among other things, wildfires impacting access to worksite. These dynamics created substantial inefficiencies and production delays resulting in increased project costs. We are in active discussions with both customers regarding change orders associated with these increased costs, some of which have already been approved, with the remaining amounts being pursued in the normal course. In addition, normal variability in work production and associated payment cycles across our operations contributed to slightly higher DSO in the quarter. As Duke discussed, and as we previously announced, we closed on the acquisition on October 13th. Prior to the closing in September 2021, we issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes with a weighted average interest rate of 2.12%. Receiving net proceeds of $1.48 billion. Accordingly, as of quarter end, we had approximately $1.7 billion of cash. Subsequent to the quarter, we amended our credit agreement to, among other things, provide a term loan facility of $750 million, which was fully drawn and combined with the net proceeds from the senior notes offering to fund a substantial majority of the cash consideration payable to the Blattner shareholders at closing. Our highlight that our financial strategy and consistent performance have allowed us to maintain investment-grade ratings subsequent to these financing transactions. From a capital allocation perspective, Blattner represents the largest acquisition in Quanta's history and a strategic opportunity to expand the solutions we deliver to support North America's transition to carbon-neutral energy infrastructure. Capital deployment for strategic acquisitions has always been a key part of our strategy, but as we've discussed in the past, our first priority for capital allocation remains supporting the working capital and equipment needs of our existing operations. While the debt issued to support the Blattner acquisition moved our leverage profile above our target range, it remains well below the financial covenant requirements in our credit facility, and we believe we can efficiently deliver, while continuing to create shareholder value through our dividend and repurchase programs, as well as strategic acquisitions. To the date of this earnings release, we've acquired approximately $64 million worth of stock since the beginning of the year as part of our repurchase program and we'll continue to evaluate potential acquisitions that fit our strategic objectives. To that end, during the third quarter and through the date of the earnings release, in addition to Blattner, we acquired 3 additional businesses and made a minority investment in another, for total combined consideration of approximately $110 million. These incremental transactions further enhance our ability to deliver comprehensive infrastructure solutions to our North American utility and communications customers. Turning to our guidance. Our outlook for the remainder of the year reflects the strength of our core utility backed operation, which continued to deliver solid results with robust year-over-year growth. However, the results of companies acquired during and subsequent to the third quarter, including Blattner's operations, will be included in our consolidated financial statements, which makes comparability to our previous expectations challenging. It should be noted that we are in the very early stages of establishing Blattner's specific opening balance sheet, which includes assessing the positions of our ongoing projects as of the closing and dialing the tangible and intangible assets acquired. The results of those ongoing efforts will have a meaningful impact on Blattner 's forth quarter contribution, which we've attempted to address in the range of our fourth-quarter expectations for the acquired businesses. That said, excluding the expected contributions from the recently acquired companies, we now expect full-year revenues from our legacy operations, to range between $12.15 to 12.35 Billion. Due to the strength of our consolidated performance for the first nine months of the year, we are increasing our expectations for the contribution of our legacy operations to adjusted EBITDA, to range between $1.17 billion and $1.2 billion. With the midpoint of the range representing an increase over our previous guidance and 13% growth when compared to 2020's record adjusted EBITDA. As it relates to our current reportable segments. While we continue to evaluate how these change may change with the addition of Blattner, I wanted to provide some color on our current expectations compared to our previous commentary, again, excluding contributions from the recently acquired business. We continue to expect full-year revenues to range between $8.7 and $8.8 billion for our legacy electric segment operation. However, based on strong performance through the first 9 months of the year, and continued confidence in our ability to execute on the opportunities across the segment, we've increased our full-year margin range for the segment, for 2021 operating margins expected to come in slightly above 11%. Our full-year expectations for the underground utility and infrastructure solution segment, however, have slightly moderated due primarily to lower third quarter revenue levels than previously expected. Accordingly, we are reducing our full-year expectations for the segment, for its revenue is now expected to range between $3.45 and $3.55 billion while segment margins are now expected to range between 4.5% and 5%, which includes the $23.6 million provision for credit loss recognized in the second quarter, a nearly 70 basis point negative impact on a full-year basis. With regard to the recently acquired companies, operations I spoke of earlier, including Blattner, we expect post-closing revenue contributions for the year to range between $400 and $500 million and adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP measure, ranging between $40 million and $60 million. Accordingly, including the expected contributions from the recently acquired companies, we now expect our consolidated full-year revenues to range between $12.55 billion and $12.85 billion and adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure of between $1.21 and $1.26 billion. Corporate and unallocated costs will increase significantly primarily due to the acquired big companies. We currently estimate amortization expense for the full year will be between $149 million and $159 million, with $60 million to $70 million attributable to the recently acquired companies. Stock compensation expense for the full year is now expected to be approximately $89 million, with approximately $2 million attributable to restricted stock units issued to employees in the acquired companies. Acquisition and integration costs are expected to be approximately $26 million for the fourth quarter, resulting in approximately $36 million for the year. This includes approximately $10.5 million of expenses associated with change of control payments awarded to certain employees of Blattner, by the selling shareholders, which require expense accounting, as they have a one-year service period requirement. We expect a comparable dollar amount will be accrued each quarter post-closing until the one-year anniversary of the transaction, at which time the payments will be made to the employee. We intend to include this amount as an adjustment to arrive at our adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA, both non-GAAP measures. Below the line, we expect interest expense for the year to be around $67 million, which includes approximately $16 million of incremental interest expense associated with debt financing used to fund the cash portion of the Blattner acquisition. Additionally, we now expect our full-year tax rate to be around 24%, reflecting a slight reduction from our prior expectations due primarily to a favorable shift in the mix of earnings between various taxing jurisdictions. As a result, our expectation for full-year diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock is now between $3.20 and $3.40 and our increased expectation for adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock, a non-GAAP measure is now between $4.62 and $4.87. On a consolidated basis, we now expect free cash flow for the year to range between $350 and $500 million. This slight decrease is primarily due to potential timing of payments associated with emergency restoration efforts, as well as the likelihood that the dynamics impacting the larger Canadian projects continued to pressure DSO in the fourth quarter. Additionally, while we expect Blattner will be meaningfully accretive to our cash flow profile on an annual basis, we expect certain favorable billing positions at the time of acquisition could unwind as Blattner incurs costs in the fourth quarter to finish projects for which they've already received payments. This dynamic could minimize Blattner's cash contribution during the quarter, which we factored into our range of expectation. As we've stated in prior quarters, our quarterly free cash flow is subject to sizable movements due to various customer and project dynamics that can occur in the normal course of operations. For additional information, please refer to our Outlook Summary, which can be found in the financial info section of our IR website at quantaservices.com. Overall, we continue to believe we are in the early stages of a significant infrastructure investment cycle. And the acquisition of Battner further differentiates us in the markets we serve and expands our ability to deliver solutions to support North America's transition to carbon-neutral energy infrastructure. We remain confident in our ability to execute against the opportunities in front of us while maintaining the financial flexibility to opportunistically deploy capital to deliver long-term shareholder value. This concludes our formal presentation and we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. We ask you to please ask one question and one follow-up then return to the queue. [Operator instructions] One moment, please, while we poll for questions. And as a reminder, that's one question, one follow-up, then please return to the queue. Our first question today is coming from Chad Dillard from Bernstein. Your line is now live.\nChad Dillard: Hi. Good morning, guys.\nDerrick Jensen: Good morning.\nChad Dillard: I just want to zero in on some of the areas of business that underperformed expectations of the quarter. I guess, first of all, on the communication side, you guys talked about some higher costing jobs impacting margins. First of all, can you quantify that? And then do you see that coming back on track as we go into the fourth quarter '22? And then on the Industrial Services side, I think you talked about some storm issues impacting results. Is that business still profitable or was that business profitable in the third quarter? And just lastly, on the Canadian projects that you called out, just want to confirm whether there were -- were charges taken or was this just a working capital swing and were those DSOs normalized?\nDuke Austin: Hey, good morning. I think when we look at the Telecom business, we did call it out [Indiscernible] we're operating from mid single-digits instead of upper-single to double-digits when we looked at it. So it's not performing terrible. It's not where we want it to be. The macro market is very good and robust. The closeouts on a few projects are very difficult but the large majority or the vast majority of the business is performing in those double-digit margins and offsetting anything there as minimal, as we said on the call, from a charge standpoint or really just cost standpoint when we close things out. We'll go from there, but I do think we added backlog. We continue to build backlog in this segment. We see a long runway there and we did start up some wireless capabilities, it has some cost in it. In general, incidental to the Company, incidental to the segment, we like the market long-term, we will get into double-digits there over time. Canada, when we looked at Canada, I think in general, the projects are performing well. We still see some COVID effects there to the Delta variant on some of those projects. There is some delays in getting billing cycles, billing points there as we run through a project, I think. So that it's more of a billing issue of when can we get things build versus any problems with the project or charges. We did not take charges on Canadian projects. We performed very well. And the storm, yes, it did have a positive effect to the electric segment. It does when we get storms like that, it was up a little bit bigger than last year from the standpoint. Fairly large storm for us, I think it shows our collaborative effect with the client, how we've got in and work our front-end services, we're still working the storm for our clients. It just shows the longevity of the Company and what we've done on the front side of the business to collaborate with the client, to get things up faster, to do a nice job there for them. And I think we performed very well there. Offset, but it did have some impact on some of our underground segments as it always does when it comes in. So you get some offset and you also come off some larger work to go pick up storm. So those things offset some in the quarter.\nChad Dillard: That's helpful. And then just my second question is a little bit longer term. It has to do with labor. Clearly there's a lot of work coming down the pipe to de -carbonize the U.S. and you guys have the Northwest Lineman College. But just trying to understand just your strategy for scaling labor. Maybe you could start off with how much throughput do you have into your ranks from Northwest Lineman College. And then how can you scale that program to meet that future labor needs? And then lastly, maybe you can talk about whatever innovations or technology you have to minimize or actually improve labor productivity of your workers and your business.\nDuke Austin: [Indiscernible] I think if you're just now trying to scale labor, you're long ways behind. We've spent about $150 million over the last 5 years and we're way ahead of that. So in my mind, we've done that. We've proven that we grow the Company, that's who we are. This is craft skilled labor, and not labor. In my mind, we self-perform about 85-90% of our business for a reason. And it's this reason, when you get tight labor markets, we can perform, we could perform on time, on budget, and give our client what they're asking for which is certainty. And we're doing that on a daily basis. That's why we're collaborating, that's why you're seeing expansion. As far as productivity, I'll put our margins up against it and show the growth of the Company, the growth of our internal labor force. The 3,000 or 5,000 that we add every year to that labor force is proof that we can do it, we can scale it. We are scaling it and the productivity speaks for itself, and the margins.\nChad Dillard: Thanks, I'll hop back in.\nOperator: Thanks. Our next question today is coming from Alex Rygiel from B. Riley. Your line is now live.\nAlex Rygiel : Thank you, gentlemen. As it relates to higher DSOs due to the cost in delays on the two Canadian electrical transmission projects, can you address your confidence in collecting on these and what the likely timing of that will be?\nDuke Austin: Yeah. So on the DSOs there in Canada and our likelihood. Canada has traditionally had larger DSOs and projects are bigger. Some of the time frames in the way that milestone billings go in. It's typically been this way. We have a high degree of confidence and probability in collecting outlet. Derrick, comment on the DSOs.\nDerrick Jensen: Yeah. Exactly. What I would comment on is that from a timing perspective right now. I think it would be post year-end, which is reflected in our cash flow commentary. I think it is probably going to be more in the first quarter and second quarter of next year.\nDuke Austin: Both projects with longstanding clients, we have great relationships with that I believe ultimately, we're in very good shape. We're quite confident.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Sean Eastman from KeyBanc, your line is now live.\nSean Eastman: Hi Gentlemen, thanks for taking my questions. I feel like coming through earnings here just a lot of concerns around the renewables supply chain. I know you guys obviously just completed a big acquisition tied to renewable development into next year. I guess just in light of what you're seeing in the supply chain, could you maybe update us on how much cushion you think you have in that 2022 Blattner outlook that you framed back in September. Do you think that outlook is bias to the upside or is that looking increasingly realistic at this point?\nDuke Austin: If you said 2,5 to 2,7, we standby it. We standby today. We know more about the Company today than we did when we talked about it before. We feel highly confident in those numbers. And I would just say, in general, yes, there is some supply chain noise, is what I would call it, and I think us having the breadth of Quanta, the breadth of Blattner is only from my standpoint helps us to add to who we are. It adds to how we can go execute. And I want to also say, when we think about Blattner and we think about this long term, we're looking 20 years and we've given guidance out. Not only do we stand by the 2-6 2-7 that we've given, which also gave a 2025 guidance of 3.6. We stand by that even more today.\nSean Eastman: Okay. Fair enough, Duke. Thanks for that. And maybe you could comment on how Luma is trending relative to what they need to be doing to capture those performance incentives. Could that be upside in the fourth quarter? I'm just not exactly sure how that works. And obviously, a lot of noise in the headlines still. So great to get an update there.\nDuke Austin: Yes. So Luma, we expected noise in the headlines. I think we've said that from the start, and as you transition to these large transitions on an island, it does have some noise to it. We're performing very well underneath the governor, the government is very much behind it. What we're doing is the right thing. We will transition that all into a modern system. We're doing so every single day, you can't get the payments on the upside of those payments until we get into a full contract which doesn't go into a full contract until bankruptcy's declared out of bankruptcy, and then it goes into a 15-year contract. But as we stand today, we are in a contract that just has not started on the 15 years until they come out of bankruptcy. There was some favorable rulings on the bankruptcy proceedings in the last week or so, I believe. Really good stuff going on underneath, a little noisy on the top, primarily around the generation which we don't control. I feel confident in our ability to perform there and what we're doing for the people that [Indiscernible]\nSean Eastman: Okay. Thanks a lot, Duke. I'll turn it over.\nOperator: Thanks. The next question today is coming from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\nNeil Mehta: Good morning, team. I want to spend a little time on transmission and there is breaking news of the whole thing of the NECEC transmission project. And do you [Indiscernible] foresee some risks the electric power top-line growth in the future due to regulatory concerns around large project activity in transmission, and any of the current projects that you're working on facing similar risks that we should be aware of?\nDuke Austin: I look at it like this. I saw [Indiscernible] most of our clients either add to their $20 billion of backlog over time, of what they're going to build in the CapEx and OpEx over the quarter. Almost every single one of them added to what they're trying to do from an energy transition. The large projects may get headlines and people want to talk about them. We're right around the edges on every one of them. They are additive to anything we said. The 85% of our business that still exist today, is -- the MSA work, those capital spend, there's undergrounding, what Energy said yesterday on [Indiscernible], those kind of things and with the tight labor supply. So any headline you're reading or what you read into something on large projects. It's not affecting the underlying business in our growth trajectories. We've given good guidance on that. The 85% mid-upper single-digits, you can look at our track record over the last 5-6 years and see what it looks like. I expect that going forward.\nNeil Mehta: That's really clear and thank you for saying that. The follow-up is around the budget reconciliation package. Would spending from both the budget reconciliation package, depending on what form it takes, and the bipartisan infrastructure build directly drive project activity that Quanta could be involved in? And that's over and above the base case growth that you talk about.\nDuke Austin: I think you're going through energy transition, as we said. And I think the sentiment around North America and around what we're hearing, even in Canada, you're seeing more and more transition. And as you go into EVs, as you go into your renewables coming on, and you are also doubling load over time. And I think that's the unknown, is people don't understand that you're doubling load, and you're going to a carbon free fuel source. So as you do those things, you're going to need hydrogen, you're going to need tons of renewables. And I think in order to do that, you got to how transmission and we're sitting in very, very good spaces in all these areas. And it allows us through policy or without policy, we'll continue to see that sentiment move forward. That's what we see. I do think when both the five and plan. The plans that we've seen are additive to anything we said.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks, Duke.\nDuke Austin: Absolutely.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live.\nJamie Cook: Hi. Good morning. I guess, two questions. One sort of short-term once or a longer-term. First, Derrick, can you help us understand the Industrial business or stronghold business. What is implied for the revenue in sort EBITDA, if any contribution in your 2021 guidance and just the opportunity for that business to be more accretive to margins and earnings as we look to 2022. And then my second question Duke, just longer term is, as we think about good long-term secular trends. You have Blattner, infrastructure etc. Could you sort of help us reframe how you're thinking about the electric power margins, over the longer-term, and is there more of an upward bias versus how you've thought about margins historically? Thank you.\nDuke Austin: And good morning, Jamie. I will take a little bit of [Indiscernible] and I'll let Derrick comment on the numbers. But in general, what we see is, we see an increase in that business in the fourth quarter a bit. I would say you have a higher oil price, so they'll be reluctant to do much in this environment. But as we go into next year, we see a real strong turnaround year. We believe that the business is coming back meaningfully. I feel confident in the next year on the business, but I'll let Derrick comment on the fourth quarter.\nDerrick Jensen: Yeah, as it relates to -- go ahead, Jamie.\nJamie Cook: Yes. Sorry, go ahead. Go ahead, Derrick.\nDerrick Jensen: I was just going to say, relative to the fourth quarter, I think it would be slightly profitable, which is what we have said, that they could be back and returning into a degree of profitability overall. That group is at slightly north of $500 million for '21 going into '22. I think we see it having the ability to start to return to the degree of normalcy that we talked about in the past. Those numbers have been north of a $700 million number. I don't know quite yet. It's too early to comment as to whether we'll get into those type levels, but I think we'll definitely see an increase. And we would see that it would be largely returning to some of that historical profitability again. I want to see how this fourth quarter plays out though.\nJamie Cook: And sir, can you remind me how you're thinking about historic profitability for strongholds?\nDerrick Jensen: Historically, they were a double-digit EBITDA.\nJamie Cook: Okay, So there's potential for that in 2022?\nDerrick Jensen: I do believe there is potential for that. Yeah. We are already [Indiscernible]. It will be [Indiscernible] guidance, so we'll see how it starts perform. But yeah, I think in the range of the guidance you'll could see that. As far as the electric power segment, I think when we put stronghold in -- when we put stronghold in, I mean, we see a double-digit margin Company. And as we look at it going forward, we believe that the segment will perform in those areas. Obviously, as we go into '22 we will be prudent about how we guide as we always are. We've got to get through whether we have a lot of [Indiscernible] performing in the field. And I think in general when we think about it, the business is healthy. It's in a good secular macro-environment. We really like where we sit. We think we're doing great things collaboratively. And anything that Blattner has is added to us. And again, their culture and what we're doing internally as far as melting together and looking for opportunity, I can only say that I feel stronger about it today than I did October 3rd.\nJamie Cook: But, I guess my question is, do you see longer-term in upward bias? Is it more profit dollar growth versus margin? Is that the way to think about it?\nDuke Austin: I think it's more -- from my standpoint, we're trying to deliver cash to the bottom line. And the returns, as far as capital, those kind of things, we'll operate in the same kind of profile we have in the past on the Electric segment. Blattner is additive from a standpoint -- from a CapEx standpoint on a return basis. So I -- they're accretive.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Marc Bianchi from Cowen. Your line is now live.\nMarc Bianchi: Hey, thanks. I wanted to talk about the acquired businesses and what's implied for fourth quarter and try to understand that in the context of the Blattner guidance for '21, or '22 excuse me. I think if I take this fourth quarter revenue from the acquired businesses, it's like a run rate of $1.8 billion annually. And the Blattner guide, I think you said earlier, 2,5 to 2,7 for '22, so is there just a lot of seasonality in that business? Is there -- are there some projects moving around or perhaps it's just conservatism? I'm curious if you could help us understand that progression a little better.\nDerrick Jensen: Yeah, sure. Partly, it's only a partial quarter contribution that we did not acquire the Company exactly at the quarter, so there's only a part of October, so that's a component of it. Two, exactly. It's unfair to annualize a given quarter much like it is on Quanta. We have a degree of seasonality. You can't take any given quarter and annualize that. There are movements of projects and seasonality. That is still yet the case as well for Blattner and any of the companies that we acquire. We still yet feel very comfortable with the 2.5-2.7 original guidance for Blattner irrespective of this quarter contribution. And then lastly, there is a bit of just [Indiscernible] at starts and stops of projects, affecting the number. And then probably the last point that you raised is that we have been trying to be a bit prudent with the contribution because of the fact that we have, just outflows the transaction, we got opening balance sheet work to do. Looking at how some of that opening balance sheet will play out to the rest of those contracts. So 4 or 5 different factors there, but net-net, we feel very comfortable still with 2,5-2,7 annual '22 contribution.\nMarc Bianchi: Okay. Super, thanks for that. Maybe looking longer-term, Duke, you mentioned CO_2 and hydrogen pipeline opportunity work down the road. How big could that business be for you, maybe on a on a percentage of what you do today or maybe what the dollar addressable market might look like, and how does that differ from the work you do today on a maybe per mile basis or however you want to talk about it, is it much larger in terms of total dollars per mile a pipeline or what ever the scope of the work is?\nDuke Austin: No, I don't think so. When we look at it, we're really just thinking about it. It's part of the segment and much like you would think about LNG when you're moving LNG or you're doing things. Really what you're seeing is the transition of infrastructure, where our role is in this infrastructure transition as we move into the future. I mean, I think we just sit right in the middle of it on anything you can think about is that transition. Whether they need -- they're going to need pipe to move it and they're also going to need pipe to move hydrogen and into blend into natural gas, and I think when you start blending that, you have different infrastructure. So all these different things that we're bringing into the markets: batteries, EV, renewables, technology with 5G, all those things are certainly where we sit. And as we sit in the nucleus of that and we think about it, as we think about Blattner and where they sit in all this, that transition is something that Quanta is really focused on from a labor standpoint, a technology standpoint, and how we help and collaborate with the client, not only from where they're at today, but how they transition. So at the very front end of that is where we're playing and it's early in hydrogen, I do think there's going to be a significant amount of opportunity going forward. But we're already seeing where turbines in power plants on gas are starting to blend and even spec, hydrogen to some degree. So it's going to be a piece of the nucleus of how you regulate and keep the grid balanced. The bigger issue with the grid is to balance it. Signed, when, and then the balance thereof so hydrogen will play a part in it.\nMarc Bianchi: Okay, thanks very much.\nDuke Austin: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question today is coming from Noelle Dilts from Stifle. Your line is now live.\nNoelle Dilts : Hi guys, good morning.\nDuke Austin: Good morning.\nNoelle Dilts : I wanted to just -- good morning. I just wanted to touch on, from a very high level maybe, how we should think about the timing or cadence of work in 2022. I have 2 questions related to that. The first is, if higher steel or raw material costs are impacting timing at all, are you seeing any projects really pushed to the right? And then second, if you could touch on how we should think about Blattner typical seasonality, would be helpful. Thanks.\nDuke Austin: Yeah, I'll comment on the -- as far as the commodities, we are seeing some escalation in commodity pricing. It has not affected the business, it's not material. I think our scale, our ability to move from project to project, while one, they delay, others are coming in, I just -- the amount, the macro environment there, that's part of the reason you want to scale. And then our renewable business or any business that we're in, we want to scale. Scale allows us flexibility, allows us flexibility with the client. And also our buying power. I mean, when you look at Fleet and how will we manage through Fleet, there's constraints to others with Fleet and our ability to really work with the client, work with our customers, and our suppliers on that has given us really, what I think, a competitive advantage going forward. I'll let Derrick comment on the rest.\nDerrick Jensen: And one other point I guess is that to the extent that there's anything for fluctuations in the timing of Blattner and any of that would be, from a supply perspective, could lead to projects pushing to the right at any given point in time. Not necessarily in our minds impacting a profitability type dynamic but could push things around. But having said that from overall seasonality, I think I'd probably say it's reasonably similar to our overall Electric power operations. Probably really a little bit lower in the first, rising in the second, stronger in the third and in the fourth being either comparable to or having a slight decline, depending upon the timing of any of these supply type dynamics. But largely, I think I'd say it's similar to our historical electric power patterns.\nDuke Austin: I would say our commentary on Blattner on the numbers that we've given you based upon us and whether we are going into next year or not. [Indiscernible] any supply chain issue, we are highly confident in those numbers.\nNoelle Dilts : Okay, great. That's really helpful. And then second, I just wanted to clarify one point, within underground utility and infrastructure. On the LDC business, I know you said you're still seeing strong demand there. When you mentioned the COVID impact to margins, was that mostly a strong hold or did you also see that at any LDC business? And if you could comment on where margins are running today or this year versus where you expect them to be over the next couple of years. Thanks.\nDerrick Jensen: Actually, some of the other COVID dynamics were a little bit in Canada, London, Australia, and then yes, in some of the industrial side pressuring it, not really so much on the LDC side. I think we're seeing normal operations for the most part on the LDC side. And then from a margins perspective, we're continuing to see that comparable to what we've been speaking to, trending towards getting into that upper single-digit overall as we go forward. We feel confident in our ability to [Indiscernible] that with LDC operation.\nDuke Austin: Yeah. No, I would say to our Canadian operations, I think were probably the most affected with COVID, certainly. And when we look at it, we look at it going forward and we've started some nice projects up there and I think we're in from a good shape on the GAAP side. And as far as on the electric side, we had commentary around that and obviously we've got -- the health and safety of these employees are what we're really focused on, to make sure they're safe every day and we've given them great mitigation and great plans to be safe. We've done that through the Company and have not missed work yet for two years. And I fully expect us to operate right through it and we're going to work with our client on any mandate there may be in geographically or holistically.\nNoelle Dilts : Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, in the interest of time and to accommodate additional questions, we ask you please limit yourself to one question. Our next question is coming from Brent Thielman from D.A. Davidson. Your line is now live.\nBrent Thielman: Hey, thank you. Thanks for taking the questions. I just want to follow up on the gas utility portion of underground, maybe just give the latest and greatest in terms of what you're seeing among customers for modernization programs going forward. Do you still think that portion of the business can achieve the growth rates you've seen a bit of last several years going forward?\nDuke Austin: We like the business long term. There's mandates around methane gas release, cast-iron replacements. We've seen some great stuff with hydrogen coming along and we really like the business on the underground. But I want to go back again and say it's a portfolio. If we can build underground electric with gas carriers, that's what we're going to do. We're going to go and really consolidate offices, leverage our capabilities in the field as some gas operations will be performed in underground electric. I'm not really worried about it from the segmentation standpoint. In my mind, we're going to fully utilize our people with the highest impact on the profitability of the Company. And I -- that's what we're focused on, whether it be Telecom, Gas, Electric, some of the equipment is like type of people for the most part, are very much like type. So we can operate throughout our portfolio of our service lines. If we do it properly and leverage our capabilities at the field level, which is that's what this Company is focused on, it's driving the margin of the whole.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Adam Thalhimer from Thompson David, your line is now live.\nAdam Thalhimer : Hey, good morning, guys. Do still think that with the hydrogen and CO_2 lines there's actually less industry pushback?\nDuke Austin: It's a complicated dynamic, whether you go green hydrogen. It's just hard. I would say it's corrosive, it burns hot. There's just that it's different. And I think when we think about it, we're working with the client. And in your early stages, it is a part of the solution. And everybody -- we're going to have to regulate the grid, the load is that we get curves in the load and that load regulation is a big deal and especially without interconnections and the difficulty building transmission. While we talk about it a lot, it's still difficult to build large projects and the underlying underneath has to be very, very robust. And so you get a lot of smaller projects and you get a lot of other things that you can do. So I do think hydrogen is just a piece of what we're trying to accomplish as utilities go into their transitions in this renewable state and are you going to build the transmission as well? It's going to stock on top, it's just a timing thing.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ian Macpherson from Piper Sandler. Your line is now live.\nIan Macpherson : Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. Duke, I heard, I think $110 million of quarter-to-date [Indiscernible] following Blattner. I had imagined that inorganic strategy might tap the brakes a little bit. As we integrate Blattner, not the case, short-term, and I know that's a big part of your DNA and what Quanta does really, really well. But just curious on your thoughts on the merits versus risks of investing more pro-cyclically, now that things are hotter, evaluations are probably hotter, maybe there's more embedded backlog risk and targets you might acquire. So just your thoughts on what the go-forward cadence might look like for additional acquisitions. Thanks.\nDuke Austin: I think when we looked at it, we had some ongoing M&A. And I think that remains to some degree. We've never been out looking for acquisitions. When companies come, they have a strong need forum in a region and I think we've made very good ones and very good acquisition. Again, we're not looking forward. We just made $2.7 billion acquisition and we're going to be prudent about how we manage this Balance Sheet. And I've said all along, we will generate cash and pay down debt. And that's part of who we are, but we're not going to walk away from great companies. We don't feel at all like we've stretched this Balance Sheet given the fact of the macro market and what we see. While we are -- well, I would say yes, will probably tap the breaks a bit. Certainly, we are not going to pass on companies that we believe add value to the shareholders.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question today is coming from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup, your line is now live.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Hey, good morning guys.\nDuke Austin: Good morning.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Duke, I know of even a few years ago you deemphasized large oil and gas pipelines but in the last quarter I think you talked about winning some larger projects in that space and obviously oil prices are higher now. It seems like there are a couple of projects out there that you could bid on. How do you view the more traditional projects these days? Is there an active pipeline? Could there be significant growth in that world?\nDuke Austin: I think when we talked about that last quarter, when we were in construction on some in Canada today. We're opportunistic there. We can operate that business quite profitably. We're just not, in my mind, we decided not to invest in it and not to continue to invest. So that's a little bit different. We can still do a billion dollars in the business, we can do $2 billion in the business from what we have today. So we don't have to invest more in capital. We have the people, we have the things that we can do. As you look at carbon sequestration and all the lines there and all the things that are coming up on hydrogen, it certainly plays into the business and we'll look at it. We have the capabilities entirely. We'll continue to take the opportunities that'll stack onto anything we're doing. Whether it be Canada, the U.S. but there is some nice projects out there and then certainly around the edges on every one of them. But we're not going to take the risk that it's not something that we have to have. And when we guide, it will be $3 to $500 million. I can almost tell you right now. And that's what it'll look like if we do $2 billion great. We'll let you know.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today comes from Michael Dudas from Vertical Research. Your line is now live.\nMichael Dudas : Yes. Thanks. Regarding Duke the capital budgets that your utility clients are putting forth for 2022 I'm certain and beyond. Has there been a significant mix? I'm talking more from the T&D side on hardening resilience relative to new investment replacement. Is that shifting? Are they focusing more on the former? And I'm assuming there is not a major difference in margin or utilization depending on what you guys do for them, but just wanted to -- if you could share your thoughts on that.\nDuke Austin: It's all of the above. So I think when we look at it depends on where you are at geographically, but certainly all of the above [Indiscernible], escalate. We've seen undergrounding certainly come about in a significant way. Those two things are there. I think what's underappreciated is the amount of infrastructure and the modernization necessary on the distribution system to handle the load of [Indiscernible]. When you start putting these cars' batteries on at night and on the distribution load of what it does to the system, I think it's underestimated on the cost and the amount of work that's out there, capital that's necessary to get these systems ready for electric vehicles. I just -- in my mind, it's just underappreciated.\nOperator: Thanks. Our next question is coming from Justin Hauke from Baird. Your line is now live.\nJustin Hauke : Hi, good morning, everyone. I guess my question and thanks for all the questions you've answered. But, on Blattner, just the award activity in 3Q and since. Given that you talked about a lot of solar mix shift for next year relative to the wind projects, I guess, maybe just an update on how things are trending there. And if that mix shift is coming through, and then also it seems like there's been a lot of approvals for offshore wind projects, and I think that's outside of the house that you're looking at. But are there opportunities for you to participate on any of those?\nDuke Austin: When we look at Blattner, I reiterated guidance pretty firmly in the '22 and talked about $3.5 billion to $3.6 billion in '25. The commitment there, we're really looking at megawatts, not projects. And the projects are certainly there if we decided to start, say, the reward we got. I just think it's not valuable to the shareholder nor is it productive. What we're saying is Q6, Q7 next year and $3.6 billion in '25 of top-line [Indiscernible]. That's how we see it. That's how robust it is. So it should give you a good idea of what we're seeing as a Company and how we said and depending on the future in the renewable business. In my mind, that shows where we're at and I think, again, the awards are there. We're certainly with the client, talking to them on a multiyear basis, not just one job. So that's their offshore. It's expensive. I think we have clients that are certainly, have their plans around offshore and we're certainly in there as far as interconnections, things that we we're good at we'll do. But primarily, as it comes on [Indiscernible], I just -- but I've said this a floor, but we have had bad luck with boats and I'm just not a boat fan.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Steven Fisher from UBS. Your line is now live.\nSteven Fisher: Thanks a lot. It sounds like there's a learning curve on Telecom that you're experiencing now and I want to make sure we understand how to set our expectations on that from here as it relates to the margins. What are the different elements of the learning curves you have to get up? And when can we expect that to normalize such that we can have a more consistent margin expectation here on the Telecom side within that -- the electric segment. And just maybe a quick follow-up on -- just to clarify, on the Blattner deal, you've been extremely clear about the confidence that you have in the guidance numbers, but you've talked about the revenue numbers, not the EBITDA contribution. I just want to make sure there's no difference in your confidence in -- between the revenue and EBITDA. Thank you.\nDuke Austin: Double-digit EBITDA on Blattner. As far as the Telecom, we've talked about it in length. I think, in general, what I would say is, the closeouts in the end, as far as engineering closeouts and things like that, and then some descoping us serve clients on their builds, created some effects in projects, We're still working with the client. We will do our best to claw stuff back. But if you think about it, if we get $200 million and we did 6% instead of 10%, it's $6 million, something like that. It's just -- it's not big numbers for us long-term and I think we're not seeing big effects to that as far as margins and we will get them in the double-digit ranges. We're operating for primarily in those ranges. We had some projects early on that are complicated and it's an Industry issue. It's not just us, so it's something that we're all faced with and some closeouts. And I think we're in the late stages of those closeouts and you'll start to see it get back into double-digits.\nOperator: Thank you. We've reached end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any further closing comments.\nDuke Austin: First, I really want to welcome the people of Blattner and certainly the culture there and then the people in the field, the people that pay our pay checks. Thank them for what they do every day. And storms were tough. Our people perform extremely well through the tough environment down in the Gulf Coast and certainly the families lost lives and [Indiscernible] to there, it's tough. Our guys did really well and I'd like to thank all of you for participating in the conference call. We appreciate your questions and your ongoing interest in Quanta Services. Thank you. Close our call.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

            "name": "Duke Austin",
            "content": "Thanks Kip. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Quanta Services Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today, I will provide operational and strategic commentary and will then turn it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer. We will provide a review of our third quarter results and full year 2021 financial expectations. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions. This morning, we reported solid third quarter results, which included a number of record financial metrics, including revenues, adjusted EBITDA, and earnings per share. Additionally, total backlog of $17 billion at the end of the quarter was also a record, which we believe reflects the benefits of our collaborative approach with the customers, favorable in market dynamics, and continued advancement of our long-term growth strategies. As many of you are aware, several weeks ago, we completed the previously announced acquisition of Blattner, which is a premier utility-scale renewable energy infrastructure solutions provider in North America with decades of experience and a strong safety culture. We believe the energy to transition in North America is on the cusp of a significant acceleration, and that moving to a carbon neutral economy will require sizeable and decade's long investment in renewable generation and related infrastructure. We believe this transaction fits Quanta in a unique position to enable the energy infrastructure for North America's energy transition. Since announcing our intention to acquirer Blattner in early September, customer reactions and conversations across our customer base have been overwhelmingly positive and supportive. Further, we previously commented about how remarkably similar Quanta and Blattner are, operationally and culturally, which has become increasingly apparent through working with the Blattner management team on integration. We were all excited about our combined growth opportunities when we first announced the transaction. And I can tell you that today, we're even more excited and increasingly confident in the value proposition, innovative solutions, and growth synergy opportunities that Quanta and Blattner are positioned to provide existing and new customers. Now, turning the call to our operating results. Our Electric Power Solutions operations continue to perform well with record revenues and strong margins driven by robust demand for our services, solid and safe execution, high utilization of our resources and operational excellence. We're proud of our execution and confident that our strong market position will allow us to capitalize on future opportunities created by a favorable long-term trends driving utility investment, and demand for our comprehensive solutions. Demand for grid modernization, system hardening, and renewable energy interconnection services remain active. And discussions around opportunities for our electric vehicle infrastructure installation, and program management capabilities continue to advance. Our electric power backlog remains strong, driven primarily by significant multiyear master service agreements with utilities, which adds to the substantial MSA backlog growth we generated in the first half of this year. During the quarter, Hurricane Ida made landfall over Louisiana, which ultimately left 1.2 million customers across 8 States without power, including 1 million outages in Louisiana alone. One of deployed significant resource is to support utility customers whose electric power infrastructure was damaged or destroyed by the hurricane, including more than 2,500 line workers and front-end support services and engineering staff. Our comprehensive response resulted in record emergency restoration revenue and highlights our ability to quickly mobilize substantial resources to support our customers in times of need. Our customers continue to advance their efforts to achieve carbon neutrality over the coming decades, which is planned to be achieved and large part through increasing renewable generation investment. We believe public policy and that the positive general sentiment supporting a greener environment will drive North America's power generation mix increasingly towards renewables over the near and longer-term. Blattner's utility-scale renewable generation solutions, coupled with Quanta's complimentary and holistic grid solutions, creates a unique value proposition and opportunity to collaborate with our customers to shape their energy transition initiatives. For example, Blattner is currently constructing more than 30 utility-scale renewable energy projects across the country and another Quanta Company is currently working on the largest solar powered battery storage project in North America. Additionally, we're seeing accelerated demand for our services that enable renewable generation, including transmission interconnections and substations. We continue to scale our communication operations and progress our strategy. For example, we have developed a wireless capabilities and are expanding our wireless services into certain markets. Communications revenues grew significantly in the third quarter as compared to last year. And though we incurred higher costs in certain jobs due to descoping of certain contracts and project closeouts which impacted profitability for these operations, these issues were not meaningful to the overall electric power segment or Quanta as a whole. Nevertheless, demand for our communication services remains high and the majority of our communication operations are performing at or near our double-digit margin targets. Our underground utility and infrastructure solutions segment generally performed well in the quarter, despite being impacted by work disruptions along the Gulf Coast due to Hurricane Ida and work inefficiencies associated with the recent surge of the COVID-19 Delta variant in certain areas. We continue to experience solid demand for our gas utility and pipeline integrity services, which are driven by regulated spend to modernize systems, reduced methane emissions, and certain environmental compliance, and improved safety and reliability. We expect our industrial services to strengthen through next year along with the continued recovery of the global economy and demand for refined products, as well as the return of our customer maintenance and capital spending that was previously deferred due to the effects of COVID-19 on the downstream market. Looking to the coming years, we believe the opportunity Quanta has with customers in this segment as they increasingly pursue strategies to reduce their carbon footprint and diversify their operations and assets towards greener business opportunities may be underestimated. There are several examples of such initiatives and project opportunities. Gas utilities are implementing system modernization initiatives that position them to blend hydrogen into their natural gas flow. To that end, Quanta is working with several gas utility customers on hydrogen pilot programs. Certain refiners are building renewable and bio-fuel processing facilities, which could create opportunities for our Industrial services. Natural gas power plants are also exploring blending hydrogen with natural gas as a fuel source to power their turbines, which could create opportunities for our Pipeline Infrastructure services. Lastly, we are actively pursuing carbon sequestration projects in the U.S., which could utilize our Engineering and Pipeline Construction services. In Canada, Pembina Pipeline and TC Energy have proposed a plan to jointly develop a carbon transportation and sequestration system called the Alberta Carbon Grid, which is envisioned to serve as the backbone of Alberta's carbon capture utilization and storage industry and could include participation by other pipeline companies. The initiative with leverage existing pipelines requires a new pipeline and facility investments, which when fully constructed, would be capable of transporting more than 20 million tons of carbon dioxide annually. The North American energy transition is just that, a transition process. The role our Electric Power Infrastructure Solutions play in the energy transition is clear. However, we believe Quanta's underground utility and infrastructure solutions operations could play in an evolving and increasing role, in this transition in support of our customers carbon reduction initiatives. Progress continues in Washington DC towards enacting the bipartisan infrastructure bill and to build back better plan. As commented on prior calls, our positive multi-year outlook and strategic plan are not reliant on either of these packages. But if either or both enacted, they could provide incremental opportunity for Quanta over both the near and longer term. These packages include funding and policies to encourage new infrastructure development and modernization and several of our core markets. In particular to build back better plan currently contains policy and [Indiscernible] representing the largest clean energy legislative package in American history. While additional political steps are still required, we're encouraged by what we've seen recently. We have profitably grown the Company and executed well this year and expecting to continue to do so. We are confident in the strategic initiatives we are executing on, like the better position we have in the marketplace and our positive multi-year outlook. We also believe that our business and opportunities for profitable growth in 2022 are gaining momentum, driven by our solution-based approach, the growth of programmatic spending with existing and new customers, opportunities for larger electric transmission projects, the addition of Blattner's renewable generation solutions, and the opportunity for recovery of certain portions of our business that have been affected by the global pandemic. Looking to the medium and longer-term, as energy transition and carbon reduction initiatives are increasingly implemented, and addition to the primary drivers of our business currently, we believe our visibility could increase and our growth opportunities could expand and accelerate. We believe the infrastructure investment and renewable generation necessary to support these initiatives are still in the early stages of deployment and that this is arguably the most exciting time in Quanta's history. We are focused on operating the business for the long term and expect to continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class field leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's base business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's diversity, unique operating model, and entrepreneurial mindset for and the foundation, that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO for his review of our third quarter results and 2021 expectations. Derrick Hey, good morning. I think when we look at the Telecom business, we did call it out [Indiscernible] we're operating from mid single-digits instead of upper-single to double-digits when we looked at it. So it's not performing terrible. It's not where we want it to be. The macro market is very good and robust. The closeouts on a few projects are very difficult but the large majority or the vast majority of the business is performing in those double-digit margins and offsetting anything there as minimal, as we said on the call, from a charge standpoint or really just cost standpoint when we close things out. We'll go from there, but I do think we added backlog. We continue to build backlog in this segment. We see a long runway there and we did start up some wireless capabilities, it has some cost in it. In general, incidental to the Company, incidental to the segment, we like the market long-term, we will get into double-digits there over time. Canada, when we looked at Canada, I think in general, the projects are performing well. We still see some COVID effects there to the Delta variant on some of those projects. There is some delays in getting billing cycles, billing points there as we run through a project, I think. So that it's more of a billing issue of when can we get things build versus any problems with the project or charges. We did not take charges on Canadian projects. We performed very well. And the storm, yes, it did have a positive effect to the electric segment. It does when we get storms like that, it was up a little bit bigger than last year from the standpoint. Fairly large storm for us, I think it shows our collaborative effect with the client, how we've got in and work our front-end services, we're still working the storm for our clients. It just shows the longevity of the Company and what we've done on the front side of the business to collaborate with the client, to get things up faster, to do a nice job there for them. And I think we performed very well there. Offset, but it did have some impact on some of our underground segments as it always does when it comes in. So you get some offset and you also come off some larger work to go pick up storm. So those things offset some in the quarter. [Indiscernible] I think if you're just now trying to scale labor, you're long ways behind. We've spent about $150 million over the last 5 years and we're way ahead of that. So in my mind, we've done that. We've proven that we grow the Company, that's who we are. This is craft skilled labor, and not labor. In my mind, we self-perform about 85-90% of our business for a reason. And it's this reason, when you get tight labor markets, we can perform, we could perform on time, on budget, and give our client what they're asking for which is certainty. And we're doing that on a daily basis. That's why we're collaborating, that's why you're seeing expansion. As far as productivity, I'll put our margins up against it and show the growth of the Company, the growth of our internal labor force. The 3,000 or 5,000 that we add every year to that labor force is proof that we can do it, we can scale it. We are scaling it and the productivity speaks for itself, and the margins. Yeah. So on the DSOs there in Canada and our likelihood. Canada has traditionally had larger DSOs and projects are bigger. Some of the time frames in the way that milestone billings go in. It's typically been this way. We have a high degree of confidence and probability in collecting outlet. Derrick, comment on the DSOs. Both projects with longstanding clients, we have great relationships with that I believe ultimately, we're in very good shape. We're quite confident. If you said 2,5 to 2,7, we standby it. We standby today. We know more about the Company today than we did when we talked about it before. We feel highly confident in those numbers. And I would just say, in general, yes, there is some supply chain noise, is what I would call it, and I think us having the breadth of Quanta, the breadth of Blattner is only from my standpoint helps us to add to who we are. It adds to how we can go execute. And I want to also say, when we think about Blattner and we think about this long term, we're looking 20 years and we've given guidance out. Not only do we stand by the 2-6 2-7 that we've given, which also gave a 2025 guidance of 3.6. We stand by that even more today. Yes. So Luma, we expected noise in the headlines. I think we've said that from the start, and as you transition to these large transitions on an island, it does have some noise to it. We're performing very well underneath the governor, the government is very much behind it. What we're doing is the right thing. We will transition that all into a modern system. We're doing so every single day, you can't get the payments on the upside of those payments until we get into a full contract which doesn't go into a full contract until bankruptcy's declared out of bankruptcy, and then it goes into a 15-year contract. But as we stand today, we are in a contract that just has not started on the 15 years until they come out of bankruptcy. There was some favorable rulings on the bankruptcy proceedings in the last week or so, I believe. Really good stuff going on underneath, a little noisy on the top, primarily around the generation which we don't control. I feel confident in our ability to perform there and what we're doing for the people that [Indiscernible] I look at it like this. I saw [Indiscernible] most of our clients either add to their $20 billion of backlog over time, of what they're going to build in the CapEx and OpEx over the quarter. Almost every single one of them added to what they're trying to do from an energy transition. The large projects may get headlines and people want to talk about them. We're right around the edges on every one of them. They are additive to anything we said. The 85% of our business that still exist today, is -- the MSA work, those capital spend, there's undergrounding, what Energy said yesterday on [Indiscernible], those kind of things and with the tight labor supply. So any headline you're reading or what you read into something on large projects. It's not affecting the underlying business in our growth trajectories. We've given good guidance on that. The 85% mid-upper single-digits, you can look at our track record over the last 5-6 years and see what it looks like. I expect that going forward. I think you're going through energy transition, as we said. And I think the sentiment around North America and around what we're hearing, even in Canada, you're seeing more and more transition. And as you go into EVs, as you go into your renewables coming on, and you are also doubling load over time. And I think that's the unknown, is people don't understand that you're doubling load, and you're going to a carbon free fuel source. So as you do those things, you're going to need hydrogen, you're going to need tons of renewables. And I think in order to do that, you got to how transmission and we're sitting in very, very good spaces in all these areas. And it allows us through policy or without policy, we'll continue to see that sentiment move forward. That's what we see. I do think when both the five and plan. The plans that we've seen are additive to anything we said. Absolutely. And good morning, Jamie. I will take a little bit of [Indiscernible] and I'll let Derrick comment on the numbers. But in general, what we see is, we see an increase in that business in the fourth quarter a bit. I would say you have a higher oil price, so they'll be reluctant to do much in this environment. But as we go into next year, we see a real strong turnaround year. We believe that the business is coming back meaningfully. I feel confident in the next year on the business, but I'll let Derrick comment on the fourth quarter. I think it's more -- from my standpoint, we're trying to deliver cash to the bottom line. And the returns, as far as capital, those kind of things, we'll operate in the same kind of profile we have in the past on the Electric segment. Blattner is additive from a standpoint -- from a CapEx standpoint on a return basis. So I -- they're accretive. No, I don't think so. When we look at it, we're really just thinking about it. It's part of the segment and much like you would think about LNG when you're moving LNG or you're doing things. Really what you're seeing is the transition of infrastructure, where our role is in this infrastructure transition as we move into the future. I mean, I think we just sit right in the middle of it on anything you can think about is that transition. Whether they need -- they're going to need pipe to move it and they're also going to need pipe to move hydrogen and into blend into natural gas, and I think when you start blending that, you have different infrastructure. So all these different things that we're bringing into the markets: batteries, EV, renewables, technology with 5G, all those things are certainly where we sit. And as we sit in the nucleus of that and we think about it, as we think about Blattner and where they sit in all this, that transition is something that Quanta is really focused on from a labor standpoint, a technology standpoint, and how we help and collaborate with the client, not only from where they're at today, but how they transition. So at the very front end of that is where we're playing and it's early in hydrogen, I do think there's going to be a significant amount of opportunity going forward. But we're already seeing where turbines in power plants on gas are starting to blend and even spec, hydrogen to some degree. So it's going to be a piece of the nucleus of how you regulate and keep the grid balanced. The bigger issue with the grid is to balance it. Signed, when, and then the balance thereof so hydrogen will play a part in it. Sure. Good morning. Yeah, I'll comment on the -- as far as the commodities, we are seeing some escalation in commodity pricing. It has not affected the business, it's not material. I think our scale, our ability to move from project to project, while one, they delay, others are coming in, I just -- the amount, the macro environment there, that's part of the reason you want to scale. And then our renewable business or any business that we're in, we want to scale. Scale allows us flexibility, allows us flexibility with the client. And also our buying power. I mean, when you look at Fleet and how will we manage through Fleet, there's constraints to others with Fleet and our ability to really work with the client, work with our customers, and our suppliers on that has given us really, what I think, a competitive advantage going forward. I'll let Derrick comment on the rest. I would say our commentary on Blattner on the numbers that we've given you based upon us and whether we are going into next year or not. [Indiscernible] any supply chain issue, we are highly confident in those numbers. Yeah. No, I would say to our Canadian operations, I think were probably the most affected with COVID, certainly. And when we look at it, we look at it going forward and we've started some nice projects up there and I think we're in from a good shape on the GAAP side. And as far as on the electric side, we had commentary around that and obviously we've got -- the health and safety of these employees are what we're really focused on, to make sure they're safe every day and we've given them great mitigation and great plans to be safe. We've done that through the Company and have not missed work yet for two years. And I fully expect us to operate right through it and we're going to work with our client on any mandate there may be in geographically or holistically. We like the business long term. There's mandates around methane gas release, cast-iron replacements. We've seen some great stuff with hydrogen coming along and we really like the business on the underground. But I want to go back again and say it's a portfolio. If we can build underground electric with gas carriers, that's what we're going to do. We're going to go and really consolidate offices, leverage our capabilities in the field as some gas operations will be performed in underground electric. I'm not really worried about it from the segmentation standpoint. In my mind, we're going to fully utilize our people with the highest impact on the profitability of the Company. And I -- that's what we're focused on, whether it be Telecom, Gas, Electric, some of the equipment is like type of people for the most part, are very much like type. So we can operate throughout our portfolio of our service lines. If we do it properly and leverage our capabilities at the field level, which is that's what this Company is focused on, it's driving the margin of the whole. It's a complicated dynamic, whether you go green hydrogen. It's just hard. I would say it's corrosive, it burns hot. There's just that it's different. And I think when we think about it, we're working with the client. And in your early stages, it is a part of the solution. And everybody -- we're going to have to regulate the grid, the load is that we get curves in the load and that load regulation is a big deal and especially without interconnections and the difficulty building transmission. While we talk about it a lot, it's still difficult to build large projects and the underlying underneath has to be very, very robust. And so you get a lot of smaller projects and you get a lot of other things that you can do. So I do think hydrogen is just a piece of what we're trying to accomplish as utilities go into their transitions in this renewable state and are you going to build the transmission as well? It's going to stock on top, it's just a timing thing. I think when we looked at it, we had some ongoing M&A. And I think that remains to some degree. We've never been out looking for acquisitions. When companies come, they have a strong need forum in a region and I think we've made very good ones and very good acquisition. Again, we're not looking forward. We just made $2.7 billion acquisition and we're going to be prudent about how we manage this Balance Sheet. And I've said all along, we will generate cash and pay down debt. And that's part of who we are, but we're not going to walk away from great companies. We don't feel at all like we've stretched this Balance Sheet given the fact of the macro market and what we see. While we are -- well, I would say yes, will probably tap the breaks a bit. Certainly, we are not going to pass on companies that we believe add value to the shareholders. Good morning. I think when we talked about that last quarter, when we were in construction on some in Canada today. We're opportunistic there. We can operate that business quite profitably. We're just not, in my mind, we decided not to invest in it and not to continue to invest. So that's a little bit different. We can still do a billion dollars in the business, we can do $2 billion in the business from what we have today. So we don't have to invest more in capital. We have the people, we have the things that we can do. As you look at carbon sequestration and all the lines there and all the things that are coming up on hydrogen, it certainly plays into the business and we'll look at it. We have the capabilities entirely. We'll continue to take the opportunities that'll stack onto anything we're doing. Whether it be Canada, the U.S. but there is some nice projects out there and then certainly around the edges on every one of them. But we're not going to take the risk that it's not something that we have to have. And when we guide, it will be $3 to $500 million. I can almost tell you right now. And that's what it'll look like if we do $2 billion great. We'll let you know. It's all of the above. So I think when we look at it depends on where you are at geographically, but certainly all of the above [Indiscernible], escalate. We've seen undergrounding certainly come about in a significant way. Those two things are there. I think what's underappreciated is the amount of infrastructure and the modernization necessary on the distribution system to handle the load of [Indiscernible]. When you start putting these cars' batteries on at night and on the distribution load of what it does to the system, I think it's underestimated on the cost and the amount of work that's out there, capital that's necessary to get these systems ready for electric vehicles. I just -- in my mind, it's just underappreciated. When we look at Blattner, I reiterated guidance pretty firmly in the '22 and talked about $3.5 billion to $3.6 billion in '25. The commitment there, we're really looking at megawatts, not projects. And the projects are certainly there if we decided to start, say, the reward we got. I just think it's not valuable to the shareholder nor is it productive. What we're saying is Q6, Q7 next year and $3.6 billion in '25 of top-line [Indiscernible]. That's how we see it. That's how robust it is. So it should give you a good idea of what we're seeing as a Company and how we said and depending on the future in the renewable business. In my mind, that shows where we're at and I think, again, the awards are there. We're certainly with the client, talking to them on a multiyear basis, not just one job. So that's their offshore. It's expensive. I think we have clients that are certainly, have their plans around offshore and we're certainly in there as far as interconnections, things that we we're good at we'll do. But primarily, as it comes on [Indiscernible], I just -- but I've said this a floor, but we have had bad luck with boats and I'm just not a boat fan. Double-digit EBITDA on Blattner. As far as the Telecom, we've talked about it in length. I think, in general, what I would say is, the closeouts in the end, as far as engineering closeouts and things like that, and then some descoping us serve clients on their builds, created some effects in projects, We're still working with the client. We will do our best to claw stuff back. But if you think about it, if we get $200 million and we did 6% instead of 10%, it's $6 million, something like that. It's just -- it's not big numbers for us long-term and I think we're not seeing big effects to that as far as margins and we will get them in the double-digit ranges. We're operating for primarily in those ranges. We had some projects early on that are complicated and it's an Industry issue. It's not just us, so it's something that we're all faced with and some closeouts. And I think we're in the late stages of those closeouts and you'll start to see it get back into double-digits. First, I really want to welcome the people of Blattner and certainly the culture there and then the people in the field, the people that pay our pay checks. Thank them for what they do every day. And storms were tough. Our people perform extremely well through the tough environment down in the Gulf Coast and certainly the families lost lives and [Indiscernible] to there, it's tough. Our guys did really well and I'd like to thank all of you for participating in the conference call. We appreciate your questions and your ongoing interest in Quanta Services. Thank you. Close our call."

            "content": "Thanks, Duke. And good morning, everyone. Today we announced record third quarter 2021 revenues the $3.4 billion. Net income attributable to common stock was $174 million or $1.21 per diluted share and adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure was $1.48. Our Electric Power revenues were $2.3 billion, a quarterly record and a 10% increase when compared to the third quarter of 2020. This increase was driven by continued favorable dynamics across our core utility and communications markets and associated demand for our services. Also contributing to the increase were revenues from acquired businesses of approximately $55 million. Electric segment operating income margins in 3Q21 were 12.4%, slightly lower than 12.7% in 3Q20, but better than our initial expectations. Operating margins benefitted from record emergency restoration revenues of approximately $230 million, which typically present opportunities for higher margins than our normal base business activities due to higher utilization, as well as overall solid execution across our electric operations. Additionally, segment margins benefited from approximately $10 million of income associated with our LUMA joint venture. Otherwise, a slight reduction in operating margin versus prior year was attributable to normal job variability and mix of work and our communication operations, which delivered mid-single-digit margins during the quarter. As a reminder, last year's third quarter Electric Power results also included, what was at the time, a record level of emergency restoration revenues. Underground Utility and Infrastructure segment revenues were $1.02 billion for the quarter, 12% higher than 3Q '20 due primarily to increased revenues from gas distribution and industrial services. Though our operations experienced increased activity year-over-year, current quarter revenues and margins in our industrial operations were negatively impacted by disruptions along the Gulf Coast attributable to Hurricane Ida, and both our industrial and non-U.S. markets within this segment remain pressured by COVID-19 dynamics. Third quarter operating income margins for the segment were 6.7%, 107 basis points lower than 3Q 20, but generally in line with our expectations. Margins for the year -- margin for the third quarter of 2020, benefited from favorable adjustments on certain larger pipeline projects with both scope changes and favorable closeouts in the quarter. Our total backlog was $17 billion at the end of the third quarter, the fifth consecutive quarter we posted record total backlog. Additionally, 12 month backlog of $9.8 billion also represents a quarterly record. Our backlog growth continues to be driven primarily by multi-year MSA programs with North American utilities, which we believe reinforces the repeatable and sustainable nature of the largest portion of our revenues and earnings. The Blattner acquisition occurred after September 30th, and accordingly, their backlog is not included in our current reportedly levels. However, the total backlog from Blattner and the other 4Q acquisitions is approximately $1.8 billion. For the third quarter of 2021, we generated negative free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, of $40 million, compared to $70 million of positive free cash flow in 3Q '20. Net cash provided by operating activities during the third quarter of 2021, although largely in line with our expectations, was down due to higher revenues and corresponding increases in working capital demands compared to prior year, which benefited from lower revenues and a corresponding lower use of working capital. Also, 3Q '20 benefited from the deferral of $41 million of payroll taxes in accordance with the Cares Act, 50% of which are due by December 31, 2021, with the remainder due by December 31, 2022. Partially offsetting these dynamics was a favorable impact of increased earnings as compared to 3Q '20. Days sales outstanding, or DSO, measured 89 days for the third quarter of 2021, an increase of 7 days compared to the third quarter of 2020, and an increase of 6 days compared to December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to elevated working capital requirements associated with 2 large Canadian transmission projects driving an increase in contract assets. Specific to the Canadian projects, both continue to encounter work stoppage protocols in Canada associated with COVID mitigation, as well as delays attributable to, among other things, wildfires impacting access to worksite. These dynamics created substantial inefficiencies and production delays resulting in increased project costs. We are in active discussions with both customers regarding change orders associated with these increased costs, some of which have already been approved, with the remaining amounts being pursued in the normal course. In addition, normal variability in work production and associated payment cycles across our operations contributed to slightly higher DSO in the quarter. As Duke discussed, and as we previously announced, we closed on the acquisition on October 13th. Prior to the closing in September 2021, we issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes with a weighted average interest rate of 2.12%. Receiving net proceeds of $1.48 billion. Accordingly, as of quarter end, we had approximately $1.7 billion of cash. Subsequent to the quarter, we amended our credit agreement to, among other things, provide a term loan facility of $750 million, which was fully drawn and combined with the net proceeds from the senior notes offering to fund a substantial majority of the cash consideration payable to the Blattner shareholders at closing. Our highlight that our financial strategy and consistent performance have allowed us to maintain investment-grade ratings subsequent to these financing transactions. From a capital allocation perspective, Blattner represents the largest acquisition in Quanta's history and a strategic opportunity to expand the solutions we deliver to support North America's transition to carbon-neutral energy infrastructure. Capital deployment for strategic acquisitions has always been a key part of our strategy, but as we've discussed in the past, our first priority for capital allocation remains supporting the working capital and equipment needs of our existing operations. While the debt issued to support the Blattner acquisition moved our leverage profile above our target range, it remains well below the financial covenant requirements in our credit facility, and we believe we can efficiently deliver, while continuing to create shareholder value through our dividend and repurchase programs, as well as strategic acquisitions. To the date of this earnings release, we've acquired approximately $64 million worth of stock since the beginning of the year as part of our repurchase program and we'll continue to evaluate potential acquisitions that fit our strategic objectives. To that end, during the third quarter and through the date of the earnings release, in addition to Blattner, we acquired 3 additional businesses and made a minority investment in another, for total combined consideration of approximately $110 million. These incremental transactions further enhance our ability to deliver comprehensive infrastructure solutions to our North American utility and communications customers. Turning to our guidance. Our outlook for the remainder of the year reflects the strength of our core utility backed operation, which continued to deliver solid results with robust year-over-year growth. However, the results of companies acquired during and subsequent to the third quarter, including Blattner's operations, will be included in our consolidated financial statements, which makes comparability to our previous expectations challenging. It should be noted that we are in the very early stages of establishing Blattner's specific opening balance sheet, which includes assessing the positions of our ongoing projects as of the closing and dialing the tangible and intangible assets acquired. The results of those ongoing efforts will have a meaningful impact on Blattner 's forth quarter contribution, which we've attempted to address in the range of our fourth-quarter expectations for the acquired businesses. That said, excluding the expected contributions from the recently acquired companies, we now expect full-year revenues from our legacy operations, to range between $12.15 to 12.35 Billion. Due to the strength of our consolidated performance for the first nine months of the year, we are increasing our expectations for the contribution of our legacy operations to adjusted EBITDA, to range between $1.17 billion and $1.2 billion. With the midpoint of the range representing an increase over our previous guidance and 13% growth when compared to 2020's record adjusted EBITDA. As it relates to our current reportable segments. While we continue to evaluate how these change may change with the addition of Blattner, I wanted to provide some color on our current expectations compared to our previous commentary, again, excluding contributions from the recently acquired business. We continue to expect full-year revenues to range between $8.7 and $8.8 billion for our legacy electric segment operation. However, based on strong performance through the first 9 months of the year, and continued confidence in our ability to execute on the opportunities across the segment, we've increased our full-year margin range for the segment, for 2021 operating margins expected to come in slightly above 11%. Our full-year expectations for the underground utility and infrastructure solution segment, however, have slightly moderated due primarily to lower third quarter revenue levels than previously expected. Accordingly, we are reducing our full-year expectations for the segment, for its revenue is now expected to range between $3.45 and $3.55 billion while segment margins are now expected to range between 4.5% and 5%, which includes the $23.6 million provision for credit loss recognized in the second quarter, a nearly 70 basis point negative impact on a full-year basis. With regard to the recently acquired companies, operations I spoke of earlier, including Blattner, we expect post-closing revenue contributions for the year to range between $400 and $500 million and adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP measure, ranging between $40 million and $60 million. Accordingly, including the expected contributions from the recently acquired companies, we now expect our consolidated full-year revenues to range between $12.55 billion and $12.85 billion and adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure of between $1.21 and $1.26 billion. Corporate and unallocated costs will increase significantly primarily due to the acquired big companies. We currently estimate amortization expense for the full year will be between $149 million and $159 million, with $60 million to $70 million attributable to the recently acquired companies. Stock compensation expense for the full year is now expected to be approximately $89 million, with approximately $2 million attributable to restricted stock units issued to employees in the acquired companies. Acquisition and integration costs are expected to be approximately $26 million for the fourth quarter, resulting in approximately $36 million for the year. This includes approximately $10.5 million of expenses associated with change of control payments awarded to certain employees of Blattner, by the selling shareholders, which require expense accounting, as they have a one-year service period requirement. We expect a comparable dollar amount will be accrued each quarter post-closing until the one-year anniversary of the transaction, at which time the payments will be made to the employee. We intend to include this amount as an adjustment to arrive at our adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA, both non-GAAP measures. Below the line, we expect interest expense for the year to be around $67 million, which includes approximately $16 million of incremental interest expense associated with debt financing used to fund the cash portion of the Blattner acquisition. Additionally, we now expect our full-year tax rate to be around 24%, reflecting a slight reduction from our prior expectations due primarily to a favorable shift in the mix of earnings between various taxing jurisdictions. As a result, our expectation for full-year diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock is now between $3.20 and $3.40 and our increased expectation for adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock, a non-GAAP measure is now between $4.62 and $4.87. On a consolidated basis, we now expect free cash flow for the year to range between $350 and $500 million. This slight decrease is primarily due to potential timing of payments associated with emergency restoration efforts, as well as the likelihood that the dynamics impacting the larger Canadian projects continued to pressure DSO in the fourth quarter. Additionally, while we expect Blattner will be meaningfully accretive to our cash flow profile on an annual basis, we expect certain favorable billing positions at the time of acquisition could unwind as Blattner incurs costs in the fourth quarter to finish projects for which they've already received payments. This dynamic could minimize Blattner's cash contribution during the quarter, which we factored into our range of expectation. As we've stated in prior quarters, our quarterly free cash flow is subject to sizable movements due to various customer and project dynamics that can occur in the normal course of operations. For additional information, please refer to our Outlook Summary, which can be found in the financial info section of our IR website at quantaservices.com. Overall, we continue to believe we are in the early stages of a significant infrastructure investment cycle. And the acquisition of Battner further differentiates us in the markets we serve and expands our ability to deliver solutions to support North America's transition to carbon-neutral energy infrastructure. We remain confident in our ability to execute against the opportunities in front of us while maintaining the financial flexibility to opportunistically deploy capital to deliver long-term shareholder value. This concludes our formal presentation and we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator. Good morning. Yeah. Exactly. What I would comment on is that from a timing perspective right now. I think it would be post year-end, which is reflected in our cash flow commentary. I think it is probably going to be more in the first quarter and second quarter of next year. Yeah, as it relates to -- go ahead, Jamie. I was just going to say, relative to the fourth quarter, I think it would be slightly profitable, which is what we have said, that they could be back and returning into a degree of profitability overall. That group is at slightly north of $500 million for '21 going into '22. I think we see it having the ability to start to return to the degree of normalcy that we talked about in the past. Those numbers have been north of a $700 million number. I don't know quite yet. It's too early to comment as to whether we'll get into those type levels, but I think we'll definitely see an increase. And we would see that it would be largely returning to some of that historical profitability again. I want to see how this fourth quarter plays out though. Historically, they were a double-digit EBITDA. I do believe there is potential for that. Yeah. We are already [Indiscernible]. It will be [Indiscernible] guidance, so we'll see how it starts perform. But yeah, I think in the range of the guidance you'll could see that. As far as the electric power segment, I think when we put stronghold in -- when we put stronghold in, I mean, we see a double-digit margin Company. And as we look at it going forward, we believe that the segment will perform in those areas. Obviously, as we go into '22 we will be prudent about how we guide as we always are. We've got to get through whether we have a lot of [Indiscernible] performing in the field. And I think in general when we think about it, the business is healthy. It's in a good secular macro-environment. We really like where we sit. We think we're doing great things collaboratively. And anything that Blattner has is added to us. And again, their culture and what we're doing internally as far as melting together and looking for opportunity, I can only say that I feel stronger about it today than I did October 3rd. Yeah, sure. Partly, it's only a partial quarter contribution that we did not acquire the Company exactly at the quarter, so there's only a part of October, so that's a component of it. Two, exactly. It's unfair to annualize a given quarter much like it is on Quanta. We have a degree of seasonality. You can't take any given quarter and annualize that. There are movements of projects and seasonality. That is still yet the case as well for Blattner and any of the companies that we acquire. We still yet feel very comfortable with the 2.5-2.7 original guidance for Blattner irrespective of this quarter contribution. And then lastly, there is a bit of just [Indiscernible] at starts and stops of projects, affecting the number. And then probably the last point that you raised is that we have been trying to be a bit prudent with the contribution because of the fact that we have, just outflows the transaction, we got opening balance sheet work to do. Looking at how some of that opening balance sheet will play out to the rest of those contracts. So 4 or 5 different factors there, but net-net, we feel very comfortable still with 2,5-2,7 annual '22 contribution. And one other point I guess is that to the extent that there's anything for fluctuations in the timing of Blattner and any of that would be, from a supply perspective, could lead to projects pushing to the right at any given point in time. Not necessarily in our minds impacting a profitability type dynamic but could push things around. But having said that from overall seasonality, I think I'd probably say it's reasonably similar to our overall Electric power operations. Probably really a little bit lower in the first, rising in the second, stronger in the third and in the fourth being either comparable to or having a slight decline, depending upon the timing of any of these supply type dynamics. But largely, I think I'd say it's similar to our historical electric power patterns. Actually, some of the other COVID dynamics were a little bit in Canada, London, Australia, and then yes, in some of the industrial side pressuring it, not really so much on the LDC side. I think we're seeing normal operations for the most part on the LDC side. And then from a margins perspective, we're continuing to see that comparable to what we've been speaking to, trending towards getting into that upper single-digit overall as we go forward. We feel confident in our ability to [Indiscernible] that with LDC operation."

With that, I would like now to turn the call over to Mr. Duke Austin, Quanta's President and CEO. Duke?\nEarl Austin: Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today, I will provide operational and strategic commentary and will then turn it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a review of our second quarter results and full year 2021 financial expectations. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions. This morning, we reported solid results with record second quarter revenues and earnings per share. Backlog of $17 billion at the end of the quarter was also a record, which we believe reflects the benefits of our collaborative approach with customers and the continued advancement of our long-term growth strategies. We continue to see opportunities for multiyear growth across our service lines driven by our solution-based approach and the growth of programmatic spending with existing and new customers. Our electric power solutions operations had another strong quarter, with record revenues and better-than-expected margins, reflecting solid and safe execution, favorable end market conditions and continued momentum as a result of ongoing grade modernization, system hardening and renewable energy interconnections. Our Electric Power backlog continues to increase, driven primarily by significant multiyear master service agreements with utilities, which adds to the substantial MSA backlog growth from the first quarter. We are proud of our execution and confident in our strong market position to capitalize on the opportunities created by favorable long-term trends, driving utility investment and demand for our comprehensive solutions. As an example, one of our largest electric customers in the Western United States recently announced a major new multiyear program to underground approximately 10,000 miles of electric distribution power lines and high fire-threat districts in the utility service territory. This initiative is in the planning stages and is expected to incorporate input from numerous stakeholders and be implemented over a number of years. While it may seem like a bold endeavor and unprecedented in its scale, the imperative to mitigate the risk of wildfires and the economic and human costs caused by them, as evidenced over the last several years in the Western United States, soon will outweigh the capital investment necessary to complete this kind of program. Electric utilities in other areas of the country are also pursuing initiatives to underground critical infrastructure. Examples include electric transmission projects in the Northeast, distribution circuits along the coast lines, electric transmission line projects for offshore wind generation and undergrounding transmission and distribution initiatives by other utilities in California. Many of these initiatives are part of a large-scale, multiyear system hardening programs, which provide meaningful opportunities for Quanta. We continue to see accelerated renewable generation development and associated demand for our services, including transmission interconnects, substations and energy storage. Our customers continue to advance their efforts to achieve carbon neutrality, in large part through increasing renewable generation investments. For example, we have begun work on what will become the largest solar power battery storage center in the world for a long-standing utility customer. We believe public policy and the positive general sentiment supporting a greener environment will drive North America's power generation mix increasingly towards renewables over the near and longer term. And as these dynamics continue to advance, demand for our services could accelerate. Related to these opportunities, we are actively pursuing larger high-voltage electric transmission projects associated with interconnecting renewable generation, which are scheduled to be awarded by the end of this year, with work expected to begin in 2022. We believe Quanta is the industry leader in performing larger-scale high-voltage electric transmission projects in North America, with an industry-leading track record of safely executing for our customers on time and on budget, and we are well positioned for these opportunities. Additionally, we are experiencing accelerating activity and opportunities for our electric vehicle infrastructure installation and program management capabilities. We are in active discussions with several industry participants about managing the deployment of thousands of charging stations, both regionally and nationally. These are exciting and meaningful prospects but just part of the equation in our view. More importantly, we feel the market is underestimating the significant investment needed to modernize and expand the capacity of the electric distribution system to accommodate the mass deployment of retail and commercial fleet electric vehicle charging infrastructure. And finally, in June, LUMA Energy and its employees, as supported by Quanta and its joint venture partner, ATCO, commenced the operations and maintenance of Puerto Rico's electric power transmission and distribution system under a supplemental terms agreement, following nearly a year of preparation. In LUMA, we have created a purpose-built and effective operator for the Puerto Rico T&D system and the people of Puerto Rico. We remain steadfast in our commitment to continue to invest our time, expertise and resources to help drive efficient operations at LUMA as it works to deliver a modern, secure, resilient and affordable electric grid and to develop a highly trained, craft-skilled workforce for the future of Puerto Rico. Our communications operations performed well in the second quarter, and we continue to profitably scale and grow the business. As we discussed in our last earnings call, the subcontractor challenges we experienced in the first quarter were an isolated issue and did not continue into the second quarter. We are on track to generate high single- or double-digit operating income margins for the remainder of this year and remain confident in our ability to profitably grow our operations. Service providers continue to push fiber closer to the customer. Fiber backhaul justification is ongoing, and 5G wireless infrastructure development is increasing. Further, in response to the meaningful federal funding being provided for broadband network expansion in underserved markets, we are seeing accelerated spending by our cooperative and municipal electric customers who also provide communication services, allowing us to leverage our relationships to provide turnkey telecom solutions to them. On our first quarter earnings call, we announced a strategic alliance with and minority investment in a broadband technology partner. Under our alliance agreement with them, Quanta is serving as the program manager for a large-scale deployment of their fixed broadband technology. To that end, we recently began the large-scale installation of their technology in several cities, with opportunities to expand our technology into additional cities in 2022. We believe that Quanta is uniquely positioned between the communications and the utility industries to provide solutions for broadband and 5G technology deployments by leveraging existing infrastructure, and our relationship with this broadband technology provider is evidence of that. Our Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment generally performed well in the quarter, with the exception of a provision for the credit loss taken related to a customer that recently declared bankruptcy, which Derrick will discuss in his remarks. I will note, however, that this was not because of our performance or execution on the project and that even with the allowance, we were profitable on the work we performed. We continue to experience solid demand for our gas utility and pipeline integrity services, which are driven by regulated spend to modernize systems, reduce methane emissions, ensure environmental compliance and improve safety and reliability. Our industrial services and -- are strengthening and should continue to do so through the balance of this year. Further, we expect continued recovery of our industrial services operations in 2022 due to the return of customer maintenance and capital spending that was previously deferred due to the effects of COVID-19 on the downstream market. Additionally, we were recently awarded more than $350 million of larger pipeline projects, primarily in Canada. We expect a portion of this revenue to be recognized this year, with the majority of the revenue to be realized in 2022. Somewhat restraining the segment's recovery are heightened restrictions and concerns in Australia and Canada due to the surge of the Delta COVID-19 variant and its effect on our operations in those countries. I hope that our comments this morning and from our prior calls convey our confidence in the strategic initiatives we are executing on, the competitive position we have in the marketplace and our positive multiyear outlook. On our last earnings call, I commented that our positive outlook and strategic plan are not reliant on the infrastructure proposal being pursued in Washington, D.C. but that if the bill were enacted, it could provide incremental opportunity for Quanta over the near and longer term. As many of you know, significant progress has recently been made on a bipartisan infrastructure package that includes funding and policies to encourage new infrastructure development and modernization in several of our core markets. While additional political steps are still required, we are encouraged by what we see in the most recently proposed legislation. We believe our business is strong, and we continue to have a favorable outlook for the rest of this year. As a result, in our earnings release this morning, we raised our 2021 guidance. We believe this demonstrates the strength and sustainability of our business and long-term strategy, our ability to safely execute and our strong competitive position in the marketplace. We also believe that our business and opportunities for profitable growth in 2022 are gaining momentum, driven by our solutions-based approach, the growth of programmatic spending with the existing and new customers, opportunities for larger electric transmission projects and the opportunity for recovery of certain portions of our business that have been affected by the global pandemic. On prior calls, we have discussed our strategy of enhancing our front-end capabilities such as engineering and permitting to complement our world-class construction expertise, which is designed to provide differentiated, comprehensive and industry-leading solutions to our customers. I am pleased to report that our strategy has been well received by our customers across our service lines and is allowing us to better support them and capture more of their programmatic spend. Our markets continue to evolve and strengthen, driven by longer-term favorable trends, including modernization, system hardening, electrification, carbon neutrality initiatives and the adoption of new technologies. Additionally, our customers and regulators increasingly understand that the rapid growth in renewable generation, electric vehicles and data-intensive technologies bring significant intermittency, which strains existing systems and creates challenges for planning the grids and networks of the future. For these advancements to be successful, infrastructure requires redundancy to ensure reliability. We believe the infrastructure investment necessary to support these initiatives are still in the early stages of deployment, which provides us with years of visibility and growth opportunities. And finally, an important part of our value proposition to all of our stakeholders is Quanta's commitment to corporate responsibility and sustainability. To that end, earlier this week, we published our 2020 corporate responsibility report, which discusses the company's accomplishments last year as well as our commitments to people, planet and principles. Quanta has a great ESG story to tell, and we are pleased with the progress we are making to provide increased transparency into our corporate responsibility and sustainability initiatives. We are focused on operating the business for the longer term and expect to continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class field leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's base business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's diversity, unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset form the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for all our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his review of our second quarter results and 2021 expectations. Derrick?\nDerrick Jensen: Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced record second quarter 2021 revenues of $3 billion. Net income attributable to common stock was $117 million or $0.81 per diluted share. And adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure, was $1.06. Our electric power revenues were $2.1 billion, a record for the second quarter and a 20% increase when compared to the second quarter of 2020. This increase was driven by continued growth in base business activities as well as contributions from larger transmission projects and revenues from acquired businesses of approximately $70 million. Electric segment operating income margins in 2Q '21 were 11% versus 10.3% in 2Q '20, led by continued execution strength, coupled with increased revenues, which contributed to improved equipment utilization and fixed cost absorption. Operating margins also benefited from approximately $7 million of income associated with our LUMA joint venture. Our communications operations, included within the electric segment, delivered mid-single-digit margins during the quarter. Due to some of the subcontractor and quality issues we identified in the first quarter, we transitioned field leadership on several projects, which led to more normalized margins during the quarter. Those transition activities have been completed, and we expect our communications operations will return to margins at or near double digits for the remainder of the year, similar to the second half of 2020. Underground utility and infrastructure segment revenues were $852 million for the quarter, 19% higher than 2Q '20, due primarily to increased revenues from gas distribution and industrial services, partially offset by reduced revenues from larger pipeline projects. Our industrial operations and non-U.S. markets within this segment remain pressured by COVID-19 dynamics, impacting core quarter revenues and margins. However, last year's second quarter results were more adversely impacted by pandemic-related disruptions. Second quarter operating income margins for the segment were 2.8%, 20 basis points lower than 2Q '20. Negatively impacting second quarter margins was the recognition of a $23.6 million provision for credit loss related to receivables from Limetree Refining, which declared bankruptcy in July 2021, an approximately 280 basis point impact on segment margins. Regarding the provision, our industrial operations had been providing regular turnaround and maintenance services to Limetree Refining's operations at its St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands refinery for several years. Following operational difficulties experienced at the St. Croix refinery, the refinery shut down operations during the second quarter. And shortly thereafter, Limetree Refining filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The bankruptcy process is in its early stages. However, given the uncertainty around the proceedings and the future operations at the St. Croix refinery, we've reserved a substantial portion of our outstanding receivables. We will continue to monitor the bankruptcy process and assess the likelihood of recovery as the facts and circumstances develop. This project began in 2018 and, even after the charge, remains nicely profitable. Excluding the impact of this provision, segment results were otherwise in line with our Q2 expectations. Our total backlog was a record $17 billion at the end of the second quarter, with 12-month backlog at $9 billion, both of which represent solid increases when compared to year-end and the second quarter of 2020. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter where we posted record backlog, a trend that continues to be driven primarily by multiyear MSA programs with North American utilities, which we believe continues to validate the repeatable and sustainable nature of the largest portion of our revenues and earnings. For the second quarter of 2021, we generated free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, of $126 million, $331 million lower than 2Q '20. Net cash provided by operating activities during the second quarter of 2021, although largely in line with our expectations, was negatively impacted by increased working capital requirements related to the continued ramp-up of 2 larger electric transmission projects in Canada and the timing that's associated with billings. The various work stoppage protocols in Canada associated with COVID mitigation have created substantial inefficiencies and production delays. These have led to increased project costs, some of which have already been approved, with the remaining amounts being pursued in normal course. Partially offsetting this was the favorable impact of increased earnings as compared to 2Q '20. The free cash flow generated in the second quarter of 2020 resulted from substantially reduced revenues and the corresponding reduction in working capital. Also during 2Q '20, we deferred the payment of both $58 million of federal and state income taxes and $30.7 million of payroll taxes. The federal and state income taxes were subsequently paid in July 2020, while 50% of the deferred payroll taxes are due by December 31, '21, with the remainder due by December 31, '22. Days sales outstanding, or DSO, measured 83 days for the second quarter of 2021, an increase of 1 day compared to the second quarter of 2020 and comparable to December 31, 2020. We had approximately $212 million of cash at the end of the quarter, with total liquidity of approximately $2.1 billion and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as calculated under our credit agreement, of approximately 1.2x. As we've discussed in the past, our first priority for capital allocation remains supporting the working capital and equipment needs of our operations. However, we remain committed to delivering shareholder value through our dividend and repurchase programs as well as strategic acquisitions. Through the date of this earnings release, we've acquired approximately $58 million worth of stock since the beginning of the year as part of our repurchase program, and we continue to evaluate potential acquisitions that fit our strategic objectives. Turning to guidance. Based on the electric segment's strong performance through the first 6 months of the year and continued confidence in our ability to execute on the opportunities across the segment, we've increased our full year expectations for segment revenues, resulting in a range between $8.7 billion and $8.8 billion for 2021. Similarly, we are increasing our full year margin range for this segment, with 2021 operating margins now expected to range between 10.5% and 11%. Our full year expectations for the Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment, however, have slightly moderated due primarily to a lack of visibility into new project awards that could contribute to the back half of 2021 from our Canadian and Australian operations. Accordingly, we are reducing our full year expectations for this segment, with revenues now expected to range between $3.5 billion and $3.65 billion and segment margins ranging between 4.6% and 5.1%, which includes the $23.6 million or nearly 70 basis point negative impact on a full year basis associated with the provision for credit loss recognized in the second quarter. These segment operating ranges support our increased expectations for 2021 annual revenues of between $12.2 billion and $12.45 billion and adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, of between $1.13 billion and $1.21 billion. The midpoint of the range represents 11% growth when compared to 2020's record adjusted EBITDA. We now expect our full year tax rate to range between 24.25% and 24.75%, a slight reduction from our prior expectations due to favorable tax dynamics in the second quarter associated with certain deferred compensation items. As a result, our increased expectation for full year diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock is now between $3.40 and $3.76, and our increased expectation for adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock, a non-GAAP measure, is now between $4.32 and $4.68. We expect cash generation associated with our increased expectations for our revenue and earnings will be slightly offset by higher working capital requirements in the second half of the year. And accordingly, we are maintaining our free cash flow guidance for the year, expecting it to range between $400 million and $600 million. As we stated in prior quarters, our quarterly free cash flow is subject to sizable movements due to various customer and project dynamics that can occur in the normal course of operations. For additional information, please refer to our outlook summary, which can be found in the Financial Info section of our IR website at quantaservices.com. Overall, our core utility-based operations continue to execute at a high level, and we are well positioned to deliver solutions to meet the expanding capital and maintenance programs of our North American utility partners. We firmly believe we are in the early stages of a significant infrastructure investment cycle and our ability to train and deploy world-class craft-skilled labor differentiates us in the markets we serve. This craft skill foundation, coupled with our balance sheet strength, gives us the ability to deliver industry-leading solutions to our customers while maintaining the ability to opportunistically deploy capital to deliver long-term shareholder value. This concludes our formal presentation, and we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question this morning is coming from Chad Dillard of Bernstein.\nChad Dillard: So my first question is just on the MSA part of your business. So to what extent are your customers entering these agreements to lock up labor? And is this like a primary motivating factor? Or is there -- are there other things at play that are driving some of the momentum? And then just like secondly, how much of your labor rates -- like, I guess, like what's the structure of like the labor rates that you're negotiating there? Are they passed through? And I'm talking more about like the portion of your labor that's nonunion.\nEarl Austin: Yes. Chad, thanks. When we look at our MSA work going forward, I think when we're working with the customers in a collaborative manner, we're looking at their capital spend, they're working with us, and we're looking at that body of work or that body of capital over time and providing solutions to them through an MSA form. So it allows us to work with them in a strategic manner on a go-forward basis. And yes, somewhat to lock up resources, but also to make sure from a constructability and a prudency manner that we can go out and deliver it. I think when you look at labor and look at what we've done with labor and our ability to perform and perform at a cost and on time, we've been able to do that. And so the clients are recognizing that, and that's why we're having these conversations in a long-term manner and also independent services. As far as how we look at escalations in labor, we do pricing and escalations on all of our labor as we move forward. So that's something that we do and have done for the past 50 years.\nChad Dillard: That's helpful. And then just a second question, more on some of the newer parts of your business, grid storage and charging station work that you're starting to do. So how transferable are the competitive advantages that you have on some of your large transmission work to those areas? How much of the business is comprised of revenue from those sources? And then I guess can you just talk about just like the contract structure, fixed versus reimbursable?\nEarl Austin: Yes. There's two parts to most of these projects when you're thinking about renewables or anything really for that matter, battery storage. Your interconnections or substations and your collector systems that allow you to push the generation or storage onto the grid, so we're certainly involved in that on a daily basis. It's fairly technical and that's part of this. And the risk on the battery is big battery. So both of those things are something that we do quite often and very transferable from our standpoint on a go-forward basis, so something that we believe is right down the fairway for us. And when we look at pricing, it's both fixed, both unit-based, both lump sum either way, but we're very comfortable in that -- those type of projects. And we're not taking output risk or we're not taking product risk either on any of that.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Sean Eastman of KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nSean Eastman: Nice quarter. It'd be great to get a little more color on the market share opportunity surrounding the front-end capabilities, engineering, permitting. It seems like you've already been capturing share there. How significant is that? And why exactly are those front-end capabilities helping you capture more programmatic spend?\nEarl Austin: I think we set out -- the company set out 6, 7 years ago to really work with the client at the customer level to develop a relationship-based discussion to provide them with resources for capital. And so when the customers have been struggling to get their capital spend because of permitting, because of engineering or whatever it may be, we felt like we can make a difference there, and there wouldn't be an intermediary between us and the client. And we felt like from a constructability position, we could better service the client to build. And so that, from our standpoint, we could deliver the resources, we could talk to the client on the front side of the business and deliver a capital project that was at the best cost to the rate payer. And that's how we look at it. We look at it from a rate payer standpoint and work with the client to deliver the best product we can in a prudent manner.\nSean Eastman: Okay. That's really interesting. And maybe shifting over to underground. Just as you guys are tracking the business here year-to-date, I mean, are you seeing anything structural in terms of change in those business lines that would preclude us from kind of getting back to a prepandemic run rate? Or should we still think about this business as kind of marching back up to that prepandemic EBIT run rate as the economy continues to reopen?\nEarl Austin: Yes. Sean, I think when you look at the company, you look at the portfolio, we are getting operating leverage out of these larger operating units within our -- in the company. And when you look at the quarter, the second quarter, if you look at adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter, it's double digits. We set out to produce double-digit EBITDA, we're doing it. And yes, there's opportunities in our industrial segment on a go-forward basis to pick those up into higher upper single digits like we talked about before and also that piece of the segment. But in general, we're still looking at this in a portfolio. And we don't care if it's underground gas or underground electric, we are there to make sure that we fully utilize our resources and fully utilize equipment to produce the highest margin we can, no matter what the segment is.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse.\nJamie Cook: I guess just two questions. First question, can you help us understand the expectation, what the margins were in the communications business this quarter? I'm just trying to understand what that was relative to your electric power business because the margin performance there continues to be strong. So I'm just trying to understand the underlying performance there. And then, Duke, I guess, more a strategic question. The balance sheet is in great shape. You have great -- obviously, a lot of organic growth opportunity ahead of you. But when you think about some of these adjacent markets that you're trying to grow in, I'm just wondering if there's opportunities on the M&A side that the market is underappreciating and/or opportunities within underground utility that could potentially help accelerate the margin improvement in that segment.\nEarl Austin: Yes. Thanks, Jamie. Telecom, kind of mid-single digits in the quarter, moving towards parity to electric on the forecast going forward. I think we're very close to that. As far as the balance sheet, when we look at it, obviously, we value everything against our stock. There's no shortage of opportunity in the market for sure. But we've transformed the company a little while back, and I think we're really proud of what we've done, and we're going to be prudent about how we go forward. There is places that we see that provide opportunity, both regionally and structurally, within the service line segments that we'll be looking at. But we look at a lot of different things and think about a lot of it strategically over the next decade, and we'll position the company properly going forward. But right now, we can grow the company organically as well. We've done that with Puerto Rico. I think it's still unnoticed. It's still undervalued. The opportunity there that we got in service this quarter, it's just amazing what the company has done and the people of this company. So I just -- that opportunity is large, and we're proud of it. As far as underground, we have a significant amount of underground out in the West, probably some of the largest in the West. So we're able to perform within the segments on the underground that we see. But if we can enhance the margins and certainly, we'll look at those acquisitions as we move forward.\nJamie Cook: Nice quarter.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Ian MacPherson of Piper Sandler.\nIan MacPherson: I think what really stands out to me with your results is the continued momentum in the backlog for electric power. Duke, you've been very purposeful in your language for quarters that the infrastructure bill is not -- your multiyear growth outlook is not reliant or predicated on that in particular. But just anecdotally, do you see -- is your increasing MSA backlog, in some way, leaking in the utilities expectation, not only of all of the secular trends for the business, but also some expectation of that bill? Or do you see the bill still as an incremental layer of commitments from your customers that would materialize in more of a binary fashion once it's resolved?\nEarl Austin: Yes. When we look at the infrastructure bill, I don't think anything we've talked about -- anything on a go-forward basis that we talked about, we can do without the bill. The bill itself, there's large transmission, 2030 projects out there that are not utility-based. For the most part, they're difficult that if you got some DOE backstop and things like that, it would certainly move those forward. That would be great for the industry, great for the renewable sentiment and things of that nature. So no issues there, and it would certainly be additive to anything we've talked about. But that being said, the sentiment around renewables and the interconnections and what's needed, I spoke to my script about redundancy. And it goes unrecognized, the way technology and the way EV and the way any kind of intermittency affects any kind of infrastructure, that you need constant throughput. So data, electric, it doesn't matter. You need the redundancy if you're going to depend on it. And that's the issue, is we haven't started really to get ready for EV, and the modernization of the distribution system to handle electric vehicles is something that's just starting and has a long runway. So I think that, along with the great interconnects and the stacking effects that you see within the infrastructure bill, will only support growth going forward in anything that we've said on a go-forward basis.\nIan MacPherson: That's great. Derrick, I wanted to ask you also about the guidance, and sorry to ask a sort of a trite -- this guidance conservative type of question. But when we look at your prompt year backlog relative to the size of your second half of this year, total revenues, that ratio is looking as conservative as it has in several years, going back probably 5 years or so, and by a fair margin. So I wanted to ask what the -- is there more of a stretched-out tenor of that prompt backlog that should explain that or other factors at play?\nDerrick Jensen: Sure. So we do have a component of larger projects that will continue into the '22 period versus the back half of this year. Some of that is a little bit of work that I called out there in my prepared remarks. So that's putting a little bit of kind of higher ratio to that. And then beyond that, I mean, it's still yet -- as we look at electric power, we continue to look at it. There are opportunities in the range of the guidance there, but some of it is still yet from a ratio perspective at work drifting into '22, considering where we're at.\nEarl Austin: Also, I think it's important to note the amount of storm we had last year versus what you see this year is significant. I mean Derrick can tell you the numbers, but basically, we don't forecast storm in any of our models. So there's -- we're doing this without the storm as well.\nDerrick Jensen: Yes. Well, I mean, to that point, as a reminder, 2020, we had $442 million of storm work. And as it stands here today, our current forecast is only anticipating about $200 million. So we have a year-over-year headwind in overall revenue numbers. And actually, to be even a little bit -- even more specific, when we talk about in our guidance having a double-digit revenue growth opportunity in electric power, to put that in context, for the third quarter of last year, we did $207 million of emergency restoration work versus, as we come up to the rest of this year, right now, you're looking at only about another $80 million or $90 million forecast. So being able to achieve that type of growth in the back end of the year on top of that storm work is -- we're pretty proud of that.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Noelle Dilts of Stifel.\nNoelle Dilts: Congrats on the nice quarter. I was hoping that -- one of your competitors expressed some concern that higher steel and other raw material costs and, maybe to some extent, labor costs could potentially cause utilities to reevaluate the economics of projects and maybe just defer a bit. Could you comment on what you're hearing from your customers on that front and how you're thinking about that type of risk?\nEarl Austin: Yes. Noelle, I mean, we stay pretty close to it. We're not -- there's some effect to steel a bit. Labor, some. When we look at it, we're not seeing the big impacts or anything like that, maybe incidental here or there, but nothing that what I would say structurally -- that is impacting the work going forward. I think anything that we're doing is necessary. If you're going towards any kind of 2030-, 2050-type sentiment and you're bringing in this many electric vehicles and you want this much renewables, it's necessary to move forward. And we're not -- we're just not seeing it.\nNoelle Dilts: Okay. And then sorry if you hit on this, I missed a small amount of your commentary. But in -- around Stronghold, could you discuss in terms of how you're thinking about really moving into 2022 and to what extent you think there is work that's kind of the backlog of work that's built up in the system or kind of the potential for emergent work as you start to get into these facilities in a more meaningful way?\nEarl Austin: Yes. I think we talked about this before. We need to go back in kind of the '08, '09 time frame. They had some kind of demand that went into '11, '12 and beyond. I think we're going to see the same thing starting in '22. Back half of this year has got some pickup in it. But as we start to see traffic, and we're seeing some of it now. But again, I predicated on some sort of a normalized economy and pandemic-related effects as we move forward. That being said, I think '22, either way, is going to be the start of a multiyear, tight maintenance and nice margins into more of a normal basis for Stronghold.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Steven Fisher of UBS.\nSteven Fisher: So this is the highest Q2 electric margin in possibly 8 years, and that's even with a mid-single-digit telecom margin. So I'm wondering if you're thinking about any structurally higher level of margin here as the grid and telecom opportunities really take shape. It was encouraging to hear you talk about the benefits of utilization because I would think that would only improve as the volume ramps up. Or is there that trade-off that's going to come in about investments that you need to make to support the growth that might be somewhat mitigating of that? Just curious how we think about sort of the structural margin direction from here.\nEarl Austin: When we look at the offices, the structural issues have start increasing. I think year-over-year, we're up 3,500 employees or so in North America, and that's with the downturn in Lat Am. So when we think about putting those resources on when -- the electric segment is a mature segment that we're able to do that without really margin decline. So you're seeing that we're utilizing those offices also to work on gas, telecom from a margin standpoint and grab as much operating leverage as we can on a portfolio basis. So that's there. I think structurally, the thing that's different is you have the impacts of Puerto Rico, which Derrick can comment on, that is also driving that margin profile up. We are getting good utilization out of the resources. The funding capabilities are certainly helping us become more efficient. The training that we've put into -- that we've invested in with our line schools and how we're getting people to the field quicker is helping and deferring some of the later costs that we would normally see because we're getting it done upfront. So we're really -- I think the impacts of the things that we've done 5, 6 years ago are starting to take place today.\nSteven Fisher: Okay. Great. And then on the credit loss, not terribly concerned about this as a bigger picture item, but I should ask, what's the risk of others like this? Do you have any other customers that have a profile like Limetree in any part of your business? Are you taking any actions to strengthen your credit protection going forward? I'm just thinking that it might become more relevant depending on who your partners are on this EV charging infrastructure plan. Or were there some newer companies out there?\nEarl Austin: Yes. There's always lessons learned on something that goes the wrong way from any kind of standpoint. So sure, I mean, we'll learn. But I think, for the most part, the credit risk of the company and the people that we work for are very solid. And this was kind of a long process that the EPA came in, and we couldn't see it coming. And I think, in general, the job itself is profitable, and we ended up with this write-off. And certainly, I don't think we'll be talking about it again. Yes. And structurally, the company doesn't have these kind of things with it. But I'll let Derrick comment.\nDerrick Jensen: Yes. I mean, Steve, as you look at over the years, I mean, our allowance for credit losses is generally below $10 million against a very large net position. A credit situation is very, very rare in our situation. We have a high-quality customer base, some of the largest, best companies in the U.S. market. So this is an anomaly. It's a very unusual type of event. We have very few times that we end up finding ourselves in an LP or some other structure like that versus the primary operating company. So we're not really concerned about, on a go-forward basis, this being something of indication. But yes, to your point and Duke's point, we'll continue to monitor that as we take on any new customers.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Marc Bianchi of Cowen.\nMarc Bianchi: I wanted to start by asking about the power line undergrounding in California and the initiative that's announced by the customer there. Maybe if you could help put into context what that could mean for revenue. I think they've talked about getting up to 1,000 miles a year kind of run rate there. Help us think about what that means for your business and also, once all that's installed, if there's sort of a loss of revenue that might come from maintenance work that revolves around handling the stuff that would have previously been overhead.\nEarl Austin: Yes. So the opportunity, we've talked about it. It's large. It's early. So we'll be working with the client, one of our larger customers. California is one of our largest states. So in my mind, when we look at it, obviously, we think it's -- we're in a unique position, unique opportunity for us. It's very hard at this stage to judge what that means for us on a go-forward basis, especially in California. So we'll be prudent about how we talk about it until we know more. We'll work with the client, like we always have. And I do think it benefits us both near and long term. And no, it doesn't -- the effects of undergrounding something doesn't prevent someone from having maintenance. It does help with fire. It does help on certain things, but there will still be plenty of maintenance. That does cut out trimming of trees, which we don't do. So -- but the maintenance on underground and transformers and wire and everything else that goes along with it is certainly there. We do it on a daily basis today. There's a lot of underground within the system today that we maintain, rehab, do many, many things within that realm of possibility. So I think the opportunities are large. In the past, I would have said it didn't make sense to underground. But given the fact that -- what you're seeing with loss of life and the amount, the dollars that are spent on fire, I think it makes a lot of sense. It's a bold kind of big project. But when you think about what's going on, you're always under the gun of bankruptcy or something within fire, it makes perfect sense. I think it's smart, long term, and we'll be working with the client.\nMarc Bianchi: Yes. Okay. Super. The other one I had relates to the EV charging opportunities that you've mentioned in your prepared remarks. I think we all kind of know maybe what those look like, but the revenue opportunity is maybe a bit harder for us to get our hands around. Could you maybe talk to sort of the range of revenue opportunity per project? And are you potentially going to be partnering with a company that's building out EV charging? Or are you going to be kind of serving everybody? How do we think about your strategy to participate in that market?\nEarl Austin: I think we're in a unique position to -- in a prudent way and a cost-effective way, to install battery charging systems, especially high-voltage battery chargers. So we'll be working with the utilities, working with the OEMs, working with manufacturers of vehicles. So all of them. I think, for us, we're happy to try to facilitate that build. But the underlying -- and to quantify it, I'm not sure about how large that piece of it is. What I will say is what's necessary is a distribution system behind it to support that. Is -- from our standpoint, over the next 15 years, 20 years, the amount of work that needs to be done to modernize these distribution systems to allow you to install these charging systems is extremely significant.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Michael Dudas of Vertical Research.\nMichael Dudas: Duke, maybe you could share some of your early thoughts on the transition down in Puerto Rico. I guess it was June 1. So it's been a couple of months. Certainly, there's obviously some -- a lot of press and noise about the changes, which is to be expected. But how has that gone? And you really talked about the opportunities in Puerto Rico, and you've talked about potential larger projects in the future. Is there any kind of visibility on the timing on that front that we could maybe look forward some time in 2022 and beyond?\nEarl Austin: I think the funding -- the infrastructure bill also discussed the funding in Puerto Rico as well. So that's beneficial down there for sure. There's already frame of funding that's appropriated to the island. It should start next year. As far as where we sit and how we think about it, the grid was in bad shape. And I feel like from Quanta's standpoint, our partner's standpoint there, ATCO, that we did a really nice job under extreme difficult situation on the island. And every day, it gets better. Every day, we modernize that system, not from the lack of social media and propaganda, we've made a difference already. We'll continue. I think we'll look back in the next 3 to 4 years and be extremely proud of what we've done as a company. And the people in the island will benefit and see the benefit of what's being done. We really like where we sit. We're having good discussions all throughout the island with not only local -- the economy and the people and everything around it. So the opportunity there is large, and we look forward to the future there. And I commend our people and everything they did to throw their sleeves up and take a lot of heat but also deliver on the back side of it.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Adam Thalhimer of Thompson, Davis.\nAdam Thalhimer: Nice quarter. I wanted to ask a quick question about 2022. You had a couple of positive comments just in your prepared remarks. What kind of growth do you think you can generate next year?\nEarl Austin: I think we've talked about kind of double-digit growth on the 85% of the business. We still see that high single-upper-digit growth. There's stacking of larger projects. We've commented many times, and I'll say it again, we believe we can grow EPS double digits as long as we can use our balance sheet. And we still believe that. We still believe that we can grow it year-over-year. And that's what we -- that's how we look at it.\nAdam Thalhimer: And then quickly, on inflation and materials availability, Duke, are those issues today? And is it a risk going forward?\nEarl Austin: We're not seeing the impacts of that at this point. There's certainly some, I would say, noise in the system, but we're not seeing those impacts with material deliveries and things of that nature. It makes some of the work a little difficult. It gets out of sequence here or there, but we're typically able to overcome that and move around. Some of the projects are larger. We're moving on to something different and able to overcome any kind of material delay. We're working with the client way upfront. And when we talk about front end and things we can do, if we're working with the client way upfront, it allows us to work with them. We know the delays coming so we can move with our resources around and stay productive, stay prudent, and it helps both us and the client long term. And that's the beauty of a collaboration. So we're not seeing those impacts.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Andy Kaplowitz of Citigroup.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Duke or Derrick, can you give us a little more color into how big your Canadian and Australian businesses are these days within underground utility? And then how much are you projecting them to decline this year? And then alternatively, it seems like refining and petrochemical customers, at least in the U.S., have increased their maintenance spend already and are executing more turnarounds, and the catalyst companies are seeing more activities. So can you give us more color regarding the levels of improvement you've seen already within the industrial services business?\nEarl Austin: I'll stick to industrial service business. I'll let Derrick comment on the numbers. So the industrial service business, when you look at it, we believe it's rebounding. We're booking the '22 type seasons. We see '22 coming back to a more normal state, maybe better. It's really early. But the demand for '22 and beyond, we see it. We're talking to the clients about catalyst replacements and things like that, that are coming back. So we think it's -- parting kind of later this year into '22, it's going to be nice business, a more normalized state going forward and talking to client [indiscernible].\nDerrick Jensen: Yes. And as a percentage, it's still running pretty consistent, between the 10% and 15% range of total revenues for the underground group.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: And then you've gotten a lot of questions, obviously, on electric power backlog. I mean it did have another $1 billion sequential jump in Q2. So do you sense that your utility customers are getting more in line than they have before in the past to secure your services? And is there a way to think about how far out you are fully utilized? I mean are you basically fully utilized through '22 at this point in that business?\nEarl Austin: Some of the things that you're seeing, you're seeing multiyear agreements, there were falling capital spends, you're seeing multiyear capital spends being talked about when that wasn't the case 5 years ago. And so we are staying in front of that with the client. So that's some of your backlog growth. And when you think about year-over-year, we're up 3,000, something like that, call it, very close to it, year-over-year, that's the kind of growth that we're putting on from a people aspect within these segments. So I think those are the type of numbers that you'll see going forward, which delivers sort of kind of 85% double-digit type growth that we discussed.\nDerrick Jensen: And some of that backlog is also renewals. We have renewals that -- we have MSAs that are rolling off or historical and then we're coming through and we're renewing that. And you have a bigger pop into it, and that's a part of what's in that equation now. But -- so yes, with the same level of visibility on the renewal as we had in the previous execution.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: But Derrick, to that point, the renewables are all bigger, right? And they're decently bigger? Is that the case?\nDerrick Jensen: Yes. I mean each time we were seeing the renewals, right, we're building off of growth. And so the visibility is to have those play out, attack into a little bit larger number overall.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the floor back over to Quanta Services management team for any closing comments.\nEarl Austin: Yes. I want to thank the people of LUMA in Puerto Rico. That was -- June 1 was a tough day. And I think from our standpoint, it's monumental. We did a nice job down there and the safety that we've been able to encompass throughout. And so I commend them and everyone and anyone that are in the fields. It doesn't go unnoticed here. So I want to thank them first. And thank you for participating in our conference call. We appreciate your questions and your ongoing interest in Quanta Services. Thank you. This concludes the call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced record second quarter 2021 revenues of $3 billion. Net income attributable to common stock was $117 million or $0.81 per diluted share. And adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure, was $1.06. Our electric power revenues were $2.1 billion, a record for the second quarter and a 20% increase when compared to the second quarter of 2020. This increase was driven by continued growth in base business activities as well as contributions from larger transmission projects and revenues from acquired businesses of approximately $70 million. Electric segment operating income margins in 2Q '21 were 11% versus 10.3% in 2Q '20, led by continued execution strength, coupled with increased revenues, which contributed to improved equipment utilization and fixed cost absorption. Operating margins also benefited from approximately $7 million of income associated with our LUMA joint venture. Our communications operations, included within the electric segment, delivered mid-single-digit margins during the quarter. Due to some of the subcontractor and quality issues we identified in the first quarter, we transitioned field leadership on several projects, which led to more normalized margins during the quarter. Those transition activities have been completed, and we expect our communications operations will return to margins at or near double digits for the remainder of the year, similar to the second half of 2020. Underground utility and infrastructure segment revenues were $852 million for the quarter, 19% higher than 2Q '20, due primarily to increased revenues from gas distribution and industrial services, partially offset by reduced revenues from larger pipeline projects. Our industrial operations and non-U.S. markets within this segment remain pressured by COVID-19 dynamics, impacting core quarter revenues and margins. However, last year's second quarter results were more adversely impacted by pandemic-related disruptions. Second quarter operating income margins for the segment were 2.8%, 20 basis points lower than 2Q '20. Negatively impacting second quarter margins was the recognition of a $23.6 million provision for credit loss related to receivables from Limetree Refining, which declared bankruptcy in July 2021, an approximately 280 basis point impact on segment margins. Regarding the provision, our industrial operations had been providing regular turnaround and maintenance services to Limetree Refining's operations at its St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands refinery for several years. Following operational difficulties experienced at the St. Croix refinery, the refinery shut down operations during the second quarter. And shortly thereafter, Limetree Refining filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The bankruptcy process is in its early stages. However, given the uncertainty around the proceedings and the future operations at the St. Croix refinery, we've reserved a substantial portion of our outstanding receivables. We will continue to monitor the bankruptcy process and assess the likelihood of recovery as the facts and circumstances develop. This project began in 2018 and, even after the charge, remains nicely profitable. Excluding the impact of this provision, segment results were otherwise in line with our Q2 expectations. Our total backlog was a record $17 billion at the end of the second quarter, with 12-month backlog at $9 billion, both of which represent solid increases when compared to year-end and the second quarter of 2020. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter where we posted record backlog, a trend that continues to be driven primarily by multiyear MSA programs with North American utilities, which we believe continues to validate the repeatable and sustainable nature of the largest portion of our revenues and earnings. For the second quarter of 2021, we generated free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, of $126 million, $331 million lower than 2Q '20. Net cash provided by operating activities during the second quarter of 2021, although largely in line with our expectations, was negatively impacted by increased working capital requirements related to the continued ramp-up of 2 larger electric transmission projects in Canada and the timing that's associated with billings. The various work stoppage protocols in Canada associated with COVID mitigation have created substantial inefficiencies and production delays. These have led to increased project costs, some of which have already been approved, with the remaining amounts being pursued in normal course. Partially offsetting this was the favorable impact of increased earnings as compared to 2Q '20. The free cash flow generated in the second quarter of 2020 resulted from substantially reduced revenues and the corresponding reduction in working capital. Also during 2Q '20, we deferred the payment of both $58 million of federal and state income taxes and $30.7 million of payroll taxes. The federal and state income taxes were subsequently paid in July 2020, while 50% of the deferred payroll taxes are due by December 31, '21, with the remainder due by December 31, '22. Days sales outstanding, or DSO, measured 83 days for the second quarter of 2021, an increase of 1 day compared to the second quarter of 2020 and comparable to December 31, 2020. We had approximately $212 million of cash at the end of the quarter, with total liquidity of approximately $2.1 billion and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as calculated under our credit agreement, of approximately 1.2x. As we've discussed in the past, our first priority for capital allocation remains supporting the working capital and equipment needs of our operations. However, we remain committed to delivering shareholder value through our dividend and repurchase programs as well as strategic acquisitions. Through the date of this earnings release, we've acquired approximately $58 million worth of stock since the beginning of the year as part of our repurchase program, and we continue to evaluate potential acquisitions that fit our strategic objectives. Turning to guidance. Based on the electric segment's strong performance through the first 6 months of the year and continued confidence in our ability to execute on the opportunities across the segment, we've increased our full year expectations for segment revenues, resulting in a range between $8.7 billion and $8.8 billion for 2021. Similarly, we are increasing our full year margin range for this segment, with 2021 operating margins now expected to range between 10.5% and 11%. Our full year expectations for the Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment, however, have slightly moderated due primarily to a lack of visibility into new project awards that could contribute to the back half of 2021 from our Canadian and Australian operations. Accordingly, we are reducing our full year expectations for this segment, with revenues now expected to range between $3.5 billion and $3.65 billion and segment margins ranging between 4.6% and 5.1%, which includes the $23.6 million or nearly 70 basis point negative impact on a full year basis associated with the provision for credit loss recognized in the second quarter. These segment operating ranges support our increased expectations for 2021 annual revenues of between $12.2 billion and $12.45 billion and adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, of between $1.13 billion and $1.21 billion. The midpoint of the range represents 11% growth when compared to 2020's record adjusted EBITDA. We now expect our full year tax rate to range between 24.25% and 24.75%, a slight reduction from our prior expectations due to favorable tax dynamics in the second quarter associated with certain deferred compensation items. As a result, our increased expectation for full year diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock is now between $3.40 and $3.76, and our increased expectation for adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock, a non-GAAP measure, is now between $4.32 and $4.68. We expect cash generation associated with our increased expectations for our revenue and earnings will be slightly offset by higher working capital requirements in the second half of the year. And accordingly, we are maintaining our free cash flow guidance for the year, expecting it to range between $400 million and $600 million. As we stated in prior quarters, our quarterly free cash flow is subject to sizable movements due to various customer and project dynamics that can occur in the normal course of operations. For additional information, please refer to our outlook summary, which can be found in the Financial Info section of our IR website at quantaservices.com. Overall, our core utility-based operations continue to execute at a high level, and we are well positioned to deliver solutions to meet the expanding capital and maintenance programs of our North American utility partners. We firmly believe we are in the early stages of a significant infrastructure investment cycle and our ability to train and deploy world-class craft-skilled labor differentiates us in the markets we serve. This craft skill foundation, coupled with our balance sheet strength, gives us the ability to deliver industry-leading solutions to our customers while maintaining the ability to opportunistically deploy capital to deliver long-term shareholder value. This concludes our formal presentation, and we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator? Sure. So we do have a component of larger projects that will continue into the '22 period versus the back half of this year. Some of that is a little bit of work that I called out there in my prepared remarks. So that's putting a little bit of kind of higher ratio to that. And then beyond that, I mean, it's still yet -- as we look at electric power, we continue to look at it. There are opportunities in the range of the guidance there, but some of it is still yet from a ratio perspective at work drifting into '22, considering where we're at. Yes. Well, I mean, to that point, as a reminder, 2020, we had $442 million of storm work. And as it stands here today, our current forecast is only anticipating about $200 million. So we have a year-over-year headwind in overall revenue numbers. And actually, to be even a little bit -- even more specific, when we talk about in our guidance having a double-digit revenue growth opportunity in electric power, to put that in context, for the third quarter of last year, we did $207 million of emergency restoration work versus, as we come up to the rest of this year, right now, you're looking at only about another $80 million or $90 million forecast. So being able to achieve that type of growth in the back end of the year on top of that storm work is -- we're pretty proud of that. Yes. I mean, Steve, as you look at over the years, I mean, our allowance for credit losses is generally below $10 million against a very large net position. A credit situation is very, very rare in our situation. We have a high-quality customer base, some of the largest, best companies in the U.S. market. So this is an anomaly. It's a very unusual type of event. We have very few times that we end up finding ourselves in an LP or some other structure like that versus the primary operating company. So we're not really concerned about, on a go-forward basis, this being something of indication. But yes, to your point and Duke's point, we'll continue to monitor that as we take on any new customers. Yes. And as a percentage, it's still running pretty consistent, between the 10% and 15% range of total revenues for the underground group. And some of that backlog is also renewals. We have renewals that -- we have MSAs that are rolling off or historical and then we're coming through and we're renewing that. And you have a bigger pop into it, and that's a part of what's in that equation now. But -- so yes, with the same level of visibility on the renewal as we had in the previous execution. Yes. I mean each time we were seeing the renewals, right, we're building off of growth. And so the visibility is to have those play out, attack into a little bit larger number overall."

            "content": "Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today, I will provide operational and strategic commentary and will then turn it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a review of our second quarter results and full year 2021 financial expectations. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions. This morning, we reported solid results with record second quarter revenues and earnings per share. Backlog of $17 billion at the end of the quarter was also a record, which we believe reflects the benefits of our collaborative approach with customers and the continued advancement of our long-term growth strategies. We continue to see opportunities for multiyear growth across our service lines driven by our solution-based approach and the growth of programmatic spending with existing and new customers. Our electric power solutions operations had another strong quarter, with record revenues and better-than-expected margins, reflecting solid and safe execution, favorable end market conditions and continued momentum as a result of ongoing grade modernization, system hardening and renewable energy interconnections. Our Electric Power backlog continues to increase, driven primarily by significant multiyear master service agreements with utilities, which adds to the substantial MSA backlog growth from the first quarter. We are proud of our execution and confident in our strong market position to capitalize on the opportunities created by favorable long-term trends, driving utility investment and demand for our comprehensive solutions. As an example, one of our largest electric customers in the Western United States recently announced a major new multiyear program to underground approximately 10,000 miles of electric distribution power lines and high fire-threat districts in the utility service territory. This initiative is in the planning stages and is expected to incorporate input from numerous stakeholders and be implemented over a number of years. While it may seem like a bold endeavor and unprecedented in its scale, the imperative to mitigate the risk of wildfires and the economic and human costs caused by them, as evidenced over the last several years in the Western United States, soon will outweigh the capital investment necessary to complete this kind of program. Electric utilities in other areas of the country are also pursuing initiatives to underground critical infrastructure. Examples include electric transmission projects in the Northeast, distribution circuits along the coast lines, electric transmission line projects for offshore wind generation and undergrounding transmission and distribution initiatives by other utilities in California. Many of these initiatives are part of a large-scale, multiyear system hardening programs, which provide meaningful opportunities for Quanta. We continue to see accelerated renewable generation development and associated demand for our services, including transmission interconnects, substations and energy storage. Our customers continue to advance their efforts to achieve carbon neutrality, in large part through increasing renewable generation investments. For example, we have begun work on what will become the largest solar power battery storage center in the world for a long-standing utility customer. We believe public policy and the positive general sentiment supporting a greener environment will drive North America's power generation mix increasingly towards renewables over the near and longer term. And as these dynamics continue to advance, demand for our services could accelerate. Related to these opportunities, we are actively pursuing larger high-voltage electric transmission projects associated with interconnecting renewable generation, which are scheduled to be awarded by the end of this year, with work expected to begin in 2022. We believe Quanta is the industry leader in performing larger-scale high-voltage electric transmission projects in North America, with an industry-leading track record of safely executing for our customers on time and on budget, and we are well positioned for these opportunities. Additionally, we are experiencing accelerating activity and opportunities for our electric vehicle infrastructure installation and program management capabilities. We are in active discussions with several industry participants about managing the deployment of thousands of charging stations, both regionally and nationally. These are exciting and meaningful prospects but just part of the equation in our view. More importantly, we feel the market is underestimating the significant investment needed to modernize and expand the capacity of the electric distribution system to accommodate the mass deployment of retail and commercial fleet electric vehicle charging infrastructure. And finally, in June, LUMA Energy and its employees, as supported by Quanta and its joint venture partner, ATCO, commenced the operations and maintenance of Puerto Rico's electric power transmission and distribution system under a supplemental terms agreement, following nearly a year of preparation. In LUMA, we have created a purpose-built and effective operator for the Puerto Rico T&D system and the people of Puerto Rico. We remain steadfast in our commitment to continue to invest our time, expertise and resources to help drive efficient operations at LUMA as it works to deliver a modern, secure, resilient and affordable electric grid and to develop a highly trained, craft-skilled workforce for the future of Puerto Rico. Our communications operations performed well in the second quarter, and we continue to profitably scale and grow the business. As we discussed in our last earnings call, the subcontractor challenges we experienced in the first quarter were an isolated issue and did not continue into the second quarter. We are on track to generate high single- or double-digit operating income margins for the remainder of this year and remain confident in our ability to profitably grow our operations. Service providers continue to push fiber closer to the customer. Fiber backhaul justification is ongoing, and 5G wireless infrastructure development is increasing. Further, in response to the meaningful federal funding being provided for broadband network expansion in underserved markets, we are seeing accelerated spending by our cooperative and municipal electric customers who also provide communication services, allowing us to leverage our relationships to provide turnkey telecom solutions to them. On our first quarter earnings call, we announced a strategic alliance with and minority investment in a broadband technology partner. Under our alliance agreement with them, Quanta is serving as the program manager for a large-scale deployment of their fixed broadband technology. To that end, we recently began the large-scale installation of their technology in several cities, with opportunities to expand our technology into additional cities in 2022. We believe that Quanta is uniquely positioned between the communications and the utility industries to provide solutions for broadband and 5G technology deployments by leveraging existing infrastructure, and our relationship with this broadband technology provider is evidence of that. Our Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment generally performed well in the quarter, with the exception of a provision for the credit loss taken related to a customer that recently declared bankruptcy, which Derrick will discuss in his remarks. I will note, however, that this was not because of our performance or execution on the project and that even with the allowance, we were profitable on the work we performed. We continue to experience solid demand for our gas utility and pipeline integrity services, which are driven by regulated spend to modernize systems, reduce methane emissions, ensure environmental compliance and improve safety and reliability. Our industrial services and -- are strengthening and should continue to do so through the balance of this year. Further, we expect continued recovery of our industrial services operations in 2022 due to the return of customer maintenance and capital spending that was previously deferred due to the effects of COVID-19 on the downstream market. Additionally, we were recently awarded more than $350 million of larger pipeline projects, primarily in Canada. We expect a portion of this revenue to be recognized this year, with the majority of the revenue to be realized in 2022. Somewhat restraining the segment's recovery are heightened restrictions and concerns in Australia and Canada due to the surge of the Delta COVID-19 variant and its effect on our operations in those countries. I hope that our comments this morning and from our prior calls convey our confidence in the strategic initiatives we are executing on, the competitive position we have in the marketplace and our positive multiyear outlook. On our last earnings call, I commented that our positive outlook and strategic plan are not reliant on the infrastructure proposal being pursued in Washington, D.C. but that if the bill were enacted, it could provide incremental opportunity for Quanta over the near and longer term. As many of you know, significant progress has recently been made on a bipartisan infrastructure package that includes funding and policies to encourage new infrastructure development and modernization in several of our core markets. While additional political steps are still required, we are encouraged by what we see in the most recently proposed legislation. We believe our business is strong, and we continue to have a favorable outlook for the rest of this year. As a result, in our earnings release this morning, we raised our 2021 guidance. We believe this demonstrates the strength and sustainability of our business and long-term strategy, our ability to safely execute and our strong competitive position in the marketplace. We also believe that our business and opportunities for profitable growth in 2022 are gaining momentum, driven by our solutions-based approach, the growth of programmatic spending with the existing and new customers, opportunities for larger electric transmission projects and the opportunity for recovery of certain portions of our business that have been affected by the global pandemic. On prior calls, we have discussed our strategy of enhancing our front-end capabilities such as engineering and permitting to complement our world-class construction expertise, which is designed to provide differentiated, comprehensive and industry-leading solutions to our customers. I am pleased to report that our strategy has been well received by our customers across our service lines and is allowing us to better support them and capture more of their programmatic spend. Our markets continue to evolve and strengthen, driven by longer-term favorable trends, including modernization, system hardening, electrification, carbon neutrality initiatives and the adoption of new technologies. Additionally, our customers and regulators increasingly understand that the rapid growth in renewable generation, electric vehicles and data-intensive technologies bring significant intermittency, which strains existing systems and creates challenges for planning the grids and networks of the future. For these advancements to be successful, infrastructure requires redundancy to ensure reliability. We believe the infrastructure investment necessary to support these initiatives are still in the early stages of deployment, which provides us with years of visibility and growth opportunities. And finally, an important part of our value proposition to all of our stakeholders is Quanta's commitment to corporate responsibility and sustainability. To that end, earlier this week, we published our 2020 corporate responsibility report, which discusses the company's accomplishments last year as well as our commitments to people, planet and principles. Quanta has a great ESG story to tell, and we are pleased with the progress we are making to provide increased transparency into our corporate responsibility and sustainability initiatives. We are focused on operating the business for the longer term and expect to continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class field leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's base business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's diversity, unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset form the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for all our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his review of our second quarter results and 2021 expectations. Derrick? Yes. Chad, thanks. When we look at our MSA work going forward, I think when we're working with the customers in a collaborative manner, we're looking at their capital spend, they're working with us, and we're looking at that body of work or that body of capital over time and providing solutions to them through an MSA form. So it allows us to work with them in a strategic manner on a go-forward basis. And yes, somewhat to lock up resources, but also to make sure from a constructability and a prudency manner that we can go out and deliver it. I think when you look at labor and look at what we've done with labor and our ability to perform and perform at a cost and on time, we've been able to do that. And so the clients are recognizing that, and that's why we're having these conversations in a long-term manner and also independent services. As far as how we look at escalations in labor, we do pricing and escalations on all of our labor as we move forward. So that's something that we do and have done for the past 50 years. Yes. There's two parts to most of these projects when you're thinking about renewables or anything really for that matter, battery storage. Your interconnections or substations and your collector systems that allow you to push the generation or storage onto the grid, so we're certainly involved in that on a daily basis. It's fairly technical and that's part of this. And the risk on the battery is big battery. So both of those things are something that we do quite often and very transferable from our standpoint on a go-forward basis, so something that we believe is right down the fairway for us. And when we look at pricing, it's both fixed, both unit-based, both lump sum either way, but we're very comfortable in that -- those type of projects. And we're not taking output risk or we're not taking product risk either on any of that. I think we set out -- the company set out 6, 7 years ago to really work with the client at the customer level to develop a relationship-based discussion to provide them with resources for capital. And so when the customers have been struggling to get their capital spend because of permitting, because of engineering or whatever it may be, we felt like we can make a difference there, and there wouldn't be an intermediary between us and the client. And we felt like from a constructability position, we could better service the client to build. And so that, from our standpoint, we could deliver the resources, we could talk to the client on the front side of the business and deliver a capital project that was at the best cost to the rate payer. And that's how we look at it. We look at it from a rate payer standpoint and work with the client to deliver the best product we can in a prudent manner. Yes. Sean, I think when you look at the company, you look at the portfolio, we are getting operating leverage out of these larger operating units within our -- in the company. And when you look at the quarter, the second quarter, if you look at adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter, it's double digits. We set out to produce double-digit EBITDA, we're doing it. And yes, there's opportunities in our industrial segment on a go-forward basis to pick those up into higher upper single digits like we talked about before and also that piece of the segment. But in general, we're still looking at this in a portfolio. And we don't care if it's underground gas or underground electric, we are there to make sure that we fully utilize our resources and fully utilize equipment to produce the highest margin we can, no matter what the segment is. Yes. Thanks, Jamie. Telecom, kind of mid-single digits in the quarter, moving towards parity to electric on the forecast going forward. I think we're very close to that. As far as the balance sheet, when we look at it, obviously, we value everything against our stock. There's no shortage of opportunity in the market for sure. But we've transformed the company a little while back, and I think we're really proud of what we've done, and we're going to be prudent about how we go forward. There is places that we see that provide opportunity, both regionally and structurally, within the service line segments that we'll be looking at. But we look at a lot of different things and think about a lot of it strategically over the next decade, and we'll position the company properly going forward. But right now, we can grow the company organically as well. We've done that with Puerto Rico. I think it's still unnoticed. It's still undervalued. The opportunity there that we got in service this quarter, it's just amazing what the company has done and the people of this company. So I just -- that opportunity is large, and we're proud of it. As far as underground, we have a significant amount of underground out in the West, probably some of the largest in the West. So we're able to perform within the segments on the underground that we see. But if we can enhance the margins and certainly, we'll look at those acquisitions as we move forward. Yes. When we look at the infrastructure bill, I don't think anything we've talked about -- anything on a go-forward basis that we talked about, we can do without the bill. The bill itself, there's large transmission, 2030 projects out there that are not utility-based. For the most part, they're difficult that if you got some DOE backstop and things like that, it would certainly move those forward. That would be great for the industry, great for the renewable sentiment and things of that nature. So no issues there, and it would certainly be additive to anything we've talked about. But that being said, the sentiment around renewables and the interconnections and what's needed, I spoke to my script about redundancy. And it goes unrecognized, the way technology and the way EV and the way any kind of intermittency affects any kind of infrastructure, that you need constant throughput. So data, electric, it doesn't matter. You need the redundancy if you're going to depend on it. And that's the issue, is we haven't started really to get ready for EV, and the modernization of the distribution system to handle electric vehicles is something that's just starting and has a long runway. So I think that, along with the great interconnects and the stacking effects that you see within the infrastructure bill, will only support growth going forward in anything that we've said on a go-forward basis. Also, I think it's important to note the amount of storm we had last year versus what you see this year is significant. I mean Derrick can tell you the numbers, but basically, we don't forecast storm in any of our models. So there's -- we're doing this without the storm as well. Yes. Noelle, I mean, we stay pretty close to it. We're not -- there's some effect to steel a bit. Labor, some. When we look at it, we're not seeing the big impacts or anything like that, maybe incidental here or there, but nothing that what I would say structurally -- that is impacting the work going forward. I think anything that we're doing is necessary. If you're going towards any kind of 2030-, 2050-type sentiment and you're bringing in this many electric vehicles and you want this much renewables, it's necessary to move forward. And we're not -- we're just not seeing it. Yes. I think we talked about this before. We need to go back in kind of the '08, '09 time frame. They had some kind of demand that went into '11, '12 and beyond. I think we're going to see the same thing starting in '22. Back half of this year has got some pickup in it. But as we start to see traffic, and we're seeing some of it now. But again, I predicated on some sort of a normalized economy and pandemic-related effects as we move forward. That being said, I think '22, either way, is going to be the start of a multiyear, tight maintenance and nice margins into more of a normal basis for Stronghold. When we look at the offices, the structural issues have start increasing. I think year-over-year, we're up 3,500 employees or so in North America, and that's with the downturn in Lat Am. So when we think about putting those resources on when -- the electric segment is a mature segment that we're able to do that without really margin decline. So you're seeing that we're utilizing those offices also to work on gas, telecom from a margin standpoint and grab as much operating leverage as we can on a portfolio basis. So that's there. I think structurally, the thing that's different is you have the impacts of Puerto Rico, which Derrick can comment on, that is also driving that margin profile up. We are getting good utilization out of the resources. The funding capabilities are certainly helping us become more efficient. The training that we've put into -- that we've invested in with our line schools and how we're getting people to the field quicker is helping and deferring some of the later costs that we would normally see because we're getting it done upfront. So we're really -- I think the impacts of the things that we've done 5, 6 years ago are starting to take place today. Yes. There's always lessons learned on something that goes the wrong way from any kind of standpoint. So sure, I mean, we'll learn. But I think, for the most part, the credit risk of the company and the people that we work for are very solid. And this was kind of a long process that the EPA came in, and we couldn't see it coming. And I think, in general, the job itself is profitable, and we ended up with this write-off. And certainly, I don't think we'll be talking about it again. Yes. And structurally, the company doesn't have these kind of things with it. But I'll let Derrick comment. Yes. So the opportunity, we've talked about it. It's large. It's early. So we'll be working with the client, one of our larger customers. California is one of our largest states. So in my mind, when we look at it, obviously, we think it's -- we're in a unique position, unique opportunity for us. It's very hard at this stage to judge what that means for us on a go-forward basis, especially in California. So we'll be prudent about how we talk about it until we know more. We'll work with the client, like we always have. And I do think it benefits us both near and long term. And no, it doesn't -- the effects of undergrounding something doesn't prevent someone from having maintenance. It does help with fire. It does help on certain things, but there will still be plenty of maintenance. That does cut out trimming of trees, which we don't do. So -- but the maintenance on underground and transformers and wire and everything else that goes along with it is certainly there. We do it on a daily basis today. There's a lot of underground within the system today that we maintain, rehab, do many, many things within that realm of possibility. So I think the opportunities are large. In the past, I would have said it didn't make sense to underground. But given the fact that -- what you're seeing with loss of life and the amount, the dollars that are spent on fire, I think it makes a lot of sense. It's a bold kind of big project. But when you think about what's going on, you're always under the gun of bankruptcy or something within fire, it makes perfect sense. I think it's smart, long term, and we'll be working with the client. I think we're in a unique position to -- in a prudent way and a cost-effective way, to install battery charging systems, especially high-voltage battery chargers. So we'll be working with the utilities, working with the OEMs, working with manufacturers of vehicles. So all of them. I think, for us, we're happy to try to facilitate that build. But the underlying -- and to quantify it, I'm not sure about how large that piece of it is. What I will say is what's necessary is a distribution system behind it to support that. Is -- from our standpoint, over the next 15 years, 20 years, the amount of work that needs to be done to modernize these distribution systems to allow you to install these charging systems is extremely significant. I think the funding -- the infrastructure bill also discussed the funding in Puerto Rico as well. So that's beneficial down there for sure. There's already frame of funding that's appropriated to the island. It should start next year. As far as where we sit and how we think about it, the grid was in bad shape. And I feel like from Quanta's standpoint, our partner's standpoint there, ATCO, that we did a really nice job under extreme difficult situation on the island. And every day, it gets better. Every day, we modernize that system, not from the lack of social media and propaganda, we've made a difference already. We'll continue. I think we'll look back in the next 3 to 4 years and be extremely proud of what we've done as a company. And the people in the island will benefit and see the benefit of what's being done. We really like where we sit. We're having good discussions all throughout the island with not only local -- the economy and the people and everything around it. So the opportunity there is large, and we look forward to the future there. And I commend our people and everything they did to throw their sleeves up and take a lot of heat but also deliver on the back side of it. I think we've talked about kind of double-digit growth on the 85% of the business. We still see that high single-upper-digit growth. There's stacking of larger projects. We've commented many times, and I'll say it again, we believe we can grow EPS double digits as long as we can use our balance sheet. And we still believe that. We still believe that we can grow it year-over-year. And that's what we -- that's how we look at it. We're not seeing the impacts of that at this point. There's certainly some, I would say, noise in the system, but we're not seeing those impacts with material deliveries and things of that nature. It makes some of the work a little difficult. It gets out of sequence here or there, but we're typically able to overcome that and move around. Some of the projects are larger. We're moving on to something different and able to overcome any kind of material delay. We're working with the client way upfront. And when we talk about front end and things we can do, if we're working with the client way upfront, it allows us to work with them. We know the delays coming so we can move with our resources around and stay productive, stay prudent, and it helps both us and the client long term. And that's the beauty of a collaboration. So we're not seeing those impacts. I'll stick to industrial service business. I'll let Derrick comment on the numbers. So the industrial service business, when you look at it, we believe it's rebounding. We're booking the '22 type seasons. We see '22 coming back to a more normal state, maybe better. It's really early. But the demand for '22 and beyond, we see it. We're talking to the clients about catalyst replacements and things like that, that are coming back. So we think it's -- parting kind of later this year into '22, it's going to be nice business, a more normalized state going forward and talking to client [indiscernible]. Some of the things that you're seeing, you're seeing multiyear agreements, there were falling capital spends, you're seeing multiyear capital spends being talked about when that wasn't the case 5 years ago. And so we are staying in front of that with the client. So that's some of your backlog growth. And when you think about year-over-year, we're up 3,000, something like that, call it, very close to it, year-over-year, that's the kind of growth that we're putting on from a people aspect within these segments. So I think those are the type of numbers that you'll see going forward, which delivers sort of kind of 85% double-digit type growth that we discussed. Yes. I want to thank the people of LUMA in Puerto Rico. That was -- June 1 was a tough day. And I think from our standpoint, it's monumental. We did a nice job down there and the safety that we've been able to encompass throughout. And so I commend them and everyone and anyone that are in the fields. It doesn't go unnoticed here. So I want to thank them first. And thank you for participating in our conference call. We appreciate your questions and your ongoing interest in Quanta Services. Thank you. This concludes the call."

With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Duke Austin, Quanta's President and CEO. Duke?\nDuke Austin: Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. On the call today, I will provide operational and strategic commentary and we'll then turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a review of our first quarter results and full year 2021 financial expectations. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions. This morning, we reported solid first quarter results, with revenues of $2.7 billion in GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.62 and $0.83 respectively. Backlog at the end of the quarter was a record $15.8 billion, which we believe reflects the continued advancement of our long-term growth strategies. We continue to see opportunities for multi-year growth across our service lines, driven by our solutions-based approach and the growth of programmatic spending with existing and new customers. The recognition that the country's infrastructure needs to be modernized to support economic growth improved safety and reliability and for a cleaner environment is evidenced by the Biden administration's recently proposed $2 trillion infrastructure plan. The proposal will evolve and take time to move through the political process. But as proposed, the plan includes funding and policies to encourage new infrastructure development and modernization in several of our core markets including, high-voltage electric transmission and power grid modernization and resiliency, renewable energy, electric vehicle charging station infrastructure and other electrification initiatives, and broadband infrastructure expansion. While this infrastructure proposal could accelerate activity in these areas and provide incremental opportunity for Quanta over several years, I want to stress that our positive multiyear outlook and strategic plan are not reliant on this infrastructure proposal. We have been collaborating with our customers for many years to support their significant multiyear investment programs already in place to modernize the existing power grid, ensure reliable power delivery and to integrate higher levels of renewable generation. Our Electric Power Solutions operations performed well during the quarter, reflecting broad-based business strength, driven by ongoing grid modernization, system hardening, renewable energy interconnections and solid and safe execution. During the quarter, we signed a significant multiyear master services agreement with a utility in the Western United States, which made a substantial incremental contribution to our record first quarter backlog. We believe our record backlog and these initiatives will continue to drive multiyear growth opportunities for Quanta. Though COVID-19 has created some near-term challenges in Canada, we see opportunities to pursue additional large projects there for the coming years. Additionally, our discussions with high-voltage electric transmission project sponsors in the United States have increased as the need for large-scale electric transmission infrastructure to support growing renewable generation and achieve carbon-neutrality goals become evident. LUMA Energy and its employees, as supported by Quanta and its joint venture partner ATCO, are all working diligently towards transitioning the operations and maintenance of the Puerto Rico electric power grid to LUMA in early June. LUMA's efforts under the agreement are intended to deliver long-term social and economic benefits to the people of Puerto Rico. As stated previously, we believe this opportunity is transformative for all the parties involved, including the people of Puerto Rico, and the work to be performed by LUMA under the 15-year contract aligns with Quanta's strategy of providing sophisticated and valuable solutions to the utility, industry that benefits consumers. The majority of our communications operations are off to a solid start this year, driven by strong demand for fiber densification to reach homes and businesses and the early stages of 5G network deployments. However, during the quarter, we experienced short-term challenges really associated with efficient subcontractor work in a specific geographic area, which required rework. We have addressed our quality assessment protocol shortcomings on this issue and are pursuing compensation from the subcontractor. This was an isolated issue, and we believe we are on track to generate high-single or double-digit operating income margins for the remainder of this year. Additionally, we continue to believe, we can achieve at least $1 billion in annual revenue with double-digit operating income margins in the medium term. As service providers continue to push fiber closer to the customer, fiber backhaul densification continues, 5G wireless infrastructure development increases, and meaningful federal funding is provided for broadband network expansion initiatives in underserved markets. On prior calls, we have shared our belief that Quanta is uniquely positioned between the communications and utility industries to provide solutions for broadband and 5G technology deployments leveraging existing infrastructure. We have made significant progress working with our customers and a broadband technology partner and during the first quarter made a minority financial investment in this partner. We also entered into a strategic alliance with them where Quanta will serve as a program manager for large-scale deployments of their fixed wireless broadband technology which we utilized our customers' facilities where appropriate. We believe this relationship advances our solutions with customers to accelerate and improve access to affordable and reliable broadband in rural and underserved markets. We believe our proactive strategy and the unique solutions Quanta provides the marketplace enhances our opportunity to expand our telecom infrastructure solutions with other utility and communication customers. Our Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment performed well in the quarter with better than expected profitability despite seasonality and continued challenges caused by COVID-19. We are confident in our full year expectations for the segment driven by solid demand for our gas utility and pipeline integrity service. Additionally, there are encouraging signs supporting our expectations of improved demand for our industrial services beginning in the second half of this year. We believe deferred maintenance and capital spending due to the effects of COVID on the downstream market is creating pent-up demand for our services which should prove beneficial as market conditions normalize for our customers. However, we would like to see how the summer travel season develops which could influence activity levels of our downstream customers before making adjustments to our full year expectations for this segment. The solutions Quanta provides support our customers' efforts to increase reliability, safety, efficiency, and connectivity all of which have favorable, environmental, and social impact. Our end markets and multiyear visibility are solid and we have built a strong platform that positions us well to capitalize on favorable long-term trends particularly grid modernization and hardening, the transition toward a carbon-neutral economy, and the adoption of new technologies such as 5G, battery storage, and hydrogen. Previously, we have discussed our strategic focus on enhancing our front-end capabilities such as engineering and permitting. To complement our world-class construction expertise, our strategy is designed to provide differentiated comprehensive and industry-leading solutions to our customers which we have achieved through organic investment and select acquisitions. This strategy is contributing to our backlog growth increasing our total addressable market and providing meaningful growth opportunities for the future. In our earnings release this morning, we raised our 2021 guidance due to solid first quarter results and confidence in the business. We believe this demonstrates the strength and sustainability of our business and long-term strategy, favorable end market trends, our ability to safely execute, and our strong competitive position in the marketplace. We continue to believe we are in a multiyear up cycle with continued opportunity for further record backlog and results in 2021. We are focused on operating the business for the long-term and expect to continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class build leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's base business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's diversity unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset form the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for all our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO for his review of our first quarter results and 2021 expectations. Derrick?\nDerrick Jensen: Thanks, Duke and good morning, everyone. Today we announced first quarter 2021 revenues of $2.7 billion. Net income attributable to common stock was $90 million or $0.62 per diluted share and adjusted diluted earnings per share a non-GAAP measure was $0.83. The first quarter was another strong quarter for Quanta led by continued strength from electric power and better-than-expected profitability from our Underground Utility and Infrastructure segment. Our electric power revenues were $2.1 billion a record for the first quarter and a 17% increase when compared to the first quarter of 2020. This increase was driven by continued growth in base business activities as well as contributions from larger transmission projects underway in Canada and revenues from acquired businesses of approximately $70 million. Also revenues associated with emergency restoration services attributable to winter storm response efforts were approximately $80 million a first quarter record. Electric segment margins in 1Q 2021 were 9.7% versus 7.3% in 1Q 2020. The improved operating margins were driven by double-digit performance from our electric operations within the segment including the benefit associated with increased profit contributions from emergency restoration efforts, which typically present opportunities for higher margins than our normal base business activities due to higher utilization. Operating margins also benefited from approximately $5 million of income associated with our LUMA joint venture. Negatively impacting first quarter margins were recorded reserves for the identified issues Duke discussed, which when combined with normal seasonality exacerbated by severe weather challenges from winter Storm Uri created an operating loss within our US telecom operations for the quarter. Again we believe we have addressed the issues and expect margins at or near double-digits going forward. Underground Utility and Infrastructure segment revenues were $643 million for the quarter, 35% lower than 1Q 2020 due primarily due to reduced revenues from our industrial operations and a reduction in contributions from larger pipeline projects. Operations within this segment in last year's first quarter results had yet to be impacted by COVID-19 headwinds. And in fact our industrial operations had record results in the period. In 1Q 2021, the segment continues to be negatively impacted by COVID-19 with first quarter revenues from our Canadian operations and our industrial operations both meaningfully below pre-pandemic levels. Despite the COVID-related headwinds, the segment delivered margins of 1.4%. And although 170 basis points lower than 1Q 2020 primarily due to the reduced revenues, the results exceeded our original expectations for 1Q led by execution across much of our base business activity including our gas distribution and industrial services. Our total backlog was a record $15.8 billion at the end of the first quarter with 12-month backlog of $8.9 billion representing solid increases when compared to year end as well as the first quarter of 2020. This marks the third consecutive quarter where we posted record backlog, a trend driven primarily by continued growth in multiyear MSA programs with North American utilities which we believe continues to validate the repeatable sustainable nature of the largest portion of our revenues and earnings. For the first quarter of 2021, we generated free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure of $49 million, $115 million lower than 1Q 2020, however 1Q 2020 included the collection of $82 million of insurance proceeds associated with the settlement of two pipeline project claims. Day sales outstanding or DSO measured 89 days for the first quarter, an increase of four days compared to the first quarter of 2020 and an increase of six days compared to December 31, 2020. These increases are primarily due to the expected ramp in work on two larger electric transmission projects in Canada in the first quarter and the timing of billing. The Canadian response to COVID has significantly hampered production for which we will seek recovery and delayed this in meeting certain billing milestones. We had approximately $200 million of cash at the end of the quarter with total liquidity of approximately $2.1 billion and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio as calculated under our credit agreement of approximately 1.3 times. Integration activities associated with acquisitions closed in the back half of 2020 are ongoing and we closed another small acquisition during the first quarter of 2021. We continue to take an opportunistic view towards acquisitions and maintain the balance sheet strength to support strategic capital outlays in this area. Additionally, through the date of this earnings release, we acquired approximately $29 million worth of stock as part of our repurchase program. We remain committed to delivering shareholder value through prudent capital deployment. Turning to guidance. Based on the Electric segment's strong first quarter and continued confidence in our ability to execute on the opportunities across the segment, we've increased the low end of our full year expectations for segment revenues resulting in a range between $8.4 billion and $8.5 billion for 2021. Similarly, we are increasing the low end of our full year margin range for the segment with 2021 operating margins now expected to range between 10.2% and 10.9%. Regarding the Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment, while we had a nice start to the year, we are not yet in a position to change our full year expectations. Accordingly, we are reiterating our original full year guidance for the segment with revenues expected to range between $3.65 billion and $3.85 billion and segment margins ranging between 5.5% and 6%. These segment operating ranges support our increased expectations for 2021 annual revenues of between $12.05 billion to $12.35 billion and adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure of between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion. The midpoint of the range represents 10% growth when compared to 2020's record adjusted EBITDA. In addition to these improved operating expectations, our full year expectations for net income and adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure are expected to benefit from a reduced annual tax rate, driven by higher benefits realized in the first quarter associated with the fair value of vested stock compensation awards. We now expect our full year tax rate to range between 25.25% and 25.75%. As a result, our increased expectation for full year diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock is now between $3.25 and $3.69, and our increased expectation for adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock a non-GAAP measure is now between $4.12 and $4.57. We are maintaining our free cash flow guidance for the year, expecting it to range between $400 million and $600 million. And we'll reiterate that quarterly free cash flow is subject to sizable movements due to various customer and project dynamics that can occur in the normal course of operations. For additional information, please refer to our outlook summary, which can be found in the Financial Info section of our IR website at quantaservices.com. Overall, we are pleased with the start to the year and remain confident in the strength of our operations and prospects for profitable growth. As our backlog continues to grow and our visibility into the duration of this infrastructure cycle continues to improve, we have increasing conviction in our ability to capitalize on the opportunities across our end markets. We firmly believe the repeatable nature of our base business solutions coupled with opportunistic larger project deployments, disciplined capital allocation and continued balance sheet strength will be the key to delivering long-term shareholder value. This concludes our formal presentation and we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Chad Dillard [ph] of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. Good morning guys. Just wanted to dig a little bit into the infrastructure plan. So beyond the headline $100 billion of funding for power infrastructure, can you talk about the potential changes from a policy perspective that you could see in this plan? And whether that could actually have an impact on the process of construction or even before that out on the permitting side? And then secondly, the bill has also allocated a decent amount of money to water pipe infrastructure. Is this an area of interest for Quanta I mean given its heritage of linear construction? Thanks.\nDuke Austin: Good morning, Chad. The policy and the plan under administration, I do think it benefits us. As always states have a lot of say in right-of-ways and easements and permits. So I do think that that will be a sticking point as we move forward. But even without the plan, I would say the sentiment around the carbon-free environment neutrality is there we continue to see larger projects that are moving forward. So it's a robust environment in my mind with or without the federal funding. So I -- while it's good, I believe every bit of that would be incremental to anything we've commented on in the past. As well -- as far as water we do some water now. Anything involves cross-skill labor, we're riding there on it and looking at it. We believe that's kind of our core to us is our ability to perform that. So we do look at water quite a bit. I'm not signaling anything on that. I just -- we do look at it.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got you. Okay. And just a question. I mean I know that your reason for underground guide us on the revenue side hasn't necessarily changed, but just curious about how you think about the industrial business in particular? Can you talk about how it trended in 1Q versus your expectations? And has there been any change in terms of how you're thinking about guidance for that business? Are you still expecting flat for this year?\nDuke Austin: When we look at the underground business, again we look at these businesses as a portfolio. So I would just say the LDC business, the integrity business there is working out nicely. We like where we sit from a base business and repeatable sustainable model. But the industrial business was down as we've talked about through COVID. We do see signs of life there. We have a really nice model. The things that we perform on the industrial sector are certainly necessary. There are signs of life there. As Derrick commented, I think, when we get to the second quarter, we'll know a lot more about where the economy is going and what we think about the industrial side. In my mind, certainly, opportunity on the back side of the year and 2022 looks really robust.\nChad Dillard: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Sean Eastman of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nSean Eastman: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to start on the Underground segment. I mean, obviously, the margins there in the first quarter stood out. I was surprised you didn't call out the Texas deep freeze. I would assume the stronghold business would have been dislocated around that. And I was just wondering if we could flush out whether there was something else that was particularly strong to overcome a dislocation there?\nDuke Austin: No. The phrase it was three or four days. I know it got a lot of press and certainly loss of life and -- but really it was three or four days. And while it was an impact to the quarter, the industrial sector performed well. I mean, we did some emergency work, but very little when we think about it. All-in-all, I just think it's performing better than we anticipated a bit. We do see signs of life in that business. But all-in-all, it's really the portfolio of the company to perform throughout.\nSean Eastman: Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And I hate to do this guys, but just following this 1Q performance, I mean, $412 million at the low end. I mean, what set of operating conditions put us there at this point? It just seems hard to get down there and just be helpful to sort of frame that low end case at this point?\nDerrick Jensen: Yes. So I know as you can see we raised the low end of the guidance here for the first quarter to some way to comment to that we continue to think that there's strength in the business model itself. But we very regularly put through a range of guidance on an annual basis. That considers a low end because of the fact that we work in volatile workspace. Oftentimes, it comes down to the way that the weather patterns impact the year more specifically in the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter is where substantial types of increment weather can come in and really impact the type of dynamic. Let alone the fact that through the year we work in a range of circumstances creating volatility. So we think it's always prudent to recognize those circumstances. But what I would also say is we think we have a tendency to execute throughout. I think also as we've seen us do the last few years. So as we stand here today, we think our business model is intact. We think we continue to do the margin improvements that we think are available to us, but it's just the right thing to do to recognize the volatility of what we're working.\nSean Eastman: Okay. Terrific. Thanks for the time.\nDerrick Jensen: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Noelle Dilts of Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nNoelle Dilts: Hi, guys. Good morning. So given the challenge that you're facing on the telecom -- with the telecom subcontractor that you're working through. Could you kind of just remind us of your model there? I think at one point you were kind of 50% self-performed, 50% subcontracting. And could you touch on kind of where you'd like to see that go? And how you're thinking about investing in training folks to work on the self-perform side? Thanks.\nDuke Austin: Yes, thanks, Noelle. As we discussed earlier, we kind of through about a $770 million type number on telecom as guidance. And I think in my mind, the opportunity is still there for us to perform at those levels. I wouldn't call it such as a problem other than we had some shallow ditch. We identified it. We're remaining it through rework. We'll go after -- when I say go after, we'll work with the subcontractor to try to recoup that and go forward. That being said, we like the business. It is about a 50-50 model as we stand today. We continue to see broadband activity book work, like the business a lot and on our way to $1 billion in inorganically for the most part. So, I would just say, I think the company has done a real nice job. It is part of the Electric segment. We probably wouldn't have talked about it, honestly, if it was just normal stuff. But since it was telecom, Derrick and I thought, it was -- we talked about the good all the time. So, we'll take our lumps and talk about that a little bit here and move forward. But in general, it just shows the strength of the quarter of the Electric segment as well. And if you look at it and you add -- you do an add back call it, $10 million to $15 million of impact on the telecom business, you can see the quarter would have been substantially higher on the Electric segment.\nNoelle Dilts: Thanks, that all makes sense. And then second, just given what we're seeing with commodity price increases and steel concerns about availability, what are you kind of watching around that dynamic? Are there any concerns about some of the larger transmission poles getting to you on time? Just kind of curious how you're thinking about the supply chain challenges that are kind of dominating headlines right now? Thanks.\nDuke Austin: Yes. I mean we're seeing some challenges in commodities not really impacting us at this point. We'll watch it fairly closely on the larger projects to make sure that our material comes in on time. We don't have commodity risk per se. So, our jobs that they're impacted we'll collaborate with the customer on those impacts. But in general, we're able to work through most of those areas where we do have impacts. I would tell you like in my mind, Canada is probably our -- one of the ones that have impacted the most. And I don't think it's really material per se. It's just how it's delivered. And for the most part that's been more of a COVID issue than material, in my mind, but no really commodity impact at this point.\nNoelle Dilts: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Michael Dudas of Vertical Research. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Dudas: Good morning, gentlemen.\nDuke Austin: Good morning, Mike.\nDerrick Jensen: Good morning.\nMichael Dudas: You called out an MSA that you signed earlier this year. And how are the -- when you think about your MSAs with these customers, they typically -- there are several year? Are they long-term with annual kind of budget requirements? Are there any margin or utilization benefits from those types -- that type of agreement and the work that you flow through relative to one or two-off type opportunities that arise from maybe that same or other customer base?\nDuke Austin: Mike, we really don't call them out that much. The reason why we called out the West is fairly incremental. And one of the things that we continue to talk about is kind of that hasn't started really ramping yet. And we were primarily signaling that ramp by calling it out and the incremental backlog growth on this MSA. Typically, when we think about it the 85% 90% of the business, it's kind of base businesses MSA-type business and -- in my mind. So that's how we look at it. And we book MSAs and re-up them probably monthly in my mind. So there is no real systematic way. I do think our backlog will continue to grow to record levels. We will have MSAs that renew that are larger. We continue to see a robust environment even when we have an MSA, the growth on the MSAs there as well. We take a prudent look at it to make sure that from our standpoint, the next 12 months and beyond or what the backlog would interpret. So in my mind, we're doing a good job with that. And our customer base certainly is spending the capital. The macro market is there on our end. So we see those MSAs just grow.\nMichael Dudas: I appreciate that. And my follow-up Duke is you mentioned, again, in your prepared remarks partnership with broadband opportunity. Is -- when we see the -- from the administration and the infrastructure plan and money they want to spend on broadband technically, is the private sector doing enough to make this happen? Are these funds -- are these two, three, four-year type opportunities, it sounds that way? But I just want to get us a sense you from that point. And what made this unique partnership to call out for -- that you entered into with this company? And are others like that going to help the growth in getting to that $1 billion target that you've put out in the medium-term?\nDuke Austin: Yeah, Mark, we've talked a bunch about how the infrastructure on the utilities and broadband are converging. I think when we looked at it, we continue to look at the rule in the underserved markets that were out there. And for the last two years have really tried to find the solution with our customer in a collaborative effort to utilize that infrastructure. We found technology and a company that had the capabilities to do that, work with clients. I do think it's broad-based small-cell type deployment that you'll see ongoing. When we have a programmatic way to do that on this, we'll have a programmatic way to do it with every one of our customers. And it's really beneficial for us to be on the front side of this, providing the solution, pushing the rural development opportunity fund forward. And not just waiting for something to come to us, we're actually out making sure this happens in front of it, not just waiting on an RFP or get commoditized with labor. I think that's part of what we're saying as a solution-based provider as we're out in front of that with technology.\nMichael Dudas: Absolutely. Thanks.\nOperator: Next question is from Brent Thielman of D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question.\nBrent Thielman: Great. Thank you. Duke, any color on some of the larger project pursuits in your electrical power business in 2021 that you're seeing and maybe how that could potentially influence the segment through the year? I think the guidance for the business is more reflective of the programmatic spending you see with the customers. But I'm wondering if there are some other larger projects that can potentially layer on here this year?\nDuke Austin: Now, I could name them for five minutes, but it doesn't -- it's not -- what I'm concerned about is just in general when we start talking about it in my mind we got a long ways to go in some permitting. It's a robust environment out there, we're around every one of them. Everyone you can name I could name them for days. There's a bunch of nice projects moving the renewables and the interconnections almost every RTO regional plan has a large piece of work in it, not only one probably two or three. In order to get to the -- what the plan and the carbon-free footprint, you need a significant amount of transmission. And in order to do that we need big projects. And certainly they're tough on the permitting side, administration side they're going to help that. There are some that are ongoing that are closer than others. I believe mid-America and some of that on the buffet call as he talked about it as well. So there's a bunch of projects that are out there that are around the edges on.\nBrent Thielman: Okay. I appreciate that. And I guess another question I have is just, are you seeing anything that suggests your customers are shifting some capital plans from the gas portion of the business towards the electrical portion of the business? I just wonder, if these commitments sort of profound interest in grid reliability, or still in any thunder from the gas programs that drive the Underground segment?\nDuke Austin: No. I mean, I would say, we're seeing our pipeline customers try to build solar or build solar. We're seeing quite a bit of that happen, per se. We're not -- the LDC business, it's a safety concern as well as reliability of just what you have on any given day. I mean, you can see the freeze. We had -- in Texas you saw actually pipe freeze, which caused problems on your plant. So I think all that integrity that needs to be done is a safety concern as well as a balance until we figure out carbon free. And you can't do that without a significant amount of transmission. So the company sits in a really nice place on either side of that.\nBrent Thielman: Okay. Thank you.\nDuke Austin: Yeah.\nOperator: The next question is from Steven Fisher of UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Fisher: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to come back to the telecom business and the challenge in the quarter. And if you could just sort of talk a little bit more broadly about, why you do need to go the route of subcontract models in the first place? Because it seems like, that is perhaps bringing in an element of additional execution risk here. And the bigger picture, I guess, I'm seeing is that, you have a great market opportunity across your businesses at the moment. And I guess, I'm just wondering, what you might be able to do, to enhance your potential to execute smoothly and capture that upside market opportunity without some sort of the risks of the hiccups here?\nDuke Austin: Yeah. Steve, I think when you look at the business, our performance from a margin standpoint in the segment, we did beat our expectations. I think we've raised the guidance on the year. We continue to do it. We look at it as a portfolio. We're getting operating leverage out of all of our offices, whether they're doing telecom gas or electric. We're reporting in segments. We may run the offices a little different than that. Overall, the performance of the company is exceptional in the field. The model around telecom it was an organic growth strategy around it. It does have probably 50% of subcontract. It's -- due to the fact that it ramps, up and down. And we're not going to invest in something that just ramps like that because, it continues to weigh on it we want some balance in it. And the balance allows us to have some variable cost in our equipment and things of that nature. My returns are better that way, in my mind. So that's the way we run the telecom business. And that's how we'll go forward with it. That being said, we did have a QA/QC issue in the quarter. We'll do a better job of catching that next time or now. For that matter and try to call back all we can. But all in all, I mean we're performing really well, across the board in my mind.\nSteven Fisher: Okay. That's very helpful. And I just want to ask you about Puerto Rico. It sounds like you're working towards a timely transition there. But in the event that there is some delay. Can you just talk about what the possible implications might be for the rest of the year? I think there's some implications for some incentive potential, but you may not have expected any incentives this quickly anyway? And maybe when we should think about the real opportunities when the real opportunities for incentives on that contract might be? Thank you.\nDuke Austin: Yes. I don't think we anticipated that this year. It will be in the next year for the incentive base piece of it, but we do anticipate going into service here in June. The transformation will happen will take over in June. So from that standpoint that will move on. As far as, we're coming through the fame of phones that will be into next year in my mind before you see any of it. And that's also an opportunity next year in Puerto Rico. But all in all it's moving along like it should and we're pleased with where we sit.\nDerrick Jensen: We had commented previously that we thought that post-transition we would see on an annual basis a run rate contribution of around $0.25. That is excluding inflation adjustments, excluding all incentives and excluding any incremental construction opportunities. So all of those things would still get the upside opportunities for us.\nSteven Fisher: Terrific. Thanks.\nDerrick Jensen: Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: The next question is from Adam Thalhimer of Thompson Davis. Please proceed with your question.\nAdam Thalhimer: Hey guys, nice quarter. I wanted to start on the energy side. Curious Duke if you've seen any pickup just from the rise in oil prices particularly around pipelines?\nDuke Austin: I would not say pipelines we've seen much there. I just -- our industrial businesses stated tons a lot there. I think it will get better. We've not seen pipeline movement. Our Canadian operations we see some long-term pipe, but not really in the Lower 48 in my mind it's pretty slow as far as I'm concerned. And I think we've transferred the business over to more competitive sustainable business anyway. So nothing that affects us in my mind.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. And on the -- you talked about a fixed wireless award. Can you give a little bit more detail on that? I was curious if that was like a Tier one telco or kind of an emerging player some detail on that would be helpful? Thanks.\nDuke Austin: Yes. So we made an investment in the quarter in some technology and a service provider there on fixed wireless. It's -- to really look at the -- our dollar funds the rural development funds as well as the underserved. So not a Tier 1 carrier, but certainly someone that would put it out across, the Lower 48 and beyond from that mine in a programmatic way. So we have the ability to do that. As the Tier 1s move forward we'll have the ability to also do that in a programmatic way. Really I think it's the convergence of the electric such as your cooperatives your municipalities and the way to solve these issues around broadband. And it makes a lot of sense. We've worked on it quite a bit and this was our opportunity really to push it forward.\nAdam Thalhimer: It is something we\u2019ll hear more down the coming quarters, thanks.\nOperator: The next question is from Andy Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Hey, good morning, guys.\nDuke Austin: Hi, Andy.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Duke, so we know signing longer-term electric power MSA is one of your main strategies. But does electric power MSAs being up over 40% over the last year give you more confidence regarding Quanta's ability to grow the core business. Maybe even toward the middle to higher-end of the longer-term guide you have we know you talk about mid-single digits to low teens. I mean do you start getting visibility even into '22 in that regard?\nDuke Austin: I mean I think we've talked about multiyear type growth kind of mid to upper single digits on the 80% to 90% -- 80% of the business I would say, at this point. At least we've talked about that growth long term three to five years at least. And so we continue to see that. We've stated that quite a bit. And we think the MSA, the backlog that you're seeing that grows there for a long period of time.\nAndy Kaplowitz: I guess Duke what I'm asking there though is that -- does it give you confidence in sort of -- because it's a pretty wide range right between mid-single digits and low teens. So I mean given sort of the visibility you have do you see actually a higher growth rate going forward? I know what the guidance is for this year, but just out of curiosity?\nDuke Austin: Mean if you go back in time and you look at what -- how we've grown the segment we've grown the Electric segment double-digits over the past 10 years on a CAGR basis. So I would tell you that -- that's what we've done in the past. It's bigger numbers. We're being prudent about how we talk about it. Do we have the ability to grow in the double-digits? Yes.\nAndy Kaplowitz: And then let me ask you about -- someone I think you asked you about large projects. So let me tackled maybe slightly different way. Again, you've talked in the past about this sort of $3 billion number and saying last quarter that you had quite a bit more than that in sort of opportunities. Is the funnel a lot larger than that double that now? Like any sort of thoughts about quantifying the funnel now? Is it sort of $5 billion, $6 billion just for perspective, Duke?\nDuke Austin: If we talked about all the jobs that were out there, there's not enough material to talk about it, to begin with. So I think in our mind we're being prudent about how we discuss it. The larger projects are growing especially with the sentiment around bringing renewables in a carbon-free environment by 2030, 2050. So the transmission corridors will have to exponentially get larger than they are now in a significant way. In order for that to happen, you're going to need large project dynamics for the next decade.\nAndy Kaplowitz: I just want to follow-up on one other thing that you talked about with LUMA. LUMA's CEO recently talked about $10 billion in federal recovery funds now flowing in Puerto Rico. Do you think those funds just don't make their way into projects until next year as you said, or is it possible that could happen as early as this year?\nDuke Austin: I mean you have about $1 billion budget down there, $600 million of a $1 billion budget down there a year on any given day. So there is projects down on the island. What I would say is the FEMA funds are on top of that, that would come in. I would be prudent to say it would be next year.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Great. Thanks, Duke.\nOperator: The next question is from [indiscernible] of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is [indiscernible] on for Jamie Cook. So our first question is we were wondering if you have any concerns on securing labor in this cycle, just given the current labor market and the robust outlook? And then if you could comment on what you're seeing in the pricing environment, that would be great? Thank you.\nDuke Austin: Yes. Thank you for the question. From a labor standpoint, a tight labor market really suits us well. That's who we are. We really work on labor. I have invested well over $100 million over the last six to seven years. So any time we have a tight labor market cross-skill labor market, Quanta does really well. So we're in a good position there. We pretty much regulate some of the way that we look at wages. We have ability to pass-through those costs if they escalate. So we're in good shape. As far as pricing power and I would just say, in general, we'll stand by what we said in the past, the double-digit margins over time. At times, it'll go higher. And we're in good times now, so you're seeing some push on that. Primarily around the utilizations and things of that nature that is pushing up your margins, more so than pricing power.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you\nOperator: The next question is from Min Cho of FBR Riley. Please proceed with your question.\nMin Cho: Hi, everybody. This is Min Cho for Alex Regal at B. Riley Securities. Just one question really, Derrick, given your continuation of strong cash flow and liquidity. Just wanted to know if there was any shift in change to your capital allocation strategy and want to know if there were any more kind of opportunistic M&A opportunities that you're seeing in the current market? Thank you.\nDerrick Jensen: No, I'd say, that we're still committed to the same allocation strategy really that we've held for a number of years. We look at first leaning into the growth of the business, on the working capital and CapEx front. Very much still yet look at the acquisition and investment side of the equation, partly as an example, as highlighted to Duke's comments here for the minority interposition here this quarter. And then, as well with the buyback of stock and dividends. We still look at all of those. We like to have our balance sheet positioned well to be able to lean into all of those areas at any given time, not having to choose which one creates the most value at a point in time. I would say that acquisitions has historically been kind of the largest component of recent years and we still see an active market there, ability to find good acquisitions. It will be sporadic, because we're opportunistic with the deployment of capital there, looking for strong management teams that supplement who we are. You can see over the last four or five years, we probably averaged about $300 million on average deployment there. And I wouldn't take exception to that kind of view as we go forward.\nMin Cho: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no additional questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.\nDuke Austin: Yes, I just want to thank everyone, our field leadership team and men and women working in the field through the pandemic, doing all the things that we've done well. We performed well, safely, and it's to their credit. So I want to thank you for participating in the conference call. We appreciate your questions and ongoing interest in Quanta Services. Thank you. This concludes our call.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Duke Austin",
            "content": "Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. On the call today, I will provide operational and strategic commentary and we'll then turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a review of our first quarter results and full year 2021 financial expectations. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions. This morning, we reported solid first quarter results, with revenues of $2.7 billion in GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.62 and $0.83 respectively. Backlog at the end of the quarter was a record $15.8 billion, which we believe reflects the continued advancement of our long-term growth strategies. We continue to see opportunities for multi-year growth across our service lines, driven by our solutions-based approach and the growth of programmatic spending with existing and new customers. The recognition that the country's infrastructure needs to be modernized to support economic growth improved safety and reliability and for a cleaner environment is evidenced by the Biden administration's recently proposed $2 trillion infrastructure plan. The proposal will evolve and take time to move through the political process. But as proposed, the plan includes funding and policies to encourage new infrastructure development and modernization in several of our core markets including, high-voltage electric transmission and power grid modernization and resiliency, renewable energy, electric vehicle charging station infrastructure and other electrification initiatives, and broadband infrastructure expansion. While this infrastructure proposal could accelerate activity in these areas and provide incremental opportunity for Quanta over several years, I want to stress that our positive multiyear outlook and strategic plan are not reliant on this infrastructure proposal. We have been collaborating with our customers for many years to support their significant multiyear investment programs already in place to modernize the existing power grid, ensure reliable power delivery and to integrate higher levels of renewable generation. Our Electric Power Solutions operations performed well during the quarter, reflecting broad-based business strength, driven by ongoing grid modernization, system hardening, renewable energy interconnections and solid and safe execution. During the quarter, we signed a significant multiyear master services agreement with a utility in the Western United States, which made a substantial incremental contribution to our record first quarter backlog. We believe our record backlog and these initiatives will continue to drive multiyear growth opportunities for Quanta. Though COVID-19 has created some near-term challenges in Canada, we see opportunities to pursue additional large projects there for the coming years. Additionally, our discussions with high-voltage electric transmission project sponsors in the United States have increased as the need for large-scale electric transmission infrastructure to support growing renewable generation and achieve carbon-neutrality goals become evident. LUMA Energy and its employees, as supported by Quanta and its joint venture partner ATCO, are all working diligently towards transitioning the operations and maintenance of the Puerto Rico electric power grid to LUMA in early June. LUMA's efforts under the agreement are intended to deliver long-term social and economic benefits to the people of Puerto Rico. As stated previously, we believe this opportunity is transformative for all the parties involved, including the people of Puerto Rico, and the work to be performed by LUMA under the 15-year contract aligns with Quanta's strategy of providing sophisticated and valuable solutions to the utility, industry that benefits consumers. The majority of our communications operations are off to a solid start this year, driven by strong demand for fiber densification to reach homes and businesses and the early stages of 5G network deployments. However, during the quarter, we experienced short-term challenges really associated with efficient subcontractor work in a specific geographic area, which required rework. We have addressed our quality assessment protocol shortcomings on this issue and are pursuing compensation from the subcontractor. This was an isolated issue, and we believe we are on track to generate high-single or double-digit operating income margins for the remainder of this year. Additionally, we continue to believe, we can achieve at least $1 billion in annual revenue with double-digit operating income margins in the medium term. As service providers continue to push fiber closer to the customer, fiber backhaul densification continues, 5G wireless infrastructure development increases, and meaningful federal funding is provided for broadband network expansion initiatives in underserved markets. On prior calls, we have shared our belief that Quanta is uniquely positioned between the communications and utility industries to provide solutions for broadband and 5G technology deployments leveraging existing infrastructure. We have made significant progress working with our customers and a broadband technology partner and during the first quarter made a minority financial investment in this partner. We also entered into a strategic alliance with them where Quanta will serve as a program manager for large-scale deployments of their fixed wireless broadband technology which we utilized our customers' facilities where appropriate. We believe this relationship advances our solutions with customers to accelerate and improve access to affordable and reliable broadband in rural and underserved markets. We believe our proactive strategy and the unique solutions Quanta provides the marketplace enhances our opportunity to expand our telecom infrastructure solutions with other utility and communication customers. Our Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment performed well in the quarter with better than expected profitability despite seasonality and continued challenges caused by COVID-19. We are confident in our full year expectations for the segment driven by solid demand for our gas utility and pipeline integrity service. Additionally, there are encouraging signs supporting our expectations of improved demand for our industrial services beginning in the second half of this year. We believe deferred maintenance and capital spending due to the effects of COVID on the downstream market is creating pent-up demand for our services which should prove beneficial as market conditions normalize for our customers. However, we would like to see how the summer travel season develops which could influence activity levels of our downstream customers before making adjustments to our full year expectations for this segment. The solutions Quanta provides support our customers' efforts to increase reliability, safety, efficiency, and connectivity all of which have favorable, environmental, and social impact. Our end markets and multiyear visibility are solid and we have built a strong platform that positions us well to capitalize on favorable long-term trends particularly grid modernization and hardening, the transition toward a carbon-neutral economy, and the adoption of new technologies such as 5G, battery storage, and hydrogen. Previously, we have discussed our strategic focus on enhancing our front-end capabilities such as engineering and permitting. To complement our world-class construction expertise, our strategy is designed to provide differentiated comprehensive and industry-leading solutions to our customers which we have achieved through organic investment and select acquisitions. This strategy is contributing to our backlog growth increasing our total addressable market and providing meaningful growth opportunities for the future. In our earnings release this morning, we raised our 2021 guidance due to solid first quarter results and confidence in the business. We believe this demonstrates the strength and sustainability of our business and long-term strategy, favorable end market trends, our ability to safely execute, and our strong competitive position in the marketplace. We continue to believe we are in a multiyear up cycle with continued opportunity for further record backlog and results in 2021. We are focused on operating the business for the long-term and expect to continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class build leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's base business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's diversity unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset form the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for all our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO for his review of our first quarter results and 2021 expectations. Derrick? Good morning, Chad. The policy and the plan under administration, I do think it benefits us. As always states have a lot of say in right-of-ways and easements and permits. So I do think that that will be a sticking point as we move forward. But even without the plan, I would say the sentiment around the carbon-free environment neutrality is there we continue to see larger projects that are moving forward. So it's a robust environment in my mind with or without the federal funding. So I -- while it's good, I believe every bit of that would be incremental to anything we've commented on in the past. As well -- as far as water we do some water now. Anything involves cross-skill labor, we're riding there on it and looking at it. We believe that's kind of our core to us is our ability to perform that. So we do look at water quite a bit. I'm not signaling anything on that. I just -- we do look at it. When we look at the underground business, again we look at these businesses as a portfolio. So I would just say the LDC business, the integrity business there is working out nicely. We like where we sit from a base business and repeatable sustainable model. But the industrial business was down as we've talked about through COVID. We do see signs of life there. We have a really nice model. The things that we perform on the industrial sector are certainly necessary. There are signs of life there. As Derrick commented, I think, when we get to the second quarter, we'll know a lot more about where the economy is going and what we think about the industrial side. In my mind, certainly, opportunity on the back side of the year and 2022 looks really robust. No. The phrase it was three or four days. I know it got a lot of press and certainly loss of life and -- but really it was three or four days. And while it was an impact to the quarter, the industrial sector performed well. I mean, we did some emergency work, but very little when we think about it. All-in-all, I just think it's performing better than we anticipated a bit. We do see signs of life in that business. But all-in-all, it's really the portfolio of the company to perform throughout. Yes, thanks, Noelle. As we discussed earlier, we kind of through about a $770 million type number on telecom as guidance. And I think in my mind, the opportunity is still there for us to perform at those levels. I wouldn't call it such as a problem other than we had some shallow ditch. We identified it. We're remaining it through rework. We'll go after -- when I say go after, we'll work with the subcontractor to try to recoup that and go forward. That being said, we like the business. It is about a 50-50 model as we stand today. We continue to see broadband activity book work, like the business a lot and on our way to $1 billion in inorganically for the most part. So, I would just say, I think the company has done a real nice job. It is part of the Electric segment. We probably wouldn't have talked about it, honestly, if it was just normal stuff. But since it was telecom, Derrick and I thought, it was -- we talked about the good all the time. So, we'll take our lumps and talk about that a little bit here and move forward. But in general, it just shows the strength of the quarter of the Electric segment as well. And if you look at it and you add -- you do an add back call it, $10 million to $15 million of impact on the telecom business, you can see the quarter would have been substantially higher on the Electric segment. Yes. I mean we're seeing some challenges in commodities not really impacting us at this point. We'll watch it fairly closely on the larger projects to make sure that our material comes in on time. We don't have commodity risk per se. So, our jobs that they're impacted we'll collaborate with the customer on those impacts. But in general, we're able to work through most of those areas where we do have impacts. I would tell you like in my mind, Canada is probably our -- one of the ones that have impacted the most. And I don't think it's really material per se. It's just how it's delivered. And for the most part that's been more of a COVID issue than material, in my mind, but no really commodity impact at this point. Good morning, Mike. Mike, we really don't call them out that much. The reason why we called out the West is fairly incremental. And one of the things that we continue to talk about is kind of that hasn't started really ramping yet. And we were primarily signaling that ramp by calling it out and the incremental backlog growth on this MSA. Typically, when we think about it the 85% 90% of the business, it's kind of base businesses MSA-type business and -- in my mind. So that's how we look at it. And we book MSAs and re-up them probably monthly in my mind. So there is no real systematic way. I do think our backlog will continue to grow to record levels. We will have MSAs that renew that are larger. We continue to see a robust environment even when we have an MSA, the growth on the MSAs there as well. We take a prudent look at it to make sure that from our standpoint, the next 12 months and beyond or what the backlog would interpret. So in my mind, we're doing a good job with that. And our customer base certainly is spending the capital. The macro market is there on our end. So we see those MSAs just grow. Yeah, Mark, we've talked a bunch about how the infrastructure on the utilities and broadband are converging. I think when we looked at it, we continue to look at the rule in the underserved markets that were out there. And for the last two years have really tried to find the solution with our customer in a collaborative effort to utilize that infrastructure. We found technology and a company that had the capabilities to do that, work with clients. I do think it's broad-based small-cell type deployment that you'll see ongoing. When we have a programmatic way to do that on this, we'll have a programmatic way to do it with every one of our customers. And it's really beneficial for us to be on the front side of this, providing the solution, pushing the rural development opportunity fund forward. And not just waiting for something to come to us, we're actually out making sure this happens in front of it, not just waiting on an RFP or get commoditized with labor. I think that's part of what we're saying as a solution-based provider as we're out in front of that with technology. Now, I could name them for five minutes, but it doesn't -- it's not -- what I'm concerned about is just in general when we start talking about it in my mind we got a long ways to go in some permitting. It's a robust environment out there, we're around every one of them. Everyone you can name I could name them for days. There's a bunch of nice projects moving the renewables and the interconnections almost every RTO regional plan has a large piece of work in it, not only one probably two or three. In order to get to the -- what the plan and the carbon-free footprint, you need a significant amount of transmission. And in order to do that we need big projects. And certainly they're tough on the permitting side, administration side they're going to help that. There are some that are ongoing that are closer than others. I believe mid-America and some of that on the buffet call as he talked about it as well. So there's a bunch of projects that are out there that are around the edges on. No. I mean, I would say, we're seeing our pipeline customers try to build solar or build solar. We're seeing quite a bit of that happen, per se. We're not -- the LDC business, it's a safety concern as well as reliability of just what you have on any given day. I mean, you can see the freeze. We had -- in Texas you saw actually pipe freeze, which caused problems on your plant. So I think all that integrity that needs to be done is a safety concern as well as a balance until we figure out carbon free. And you can't do that without a significant amount of transmission. So the company sits in a really nice place on either side of that. Yeah. Yeah. Steve, I think when you look at the business, our performance from a margin standpoint in the segment, we did beat our expectations. I think we've raised the guidance on the year. We continue to do it. We look at it as a portfolio. We're getting operating leverage out of all of our offices, whether they're doing telecom gas or electric. We're reporting in segments. We may run the offices a little different than that. Overall, the performance of the company is exceptional in the field. The model around telecom it was an organic growth strategy around it. It does have probably 50% of subcontract. It's -- due to the fact that it ramps, up and down. And we're not going to invest in something that just ramps like that because, it continues to weigh on it we want some balance in it. And the balance allows us to have some variable cost in our equipment and things of that nature. My returns are better that way, in my mind. So that's the way we run the telecom business. And that's how we'll go forward with it. That being said, we did have a QA/QC issue in the quarter. We'll do a better job of catching that next time or now. For that matter and try to call back all we can. But all in all, I mean we're performing really well, across the board in my mind. Yes. I don't think we anticipated that this year. It will be in the next year for the incentive base piece of it, but we do anticipate going into service here in June. The transformation will happen will take over in June. So from that standpoint that will move on. As far as, we're coming through the fame of phones that will be into next year in my mind before you see any of it. And that's also an opportunity next year in Puerto Rico. But all in all it's moving along like it should and we're pleased with where we sit. I would not say pipelines we've seen much there. I just -- our industrial businesses stated tons a lot there. I think it will get better. We've not seen pipeline movement. Our Canadian operations we see some long-term pipe, but not really in the Lower 48 in my mind it's pretty slow as far as I'm concerned. And I think we've transferred the business over to more competitive sustainable business anyway. So nothing that affects us in my mind. Yes. So we made an investment in the quarter in some technology and a service provider there on fixed wireless. It's -- to really look at the -- our dollar funds the rural development funds as well as the underserved. So not a Tier 1 carrier, but certainly someone that would put it out across, the Lower 48 and beyond from that mine in a programmatic way. So we have the ability to do that. As the Tier 1s move forward we'll have the ability to also do that in a programmatic way. Really I think it's the convergence of the electric such as your cooperatives your municipalities and the way to solve these issues around broadband. And it makes a lot of sense. We've worked on it quite a bit and this was our opportunity really to push it forward. Hi, Andy. I mean I think we've talked about multiyear type growth kind of mid to upper single digits on the 80% to 90% -- 80% of the business I would say, at this point. At least we've talked about that growth long term three to five years at least. And so we continue to see that. We've stated that quite a bit. And we think the MSA, the backlog that you're seeing that grows there for a long period of time. Mean if you go back in time and you look at what -- how we've grown the segment we've grown the Electric segment double-digits over the past 10 years on a CAGR basis. So I would tell you that -- that's what we've done in the past. It's bigger numbers. We're being prudent about how we talk about it. Do we have the ability to grow in the double-digits? Yes. If we talked about all the jobs that were out there, there's not enough material to talk about it, to begin with. So I think in our mind we're being prudent about how we discuss it. The larger projects are growing especially with the sentiment around bringing renewables in a carbon-free environment by 2030, 2050. So the transmission corridors will have to exponentially get larger than they are now in a significant way. In order for that to happen, you're going to need large project dynamics for the next decade. I mean you have about $1 billion budget down there, $600 million of a $1 billion budget down there a year on any given day. So there is projects down on the island. What I would say is the FEMA funds are on top of that, that would come in. I would be prudent to say it would be next year. Yes. Thank you for the question. From a labor standpoint, a tight labor market really suits us well. That's who we are. We really work on labor. I have invested well over $100 million over the last six to seven years. So any time we have a tight labor market cross-skill labor market, Quanta does really well. So we're in a good position there. We pretty much regulate some of the way that we look at wages. We have ability to pass-through those costs if they escalate. So we're in good shape. As far as pricing power and I would just say, in general, we'll stand by what we said in the past, the double-digit margins over time. At times, it'll go higher. And we're in good times now, so you're seeing some push on that. Primarily around the utilizations and things of that nature that is pushing up your margins, more so than pricing power. Yes, I just want to thank everyone, our field leadership team and men and women working in the field through the pandemic, doing all the things that we've done well. We performed well, safely, and it's to their credit. So I want to thank you for participating in the conference call. We appreciate your questions and ongoing interest in Quanta Services. Thank you. This concludes our call."

            "content": "Thanks, Duke and good morning, everyone. Today we announced first quarter 2021 revenues of $2.7 billion. Net income attributable to common stock was $90 million or $0.62 per diluted share and adjusted diluted earnings per share a non-GAAP measure was $0.83. The first quarter was another strong quarter for Quanta led by continued strength from electric power and better-than-expected profitability from our Underground Utility and Infrastructure segment. Our electric power revenues were $2.1 billion a record for the first quarter and a 17% increase when compared to the first quarter of 2020. This increase was driven by continued growth in base business activities as well as contributions from larger transmission projects underway in Canada and revenues from acquired businesses of approximately $70 million. Also revenues associated with emergency restoration services attributable to winter storm response efforts were approximately $80 million a first quarter record. Electric segment margins in 1Q 2021 were 9.7% versus 7.3% in 1Q 2020. The improved operating margins were driven by double-digit performance from our electric operations within the segment including the benefit associated with increased profit contributions from emergency restoration efforts, which typically present opportunities for higher margins than our normal base business activities due to higher utilization. Operating margins also benefited from approximately $5 million of income associated with our LUMA joint venture. Negatively impacting first quarter margins were recorded reserves for the identified issues Duke discussed, which when combined with normal seasonality exacerbated by severe weather challenges from winter Storm Uri created an operating loss within our US telecom operations for the quarter. Again we believe we have addressed the issues and expect margins at or near double-digits going forward. Underground Utility and Infrastructure segment revenues were $643 million for the quarter, 35% lower than 1Q 2020 due primarily due to reduced revenues from our industrial operations and a reduction in contributions from larger pipeline projects. Operations within this segment in last year's first quarter results had yet to be impacted by COVID-19 headwinds. And in fact our industrial operations had record results in the period. In 1Q 2021, the segment continues to be negatively impacted by COVID-19 with first quarter revenues from our Canadian operations and our industrial operations both meaningfully below pre-pandemic levels. Despite the COVID-related headwinds, the segment delivered margins of 1.4%. And although 170 basis points lower than 1Q 2020 primarily due to the reduced revenues, the results exceeded our original expectations for 1Q led by execution across much of our base business activity including our gas distribution and industrial services. Our total backlog was a record $15.8 billion at the end of the first quarter with 12-month backlog of $8.9 billion representing solid increases when compared to year end as well as the first quarter of 2020. This marks the third consecutive quarter where we posted record backlog, a trend driven primarily by continued growth in multiyear MSA programs with North American utilities which we believe continues to validate the repeatable sustainable nature of the largest portion of our revenues and earnings. For the first quarter of 2021, we generated free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure of $49 million, $115 million lower than 1Q 2020, however 1Q 2020 included the collection of $82 million of insurance proceeds associated with the settlement of two pipeline project claims. Day sales outstanding or DSO measured 89 days for the first quarter, an increase of four days compared to the first quarter of 2020 and an increase of six days compared to December 31, 2020. These increases are primarily due to the expected ramp in work on two larger electric transmission projects in Canada in the first quarter and the timing of billing. The Canadian response to COVID has significantly hampered production for which we will seek recovery and delayed this in meeting certain billing milestones. We had approximately $200 million of cash at the end of the quarter with total liquidity of approximately $2.1 billion and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio as calculated under our credit agreement of approximately 1.3 times. Integration activities associated with acquisitions closed in the back half of 2020 are ongoing and we closed another small acquisition during the first quarter of 2021. We continue to take an opportunistic view towards acquisitions and maintain the balance sheet strength to support strategic capital outlays in this area. Additionally, through the date of this earnings release, we acquired approximately $29 million worth of stock as part of our repurchase program. We remain committed to delivering shareholder value through prudent capital deployment. Turning to guidance. Based on the Electric segment's strong first quarter and continued confidence in our ability to execute on the opportunities across the segment, we've increased the low end of our full year expectations for segment revenues resulting in a range between $8.4 billion and $8.5 billion for 2021. Similarly, we are increasing the low end of our full year margin range for the segment with 2021 operating margins now expected to range between 10.2% and 10.9%. Regarding the Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment, while we had a nice start to the year, we are not yet in a position to change our full year expectations. Accordingly, we are reiterating our original full year guidance for the segment with revenues expected to range between $3.65 billion and $3.85 billion and segment margins ranging between 5.5% and 6%. These segment operating ranges support our increased expectations for 2021 annual revenues of between $12.05 billion to $12.35 billion and adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure of between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion. The midpoint of the range represents 10% growth when compared to 2020's record adjusted EBITDA. In addition to these improved operating expectations, our full year expectations for net income and adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure are expected to benefit from a reduced annual tax rate, driven by higher benefits realized in the first quarter associated with the fair value of vested stock compensation awards. We now expect our full year tax rate to range between 25.25% and 25.75%. As a result, our increased expectation for full year diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock is now between $3.25 and $3.69, and our increased expectation for adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock a non-GAAP measure is now between $4.12 and $4.57. We are maintaining our free cash flow guidance for the year, expecting it to range between $400 million and $600 million. And we'll reiterate that quarterly free cash flow is subject to sizable movements due to various customer and project dynamics that can occur in the normal course of operations. For additional information, please refer to our outlook summary, which can be found in the Financial Info section of our IR website at quantaservices.com. Overall, we are pleased with the start to the year and remain confident in the strength of our operations and prospects for profitable growth. As our backlog continues to grow and our visibility into the duration of this infrastructure cycle continues to improve, we have increasing conviction in our ability to capitalize on the opportunities across our end markets. We firmly believe the repeatable nature of our base business solutions coupled with opportunistic larger project deployments, disciplined capital allocation and continued balance sheet strength will be the key to delivering long-term shareholder value. This concludes our formal presentation and we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator? Yes. So I know as you can see we raised the low end of the guidance here for the first quarter to some way to comment to that we continue to think that there's strength in the business model itself. But we very regularly put through a range of guidance on an annual basis. That considers a low end because of the fact that we work in volatile workspace. Oftentimes, it comes down to the way that the weather patterns impact the year more specifically in the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter is where substantial types of increment weather can come in and really impact the type of dynamic. Let alone the fact that through the year we work in a range of circumstances creating volatility. So we think it's always prudent to recognize those circumstances. But what I would also say is we think we have a tendency to execute throughout. I think also as we've seen us do the last few years. So as we stand here today, we think our business model is intact. We think we continue to do the margin improvements that we think are available to us, but it's just the right thing to do to recognize the volatility of what we're working. Thank you. Good morning. We had commented previously that we thought that post-transition we would see on an annual basis a run rate contribution of around $0.25. That is excluding inflation adjustments, excluding all incentives and excluding any incremental construction opportunities. So all of those things would still get the upside opportunities for us. Thanks, Steve. No, I'd say, that we're still committed to the same allocation strategy really that we've held for a number of years. We look at first leaning into the growth of the business, on the working capital and CapEx front. Very much still yet look at the acquisition and investment side of the equation, partly as an example, as highlighted to Duke's comments here for the minority interposition here this quarter. And then, as well with the buyback of stock and dividends. We still look at all of those. We like to have our balance sheet positioned well to be able to lean into all of those areas at any given time, not having to choose which one creates the most value at a point in time. I would say that acquisitions has historically been kind of the largest component of recent years and we still see an active market there, ability to find good acquisitions. It will be sporadic, because we're opportunistic with the deployment of capital there, looking for strong management teams that supplement who we are. You can see over the last four or five years, we probably averaged about $300 million on average deployment there. And I wouldn't take exception to that kind of view as we go forward."

With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Duke Austin, Quanta's President and CEO. Duke?\nDuke Austin: Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings conference call. On the call today, I will provide operational and strategic commentary, and we'll then turn it over to Jayshree Desai, Quanta CFO, to provide a review of our financial results and full year 2023 financial expectations. Following Jayshree's comments, we welcome your questions. This morning, we reported strong fourth quarter and full year results, which were built off an industry-leading operational and financial platform that delivered another year of solid, safe execution and profitable growth. Additionally, total backlog of $24.1 billion at year-end was a record, and that does not include several notable recent project awards. Driven by the dedication and operational excellence of our world-class employees and the culture of collaboration throughout Quanta, we believe our '22 -- 2022 results also demonstrate the benefit of our diversified portfolio of solutions, our repeatable and sustainable model and the successful execution of our strategic initiatives to drive operational excellence and total cost solutions for our clients and ultimately, the consumer. Our portfolio of companies, diversity of service lines, geographic coverage, outstanding field leadership and deep, long-standing and collaborative relationships with our clients have allowed us to successfully navigate through the challenges presented by a global pandemic, and manage ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and supply chain constraints, while still delivering five consecutive years of record adjusted EBITDA and six consecutive years of record earnings per share. We accomplished a great deal in 2022 through the successful implementation of our strategic initiatives and our past success positions us well for the future. Our innovative approach to our infrastructure solutions, our portfolio of services and our passion for working collaboratively with our clients to support their success, positions us to be a critical partner in enabling the energy transition for years to come. Here are some of our accomplishments in 2022. We continue to successfully advance our front-end solution strategy, both organically and through acquisitions and strategic investments. Our focus is on strengthening our design, engineering, permitting, environmental, logistics and program management capabilities. This strategy allows us to expand our customers and provide them with greater certainty around cost, time to market and quality, which ultimately benefits consumers. It also enhances our risk management capabilities and increases our total addressable market. Electric Power Infrastructure Solutions segment revenues achieved record levels, maintain margins and increase market share despite some work delays caused by ongoing supply chain challenges. We further expanded our emergency response capabilities and supported our customers' efforts to restore power to millions of people adversely impacted by several severe weather events during the year. Our ability to quickly mobilize significant resources to support our customers in times of need is unmatched in our industry.  LUMA Energy, our joint venture with ATCO, which is managing Puerto Rico's more than 18,000-mile electric transmission and distribution system, continue to improve its customer service, response times, customer communication and workforce safety as well as overall system reliability. Additionally, LUMA restored power to more than 90% of its customers in less than two weeks following Hurricane Fiona, which was much faster than previous storm responses by the prior grid operator and was comparable to, if not better, than restoration times following major hurricanes in the mainland United States. Though many years of challenges and work remain, we continue to believe this opportunity is transformative for Quanta and the people of Puerto Rico and remain committed to supporting LUMA's mission to provide reliable electricity while building a modern and sustainable transmission and distribution system. We continue to grow our communication services business and increased revenues by approximately 30%. Contributing to the growth was further development of our wireless infrastructure solutions, which expand our opportunities to capitalize on 5G network deployment and ongoing enhancement of 4G wireless networks. We continue to make meaningful progress on growing our portfolio of services within each of our operating companies to further enhance our operating results. For example, we are leveraging our gas utility assets to perform certain aspects of underground electric power and telecom-related work. We believe the resource expansion and operating leverage we gained through these initiatives is significant opportunity for Quanta to reinforce our self-perform capabilities, improve operating efficiency and profitability and demonstrates the strength of our portfolio approach. Quanta's Capacity Model was recognized by the National Safety Council as a finalist for its prestigious Green Cross for Safety Award, which recognizes outstanding projects in organizations working to support the National Safety Council's mission to save lives and prevent injuries from workplace to any place. The Capacity Model is revolutionary because it only creates a work environment that focuses on preventing an incident but also builds the capacity to fell safely. We demonstrated our commitment to stockholder value and our confidence in Quanta's financial strength and continue to growth opportunities through the repurchase of approximately $128 million of our common stock and a 17% increase of our dividend while also increasing our liquidity. And finally, we continue to increase our efforts and dedicate resources towards implementing sustainable business practices throughout the organization. We made significant progress in our 2021 Sustainability Report, which discusses the company's accomplishments during that year and marks a key milestone for Quanta as we published our first consolidated sustainability metrics, including our Scope 1 and 2 emissions. We also highlighted and discussed the important positive impact Quanta has on society and enabling the energy transition and technological development. Demand is robust for our solutions that support our customers, efforts to modernize and harden the grid and prepare it for the impact of increased electric vehicle penetration. This activity drove our Electric Power segment results and backlog strength during 2022, primarily due to significant multiyear master service agreements and gains through our service line expansion with utilities. Further, we continue to believe we are in the early stages of utilities undergrounding transmission and distribution lines to protect them from the effects of severe weather events and wildfires. We see this activity increasing in the Western United States and high-fire threat areas, but these initiatives are active in other areas of the country. Examples include electric transmission projects in the Northeast, distribution circuits along the coast lines and electric transmission line projects for offshore wind generation. Many of these initiatives are part of a large-scale multiyear system modernization and hardening programs. Our utility and renewable developer customers who accounted for the majority of our 2022 revenues are leaders in the effort to reduce carbon emissions, increased electrification and lead the energy transition with aggressive plans to expand and modernize the power grid and grow their renewable generation portfolios. Achieving these goals will require substantial incremental investment in transmission, substation and renewable generation facilities to produce and transport clean power to ensure grid reliability due to the growth of intermittent power added to the system. For example, in December of last year, we announced Quanta's selection by Xcel Energy as its prime constructor to manage all construction activities for Colorado's Power Pathway high-voltage electric transmission project in Colorado. The approximately 610-mile high-voltage electric transmission line project is designed to increase the reliabilities of the state's power grid and enable future renewable energy development in Colorado including approximately 5,500 megawatts of new wind, solar and other resources that Xcel Energy plans to add through 2030.  While the supply chain and regulatory hurdles created challenges for the renewable industry during 2022, there is significant demand for our power grid and renewable generation solutions. Number of solar projects that were delayed in 2022 are beginning to move forward in '23. Regulatory hurdles are easing and the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act or IRA which is considered by many to be the nation's most ambitious legislative action ever taken on climate is expected to have meaningful positive effect on a number of our end markets, which would be additive to our strategy for at least the next decade. Our underground utility and infrastructure solutions segment consistently performed at a high level through the year. Revenues grew strongly and margins significantly improved, after navigating through tough operating conditions caused by the global pandemic over the prior two years. Importantly, we continue to invest in our people and strategies during those challenging times and emerge as a stronger and better company, which is reflected in our solid 2022 results. We expect to continue our focus on growing our gas utility, pipeline integrity and industrial services businesses consistent with our strategy over the last five years, which are executing well and driven by regulatory spend to modernize systems, reduce methane emissions, ensure environmental compliance and improve safety and reliability. Looking to the coming years, we continue to believe Quanta has any meaningful opportunities with customers in this segment as they increasingly pursue strategies to reduce their carbon footprint and diversify their operations and assets toward greener business opportunities. Further, the IRA includes incentives to support certain energy transition technologies to further encourage a broader set of current and potential traditional energy and industrial customers to accelerate their pursuit of opportunities around these technologies. In our earnings release this morning, we provided our 2023 guidance, which we believe demonstrates the strength and sustainability of our portfolio approach to this and long-term strategy, favorable end market trends, our ability to safely execute our strong and strengthening competitive position in the marketplace. Further, our ongoing investment in and commitment to workforce training continues to positively impact our performance and allow us to capitalize on future opportunities. Our expectations caught for another year of meaningful growth in record revenues, improved margins and opportunity for double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDA, cash flow and earnings per share. Additionally, we see opportunity to achieve record levels of backlog in 2023. Jayshree will provide additional detail about our guidance in her commentary.  Quanta's management team recently had the privilege of ringing the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange to commemorate our 25-year anniversary of trading on the prestigious exchange. Standing on that balcony and reflecting on what we have built over the last 25 years and where we are heading in the future was [ogling] and I couldn't be prouder. Quanta's infrastructure solutions are at the tip of the spear of the energy transition in North America. At our Investor Day last year, we laid out a five-year financial goals we expect to achieve through 2026, which provided an organic growth strategy to generate a 10% adjusted earnings per share CAGR and when considering the levers available to us to allocate future cash flow generation into value-creating opportunities, a platform with opportunity to deliver more than a 15% CAGR in adjusted earnings per share.  With the strong results we delivered last year, our outlook for 2023 and the momentum we see building for the coming years, we are increasingly confident in our ability to meet or exceed those goals we laid out. We are focused on operating the business for the long term and expect to continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class field leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's base business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's diversity, unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset form the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for our stakeholders.  I will now turn the call over to Jayshree Desai, our CFO, for her review of our fourth quarter and full year results and 2023 expectations. Jayshree?\nJayshree Desai : Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced record fourth quarter revenues of $4.4 billion. Net income attributable to common stock was $163 million or $1.10 per diluted share and adjusted diluted earnings per share was a record for the fourth quarter at $1.68. Overall, the fourth quarter closed out another year of exceptional operational performance by Quanta. Our electric segment benefited from outstanding execution and higher revenues across the segment. Additionally, our underground segment performed well in the fourth quarter, led by increased volumes and operating income from our base business operations. Our renewables segment, however, was negatively impacted by unanticipated project delays, which were primarily attributable to the changes in the solar market regulations that we discussed in the third quarter. These delays created cost absorption challenges, which pressured operating margins. Additionally, the segment's operating margin was negatively impacted by approximately 120 basis points due to impairment charges on the software implementation project at an acquired company, which commenced prior to our acquisition, but was discontinued in the fourth quarter. Ultimately, in the aggregate, against the backdrop of supply chain challenges, inflationary pressures and a complex regulatory environment, our portfolio delivered against our targets for the fourth quarter and the year, and we remain well positioned for the anticipated growth ahead. Below the line, we recorded an unrealized loss of $15 million associated with our common equity interest in fixed wireless broadband technology provider, Starry Group Holdings, which reduced the carrying value of our investment to zero. Offsetting this unrealized loss was an unrealized gain of $26 million on the sale of an investment in a non-integral unconsolidated affiliate, of which $10 million was attributable to a non-controlling ownership interest. Further commentary comparing fourth quarter '22 to fourth quarter '21 for each segment can be found in the slides accompanying this call. Our total backlog was $24.1 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, a significant increase from third quarter '22 and another record level. The increases across each of our segments are attributable to multiple new project awards including the previously announced Colorado Power Pathway Project and extensions and increases in expected volumes under MSAs. Our 12-month backlog was also at a record level of $13.8 billion, which we believe is another indicator of the strength of our core markets and the steady growing demand for our solutions-based approach. For the fourth quarter of 2022, we generated free cash flow of $513 million, resulting in $767 million of free cash flow for the year. Contributing to our free cash flow was the collection of $101 million of insurance proceeds following a favorable arbitration ruling associated with our Peruvian subsidiary\u2019s terminated telecommunications project. Excluding those proceeds, our fourth quarter cash flow was still in line with our expectations and included planned outflows of approximately $45 million for change of control related payments associated with the Blattner acquisition, and $54 million of previously deferred payroll taxes in accordance with the CARES Act in 2020. DSO measured 75 days for the fourth quarter of 2022, which was a reduction of 6 days compared to the third quarter of 2022, primarily due to favorable billing arrangements related to certain projects. Regarding the Canadian renewable transmission project that we've discussed in prior quarters, we continue to work with the customer to address the contract asset balance. Resolution of certain of these amounts could extend into 2024 and currently represent 5 to 6 days of DSO at December 31, 2022. While we remain confident in our position, our DSO will be pressured by the project in the near term. We had total liquidity of $2.4 billion at year-end and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.1 as calculated under our credit agreement. As we mentioned in today's release, we continue to identify and make strategic investments in acquisitions. In January of 2023, we acquired three businesses for total combined consideration of approximately $588 million, approximately $465 million of which was paid in cash at the time of the acquisitions. Additionally, we repurchased approximately $128 million of our common stock during the year.  Turning to our full year 2023 guidance. The growth across our end markets remains robust, and we believe the tailwinds driving our growth are long in duration and create multiyear visibility in our earnings potential. As the build-out of the infrastructure necessary for the energy transition accelerates, we believe the complementary capabilities of our operations will become even more valuable to our customers. While segment designations help investors better understand the work we're performing, we'll continue to emphasize the power of our aggregate portfolio of solutions and the earnings they generate. That said, the following remarks will speak to our expectations at a segment level for 2023. As it relates to the Electric Power segment, we expect 2023 revenues ranging between $10 billion and $10.1 billion. Our base business continues to lead the growth in the segment, driven primarily by North American utilities outsourcing the activities required to replace, rebuild and modernize existing infrastructure. Notably, our 2023 expectations included $250 million of emergency restoration services revenues compared to a little over $300 million in 2022. Also included within the segment are our communications operations, which we expect will generate around $900 million of revenue, in line with 2022 levels. We expect 2023 operating margins for the Electric Power segment to range between 10.7% and 11.3%, which includes contributions of between $43 million and $48 million of earnings from our integral unconsolidated affiliates, the largest portion of which relates to the LUMA joint venture in Puerto Rico. From a seasonality perspective, we expect revenues to be lowest in the first quarter with mid-single-digit growth from first quarter '22, then growing sequentially through the third quarter, followed by a seasonal decline in the fourth. We expect fourth quarter operating margins will be the lowest for the year, likely around 9%, then increasing into the second and third quarters and slightly declining in the fourth quarter. The Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions segment full year revenues are expected to range between $4.3 billion and $4.5 billion, over 15% growth compared to 2022 as we believe the headwinds faced by the solar market in '22 should meaningfully improve in the second half of 2023. We think it's important to note that within our range of guidance for renewables, approximately $3 billion of our planned revenues are already in various stages of construction, giving us confidence in our ability to deliver full year revenues at these levels. We expect 2023 operating margins for the Renewable Energy segment to be around 8.5% for the year, slightly lower than the 9% level that we would normally expect. We've invested meaningfully in the project leadership, specialized equipment and administrative needs required to support the expected ramp in project activity in the second half of '23 and into '24. However, the cost of that investment weighs on margins, particularly in the first quarter. We expect margins for the first quarter to be the lowest for the year, likely between 4% and 5%, but should strengthen in each sequential quarter as volumes increase throughout the year. From a revenue seasonality perspective, we expect segment revenues to be between $850 million and $900 million in the first quarter, the lowest for the year, then growing sequentially into the third quarter and slightly declining in the fourth. As a reminder, it's possible that as we progress through the year and gain more visibility into the nature of the work we'll be performing, there could be movements outside these initial ranges for the electric and renewable segments, depending on the type of generation or activity support. With regard to the Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment, we are currently anticipating full year revenue range to range between $4.1 billion and $4.3 billion, a slight decline compared to 2022. This decline is due to lower volumes of larger pipeline projects, which contributed almost $900 million of revenue in 2022, but are expected to be around $450 million in 2023. Despite the revenue reduction, operating margins for the year are expected to range between 7.25% and 7.75% led by our base business activities in the segment. From a seasonality perspective, we expect segment revenues in the first quarter to be in line with first quarter '22 revenues, with operating margins around 5%. We then expect revenues and margins to improve in the second and third quarters with a seasonal decline in the fourth quarter. As it stands today, we expect fourth quarter '23 revenues to be the lowest for the year. These segment operating ranges support our expectation for 2023 annual consolidated revenues of $18.4 billion to $18.9 billion and adjusted EBITDA of between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion. This represents another record level of adjusted EBITDA with expected full year adjusted EBITDA margins at the midpoint of over 10%. With these operating results, we estimate our range of GAAP diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock for 2023 to be between $4.67 and $5.17 and non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share to be $6.75 and $7.25. Of note, we estimate our tax rate for the year will range between 26.25% and 26.75%. The first quarter rate, however, will be negligible, potentially zero due to favorable discrete tax dynamics associated with the increase between grant date value and the vesting date value of stock-related awards under our equity compensation plan. We currently expect 2023 free cash flow to range between $750 million and $1 billion with capital expenditures of around $400 million, which should give us the ability to be within our target leverage range of 1.5x to 2x by the end of 2023. We remain committed, however, to be -- we remain committed, however, to creating shareholder value with strategic acquisitions and opportunistic repurchase activity throughout the year while retaining our investment grade rating. Going into 2023, we have approximately $345 million of availability remaining on our current stock repurchase program. As a reminder, we've provided more guidance details in the outlook summary that was posted in connection with the earnings release and can be found on our IR website at quantaservices.com. The strength and versatility of our portfolio give us confidence in our ability to continue driving results against an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. The infrastructure investment required to support North America's energy transition is still in its early stages and creates opportunity for Quanta to continue providing industry-leading comprehensive end-to-end solutions. Our relationships and the breadth of our solutions have proven to be critical in our ability to navigate the economic landscape of the last three years, and we are confident those attributes position us to continue along our expected double-digit growth trajectory.  This concludes our formal presentation, and we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Alex Rygiel with B. Riley.\nAlex Rygiel : Excellent quarter. A few quick questions. Duke, backlog growth is fantastic here. Obviously, some of that is from some of your acquisitions. But I guess what I'm trying to get at is how do you think about backlog growth over the next couple of years? And maybe if you could comment on what you think your bid pipeline sort of looks like as it relates to backlog? Do you see an acceleration in your bid pipeline? It sounds like you might be seeing that, but any thoughts there would be helpful.\nDuke Austin : Thanks, Alex. The backlog is really not material when you look at the acquisitions, so take that out. I think we had broad-based backlog growth within the company. And as we look forward, I think you'll continue to see that throughout '23. The dynamic of the stacking of larger projects along with what we see at our MSA levels continue to be robust. And I think it will be broad-based on our Renewables as well as our Electric Power and even in U&I segment. So we see robust markets there.  As we look at the bid pipeline, I think both the renewable side, you see more of elongation out where it was just 12 months, you're seeing 24-month, 36-month type things within our backlog. So that's creating that growth as well there. But the pipeline itself, larger projects are certainly in there. But our MSA business, base business is robust as well. So just a broad-based kind of look at the business at this point.\nJayshree Desai : Hey, Alex. Just to add and to clarify that the acquisitions were done in January, so they are not in our backlog.\nAlex Rygiel : Fair enough. And then secondly, you referenced ongoing supply chain challenges. There's a couple kind of thought on that topic. And one is supply chain challenges to hold back your ability to obviously acquire equipment to execute on projects. But also kind of when you layer into that Quanta's historical achievements in managing difficult labor supply chain challenges and educating and training internally. Can you talk about how those supply chain challenges have allowed Quanta to gain market share kind of in this current environment right now and moving forward? .\nDuke Austin : We anticipated the labor. So I think craft skilled labor is still at the core of the business. We've invested in a long ago and not -- we continue to invest in it today. That is something that we are in front of. The supply chain challenges with the fleet. We've done a nice job, have great partnerships in our fleet over the years, certainly leverage. I think we have the fourth largest fleet in North America. So it's something that we challenge ourselves to be in front of that as well with our suppliers and the same collaborative manner that we use with our customers, we use with our suppliers. So I certainly gave us an advantage, but also gives us a look in the future. And I just think we'll stay on top of the two things that we manage and control is labor and fleet and so we made it pretty tough.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta : Congrats on a great quarter here. I wonder if you spend some time on the renewable segment. And if you could comment first, how the Inflation Reduction Act is impacting customer conversations? And when we -- when you think it will start to show up in terms of either backlog or in revenue? And then Jayshree, you made some comments about operating income at the segment moving in the right direction as you think '23. Can you help us give us the building blocks to think about that?\nDuke Austin : Yes. With the Renewables segment, when we look out the IRA, certainly it's additive to anything we've talked about to get your hands around it and what it actually means. I don't think we see anything at this point that has the consequences thereof. It does give us certainty over the next 10 years within that. But as our backlog as we're having the conversations today, it's certainly about U.S. content, how we look at labor, all those kind of things within the IRA bill. That's something the company has done a nice job of getting in front of and we're proud of that. I'll let Jayshree comment on the rest of it.\nJayshree Desai : Yes, Neil, the Renewables segment margin and revenues, basically, as we said, till a little down in the first quarter, but it will be picking up as we move throughout the year. And that's really driven by the fact that as the industry gets more and more comfortable with where the IRA is headed as projects move forward with PPAs and financing, we should see a big pickup in the back half of the year. We have been prudent with our guidance given some of the still supply chain issues and the tariff situations that are out there. However, we're seeing a lot more interest, a lot more movement, and it should start developing in the back half of the year and especially into 2024.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Justin Hauke with Robert W. Baird.\nJustin Hauke : I've got, I guess, a question just on the guidance and the acquisitions that you did post quarter. Just the $580 million that for three deals is actually a fairly large amount for you guys when you usually do kind of more smaller bolt-on ones per quarter. So maybe you could just give a little bit of guidance around the revenue and EBITDA contribution in 2023 from that incremental M&A?\nJayshree Desai : Yes, the revenue contribution is around $600 million for those three deals. And I would just say that from an EPS contribution, they contribute around $0.15 to $0.20.\nDuke Austin : As far as its three deals, and they're all within the strategic platform that we've set out and a regional T&D. One addresses the front end side of the solar markets and wind, so batteries, et cetera, and the other one is the supply chain kind of contribution there. So three things that we felt like we're right down the middle for us. We've always said the timing and how we deploy capital. It's -- sometimes it's lumpy, sometimes it spreads out. So I wouldn't read anything into it.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse.\nJamie Cook : Good morning and congrats on a nice quarter. I guess just back to the renewable margins. I think you guys talked about investing in the business, which is weighing on margins, in particular, in the first quarter. Can you help us understand like the investments that you're making and how to think about how much that's impacting the margin guidance for the year? So I guess that's my first question.  And my second question is, I'm sort of struck with the guidance that we're implying for 2023, $7 your company that typically guides fairly conservatively. So trying to think about if there's upside to the numbers in 2023 or downside to the numbers, could you just calibrate where the upside or downside could be given the good guide already?\nDuke Austin : Yes. Thanks, Jamie. When we think about the renewable segment is primarily around utilization and how quickly you're going to get absorption early on. And as we move on to the projects that are stated, certainly, you get absorption in the back half. You're a little light, and you saw it in the fourth quarter, you'll see it in the first quarter. We know the projects that we're on, we talked about $3 billion that we have started. The back half, when we look at the back half, certainly, there's opportunities there. We were prudent about how we looked at it. We felt like with the way that the supply chain work this year, especially on the panels and things of that nature and how the IRA comes in and how quickly it comes in. We take the same approach to guidance every year, which is prudent, and I believe we did the same this year. It's exactly the same way.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Noelle Dilts with Stifel.\nNoelle Dilts : I know there's been a fair amount of discussion around supply chain. But I have heard that the transformer issue remains fairly challenging with extremely long lead times. So -- and we've talked about that before. So I was actually just curious to what extent you think that's getting better? Are things getting a little bit more predictable as it relates to some of these components that have been in short supply, specifically as it relates to electric T&D?\nDuke Austin : Thanks, Noelle. The -- when we look at the supply chain, most of your larger Us, your larger customers have solved much of this, not to say that the transformers and certain items are long lead times they are. And it is issues, there is issues around it. But once we understand it, once we understand cadence, we can be much more predictable about how we deploy crews and assets. So that's helped us. I do think there's opportunity there for us and how we participate in solving these solutions with the client. That said, I don't -- transformer is going to be a while. I think the back half of the year, maybe even into the fourth quarter before that levelizes out and we get enough capacity in the market. But with the amount of EV penetration, the things that we see, you're going to see some shortages in transformers, and we just have to be more robust about how we deploy assets. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS.\nSteven Fisher : Just on the electric transmission and distribution kind of customer spending outlook. There's been some mixed data points on utility CapEx over the last few months, but I guess still overall, positive. I'm curious what discussions you're having with the utility customers, specifically around the planning for the IIJA funds, how are they baking those into their spending patterns? And how will that ultimately flow into your bookings and backlog? \nDuke Austin : Thanks. Here's what we see. We see North America is load growing as we look at it across our segments. So the growth of generation in North America, you have that going on, you have renewables and the way that we're looking at penetration through transmission, you have EV penetration ongoing. So all those things are coming in to these CapEx. I hear that and I hear well, you've seen something different. All I've seen is our customers moved our CapEx budgets up primarily in distribution on the outer end because of penetration of EV and then all your transmission that needs to be interconnected. The way that you think about it, you think about all the things that are necessary to make this work, yes, you can delay a bit. You can do some things. But we're already behind on just in general, if you stay flat on carbon today, you can't -- we're struggling to serve the load at the customer level on the coastlines. And that's our duty to this industry's duty to the consumer is to have load and if you have wells that are offshore, if you have things that don't allow us to build generation that's necessary to get to a carbon-free environment, we have to have more transmission. So either way you look at this on any level, the capital necessary to transform and to make sure that these countries have as a resilient grid, will require a significant amount of capital.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer with Thompson, Davis.\nAdam Thalhimer : Great quarter. Great outlook. A quick question on electrical margins. So the guidance range for margins this year, 10.7% to 11.3%. It's the same guidance we started last year with and we ended up at the low end, 10.7%. So my question would be, what factors drive you to the low end last year and what could drive you to the high end of this year?\nDuke Austin : We talked about the segment. And when you look at it, I mean, I think in general, this year, the supply chain on the way -- well, you had inflation, you had real costs rising, a bunch of different things going on, and we talked about that early on in the first half that we thought we could operate through it in the second half, and we did.  So we've got that in our system now. We understand cadence around supply chains and things of that nature. So it gives us a great more deal of comfort that we can operate in the higher end of the range, not in the lower. So that's just us understanding what markets we're in. We're still -- our guide is at 12% EBITDA, something like that. A lot of people talk about EBITDA, so it's 12% in EBITDA.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard with Bernstein.\nChad Dillard : So Duke, I want to go back to your comments about your focus on front end. And my question is, by how much does that greater focus on front end work expand your TAM? And then like would you classify this as a pull from your customers versus a push from Quanta? And then how are you thinking about building this out? To what extent do you plan to focus on inorganic acquisitions versus just organic building?\nDuke Austin : When we look at the market, if you take it all, it's 30% or so of total addressable market within our client base. And I -- we continue to build that out because what was happening, and it made us less efficient and also the client less efficient. And I believe from a construction standpoint, how we approach it, how we approach the front end, we can give a lot more certainty to any project. So it was necessary, in my mind, for us to get in that business. And yes, the customer is happy with it. The projects that we have done, the programs that we are ongoing are certainly something that we'll continue to build off as we move into the future. And that market is there. It makes us more efficient on the backside of a lot of reasons for us to like that piece of business. And we'll continue to invest.\nChad Dillard : Got it. Okay. And then my second question is just on the supply chain. Can you talk about what's embedded in your '23 guide in terms of improvement maybe like versus where we are today? And then just going to the Renewables segment, how much of the revenues in '23 what were delayed in '22?\nDuke Austin : As far as the supply chain what we see today, what we've seen over the past quarters is how we looked at it going forward. If it gets better, certainly, we'll come back and we'll talk about it, but we see intermittence in the supply chain on utility side for the year, basically, I do think the renewable segment, supply chain is better in the second half, and we've certainly looked at that as well. But how much better? I'm not sure. And if it does, if it creates, there is some conservatism in the renewables segment due to that. We've baked all that in, and I feel like hit it down the middle with prudent guidance. As far as the revenue, I'll let Jayshree talk about.\nJayshree Desai : Yes. I would say it's a mix. It's hard to -- I don't want to sit here and say how much is due to delays versus there has been additional backlog on the renewable segment, that's starting to come in, and you've got some projects that have moved into the -- from '22 to '23, it's both.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research.\nMichael Dudas: Duke, you announced several large T&D projects over the last couple of months. Can you talk about what you have in the pipeline relative to those types of projects and what your selectivity might be going forward? And maybe how that plays out over the next several years because these are much longer gestation projects than we have in your base business?\nDuke Austin : Yes. Thanks, Michael. We talked about the stacking effect of the projects, the larger projects they stack on the base. I think when we went through CREZ seven, eight years ago, the company got off the base. I would tell you today, we're highly focused on our base business roughly 85%, 90% of that resilient business that we have. We'll continue to focus on that. We're being every project the same. We did the risk. We're not going to win them all. We're just not. And I've watched one recently look at -- we know our cost, we know what we're doing. We're not going to take risk. It's not something we're going to gamble on. If we're just not, and it's not Vegas, we're going to get ourselves in a good position to make sure that we execute on these projects. And we don't need to necessarily take the larger projects. We can build our base. But we do see an incremental amount of larger projects coming in, in '23, '24 and beyond.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson.\nBrent Thielman : Duke, expectation for reduction in large pipeline work in '23 versus '22, is that just a function of sort of project sequencing for your business? Because your backlog is up pretty nicely in undergrads that just sort of reflective of the environment we're in. And I also just be curious there's opportunities to still fill that void you're sort of talking about for the underground business late in the year.\nDuke Austin : Yes, the backlog was primarily driven by MSA growth there. And when we look at the larger diameter pie, we talked about guiding to kind of 450, 500 type range year-over-year. Certainly, there's opportunities for us to do $1 billion and that opportunity is out there. We guided to where we're at. Just for us, we can make the numbers in a portfolio approach where we're at. I felt comfortable with them. We felt comfortable if things move, let's just say, solar moved or, let's say, large pipe went the other way. The portfolio we have makes us what I think very predictable. And that -- those larger dynamics of pipe and some of our renewable projects, we took a prudent approach to guidance. We'll update you if we get more work, we'll certainly update.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'm not seeing any questions coming in. I'd like to pass it back over to the Quanta management team for any closing comments.\nDuke Austin : Yes, I want to thank men and women in the field, they are putting up the numbers every day and more in safe. It allows for a great call and for us to talk about how great the company is doing. And certainly, after 25 years in Quanta, I think we're just getting started. So I'd like to thank everyone for participating in our conference call. We appreciate your questions and your ongoing interest in Quanta Services. Thank you, and this concludes our call.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Duke Austin",
            "content": "Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings conference call. On the call today, I will provide operational and strategic commentary, and we'll then turn it over to Jayshree Desai, Quanta CFO, to provide a review of our financial results and full year 2023 financial expectations. Following Jayshree's comments, we welcome your questions. This morning, we reported strong fourth quarter and full year results, which were built off an industry-leading operational and financial platform that delivered another year of solid, safe execution and profitable growth. Additionally, total backlog of $24.1 billion at year-end was a record, and that does not include several notable recent project awards. Driven by the dedication and operational excellence of our world-class employees and the culture of collaboration throughout Quanta, we believe our '22 -- 2022 results also demonstrate the benefit of our diversified portfolio of solutions, our repeatable and sustainable model and the successful execution of our strategic initiatives to drive operational excellence and total cost solutions for our clients and ultimately, the consumer. Our portfolio of companies, diversity of service lines, geographic coverage, outstanding field leadership and deep, long-standing and collaborative relationships with our clients have allowed us to successfully navigate through the challenges presented by a global pandemic, and manage ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and supply chain constraints, while still delivering five consecutive years of record adjusted EBITDA and six consecutive years of record earnings per share. We accomplished a great deal in 2022 through the successful implementation of our strategic initiatives and our past success positions us well for the future. Our innovative approach to our infrastructure solutions, our portfolio of services and our passion for working collaboratively with our clients to support their success, positions us to be a critical partner in enabling the energy transition for years to come. Here are some of our accomplishments in 2022. We continue to successfully advance our front-end solution strategy, both organically and through acquisitions and strategic investments. Our focus is on strengthening our design, engineering, permitting, environmental, logistics and program management capabilities. This strategy allows us to expand our customers and provide them with greater certainty around cost, time to market and quality, which ultimately benefits consumers. It also enhances our risk management capabilities and increases our total addressable market. Electric Power Infrastructure Solutions segment revenues achieved record levels, maintain margins and increase market share despite some work delays caused by ongoing supply chain challenges. We further expanded our emergency response capabilities and supported our customers' efforts to restore power to millions of people adversely impacted by several severe weather events during the year. Our ability to quickly mobilize significant resources to support our customers in times of need is unmatched in our industry.  LUMA Energy, our joint venture with ATCO, which is managing Puerto Rico's more than 18,000-mile electric transmission and distribution system, continue to improve its customer service, response times, customer communication and workforce safety as well as overall system reliability. Additionally, LUMA restored power to more than 90% of its customers in less than two weeks following Hurricane Fiona, which was much faster than previous storm responses by the prior grid operator and was comparable to, if not better, than restoration times following major hurricanes in the mainland United States. Though many years of challenges and work remain, we continue to believe this opportunity is transformative for Quanta and the people of Puerto Rico and remain committed to supporting LUMA's mission to provide reliable electricity while building a modern and sustainable transmission and distribution system. We continue to grow our communication services business and increased revenues by approximately 30%. Contributing to the growth was further development of our wireless infrastructure solutions, which expand our opportunities to capitalize on 5G network deployment and ongoing enhancement of 4G wireless networks. We continue to make meaningful progress on growing our portfolio of services within each of our operating companies to further enhance our operating results. For example, we are leveraging our gas utility assets to perform certain aspects of underground electric power and telecom-related work. We believe the resource expansion and operating leverage we gained through these initiatives is significant opportunity for Quanta to reinforce our self-perform capabilities, improve operating efficiency and profitability and demonstrates the strength of our portfolio approach. Quanta's Capacity Model was recognized by the National Safety Council as a finalist for its prestigious Green Cross for Safety Award, which recognizes outstanding projects in organizations working to support the National Safety Council's mission to save lives and prevent injuries from workplace to any place. The Capacity Model is revolutionary because it only creates a work environment that focuses on preventing an incident but also builds the capacity to fell safely. We demonstrated our commitment to stockholder value and our confidence in Quanta's financial strength and continue to growth opportunities through the repurchase of approximately $128 million of our common stock and a 17% increase of our dividend while also increasing our liquidity. And finally, we continue to increase our efforts and dedicate resources towards implementing sustainable business practices throughout the organization. We made significant progress in our 2021 Sustainability Report, which discusses the company's accomplishments during that year and marks a key milestone for Quanta as we published our first consolidated sustainability metrics, including our Scope 1 and 2 emissions. We also highlighted and discussed the important positive impact Quanta has on society and enabling the energy transition and technological development. Demand is robust for our solutions that support our customers, efforts to modernize and harden the grid and prepare it for the impact of increased electric vehicle penetration. This activity drove our Electric Power segment results and backlog strength during 2022, primarily due to significant multiyear master service agreements and gains through our service line expansion with utilities. Further, we continue to believe we are in the early stages of utilities undergrounding transmission and distribution lines to protect them from the effects of severe weather events and wildfires. We see this activity increasing in the Western United States and high-fire threat areas, but these initiatives are active in other areas of the country. Examples include electric transmission projects in the Northeast, distribution circuits along the coast lines and electric transmission line projects for offshore wind generation. Many of these initiatives are part of a large-scale multiyear system modernization and hardening programs. Our utility and renewable developer customers who accounted for the majority of our 2022 revenues are leaders in the effort to reduce carbon emissions, increased electrification and lead the energy transition with aggressive plans to expand and modernize the power grid and grow their renewable generation portfolios. Achieving these goals will require substantial incremental investment in transmission, substation and renewable generation facilities to produce and transport clean power to ensure grid reliability due to the growth of intermittent power added to the system. For example, in December of last year, we announced Quanta's selection by Xcel Energy as its prime constructor to manage all construction activities for Colorado's Power Pathway high-voltage electric transmission project in Colorado. The approximately 610-mile high-voltage electric transmission line project is designed to increase the reliabilities of the state's power grid and enable future renewable energy development in Colorado including approximately 5,500 megawatts of new wind, solar and other resources that Xcel Energy plans to add through 2030.  While the supply chain and regulatory hurdles created challenges for the renewable industry during 2022, there is significant demand for our power grid and renewable generation solutions. Number of solar projects that were delayed in 2022 are beginning to move forward in '23. Regulatory hurdles are easing and the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act or IRA which is considered by many to be the nation's most ambitious legislative action ever taken on climate is expected to have meaningful positive effect on a number of our end markets, which would be additive to our strategy for at least the next decade. Our underground utility and infrastructure solutions segment consistently performed at a high level through the year. Revenues grew strongly and margins significantly improved, after navigating through tough operating conditions caused by the global pandemic over the prior two years. Importantly, we continue to invest in our people and strategies during those challenging times and emerge as a stronger and better company, which is reflected in our solid 2022 results. We expect to continue our focus on growing our gas utility, pipeline integrity and industrial services businesses consistent with our strategy over the last five years, which are executing well and driven by regulatory spend to modernize systems, reduce methane emissions, ensure environmental compliance and improve safety and reliability. Looking to the coming years, we continue to believe Quanta has any meaningful opportunities with customers in this segment as they increasingly pursue strategies to reduce their carbon footprint and diversify their operations and assets toward greener business opportunities. Further, the IRA includes incentives to support certain energy transition technologies to further encourage a broader set of current and potential traditional energy and industrial customers to accelerate their pursuit of opportunities around these technologies. In our earnings release this morning, we provided our 2023 guidance, which we believe demonstrates the strength and sustainability of our portfolio approach to this and long-term strategy, favorable end market trends, our ability to safely execute our strong and strengthening competitive position in the marketplace. Further, our ongoing investment in and commitment to workforce training continues to positively impact our performance and allow us to capitalize on future opportunities. Our expectations caught for another year of meaningful growth in record revenues, improved margins and opportunity for double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDA, cash flow and earnings per share. Additionally, we see opportunity to achieve record levels of backlog in 2023. Jayshree will provide additional detail about our guidance in her commentary.  Quanta's management team recently had the privilege of ringing the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange to commemorate our 25-year anniversary of trading on the prestigious exchange. Standing on that balcony and reflecting on what we have built over the last 25 years and where we are heading in the future was [ogling] and I couldn't be prouder. Quanta's infrastructure solutions are at the tip of the spear of the energy transition in North America. At our Investor Day last year, we laid out a five-year financial goals we expect to achieve through 2026, which provided an organic growth strategy to generate a 10% adjusted earnings per share CAGR and when considering the levers available to us to allocate future cash flow generation into value-creating opportunities, a platform with opportunity to deliver more than a 15% CAGR in adjusted earnings per share.  With the strong results we delivered last year, our outlook for 2023 and the momentum we see building for the coming years, we are increasingly confident in our ability to meet or exceed those goals we laid out. We are focused on operating the business for the long term and expect to continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class field leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's base business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's diversity, unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset form the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for our stakeholders.  I will now turn the call over to Jayshree Desai, our CFO, for her review of our fourth quarter and full year results and 2023 expectations. Jayshree? Thanks, Alex. The backlog is really not material when you look at the acquisitions, so take that out. I think we had broad-based backlog growth within the company. And as we look forward, I think you'll continue to see that throughout '23. The dynamic of the stacking of larger projects along with what we see at our MSA levels continue to be robust. And I think it will be broad-based on our Renewables as well as our Electric Power and even in U&I segment. So we see robust markets there.  As we look at the bid pipeline, I think both the renewable side, you see more of elongation out where it was just 12 months, you're seeing 24-month, 36-month type things within our backlog. So that's creating that growth as well there. But the pipeline itself, larger projects are certainly in there. But our MSA business, base business is robust as well. So just a broad-based kind of look at the business at this point. We anticipated the labor. So I think craft skilled labor is still at the core of the business. We've invested in a long ago and not -- we continue to invest in it today. That is something that we are in front of. The supply chain challenges with the fleet. We've done a nice job, have great partnerships in our fleet over the years, certainly leverage. I think we have the fourth largest fleet in North America. So it's something that we challenge ourselves to be in front of that as well with our suppliers and the same collaborative manner that we use with our customers, we use with our suppliers. So I certainly gave us an advantage, but also gives us a look in the future. And I just think we'll stay on top of the two things that we manage and control is labor and fleet and so we made it pretty tough. Yes. With the Renewables segment, when we look out the IRA, certainly it's additive to anything we've talked about to get your hands around it and what it actually means. I don't think we see anything at this point that has the consequences thereof. It does give us certainty over the next 10 years within that. But as our backlog as we're having the conversations today, it's certainly about U.S. content, how we look at labor, all those kind of things within the IRA bill. That's something the company has done a nice job of getting in front of and we're proud of that. I'll let Jayshree comment on the rest of it. As far as its three deals, and they're all within the strategic platform that we've set out and a regional T&D. One addresses the front end side of the solar markets and wind, so batteries, et cetera, and the other one is the supply chain kind of contribution there. So three things that we felt like we're right down the middle for us. We've always said the timing and how we deploy capital. It's -- sometimes it's lumpy, sometimes it spreads out. So I wouldn't read anything into it. Yes. Thanks, Jamie. When we think about the renewable segment is primarily around utilization and how quickly you're going to get absorption early on. And as we move on to the projects that are stated, certainly, you get absorption in the back half. You're a little light, and you saw it in the fourth quarter, you'll see it in the first quarter. We know the projects that we're on, we talked about $3 billion that we have started. The back half, when we look at the back half, certainly, there's opportunities there. We were prudent about how we looked at it. We felt like with the way that the supply chain work this year, especially on the panels and things of that nature and how the IRA comes in and how quickly it comes in. We take the same approach to guidance every year, which is prudent, and I believe we did the same this year. It's exactly the same way. Thanks, Noelle. The -- when we look at the supply chain, most of your larger Us, your larger customers have solved much of this, not to say that the transformers and certain items are long lead times they are. And it is issues, there is issues around it. But once we understand it, once we understand cadence, we can be much more predictable about how we deploy crews and assets. So that's helped us. I do think there's opportunity there for us and how we participate in solving these solutions with the client. That said, I don't -- transformer is going to be a while. I think the back half of the year, maybe even into the fourth quarter before that levelizes out and we get enough capacity in the market. But with the amount of EV penetration, the things that we see, you're going to see some shortages in transformers, and we just have to be more robust about how we deploy assets. Thanks. Here's what we see. We see North America is load growing as we look at it across our segments. So the growth of generation in North America, you have that going on, you have renewables and the way that we're looking at penetration through transmission, you have EV penetration ongoing. So all those things are coming in to these CapEx. I hear that and I hear well, you've seen something different. All I've seen is our customers moved our CapEx budgets up primarily in distribution on the outer end because of penetration of EV and then all your transmission that needs to be interconnected. The way that you think about it, you think about all the things that are necessary to make this work, yes, you can delay a bit. You can do some things. But we're already behind on just in general, if you stay flat on carbon today, you can't -- we're struggling to serve the load at the customer level on the coastlines. And that's our duty to this industry's duty to the consumer is to have load and if you have wells that are offshore, if you have things that don't allow us to build generation that's necessary to get to a carbon-free environment, we have to have more transmission. So either way you look at this on any level, the capital necessary to transform and to make sure that these countries have as a resilient grid, will require a significant amount of capital. We talked about the segment. And when you look at it, I mean, I think in general, this year, the supply chain on the way -- well, you had inflation, you had real costs rising, a bunch of different things going on, and we talked about that early on in the first half that we thought we could operate through it in the second half, and we did.  So we've got that in our system now. We understand cadence around supply chains and things of that nature. So it gives us a great more deal of comfort that we can operate in the higher end of the range, not in the lower. So that's just us understanding what markets we're in. We're still -- our guide is at 12% EBITDA, something like that. A lot of people talk about EBITDA, so it's 12% in EBITDA. When we look at the market, if you take it all, it's 30% or so of total addressable market within our client base. And I -- we continue to build that out because what was happening, and it made us less efficient and also the client less efficient. And I believe from a construction standpoint, how we approach it, how we approach the front end, we can give a lot more certainty to any project. So it was necessary, in my mind, for us to get in that business. And yes, the customer is happy with it. The projects that we have done, the programs that we are ongoing are certainly something that we'll continue to build off as we move into the future. And that market is there. It makes us more efficient on the backside of a lot of reasons for us to like that piece of business. And we'll continue to invest. As far as the supply chain what we see today, what we've seen over the past quarters is how we looked at it going forward. If it gets better, certainly, we'll come back and we'll talk about it, but we see intermittence in the supply chain on utility side for the year, basically, I do think the renewable segment, supply chain is better in the second half, and we've certainly looked at that as well. But how much better? I'm not sure. And if it does, if it creates, there is some conservatism in the renewables segment due to that. We've baked all that in, and I feel like hit it down the middle with prudent guidance. As far as the revenue, I'll let Jayshree talk about. Yes. Thanks, Michael. We talked about the stacking effect of the projects, the larger projects they stack on the base. I think when we went through CREZ seven, eight years ago, the company got off the base. I would tell you today, we're highly focused on our base business roughly 85%, 90% of that resilient business that we have. We'll continue to focus on that. We're being every project the same. We did the risk. We're not going to win them all. We're just not. And I've watched one recently look at -- we know our cost, we know what we're doing. We're not going to take risk. It's not something we're going to gamble on. If we're just not, and it's not Vegas, we're going to get ourselves in a good position to make sure that we execute on these projects. And we don't need to necessarily take the larger projects. We can build our base. But we do see an incremental amount of larger projects coming in, in '23, '24 and beyond. Yes, the backlog was primarily driven by MSA growth there. And when we look at the larger diameter pie, we talked about guiding to kind of 450, 500 type range year-over-year. Certainly, there's opportunities for us to do $1 billion and that opportunity is out there. We guided to where we're at. Just for us, we can make the numbers in a portfolio approach where we're at. I felt comfortable with them. We felt comfortable if things move, let's just say, solar moved or, let's say, large pipe went the other way. The portfolio we have makes us what I think very predictable. And that -- those larger dynamics of pipe and some of our renewable projects, we took a prudent approach to guidance. We'll update you if we get more work, we'll certainly update. Yes, I want to thank men and women in the field, they are putting up the numbers every day and more in safe. It allows for a great call and for us to talk about how great the company is doing. And certainly, after 25 years in Quanta, I think we're just getting started. So I'd like to thank everyone for participating in our conference call. We appreciate your questions and your ongoing interest in Quanta Services. Thank you, and this concludes our call."

            "name": "Jayshree Desai",
            "content": "Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced record fourth quarter revenues of $4.4 billion. Net income attributable to common stock was $163 million or $1.10 per diluted share and adjusted diluted earnings per share was a record for the fourth quarter at $1.68. Overall, the fourth quarter closed out another year of exceptional operational performance by Quanta. Our electric segment benefited from outstanding execution and higher revenues across the segment. Additionally, our underground segment performed well in the fourth quarter, led by increased volumes and operating income from our base business operations. Our renewables segment, however, was negatively impacted by unanticipated project delays, which were primarily attributable to the changes in the solar market regulations that we discussed in the third quarter. These delays created cost absorption challenges, which pressured operating margins. Additionally, the segment's operating margin was negatively impacted by approximately 120 basis points due to impairment charges on the software implementation project at an acquired company, which commenced prior to our acquisition, but was discontinued in the fourth quarter. Ultimately, in the aggregate, against the backdrop of supply chain challenges, inflationary pressures and a complex regulatory environment, our portfolio delivered against our targets for the fourth quarter and the year, and we remain well positioned for the anticipated growth ahead. Below the line, we recorded an unrealized loss of $15 million associated with our common equity interest in fixed wireless broadband technology provider, Starry Group Holdings, which reduced the carrying value of our investment to zero. Offsetting this unrealized loss was an unrealized gain of $26 million on the sale of an investment in a non-integral unconsolidated affiliate, of which $10 million was attributable to a non-controlling ownership interest. Further commentary comparing fourth quarter '22 to fourth quarter '21 for each segment can be found in the slides accompanying this call. Our total backlog was $24.1 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, a significant increase from third quarter '22 and another record level. The increases across each of our segments are attributable to multiple new project awards including the previously announced Colorado Power Pathway Project and extensions and increases in expected volumes under MSAs. Our 12-month backlog was also at a record level of $13.8 billion, which we believe is another indicator of the strength of our core markets and the steady growing demand for our solutions-based approach. For the fourth quarter of 2022, we generated free cash flow of $513 million, resulting in $767 million of free cash flow for the year. Contributing to our free cash flow was the collection of $101 million of insurance proceeds following a favorable arbitration ruling associated with our Peruvian subsidiary's terminated telecommunications project. Excluding those proceeds, our fourth quarter cash flow was still in line with our expectations and included planned outflows of approximately $45 million for change of control related payments associated with the Blattner acquisition, and $54 million of previously deferred payroll taxes in accordance with the CARES Act in 2020. DSO measured 75 days for the fourth quarter of 2022, which was a reduction of 6 days compared to the third quarter of 2022, primarily due to favorable billing arrangements related to certain projects. Regarding the Canadian renewable transmission project that we've discussed in prior quarters, we continue to work with the customer to address the contract asset balance. Resolution of certain of these amounts could extend into 2024 and currently represent 5 to 6 days of DSO at December 31, 2022. While we remain confident in our position, our DSO will be pressured by the project in the near term. We had total liquidity of $2.4 billion at year-end and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.1 as calculated under our credit agreement. As we mentioned in today's release, we continue to identify and make strategic investments in acquisitions. In January of 2023, we acquired three businesses for total combined consideration of approximately $588 million, approximately $465 million of which was paid in cash at the time of the acquisitions. Additionally, we repurchased approximately $128 million of our common stock during the year.  Turning to our full year 2023 guidance. The growth across our end markets remains robust, and we believe the tailwinds driving our growth are long in duration and create multiyear visibility in our earnings potential. As the build-out of the infrastructure necessary for the energy transition accelerates, we believe the complementary capabilities of our operations will become even more valuable to our customers. While segment designations help investors better understand the work we're performing, we'll continue to emphasize the power of our aggregate portfolio of solutions and the earnings they generate. That said, the following remarks will speak to our expectations at a segment level for 2023. As it relates to the Electric Power segment, we expect 2023 revenues ranging between $10 billion and $10.1 billion. Our base business continues to lead the growth in the segment, driven primarily by North American utilities outsourcing the activities required to replace, rebuild and modernize existing infrastructure. Notably, our 2023 expectations included $250 million of emergency restoration services revenues compared to a little over $300 million in 2022. Also included within the segment are our communications operations, which we expect will generate around $900 million of revenue, in line with 2022 levels. We expect 2023 operating margins for the Electric Power segment to range between 10.7% and 11.3%, which includes contributions of between $43 million and $48 million of earnings from our integral unconsolidated affiliates, the largest portion of which relates to the LUMA joint venture in Puerto Rico. From a seasonality perspective, we expect revenues to be lowest in the first quarter with mid-single-digit growth from first quarter '22, then growing sequentially through the third quarter, followed by a seasonal decline in the fourth. We expect fourth quarter operating margins will be the lowest for the year, likely around 9%, then increasing into the second and third quarters and slightly declining in the fourth quarter. The Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions segment full year revenues are expected to range between $4.3 billion and $4.5 billion, over 15% growth compared to 2022 as we believe the headwinds faced by the solar market in '22 should meaningfully improve in the second half of 2023. We think it's important to note that within our range of guidance for renewables, approximately $3 billion of our planned revenues are already in various stages of construction, giving us confidence in our ability to deliver full year revenues at these levels. We expect 2023 operating margins for the Renewable Energy segment to be around 8.5% for the year, slightly lower than the 9% level that we would normally expect. We've invested meaningfully in the project leadership, specialized equipment and administrative needs required to support the expected ramp in project activity in the second half of '23 and into '24. However, the cost of that investment weighs on margins, particularly in the first quarter. We expect margins for the first quarter to be the lowest for the year, likely between 4% and 5%, but should strengthen in each sequential quarter as volumes increase throughout the year. From a revenue seasonality perspective, we expect segment revenues to be between $850 million and $900 million in the first quarter, the lowest for the year, then growing sequentially into the third quarter and slightly declining in the fourth. As a reminder, it's possible that as we progress through the year and gain more visibility into the nature of the work we'll be performing, there could be movements outside these initial ranges for the electric and renewable segments, depending on the type of generation or activity support. With regard to the Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment, we are currently anticipating full year revenue range to range between $4.1 billion and $4.3 billion, a slight decline compared to 2022. This decline is due to lower volumes of larger pipeline projects, which contributed almost $900 million of revenue in 2022, but are expected to be around $450 million in 2023. Despite the revenue reduction, operating margins for the year are expected to range between 7.25% and 7.75% led by our base business activities in the segment. From a seasonality perspective, we expect segment revenues in the first quarter to be in line with first quarter '22 revenues, with operating margins around 5%. We then expect revenues and margins to improve in the second and third quarters with a seasonal decline in the fourth quarter. As it stands today, we expect fourth quarter '23 revenues to be the lowest for the year. These segment operating ranges support our expectation for 2023 annual consolidated revenues of $18.4 billion to $18.9 billion and adjusted EBITDA of between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion. This represents another record level of adjusted EBITDA with expected full year adjusted EBITDA margins at the midpoint of over 10%. With these operating results, we estimate our range of GAAP diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock for 2023 to be between $4.67 and $5.17 and non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share to be $6.75 and $7.25. Of note, we estimate our tax rate for the year will range between 26.25% and 26.75%. The first quarter rate, however, will be negligible, potentially zero due to favorable discrete tax dynamics associated with the increase between grant date value and the vesting date value of stock-related awards under our equity compensation plan. We currently expect 2023 free cash flow to range between $750 million and $1 billion with capital expenditures of around $400 million, which should give us the ability to be within our target leverage range of 1.5x to 2x by the end of 2023. We remain committed, however, to be -- we remain committed, however, to creating shareholder value with strategic acquisitions and opportunistic repurchase activity throughout the year while retaining our investment grade rating. Going into 2023, we have approximately $345 million of availability remaining on our current stock repurchase program. As a reminder, we've provided more guidance details in the outlook summary that was posted in connection with the earnings release and can be found on our IR website at quantaservices.com. The strength and versatility of our portfolio give us confidence in our ability to continue driving results against an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. The infrastructure investment required to support North America's energy transition is still in its early stages and creates opportunity for Quanta to continue providing industry-leading comprehensive end-to-end solutions. Our relationships and the breadth of our solutions have proven to be critical in our ability to navigate the economic landscape of the last three years, and we are confident those attributes position us to continue along our expected double-digit growth trajectory.  This concludes our formal presentation, and we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator? Hey, Alex. Just to add and to clarify that the acquisitions were done in January, so they are not in our backlog. Yes, Neil, the Renewables segment margin and revenues, basically, as we said, till a little down in the first quarter, but it will be picking up as we move throughout the year. And that's really driven by the fact that as the industry gets more and more comfortable with where the IRA is headed as projects move forward with PPAs and financing, we should see a big pickup in the back half of the year. We have been prudent with our guidance given some of the still supply chain issues and the tariff situations that are out there. However, we're seeing a lot more interest, a lot more movement, and it should start developing in the back half of the year and especially into 2024. Yes, the revenue contribution is around $600 million for those three deals. And I would just say that from an EPS contribution, they contribute around $0.15 to $0.20. Yes. I would say it's a mix. It's hard to -- I don't want to sit here and say how much is due to delays versus there has been additional backlog on the renewable segment, that's starting to come in, and you've got some projects that have moved into the -- from '22 to '23, it's both."

With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Duke Austin, Quanta's President and CEO. Duke?\nDuke Austin: Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today, I will provide operational and strategic commentary, and we'll then turn it over to Jayshree Desai, Quanta's CFO, to provide a review of our third quarter results and full year 2022 financial expectations. Following Jayshree's comments, we welcome your questions. This morning, we reported our third quarter results, which continue to reflect strong demand for our services and solid execution. We believe the results highlight the benefits of our diverse, repeatable and sustainable earnings streams and our ability to successfully leverage our portfolio approach in managing our service lines. Our third quarter results include a number of record financial metrics, including revenues, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. Additionally, total backlog of $20.9 billion was a record and is considerably higher than the same period last year. Notably, we also see the opportunity to significantly increase backlog as we move into 2023. Our Electric Power Infrastructure Solutions segment continued to perform well with record revenues and solid margins. We achieved these results despite some delays caused by ongoing supply chain challenges that led to resource imbalances and utilization inefficiencies. As we commented on our second quarter earnings call, these supply chain challenges are not causing meaningful delays in our overall utility capital spending that we are seeing, and we believe these dynamics are shorter term conditions that should be resolved over the coming quarters. Demand for our services continues to be driven by broad-based business strength from utility grid modernization and system hardening initiatives, as well as our reputation for solid and safe execution. Overall, our electric power outlook remains strong, driven primarily by increasing service line opportunities and market share gains for our base business. Quanta deployed emergency response resources to utility customers for 2 hurricanes late in the third quarter. Hurricane Fiona made landfall in Puerto Rico and damaged 50% of the island's distribution feeders, 30% of its transmission lines and submerged 7 substations. Quanta sent more than 200 skilled line workers to the island to support LUMA's restoration efforts and has strategically prepositioned a fleet of trucks and equipment on the island prior to the storm, which allowed us to quickly respond when the hurricane hit. While the fragile state of the island's existing power grid and the heavy rain and flooding from the hurricane made restoration efforts more challenging, LUMA still managed to return power to more than 90% of its customers in less than 2 weeks. We are proud of the way LUMA responded to this event, which was much faster than previous storm responses by prior grid operators and comparable to, if not better, than restoration times following major hurricanes in the mainland United States. At the end of the third quarter, Hurricane Ian made landfall in Florida as a large and destructive category 4 hurricane, which left more than 3 million customers across the Southeast United States without power. Quanta deployed significant resources to support utility customers whose electrical power infrastructure was damaged or destroyed by the hurricane, including more than 3,500 line workers and front-end support services staff from 18 different Quanta operating companies. Although restoration efforts for Hurricane Ian were largely a fourth quarter event, we believe our industry-leading, comprehensive emergency restoration capabilities highlights our ability to rapidly mobilize substantial resources to support our customers in times of need. Importantly, the system hardening investments that Florida utilities have made over the past 10 years proved beneficial during Hurricane Ian and enhanced the ability to restore power to many customers after the first full day of restoration efforts. We believe Florida's leading role in system hardening and its demonstrated benefits will serve as a model for utilities and regulators throughout the country as they plan and implement their own hardening programs. It was a little more than a year ago that we closed the acquisition of Blattner, and I can tell you that we are more excited about the key drivers of the transaction now than we were then, including the value proposition to our customers, the multiyear growth opportunities available to us and the strong operational and cultural fit between the organizations. Since closing, we have largely completed integration. Our teams are working collaboratively. We have enhanced existing customer relationships and created new ones. We are jointly pursuing project opportunities that leverage our expertise and industry-leading position. We have accomplished a great deal with Blattner over the last year, but more importantly, we believe we are just getting started. Our Renewable Infrastructure Solutions segment performed well overall during the third quarter, led by solid performance on high voltage transmission, substation and interconnection work. The utility-scale solar industry faced increased levels of supply chain delays during the third quarter, which impacted our revenues, but our operations managed through these dynamics. We are optimistic that these conditions are shorter term in duration and will resolve themselves over the coming quarters. We continue to collaborate closely with our customers on our renewable build plans for 2023 and beyond. While still early in the process, we are beginning to see a more normalized cadence with respect to limited notices to proceed for renewable projects moving to contract in 2023 as well as forward movement on projects that were delayed in 2022 that are now slated to be built in 2023. According to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, there are approximately 1,400 gigawatts of proposed generation, mostly wind and solar, and energy storage projects that are actively seeking interconnection to the U.S. power grid. These create both opportunities and challenges for our customers, and demand for Quanta's comprehensive solutions and collaborative delivery model is increasing as a result. Further, there are several large renewable energy-related high-voltage electric transmission project opportunities that we are pursuing, which we believe we are well positioned for and could be awarded over the coming months. Furthermore, this past August, the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, was signed into law. It includes nearly $400 billion of tax incentives and financial support designed to accelerate the country's energy transition to a low-carbon economy. This legislation is considered by many to be the nation's most ambitious legislative action ever taken on climate, which we believe should have a meaningful positive effect on a number of our end markets for at least the next decade. In particular, we believe the IRA will drive investment in the development and construction of utility-scale renewable generation facilities and the transmission and substation infrastructure required to support them. Additionally, there are attractive financial incentives in the IRA to expand domestic manufacturing of key renewable energy components such as solar panels. This could reduce the country's reliance on overseas manufacturers and, in turn, reduce supply chain risk by ensuring domestic product availability to meet the growing demand for renewable generation development in the United States. These are just some of the dynamics that give us a high degree of confidence in our ability to meet or exceed long-term growth and earnings targets. Our Underground and Utility Infrastructure Solutions segment continues to perform at a high level. Revenues grew strongly, and margins demonstrate solid execution across our operations in the segment. Our industrial services operation continue to execute very well and experienced robust demand as capital spending resumed and pent-up activity from 2 years of deferred maintenance moved forward. We also continue to experience solid demand for our gas utility and pipeline integrity operations, which are executing well and are driven by regulated spend to modernize systems, reduce methane emissions, ensure environmental compliance and improve safety and reliability. For several quarters on our earnings calls, we have discussed our views about the emerging opportunities within the segment that center around the evolving and increasing efforts of our customers' strategies to reduce their carbon footprint and diversify their operations and assets toward greener business opportunities. To that end, the IRA includes incentives that are designed to support and accelerate certain technologies as part of the energy transition for the traditional energy and industrial industries. For example, there are significant production tax credits for clean hydrogen that can make the energy source cost competitive today, which is expected to accelerate interest and investment in hydrogen technology as another tool to produce clean power and reduce carbon emissions. The IRA also includes incentives to invest in carbon capture projects and technology. Prior to the passage of this legislation, we had been supporting several customers as they pursued hydrogen and/or carbon capture projects and believe the IRA will further encourage a broader set of current and potential customers to accelerate their pursuit of opportunities around these technologies. As we discussed at our Investor Day earlier this year and as I hope you take away from our comments today, demand for our services is robust across our portfolio and driven by what we believe are long-term, visible and resilient megatrends. We are successfully executing on our strategic initiatives to drive operational excellence, total cost solutions for our clients and value for our stakeholders. We have profitably grown the company and executed well this year and expect to continue to do so. Our strategic initiatives are designed to uniquely position us to not only capitalize on the megatrends of our end markets, but also to enhance our customer relationships and market positioning. Quanta's infrastructure solutions bite the tip of the spear of the energy transition in North America. Our customers are leading the effort to transition towards a lower carbon economy, which industry experts believe could require trillions of dollars of investment in renewable generation, energy storage and great investment, all areas where Quanta is an industry leader. In order to meet the needs of our customers and capitalize on the large and visible opportunities ahead of us, Quanta is investing in resources necessary to do so. We are innovative with our safety, training and recruiting efforts to ensure we have a world-class workforce and adding to and enhancing our operations leadership and management. We are also making and evaluating value-creating acquisitions that further our strategic initiatives and investing capital in equipment and facilities to support organic growth. As a result of our solid year-to-date financial results and continued overall favorable end market drivers, we remain confident in our 2022 consolidated financial expectations. We also believe that our business and opportunities for profitable growth in 2023 are gaining momentum, driven by our solutions-based approach, the growth of programmatic spending with existing and new customers, growing renewable generation activity and opportunities for larger electric transmission projects. We are focused on operating the business for the long term and expect to continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class build leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's base business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's diversity, unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset form the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Jayshree Desai, our CFO, for her review of the third quarter results and 2022 expectations. Jayshree?\nJayshree Desai: Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into the results, I wanted to quickly thank Duke and Derrick for their support last quarter. I'm incredibly excited to expand my leadership role as we deliver against the multiyear plan we laid out at our Investor Day earlier this year. Today, we announced record third quarter revenues of $4.5 billion. Net income attributable to common stock was $156 million or $1.06 per diluted share, and adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure, was a record for the third quarter of $1.77. Our electric power revenues were $2.3 billion, a quarterly record and a 14% increase when compared to the third quarter of 2021. This increase was primarily due to growth in spending by our utility customers on grid modernization and hardening, resulting in increased demand for our electric power services as well as approximately $85 million in revenues attributable to acquired businesses. These increases were partially offset by approximately $175 million in lower emergency restoration services revenues. Electric segment operating income margins in 3Q '22 were 11.2% compared to 12.6% in 3Q '21. The margin reduction is largely attributable to lower emergency restoration service revenues, which were a record level in third quarter of 2021. Also included within our electric segment are our communications operations, which grew over 25% year-over-year. Communications margins in the quarter were mid-single digits, an improvement compared to 3Q '21, and we remain on pace for upper single-digit to double-digit margins for the year. Renewable Energy Infrastructure segment revenues for 3Q '22 were $979 million, a substantial increase from 3Q '21 primarily due to $480 million in revenues attributable to acquired businesses. Operating income margins in 3Q '22 were 9.1% compared to 10.8% in 3Q '21. The margin reduction is due to normal project variability and a change in the mix of work as a result of the acquisitions, but otherwise was in line with our expectations. Revenues, however, came in lower than we were anticipating, driven by continued supply chain challenges as we alluded to on last quarter's call. Underground Utility and Infrastructure segment revenues were $1.2 billion for the quarter, 17% higher than 3Q '21, reflecting increased demand from our gas utility and industrial customers as well as an increased contribution from larger pipeline projects. Operating income margins for the segment were 8.5%, resulting from the solid performance by our base business activities, notably gas distribution and industrial services, and the impact of a favorable project closeout. Below the line, we recorded an unrealized loss of $26.5 million associated with our common equity interest in fixed wireless broadband technology provider Starry Group Holdings. As required, we remeasure the fair value of this investment based on the market price of the publicly traded company stock as of September 30, 2022. At that time, our investment had a fair value of approximately $15 million. Although there has been further deterioration in Starry's equity value, we remain committed to our partnership with Starry to provide high-speed, affordable Internet access to underserved markets. Our total backlog was a record $20.9 billion, an increase of $1 billion compared to last quarter. The increase is primarily attributable to additional awards and an increase in expected volumes under MSAs. Our 12-month backlog is also at a record level of $12.4 billion, which we believe is another indicator of the steady, growing demand for our base business solutions. We remain confident in our ability to capitalize on opportunities that can lead to new record levels of backlog in subsequent quarters. For the third quarter of 2022, we had free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, of $256 million compared to $40 million of negative free cash flow in 3Q '21. The strong free cash flow for the quarter was led by the collection of a significant portion of the receivables associated with the large Canadian electric transmission project that we've discussed in prior quarters. Regarding the other Canadian renewable transmission project that we've discussed in prior quarters, we continue to work with the customer to address the contract asset balance. Discussions with the customer are progressing, and we remain confident in our cost position. The resolution of certain of these amounts will likely extend beyond this year and will continue to impact cash flow and DSO in the near term. DSO measured 81 days for the third quarter of 2022, a decrease of 8 days compared to the third quarter of 2021. The decrease was primarily due to the aforementioned collection associated with the large Canadian electrical transmission project as well as the favorable impact of the acquisition of Blattner, which historically operates with a lower DSO than certain of our other larger operating companies. As of September 30, 2022, we had total liquidity of approximately $1.8 billion and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5 as calculated on our credit agreement. As of October 31, 2022, we had repurchased approximately $127 million of our common stock since the beginning of the year, and as we mentioned in today's release, we continue to identify and execute on strategic acquisitions. Also of note, during the quarter, we commenced a commercial paper program, which is backstopped by our credit facility and allows for up to $1 billion of borrowings outstanding at any time. The program provides access to short-term borrowings at a cost below our existing credit facility rates. We expect continued earnings growth and cash generation to support our ability to efficiently delever over the coming quarters while continuing to create stockholder value through incremental capital deployment. Turning to our guidance. We've executed nicely through the first 9 months of the year, and as we close out 2022, we remain confident in our ability to execute within a tightened range of our previous expectations. However, the composition of our revenue and earnings continues to shift somewhat as we react to certain factors impacting our end markets. Overall, we believe our ability to deliver against our plan reflects the benefit and strength of our portfolio of solutions. Demand for the services across our electric segment remain robust, and we now expect revenues to range between $8.8 billion and $8.9 billion, a $300 million increase from our previous range. With respect to segment margins, it's important to note that the second half of both 2020 and 2021 had significant emergency restoration revenues, which contributed favorably to margins in those periods. As it stands today, we expect 2022 emergency restoration revenues to be around $300 million for the year, over 30% lower than prior year levels. Despite this reduction, margins are expected to be at double-digit levels, ranging between 10.6% and 10.8%, consistent with our previous guidance. Regarding our renewables segment, on last quarter's call, we raised our expectations for the segment with a view that the anti-circumvention moratorium would revitalize solar construction activities in the second half of the year. Unfortunately, panel delays due to other tariff dynamics persisted and remain problematic today. Additionally, owners are reviewing and repositioning their project pipelines in light of the positive changes in the Inflation Reduction Act, or the IRA. The combination of these dynamics resulted in several projects pushing out of 2022 and into 2023. In light of those near-term delays, we now expect full year revenues for the segment to be around $3.8 billion, a $300 million reduction from the previous midpoint. The revenue reduction has also pressured margins as we continue to invest in the resources required to execute on the growth opportunity in 2023 and beyond. For the year, we now expect segment margins to range between 8.5% and 8.75%. Despite the delays in 2022, we remain confident in our 5-year outlook for Blattner and believe that the passage of the IRA both accelerates and extends the growth opportunity associated with renewable energy infrastructure. Our underground segment has performed well over the first 3 quarters, and we now expect full year revenues for the segment to range between $4.2 billion and $4.3 billion. The strong year-to-date performance was led by our industrial services, which delivered significantly improved results following 2 challenging years across their end markets. However, we expect a pullback in industrial activity in the fourth quarter driven by reduced scopes of work as refiners defer maintenance efforts to capitalize on current market conditions. With this expected reduction, we now see segment margins ranging between 7% and 7.25% for the year. In the aggregate, our consolidated expectations for full year diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock are now expected to range between $3.19 and $3.43 and full year adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock, a non-GAAP financial measure, to range between $6.15 and $6.39. Additionally, we now expect adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, to range between $1.65 billion and $1.70 billion for the year. We expect free cash flow for the year to range between $600 million to $700 million, narrowing around our previous midpoint. This free cash flow range represents 35% to 40% of our expected adjusted EBITDA, consistent with our previous guidance of cash generation during periods of double-digit revenue growth rates. For quarterly commentary and additional details on our financial expectations, please refer to our outlook summary, which can be found in the Financial Info section of our IR website at quantaservices.com. From a long-term perspective, our end markets continue to strengthen, with utilities investing heavily in grid hardening and modernization and North America investing in the infrastructure required to deliver a carbon-neutral future. We believe we are uniquely positioned to deliver comprehensive solutions to the markets we serve and continue to have the opportunity to deliver significant stockholder value through organic growth and strategic capital deployment. I'll now turn back to the operator for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question today is coming from Andy Kaplowitz of Citigroup.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Maybe just starting with the bigger picture question. Could you elaborate on your comments regarding significant backlog growth as the company enters '23 that should support your expectations for profitable growth next year? How would you characterize your visibility at this point in the year for next year's potential bookings and EPS? I think you've guided longer term to 7% to 10% organic growth, double-digit EPS. Any reason to think that you couldn't do that despite the recession fears that are out there?\nDuke Austin: Thanks. When we look at it, when we look at the business long term, we stand by our adjusted 10% EPS growth using all levers of the balance sheet. We still remain confident on that. What I would say is based on what we see today, we believe those metrics move in, we see more business quicker. We continue to see all aspects, all macro markets, kind of the megatrends that we talked about in our Investor Day coming to fruition here. And when we look at backlog, when we look at what's in front of us, we see significant growth. I don't know how else to say it. It's significant. And I think it will continue, and our backlog will continue to set records. So that's what we see. We see it long term. We're looking into '24, '25. The company has great visibility against these macro markets and trends.\nAndy Kaplowitz: That's great to hear, Duke. And then Duke or Jayshree, can you give more color regarding what you're seeing across your renewables markets? Obviously, Jayshree, you just mentioned you're lowering revenue a little bit for the year, but your backlog is up. Have you started to see your customers get their act together in solar? Because I think they do have relatively robust plans. And then maybe you could give us more detail regarding what you're seeing in wind.\nDuke Austin: Yes. I'll give you a little bit on renewables, and Jayshree will follow up. But I think what we see is clarity against the long-term PTC with the IRA. That said, as you see it today, you're still trying to get clarity against what it means. So while you see it long term, there's still interactions ongoing with your panels basically. And so as those panels -- or you're getting manufacturing capacity, you get clarity long term, your developers get clarity long term and you get longer-term PPAs. So it causes some issues. I would say, as we sit today, we would -- I would give you an example. We have 6 projects that we're waiting on panels. Everything else is done. And so it just causes some intermittency in the supply chain and in the work from a production standpoint. That said, we think that plays out fairly quickly here as we move into '23, but I'll let Jayshree comment on the rest.\nJayshree Desai: Yes. I think -- Andy, thanks for the question. I would echo what Duke is saying. We do believe that these short-term issues around supply chain, as Duke talked about on the solar panels, has delayed some projects. But the longer-term view from developers is very optimistic and exciting given the passage of the IRA. It gives what the industry has wanted for decades, which is long-term visibility in the ability to invest and grow in both the solar and wind space. So we are -- we do believe that as we -- as you pointed out, our backlog is starting to pick up on renewables. We do believe that we'll start accelerating here over the next several months, and we are very confident in our long-term outlook for the segment. I will say -- you asked about wind. I do think the IRA has been very positive for the long-term aspects for wind. I do think in the near term, solar, the IRA does provide even greater incentives to make solar that much more competitive. So it will take a little bit for wind to ramp up. I see it definitely ramping up in the latter half of the decade given all the benefits that -- passing the IRA, but it will take a little bit of that time for the developers to restock their wind pipeline and be competitive against the near-term solar projects.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Adam Thalhimer of Thompson, Davis.\nAdam Thalhimer: I just wanted to ask, Duke, about the carbon capture opportunity. What are some of the individual projects that you're seeing? And when could that revenue actually hit?\nDuke Austin: Yes. I mean we're in discussions constantly on carbon capture or hydrogen. It's very difficult on those type projects when you're crossing linear construction, you get permitting. And while we're talking about it, honestly, I really don't think about them. If they come, I believe those are those kind of plus 10% type things we talked about as megatrends. We'll view them as that. But the customer base that's building that is a very good customer base. So we have very good contacts with -- and we're certainly right in the middle of every one of those projects at the very front end. So we took a very long approach to hydrogen, long approach to carbon capture. We built carbon capture lines before. It's not -- it's the same in my mind as it is anything else. When you building pipe, you're building pipe, So whether it's water or carbon, whatever it may be, gas, we can build it. And I think our ability to do so efficiently and work collaboratively with the developers and our carriers make sense, and we'll continue to do that.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Justin Hauke of Robert W. Baird.\nJustin Hauke: I guess I wanted to ask just on the underground segment because it's been so strong in the last couple of quarters, at least kind of relative to your expectations. I know you talked about an earnout there. And I guess I was just hoping to clarify that and maybe just -- maybe level set. So as we think about '23 and the margin expectations or potential for that segment, just how material was that in the quarter?\nDuke Austin: Yes. I'm not sure about the earnout. We -- I'm not -- we had an acquisition. That's all that I'm aware of. There may be a small earnout somewhere, I don't know. I'm not familiar. I don't think, Jayshree...\nJayshree Desai: No, I'm not sure what you're referring to on the earnout. But -- go ahead.\nDuke Austin: So I think one thing that was a comment, we did have a small release there or a release there in the quarter on some contingency. So that could have been what you saw. That was done, and we had contemplated that as we move forward. We take a pretty conservative approach to all of our projects. And when things come through, they come through. So that's certainly the way we risk base our project work and -- project work going forward. The main thing I would say is underneath, we're getting operating leverage by a portfolio approach across the company, as we said we would. We said that we can -- believe we can deliver at upper single digits in the segment. We're continuing to do that through operating leverage. So I'm really proud of that as a company, and this portfolio that we're putting up now is allowing us to pull through, to work through any kind of issues across the board for the most part on our macro markets, whether it be supply chain, tariffs. Whatever it may be, we can work through that through the portfolio as we've discussed before.\nJustin Hauke: Okay. Yes, that was what I was referring to. I guess my second question, so obviously, it was good to see the free cash flow come in, and I know you guys talked about that. The AR that's tied up on the remaining Canadian renewable project that you guys are seeing is probably a '23 resolution. How material is that? Or how big is the collections associated with that? And is that project done? Or is that going to continue to progressively build until that's resolved next year?\nDuke Austin: Yes. I'll give you some color, and I'll let Jayshree clarify the amount. We talked about last quarter, Canadian project, one of them we've completed and worked through the claims. The second one is ongoing. So we're working through that. We'll finish in the second half of '23. I believe we'll make progress against our AR across as we start to complete milestones, as we start to get through documentation. It's a typical Canadian project, big project, takes a lot of documentation. And so we're definitely doing that now, and we expect to -- when I think about it from a sequence standpoint, we'll have multiple collections throughout and then work through the final there at the second half of next year. But we're making great progress with a collaborative approach. There's no issues, and I believe we take a conservative approach to all of our claims. And I'll let Jayshree comment on the amounts.\nJayshree Desai: Yes. I think we talked about this in the last quarter's call that the impact of the Canadian project is affecting our DSOs around 5 to 6 days. That's still what we're seeing today. And as Duke talked about, we baked that into our forecast for the year, and we believe that going forward, we'll be working through that for the rest of the year, and we'll be able to make some progress around that as the project commences.\nDuke Austin: And I would say, I was thinking through that earlier, just -- we're just not a litigious company. We get our stuff upfront, we build, we execute and we move forward. And then any kind of -- when we say claims or things like that, it's typically a collaborative process, and it's just not litigious.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Alex Rygiel of B. Riley.\nAlex Rygiel: A very nice quarter. A couple of quick questions here. To some degree, your business is driven directly by overall economic activity such as new home construction and whatnot. Can you address this and your thoughts on how an economic slowdown moving forward could impact your business?\nDuke Austin: I would say, in general, the economic slowdown always impacts your new builds, your kind of new construction. Small piece of the business at this point, when you look at what's happening to modernize the grids and infrastructure, it doesn't rely so much on your economics. Again, it does from an interest standpoint at times, you could see some areas of constraint. But the way that carbon capture, batteries, EV, the way that, that's coming to market, it's different than it's ever been in the utility industry as well as all the renewable industries. If we're moving at a pace that we're moving towards a carbon-free footprint, your manufacturers of vehicles, chip manufacturing, the load growth that you're seeing will not allow a stop at this point unless there's significant change in the way we view carbon. And I don't see that happening. We have long-term outlooks. I mean we're looking at '24 or '25. While it might slow down a little bit, the offsets are much, much greater than any kind of economic offset at this point.\nAlex Rygiel: Very helpful. And then as it relates to inflation, obviously, you've been fighting some inflation over the last 12 months. I feel like we might be on the back side of that curve. So how do you think about inflation in 2023 versus 2022? Clearly, it looks like fuel could help you out a lot -- a little bit, maybe some incremental headwind from labor, but I'd appreciate your comments.\nDuke Austin: Yes. I do think it helps. But what really -- the impacts are supply chain driven, such as transformers, for example, very difficult year for transformers, and that manufacturing capacity needs to move up. So we're seeing some of that come in. It's those kind of things that -- where work can get sequenced and normal cadence, it gives us more problems than any kind of inflationary impact. So I do believe we're starting to see those things get past us. I do think in '23, we'll work through the transformer supply issues. Your large AC/DC transformers are also an issue long term as you see the queues move up. I think the bigger clients, our bigger customers have it under control. The smaller ones are working through it. So just -- those kind of things, where your production and your -- we're growing over 1,000 employees a quarter at this point. That growth against not a normal cadence in supply chain does give you a little bit of issues at times. And the company has done a phenomenal job. Our guys and men and women in the field has done phenomenal working through any of those issues and stayed in a collaborative manner with the client.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Noelle Dilts of Stifel.\nNoelle Dilts: Kind of piggybacking off of that, Alex' second question. I'm curious if you've been able to make an estimate or sort of quantify how much you think the supply chain disruption has impacted margins this year. Basically trying to get a sense of how to think about how some of that might reverse as we get into '23 and the opportunity for margin expansion.\nDuke Austin: Thanks, Noelle. I would just say, in general, it's caused us issues. I can't really quantify it. I mean I think our margins are good. Can we do better? Yes. Is there some small issues? Yes. But I do think those things, it's mainly the growth against your employee base against the intermittency of supply chain coming in. It's those 2 things where they're not perfectly aligned where normally you would build against what you know from a supply chain standpoint, that -- the unknown and the pushout of 30 days, 60 days type things give you issues. So I think it's hard to quantify that in my mind, Noelle. I don't think anyone can. I would just say as an industry, we've been able to overcome it for the most part, and there is some upside if we get this thing resolved.\nNoelle Dilts: Okay. And then quickly, I think last call, we discussed how much you're -- what you're looking at in terms of wage rate increases. I think it was kind of mid-single digits for 2023. Is that still looking like the right level?\nDuke Austin: Yes. I mean we bake in 3.5% to 5%. So you're probably on the upper end when you go through it now. And we typically are in multiyear agreements across the board. So I'm not too concerned with that.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Sean Eastman of KeyBanc.\nSean Eastman: Nice quarter. I wanted to come back to the renewable revenue discussion and just this project timing element. Are you guys essentially messaging that renewables -- the renewables revenue trajectory should be pretty outsized perhaps relative to that targeted range as we go into next year based on these timing elements? And I'm just curious about the line of sight there relative to what you're seeing in the supply chain.\nDuke Austin: Not willing to give '23 guidance at this point. But what I would tell you is that what we see is a long-term robust market. We talked about Blattner having $3.5 billion in 2026. I believe that's pulled in. The exact timing on it, I'm not confident at this point. I got 4, 5 months here to get my head around '23. So I'm going to take every bit of it. That said, I would say the inbound calls, what we see, our pipelines, our growth trajectory across that segment, not just Blattner, is robust, probably the best I've seen in my time frame, in my career on a macro market. It's there. We're in early stages of an energy transition. We're sitting at the tip of the spear. And when you're there and you see it, you see it every day, the growth -- we're in '24 or 25. And we're not used to being out that far with our clients, trying to make sure that we can meet the demand of the industry. And I do believe we're doing a nice job of doing so. Once you get through the cadence on how quickly panels can get to the U.S. or how quickly the panel issue can get resolved in a meaningful way, not just American may, but in a meaningful way, and we have a good cadence on that, it's certainly much, much easier to give you commentary against it. So while the macro market's there and we could say outsized growth -- I don't know what the IRA and the way that it's interpreted at this point -- going forward in '23, I don't know yet. So until I can figure that out, I can't really give you good guidance on it other than to say it's robust. It's just a matter of how much plus-plus.\nSean Eastman: Okay. And then on the electric power margins, just this dynamic of now there being a sequential step-up from 3Q to 4Q. I assume that's the storm dynamic. Maybe you could talk about that a little bit. And then also just the outer year target, the midpoint is 11%. The midpoint of this year's guidance is intact at 10.7%. Just kind of understanding what that 30 basis points is would be helpful as well.\nDuke Austin: I mean I think it's a couple of things ongoing. You have a storm year-over-year going on that's -- we're probably at $300 million versus $500-something million, $600-something million year-over-year. So you're down $200 million plus-plus, give or take, year-over-year as we have guided, which it does -- when you have those large storms in multiyears, it does give you some utilizations and things like that, which increases. That's one thing. The second thing is, as I've discussed earlier, when you're building people and you have 1,000 people per quarter you're training and you're putting out in the field, that against the supply chain disruptions doesn't allow you to be as efficient. And so you're having some disruption, but it's not -- to me, we're building out long-term relationships with clients, and we're not going to nickel and dime our clients against that growth. So yes, there is some pullback on that type of dynamic, but I do believe we're starting to see those things normalize as we move forward into next year.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse.\nJamie Cook: Nice quarter. I guess 2 questions. One, in the context of -- you guys like to talk about base earnings. If I look at your implied earnings in the back half of the year, like just the run rate, it's like $170 million a quarter, which implies -- you multiply that by 4, $680 million is a good base to think about. I'm just wondering if that's a good base to think about earnings, the base of earnings for 2023, just given the run rate off of the back half of the year and that it's -- you don't have a lot of big, large projects that are rolling off or anything. So that's my first question, just trying to frame 2023. My second question, Duke, on Blattner, just trying to understand where you are in terms of potentially diversifying the customer base and/or as you're aligning -- as you're talking to customers more, shifting that business model from a less of a CapEx one-off project to more of a -- your aligning with their sort of longer-term CapEx plans, where we are on that basis.\nDuke Austin: Thanks, Jamie. First one, we're not going to give 2023 guidance, but like theoretically, I'm not arguing with you. I just don't know, it might be better, it might be worse. So that said...\nJamie Cook: But my math isn't totally off?\nDuke Austin: It's somewhere in the neighborhood. So I can't see it. I'm not sitting here on a piece of paper -- I'm not going to give you guidance, but I would say your math is somewhere in there, plus or minus.\nJamie Cook: Because I was a math major in college. So that's good.\nDuke Austin: I'm not jumping up and down, saying no, you're totally wrong, I won't say that. But I'm not giving you guidance, too. Okay. So that said -- no, on Blattner, when we look at it, I do believe those relationships long term, and that collaboration has gotten stronger as the demand has gotten greater because the client base is the larger clients in the industry. So as they either buy developments or they're looking long term and when their stated goals are very large, we need to be right in the middle of that long term. So -- and also how we look at interconnections queues, what can we do at the queue level from utilities, how do we help, how do we provide those solutions. I mean I think the company has really moved forward with those synergies over the past 6 months with Blattner, and they've integrated very nicely. I like where we sit, and I do think it's going to provide unique opportunities as we move forward.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Steven Fisher of UBS.\nSteven Fisher: Just wanted to follow up on the backlog growth commentary. How broadly do you expect that backlog growth comment to apply across your segments? And then kind of what's the timing of that? Is that -- are you expecting as soon as the fourth quarter? Or when you say into '23, that's -- you're talking more about sort of like the first half of 2023?\nDuke Austin: I can't give you exact timing. It's just we see it. It's there. It's coming. We're not going to pin ourselves down on exactly when, but I would say we see the significant growth throughout '23 as well as earlier. Some of the things that we're looking at now are earlier rather than later, but we also see things that are later as well. So I just think overall, when I said significant, we have significant projects, significant MSAs that are imminent for us in the first half of '23. So -- or the fourth quarter. I can't -- I'm not going to pin it down, but I can see it. I'm willing to say significant and talk about it, and that's not normal, obviously.\nSteven Fisher: And was that across your segments? Or is that mainly focused on the electric side?\nDuke Austin: I see broad-based growth.\nSteven Fisher: Okay. And then if I could just follow up on Sean's question on the renewables visibility. I know, Duke, you want to take as much as -- time as you can, the full 4 or 5 months, you said, before commenting on the full year. But I just -- I'm curious if there's anything you can say about how well you sense your customer base is set up in renewables for the first half of 2023. Have they kind of given you indication of what projects they have slated for that time frame and how well they have availability of panels just for the first half, at least?\nDuke Austin: It's not about like the projects. It's not the LNTPs. It's not the verbal awards. It's not the awards. It's clarity against the IRA. And what does it say, what exactly does it mean on panels, that clarity needs to happen. And you have just a backlog of panel deliveries, things of that nature on the solar side that has caused some disruption. And I think when you look at that against the backdrop of the jobs, the market, it's -- we can't give you clarity until we have it. So we need the clarity on the IRA and what that means against our developers' backlogs. And that said, the work and the jobs and our ability to perform them are there. So we're just basically waiting to get those kind -- that kind of clarity long term. But once we get it, I do think I said it in the call, there's some backlog that didn't happen in '23 from '22 that will go in '23. And then the outsized demand in '23 will come in. And so I do think it -- you have some in the first half, but the back half will be robust into '24 and '25.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Michael Dudas of Vertical Research Partners.\nMichael Dudas: Duke, you highlighted in your prepared remarks about some -- seems like good progress on the telecommunications side. Can you maybe elaborate, as we look into 2023, what are some of the puts and takes that you guys are seeing? Is the industry getting cadence and spending moving forward? And the targets that you put out generally, are they still appropriate for what we're looking at over the next couple of years to get that business to where you want it to be?\nDuke Austin: Yes. I mean I think we grow the business double digits plus. We continue to do so. We like where we sit. I don't -- I've said it before, we've invested in that organically. It's been a nice business, very little acquisition. I do think there's opportunities there long term for growth. What I would say, it's not regulated, and it's not predictable. And so I worry with the predictability of telecom. That said, the RDOF money, the monies that are out there, the amount of bandwidth necessary for growth in this economy, whether you look at self-driving vehicles, small cells, it doesn't matter, 5G, that's there, and it will continue to drive demand against the services we provide for the infrastructure. So the macro markets there, the timing of which is always moving around due to the nature of the business. So we're optimistic, but we will take a cautious approach on how we look at it, but double digits growth is there.\nMichael Dudas: And on the margin side and utilization?\nDuke Austin: I mean we can operate at parity. We're very close now. If not, in the next year, we should operate at double digits on a go-forward basis. But I would say -- I've said this before, the company in that market, we leverage our assets against gas, against underground electric. It doesn't matter. So the portfolio itself, if it means go do gas work at higher margins, that's what we're going to do. If it means go do underground electric at higher margins, that's what we're going to do. It would offset some of the telecom, but the overall company would rise. So I'm not too concerned with the margins at one single telecom, for example.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Gus Richard of Northland.\nGus Richard: Just on the underground utilities. Is some of the strength coming from LNG? And in terms of the IRA, is there some provisions where you're going to see increase in pipeline work?\nDuke Austin: I mean I think when you look at the gas market, LNG market across the globe, you see tremendous amount of demand, not only war driven, but in Europe and things like that. So I do believe you'll start to see some pipe to feed LNG. Also I think your carbon capture pipe will be there. That's certainly something that's new. Your hydrogen, there's a lot of money in the IRA against hydrogen, the development thereof. So that's there as well. It's still difficult to get permit, a piece of pipe. It just is. And the company has been in that many, many times. And I would say all that would be upside for us. We're thinking about it. We're on it. We're in front of it. Can I guide to it? No.\nGus Richard: Got it. And then just in terms of the refiners, how long can they hold their breath on maintenance?\nDuke Austin: We saw some maintenance early in the year, a lot of replacements, things of that nature. I do believe that you'll start to see that same kind of sequence in the first half of next year. You'll see some maintenance and things of that nature start to happen. They're going to run them as long as they can in high markets, and they'll see a bunch of maintenance. But I do believe the view there is longer than people think. Your 20, 30 years of refining capacity that you still are going to have to think about. So I don't think it's short term in nature. I think it's longer term. And we will see the plants that are in existence run longer. That said, they'll take more maintenance.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this brings us to the end of the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Duke Austin for closing comments.\nDuke Austin: Yes. I want to thank our men and women in the field, a couple of storms, tough environments, they performed really, really well, safety. And what they give for us every day, families -- being away from their families doesn't go unnoticed to us management team. I want to thank Jayshree for her first call, and I'm sure the stock is going through the roof. That said, I want to thank you for your participation. This concludes the call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's event. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and enjoy the rest of your day.",

            "name": "Duke Austin",
            "content": "Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today, I will provide operational and strategic commentary, and we'll then turn it over to Jayshree Desai, Quanta's CFO, to provide a review of our third quarter results and full year 2022 financial expectations. Following Jayshree's comments, we welcome your questions. This morning, we reported our third quarter results, which continue to reflect strong demand for our services and solid execution. We believe the results highlight the benefits of our diverse, repeatable and sustainable earnings streams and our ability to successfully leverage our portfolio approach in managing our service lines. Our third quarter results include a number of record financial metrics, including revenues, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. Additionally, total backlog of $20.9 billion was a record and is considerably higher than the same period last year. Notably, we also see the opportunity to significantly increase backlog as we move into 2023. Our Electric Power Infrastructure Solutions segment continued to perform well with record revenues and solid margins. We achieved these results despite some delays caused by ongoing supply chain challenges that led to resource imbalances and utilization inefficiencies. As we commented on our second quarter earnings call, these supply chain challenges are not causing meaningful delays in our overall utility capital spending that we are seeing, and we believe these dynamics are shorter term conditions that should be resolved over the coming quarters. Demand for our services continues to be driven by broad-based business strength from utility grid modernization and system hardening initiatives, as well as our reputation for solid and safe execution. Overall, our electric power outlook remains strong, driven primarily by increasing service line opportunities and market share gains for our base business. Quanta deployed emergency response resources to utility customers for 2 hurricanes late in the third quarter. Hurricane Fiona made landfall in Puerto Rico and damaged 50% of the island's distribution feeders, 30% of its transmission lines and submerged 7 substations. Quanta sent more than 200 skilled line workers to the island to support LUMA's restoration efforts and has strategically prepositioned a fleet of trucks and equipment on the island prior to the storm, which allowed us to quickly respond when the hurricane hit. While the fragile state of the island's existing power grid and the heavy rain and flooding from the hurricane made restoration efforts more challenging, LUMA still managed to return power to more than 90% of its customers in less than 2 weeks. We are proud of the way LUMA responded to this event, which was much faster than previous storm responses by prior grid operators and comparable to, if not better, than restoration times following major hurricanes in the mainland United States. At the end of the third quarter, Hurricane Ian made landfall in Florida as a large and destructive category 4 hurricane, which left more than 3 million customers across the Southeast United States without power. Quanta deployed significant resources to support utility customers whose electrical power infrastructure was damaged or destroyed by the hurricane, including more than 3,500 line workers and front-end support services staff from 18 different Quanta operating companies. Although restoration efforts for Hurricane Ian were largely a fourth quarter event, we believe our industry-leading, comprehensive emergency restoration capabilities highlights our ability to rapidly mobilize substantial resources to support our customers in times of need. Importantly, the system hardening investments that Florida utilities have made over the past 10 years proved beneficial during Hurricane Ian and enhanced the ability to restore power to many customers after the first full day of restoration efforts. We believe Florida's leading role in system hardening and its demonstrated benefits will serve as a model for utilities and regulators throughout the country as they plan and implement their own hardening programs. It was a little more than a year ago that we closed the acquisition of Blattner, and I can tell you that we are more excited about the key drivers of the transaction now than we were then, including the value proposition to our customers, the multiyear growth opportunities available to us and the strong operational and cultural fit between the organizations. Since closing, we have largely completed integration. Our teams are working collaboratively. We have enhanced existing customer relationships and created new ones. We are jointly pursuing project opportunities that leverage our expertise and industry-leading position. We have accomplished a great deal with Blattner over the last year, but more importantly, we believe we are just getting started. Our Renewable Infrastructure Solutions segment performed well overall during the third quarter, led by solid performance on high voltage transmission, substation and interconnection work. The utility-scale solar industry faced increased levels of supply chain delays during the third quarter, which impacted our revenues, but our operations managed through these dynamics. We are optimistic that these conditions are shorter term in duration and will resolve themselves over the coming quarters. We continue to collaborate closely with our customers on our renewable build plans for 2023 and beyond. While still early in the process, we are beginning to see a more normalized cadence with respect to limited notices to proceed for renewable projects moving to contract in 2023 as well as forward movement on projects that were delayed in 2022 that are now slated to be built in 2023. According to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, there are approximately 1,400 gigawatts of proposed generation, mostly wind and solar, and energy storage projects that are actively seeking interconnection to the U.S. power grid. These create both opportunities and challenges for our customers, and demand for Quanta's comprehensive solutions and collaborative delivery model is increasing as a result. Further, there are several large renewable energy-related high-voltage electric transmission project opportunities that we are pursuing, which we believe we are well positioned for and could be awarded over the coming months. Furthermore, this past August, the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, was signed into law. It includes nearly $400 billion of tax incentives and financial support designed to accelerate the country's energy transition to a low-carbon economy. This legislation is considered by many to be the nation's most ambitious legislative action ever taken on climate, which we believe should have a meaningful positive effect on a number of our end markets for at least the next decade. In particular, we believe the IRA will drive investment in the development and construction of utility-scale renewable generation facilities and the transmission and substation infrastructure required to support them. Additionally, there are attractive financial incentives in the IRA to expand domestic manufacturing of key renewable energy components such as solar panels. This could reduce the country's reliance on overseas manufacturers and, in turn, reduce supply chain risk by ensuring domestic product availability to meet the growing demand for renewable generation development in the United States. These are just some of the dynamics that give us a high degree of confidence in our ability to meet or exceed long-term growth and earnings targets. Our Underground and Utility Infrastructure Solutions segment continues to perform at a high level. Revenues grew strongly, and margins demonstrate solid execution across our operations in the segment. Our industrial services operation continue to execute very well and experienced robust demand as capital spending resumed and pent-up activity from 2 years of deferred maintenance moved forward. We also continue to experience solid demand for our gas utility and pipeline integrity operations, which are executing well and are driven by regulated spend to modernize systems, reduce methane emissions, ensure environmental compliance and improve safety and reliability. For several quarters on our earnings calls, we have discussed our views about the emerging opportunities within the segment that center around the evolving and increasing efforts of our customers' strategies to reduce their carbon footprint and diversify their operations and assets toward greener business opportunities. To that end, the IRA includes incentives that are designed to support and accelerate certain technologies as part of the energy transition for the traditional energy and industrial industries. For example, there are significant production tax credits for clean hydrogen that can make the energy source cost competitive today, which is expected to accelerate interest and investment in hydrogen technology as another tool to produce clean power and reduce carbon emissions. The IRA also includes incentives to invest in carbon capture projects and technology. Prior to the passage of this legislation, we had been supporting several customers as they pursued hydrogen and/or carbon capture projects and believe the IRA will further encourage a broader set of current and potential customers to accelerate their pursuit of opportunities around these technologies. As we discussed at our Investor Day earlier this year and as I hope you take away from our comments today, demand for our services is robust across our portfolio and driven by what we believe are long-term, visible and resilient megatrends. We are successfully executing on our strategic initiatives to drive operational excellence, total cost solutions for our clients and value for our stakeholders. We have profitably grown the company and executed well this year and expect to continue to do so. Our strategic initiatives are designed to uniquely position us to not only capitalize on the megatrends of our end markets, but also to enhance our customer relationships and market positioning. Quanta's infrastructure solutions bite the tip of the spear of the energy transition in North America. Our customers are leading the effort to transition towards a lower carbon economy, which industry experts believe could require trillions of dollars of investment in renewable generation, energy storage and great investment, all areas where Quanta is an industry leader. In order to meet the needs of our customers and capitalize on the large and visible opportunities ahead of us, Quanta is investing in resources necessary to do so. We are innovative with our safety, training and recruiting efforts to ensure we have a world-class workforce and adding to and enhancing our operations leadership and management. We are also making and evaluating value-creating acquisitions that further our strategic initiatives and investing capital in equipment and facilities to support organic growth. As a result of our solid year-to-date financial results and continued overall favorable end market drivers, we remain confident in our 2022 consolidated financial expectations. We also believe that our business and opportunities for profitable growth in 2023 are gaining momentum, driven by our solutions-based approach, the growth of programmatic spending with existing and new customers, growing renewable generation activity and opportunities for larger electric transmission projects. We are focused on operating the business for the long term and expect to continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class build leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's base business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's diversity, unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset form the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Jayshree Desai, our CFO, for her review of the third quarter results and 2022 expectations. Jayshree? Thanks. When we look at it, when we look at the business long term, we stand by our adjusted 10% EPS growth using all levers of the balance sheet. We still remain confident on that. What I would say is based on what we see today, we believe those metrics move in, we see more business quicker. We continue to see all aspects, all macro markets, kind of the megatrends that we talked about in our Investor Day coming to fruition here. And when we look at backlog, when we look at what's in front of us, we see significant growth. I don't know how else to say it. It's significant. And I think it will continue, and our backlog will continue to set records. So that's what we see. We see it long term. We're looking into '24, '25. The company has great visibility against these macro markets and trends. Yes. I'll give you a little bit on renewables, and Jayshree will follow up. But I think what we see is clarity against the long-term PTC with the IRA. That said, as you see it today, you're still trying to get clarity against what it means. So while you see it long term, there's still interactions ongoing with your panels basically. And so as those panels -- or you're getting manufacturing capacity, you get clarity long term, your developers get clarity long term and you get longer-term PPAs. So it causes some issues. I would say, as we sit today, we would -- I would give you an example. We have 6 projects that we're waiting on panels. Everything else is done. And so it just causes some intermittency in the supply chain and in the work from a production standpoint. That said, we think that plays out fairly quickly here as we move into '23, but I'll let Jayshree comment on the rest. Yes. I mean we're in discussions constantly on carbon capture or hydrogen. It's very difficult on those type projects when you're crossing linear construction, you get permitting. And while we're talking about it, honestly, I really don't think about them. If they come, I believe those are those kind of plus 10% type things we talked about as megatrends. We'll view them as that. But the customer base that's building that is a very good customer base. So we have very good contacts with -- and we're certainly right in the middle of every one of those projects at the very front end. So we took a very long approach to hydrogen, long approach to carbon capture. We built carbon capture lines before. It's not -- it's the same in my mind as it is anything else. When you building pipe, you're building pipe, So whether it's water or carbon, whatever it may be, gas, we can build it. And I think our ability to do so efficiently and work collaboratively with the developers and our carriers make sense, and we'll continue to do that. Yes. I'm not sure about the earnout. We -- I'm not -- we had an acquisition. That's all that I'm aware of. There may be a small earnout somewhere, I don't know. I'm not familiar. I don't think, Jayshree... So I think one thing that was a comment, we did have a small release there or a release there in the quarter on some contingency. So that could have been what you saw. That was done, and we had contemplated that as we move forward. We take a pretty conservative approach to all of our projects. And when things come through, they come through. So that's certainly the way we risk base our project work and -- project work going forward. The main thing I would say is underneath, we're getting operating leverage by a portfolio approach across the company, as we said we would. We said that we can -- believe we can deliver at upper single digits in the segment. We're continuing to do that through operating leverage. So I'm really proud of that as a company, and this portfolio that we're putting up now is allowing us to pull through, to work through any kind of issues across the board for the most part on our macro markets, whether it be supply chain, tariffs. Whatever it may be, we can work through that through the portfolio as we've discussed before. Yes. I'll give you some color, and I'll let Jayshree clarify the amount. We talked about last quarter, Canadian project, one of them we've completed and worked through the claims. The second one is ongoing. So we're working through that. We'll finish in the second half of '23. I believe we'll make progress against our AR across as we start to complete milestones, as we start to get through documentation. It's a typical Canadian project, big project, takes a lot of documentation. And so we're definitely doing that now, and we expect to -- when I think about it from a sequence standpoint, we'll have multiple collections throughout and then work through the final there at the second half of next year. But we're making great progress with a collaborative approach. There's no issues, and I believe we take a conservative approach to all of our claims. And I'll let Jayshree comment on the amounts. And I would say, I was thinking through that earlier, just -- we're just not a litigious company. We get our stuff upfront, we build, we execute and we move forward. And then any kind of -- when we say claims or things like that, it's typically a collaborative process, and it's just not litigious. I would say, in general, the economic slowdown always impacts your new builds, your kind of new construction. Small piece of the business at this point, when you look at what's happening to modernize the grids and infrastructure, it doesn't rely so much on your economics. Again, it does from an interest standpoint at times, you could see some areas of constraint. But the way that carbon capture, batteries, EV, the way that, that's coming to market, it's different than it's ever been in the utility industry as well as all the renewable industries. If we're moving at a pace that we're moving towards a carbon-free footprint, your manufacturers of vehicles, chip manufacturing, the load growth that you're seeing will not allow a stop at this point unless there's significant change in the way we view carbon. And I don't see that happening. We have long-term outlooks. I mean we're looking at '24 or '25. While it might slow down a little bit, the offsets are much, much greater than any kind of economic offset at this point. Yes. I do think it helps. But what really -- the impacts are supply chain driven, such as transformers, for example, very difficult year for transformers, and that manufacturing capacity needs to move up. So we're seeing some of that come in. It's those kind of things that -- where work can get sequenced and normal cadence, it gives us more problems than any kind of inflationary impact. So I do believe we're starting to see those things get past us. I do think in '23, we'll work through the transformer supply issues. Your large AC/DC transformers are also an issue long term as you see the queues move up. I think the bigger clients, our bigger customers have it under control. The smaller ones are working through it. So just -- those kind of things, where your production and your -- we're growing over 1,000 employees a quarter at this point. That growth against not a normal cadence in supply chain does give you a little bit of issues at times. And the company has done a phenomenal job. Our guys and men and women in the field has done phenomenal working through any of those issues and stayed in a collaborative manner with the client. Thanks, Noelle. I would just say, in general, it's caused us issues. I can't really quantify it. I mean I think our margins are good. Can we do better? Yes. Is there some small issues? Yes. But I do think those things, it's mainly the growth against your employee base against the intermittency of supply chain coming in. It's those 2 things where they're not perfectly aligned where normally you would build against what you know from a supply chain standpoint, that -- the unknown and the pushout of 30 days, 60 days type things give you issues. So I think it's hard to quantify that in my mind, Noelle. I don't think anyone can. I would just say as an industry, we've been able to overcome it for the most part, and there is some upside if we get this thing resolved. Yes. I mean we bake in 3.5% to 5%. So you're probably on the upper end when you go through it now. And we typically are in multiyear agreements across the board. So I'm not too concerned with that. Not willing to give '23 guidance at this point. But what I would tell you is that what we see is a long-term robust market. We talked about Blattner having $3.5 billion in 2026. I believe that's pulled in. The exact timing on it, I'm not confident at this point. I got 4, 5 months here to get my head around '23. So I'm going to take every bit of it. That said, I would say the inbound calls, what we see, our pipelines, our growth trajectory across that segment, not just Blattner, is robust, probably the best I've seen in my time frame, in my career on a macro market. It's there. We're in early stages of an energy transition. We're sitting at the tip of the spear. And when you're there and you see it, you see it every day, the growth -- we're in '24 or 25. And we're not used to being out that far with our clients, trying to make sure that we can meet the demand of the industry. And I do believe we're doing a nice job of doing so. Once you get through the cadence on how quickly panels can get to the U.S. or how quickly the panel issue can get resolved in a meaningful way, not just American may, but in a meaningful way, and we have a good cadence on that, it's certainly much, much easier to give you commentary against it. So while the macro market's there and we could say outsized growth -- I don't know what the IRA and the way that it's interpreted at this point -- going forward in '23, I don't know yet. So until I can figure that out, I can't really give you good guidance on it other than to say it's robust. It's just a matter of how much plus-plus. I mean I think it's a couple of things ongoing. You have a storm year-over-year going on that's -- we're probably at $300 million versus $500-something million, $600-something million year-over-year. So you're down $200 million plus-plus, give or take, year-over-year as we have guided, which it does -- when you have those large storms in multiyears, it does give you some utilizations and things like that, which increases. That's one thing. The second thing is, as I've discussed earlier, when you're building people and you have 1,000 people per quarter you're training and you're putting out in the field, that against the supply chain disruptions doesn't allow you to be as efficient. And so you're having some disruption, but it's not -- to me, we're building out long-term relationships with clients, and we're not going to nickel and dime our clients against that growth. So yes, there is some pullback on that type of dynamic, but I do believe we're starting to see those things normalize as we move forward into next year. Thanks, Jamie. First one, we're not going to give 2023 guidance, but like theoretically, I'm not arguing with you. I just don't know, it might be better, it might be worse. So that said... It's somewhere in the neighborhood. So I can't see it. I'm not sitting here on a piece of paper -- I'm not going to give you guidance, but I would say your math is somewhere in there, plus or minus. I'm not jumping up and down, saying no, you're totally wrong, I won't say that. But I'm not giving you guidance, too. Okay. So that said -- no, on Blattner, when we look at it, I do believe those relationships long term, and that collaboration has gotten stronger as the demand has gotten greater because the client base is the larger clients in the industry. So as they either buy developments or they're looking long term and when their stated goals are very large, we need to be right in the middle of that long term. So -- and also how we look at interconnections queues, what can we do at the queue level from utilities, how do we help, how do we provide those solutions. I mean I think the company has really moved forward with those synergies over the past 6 months with Blattner, and they've integrated very nicely. I like where we sit, and I do think it's going to provide unique opportunities as we move forward. I can't give you exact timing. It's just we see it. It's there. It's coming. We're not going to pin ourselves down on exactly when, but I would say we see the significant growth throughout '23 as well as earlier. Some of the things that we're looking at now are earlier rather than later, but we also see things that are later as well. So I just think overall, when I said significant, we have significant projects, significant MSAs that are imminent for us in the first half of '23. So -- or the fourth quarter. I can't -- I'm not going to pin it down, but I can see it. I'm willing to say significant and talk about it, and that's not normal, obviously. I see broad-based growth. It's not about like the projects. It's not the LNTPs. It's not the verbal awards. It's not the awards. It's clarity against the IRA. And what does it say, what exactly does it mean on panels, that clarity needs to happen. And you have just a backlog of panel deliveries, things of that nature on the solar side that has caused some disruption. And I think when you look at that against the backdrop of the jobs, the market, it's -- we can't give you clarity until we have it. So we need the clarity on the IRA and what that means against our developers' backlogs. And that said, the work and the jobs and our ability to perform them are there. So we're just basically waiting to get those kind -- that kind of clarity long term. But once we get it, I do think I said it in the call, there's some backlog that didn't happen in '23 from '22 that will go in '23. And then the outsized demand in '23 will come in. And so I do think it -- you have some in the first half, but the back half will be robust into '24 and '25. Yes. I mean I think we grow the business double digits plus. We continue to do so. We like where we sit. I don't -- I've said it before, we've invested in that organically. It's been a nice business, very little acquisition. I do think there's opportunities there long term for growth. What I would say, it's not regulated, and it's not predictable. And so I worry with the predictability of telecom. That said, the RDOF money, the monies that are out there, the amount of bandwidth necessary for growth in this economy, whether you look at self-driving vehicles, small cells, it doesn't matter, 5G, that's there, and it will continue to drive demand against the services we provide for the infrastructure. So the macro markets there, the timing of which is always moving around due to the nature of the business. So we're optimistic, but we will take a cautious approach on how we look at it, but double digits growth is there. I mean we can operate at parity. We're very close now. If not, in the next year, we should operate at double digits on a go-forward basis. But I would say -- I've said this before, the company in that market, we leverage our assets against gas, against underground electric. It doesn't matter. So the portfolio itself, if it means go do gas work at higher margins, that's what we're going to do. If it means go do underground electric at higher margins, that's what we're going to do. It would offset some of the telecom, but the overall company would rise. So I'm not too concerned with the margins at one single telecom, for example. I mean I think when you look at the gas market, LNG market across the globe, you see tremendous amount of demand, not only war driven, but in Europe and things like that. So I do believe you'll start to see some pipe to feed LNG. Also I think your carbon capture pipe will be there. That's certainly something that's new. Your hydrogen, there's a lot of money in the IRA against hydrogen, the development thereof. So that's there as well. It's still difficult to get permit, a piece of pipe. It just is. And the company has been in that many, many times. And I would say all that would be upside for us. We're thinking about it. We're on it. We're in front of it. Can I guide to it? No. We saw some maintenance early in the year, a lot of replacements, things of that nature. I do believe that you'll start to see that same kind of sequence in the first half of next year. You'll see some maintenance and things of that nature start to happen. They're going to run them as long as they can in high markets, and they'll see a bunch of maintenance. But I do believe the view there is longer than people think. Your 20, 30 years of refining capacity that you still are going to have to think about. So I don't think it's short term in nature. I think it's longer term. And we will see the plants that are in existence run longer. That said, they'll take more maintenance. Yes. I want to thank our men and women in the field, a couple of storms, tough environments, they performed really, really well, safety. And what they give for us every day, families -- being away from their families doesn't go unnoticed to us management team. I want to thank Jayshree for her first call, and I'm sure the stock is going through the roof. That said, I want to thank you for your participation. This concludes the call."

Net income attributable to common stock was $156 million or $1.06 per diluted share, and adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure, was a record for the third quarter of $1.77. Our electric power revenues were $2.3 billion, a quarterly record and a 14% increase when compared to the third quarter of 2021. This increase was primarily due to growth in spending by our utility customers on grid modernization and hardening, resulting in increased demand for our electric power services as well as approximately $85 million in revenues attributable to acquired businesses. These increases were partially offset by approximately $175 million in lower emergency restoration services revenues. Electric segment operating income margins in 3Q '22 were 11.2% compared to 12.6% in 3Q '21. The margin reduction is largely attributable to lower emergency restoration service revenues, which were a record level in third quarter of 2021. Also included within our electric segment are our communications operations, which grew over 25% year-over-year. Communications margins in the quarter were mid-single digits, an improvement compared to 3Q '21, and we remain on pace for upper single-digit to double-digit margins for the year. Renewable Energy Infrastructure segment revenues for 3Q '22 were $979 million, a substantial increase from 3Q '21 primarily due to $480 million in revenues attributable to acquired businesses. Operating income margins in 3Q '22 were 9.1% compared to 10.8% in 3Q '21. The margin reduction is due to normal project variability and a change in the mix of work as a result of the acquisitions, but otherwise was in line with our expectations. Revenues, however, came in lower than we were anticipating, driven by continued supply chain challenges as we alluded to on last quarter's call. Underground Utility and Infrastructure segment revenues were $1.2 billion for the quarter, 17% higher than 3Q '21, reflecting increased demand from our gas utility and industrial customers as well as an increased contribution from larger pipeline projects. Operating income margins for the segment were 8.5%, resulting from the solid performance by our base business activities, notably gas distribution and industrial services, and the impact of a favorable project closeout. Below the line, we recorded an unrealized loss of $26.5 million associated with our common equity interest in fixed wireless broadband technology provider Starry Group Holdings. As required, we remeasure the fair value of this investment based on the market price of the publicly traded company stock as of September 30, 2022. At that time, our investment had a fair value of approximately $15 million. Although there has been further deterioration in Starry's equity value, we remain committed to our partnership with Starry to provide high-speed, affordable Internet access to underserved markets. Our total backlog was a record $20.9 billion, an increase of $1 billion compared to last quarter. The increase is primarily attributable to additional awards and an increase in expected volumes under MSAs. Our 12-month backlog is also at a record level of $12.4 billion, which we believe is another indicator of the steady, growing demand for our base business solutions. We remain confident in our ability to capitalize on opportunities that can lead to new record levels of backlog in subsequent quarters. For the third quarter of 2022, we had free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, of $256 million compared to $40 million of negative free cash flow in 3Q '21. The strong free cash flow for the quarter was led by the collection of a significant portion of the receivables associated with the large Canadian electric transmission project that we've discussed in prior quarters. Regarding the other Canadian renewable transmission project that we've discussed in prior quarters, we continue to work with the customer to address the contract asset balance. Discussions with the customer are progressing, and we remain confident in our cost position. The resolution of certain of these amounts will likely extend beyond this year and will continue to impact cash flow and DSO in the near term. DSO measured 81 days for the third quarter of 2022, a decrease of 8 days compared to the third quarter of 2021. The decrease was primarily due to the aforementioned collection associated with the large Canadian electrical transmission project as well as the favorable impact of the acquisition of Blattner, which historically operates with a lower DSO than certain of our other larger operating companies. As of September 30, 2022, we had total liquidity of approximately $1.8 billion and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5 as calculated on our credit agreement. As of October 31, 2022, we had repurchased approximately $127 million of our common stock since the beginning of the year, and as we mentioned in today's release, we continue to identify and execute on strategic acquisitions. Also of note, during the quarter, we commenced a commercial paper program, which is backstopped by our credit facility and allows for up to $1 billion of borrowings outstanding at any time. The program provides access to short-term borrowings at a cost below our existing credit facility rates. We expect continued earnings growth and cash generation to support our ability to efficiently delever over the coming quarters while continuing to create stockholder value through incremental capital deployment. Turning to our guidance. We've executed nicely through the first 9 months of the year, and as we close out 2022, we remain confident in our ability to execute within a tightened range of our previous expectations. However, the composition of our revenue and earnings continues to shift somewhat as we react to certain factors impacting our end markets. Overall, we believe our ability to deliver against our plan reflects the benefit and strength of our portfolio of solutions. Demand for the services across our electric segment remain robust, and we now expect revenues to range between $8.8 billion and $8.9 billion, a $300 million increase from our previous range. With respect to segment margins, it's important to note that the second half of both 2020 and 2021 had significant emergency restoration revenues, which contributed favorably to margins in those periods. As it stands today, we expect 2022 emergency restoration revenues to be around $300 million for the year, over 30% lower than prior year levels. Despite this reduction, margins are expected to be at double-digit levels, ranging between 10.6% and 10.8%, consistent with our previous guidance. Regarding our renewables segment, on last quarter's call, we raised our expectations for the segment with a view that the anti-circumvention moratorium would revitalize solar construction activities in the second half of the year. Unfortunately, panel delays due to other tariff dynamics persisted and remain problematic today. Additionally, owners are reviewing and repositioning their project pipelines in light of the positive changes in the Inflation Reduction Act, or the IRA. The combination of these dynamics resulted in several projects pushing out of 2022 and into 2023. In light of those near-term delays, we now expect full year revenues for the segment to be around $3.8 billion, a $300 million reduction from the previous midpoint. The revenue reduction has also pressured margins as we continue to invest in the resources required to execute on the growth opportunity in 2023 and beyond. For the year, we now expect segment margins to range between 8.5% and 8.75%. Despite the delays in 2022, we remain confident in our 5-year outlook for Blattner and believe that the passage of the IRA both accelerates and extends the growth opportunity associated with renewable energy infrastructure. Our underground segment has performed well over the first 3 quarters, and we now expect full year revenues for the segment to range between $4.2 billion and $4.3 billion. The strong year-to-date performance was led by our industrial services, which delivered significantly improved results following 2 challenging years across their end markets. However, we expect a pullback in industrial activity in the fourth quarter driven by reduced scopes of work as refiners defer maintenance efforts to capitalize on current market conditions. With this expected reduction, we now see segment margins ranging between 7% and 7.25% for the year. In the aggregate, our consolidated expectations for full year diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock are now expected to range between $3.19 and $3.43 and full year adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock, a non-GAAP financial measure, to range between $6.15 and $6.39. Additionally, we now expect adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, to range between $1.65 billion and $1.70 billion for the year. We expect free cash flow for the year to range between $600 million to $700 million, narrowing around our previous midpoint. This free cash flow range represents 35% to 40% of our expected adjusted EBITDA, consistent with our previous guidance of cash generation during periods of double-digit revenue growth rates. For quarterly commentary and additional details on our financial expectations, please refer to our outlook summary, which can be found in the Financial Info section of our IR website at quantaservices.com. From a long-term perspective, our end markets continue to strengthen, with utilities investing heavily in grid hardening and modernization and North America investing in the infrastructure required to deliver a carbon-neutral future. We believe we are uniquely positioned to deliver comprehensive solutions to the markets we serve and continue to have the opportunity to deliver significant stockholder value through organic growth and strategic capital deployment. I'll now turn back to the operator for Q&A. Operator? Yes. I think -- Andy, thanks for the question. I would echo what Duke is saying. We do believe that these short-term issues around supply chain, as Duke talked about on the solar panels, has delayed some projects. But the longer-term view from developers is very optimistic and exciting given the passage of the IRA. It gives what the industry has wanted for decades, which is long-term visibility in the ability to invest and grow in both the solar and wind space. So we are -- we do believe that as we -- as you pointed out, our backlog is starting to pick up on renewables. We do believe that we'll start accelerating here over the next several months, and we are very confident in our long-term outlook for the segment. I will say -- you asked about wind. I do think the IRA has been very positive for the long-term aspects for wind. I do think in the near term, solar, the IRA does provide even greater incentives to make solar that much more competitive. So it will take a little bit for wind to ramp up. I see it definitely ramping up in the latter half of the decade given all the benefits that -- passing the IRA, but it will take a little bit of that time for the developers to restock their wind pipeline and be competitive against the near-term solar projects. No, I'm not sure what you're referring to on the earnout. But -- go ahead. Yes. I think we talked about this in the last quarter's call that the impact of the Canadian project is affecting our DSOs around 5 to 6 days. That's still what we're seeing today. And as Duke talked about, we baked that into our forecast for the year, and we believe that going forward, we'll be working through that for the rest of the year, and we'll be able to make some progress around that as the project commences."

Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Executive Vice President of Business Operations and former CFO, will review and comment on the company's second quarter financial performance and full year guidance in here instead. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Duke Austin, Quanta's President and CEO. Duke?\nEarl Austin: Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today, I will provide operational and strategic commentary, and we'll then turn it over to Derrick Jensen, who as Kip said, is making a current call appearance, filling in for Jayshree today. He will provide a review of our second quarter results and full year 2022 financial expectations. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions. Our second quarter results continue our solid start to the year. with record quarterly revenues exceeding $4 billion for the first time in our history as well as record quarterly adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. We also believe momentum is building for a continued profitable growth next year, and we continue to see opportunities for multiyear expansion across our service lines, driven by our collaborative solutions-based approach. The growth of programmatic spending with existing and new customers and favorable megatrends. We are negotiating several large master service agreement or MSA renewals with utilities. As significant levels of limited notices to proceed for projects across our segments, and we are actively pursuing numerous larger transmission projects. As a result, we believe there is opportunity to achieve record backlog levels again in the coming quarters. Our Electric Power Infrastructure Solutions segment performed well overall during the quarter, despite some supply chain challenges causing delays and resource utilization and efficiencies. The impact on our business has been relatively limited, and these challenges are not causing meaningful delays in our overall utility capital spending. We also believe these are shorter-term conditions that have resulted in mostly short-term delays in the timing of certain electric transmission work. and we continue to collaborate and partner with our customers to manage through these dynamics and work on potential mitigation solutions, which we believe will further enhance our relationships going forward. Demand for our services continue to be driven by broad-based business strength from utility grid modernization and system hardening initiatives as well as our reputation for solid and safe execution. Additionally, our communications operations continue to execute well from both a revenue and margin perspective and remain on track for improved performance this year. Overall, our electric power outlook remains strong, driven primarily by increasing service line opportunities and market share gains on our base business. Incrementally, we continue to actively pursue large utility programs that are designed to modernize the grid, support growing electric vehicle penetration and on other new technology adoption, and hardened systems to be more resilient to wildfire and severe weather events. To that end, in our earnings release this morning, we highlighted an MSA we secured in July to provide turnkey engineering construction and program management solutions in support of the deployment of a national electric vehicle direct current, fast charging network. This program brings together 1 of the largest auto manufacturers, North America's largest operator of travel centers and the nation's largest public fast charging network for electric vehicles. These companies are collaborating on a fast-charging network that is expected to include as many as 2,000 DC charging stalls at hundreds of travel locations across the United States. We expect to begin engineering work on this program this year, with construction expected to begin in 2023. This is just 1 example of several large electric vehicle charging deployment programs that we have been pursuing. Additionally, we believe the need to modernize and enhance the power grid to enable higher levels of load growth and continuous power demand caused by growing electric vehicle penetration will create significant opportunity for Quanta. Renewable developers and utilities are leading the effort to reduce carbon emissions, many with significant carbon reduction commitments through aggressive efforts to expand our renewable generation portfolios. Achieving their goals will also require substantial incremental investment in transmission and substation infrastructure to interconnect new renewable generation facilities to the power grid and to ensure grid reliability due to the significant increase of intermittent power added to the system. Over the near and longer term, we believe substantial load growth favorable public policy and overall positive sentiment supporting a greener environment will continue to drive North America's power generation mix, increasingly towards renewables. Our Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions segment performed well during the quarter and successfully managed through general supply chain challenges and solar project in disruption caused by the Department of Commerce's investigation into solar panel manufacturers in several Southeast Asian countries, the impact of which has since been mitigated through an executive order by President Biden. While the first 6 months of 2022 presented challenges to the renewable industry, we are on track and expect to build momentum through the rest of this year. Interestingly, due to the initial solar industry uncertainty and project delays caused by the Department of Commerce investigation, a number of renewable developers and utilities have them for projects in their wind portfolios to be built over the next several years. We believe this incremental wind activity could create a stacking effect in future years on top of existing industry expectations for accelerated solar and battery storage project investment. To that end, we are actively collaborating with existing and potential renewable generation customers on their multiyear programs with some discussions in planning extending out to 2026. Additionally, we are pursuing several large, high-voltage electric transmission projects designed to support renewable generation and overall system reliability. And these projects have made meaningful progress with permitting and approvals. We are the leading high-voltage electric transmission infrastructure solutions provider in North America and believe we are well positioned to be selected for these projects. As we have commented previously about both proposed and enacted federal infrastructure legislation, our positive month a year outlook is not dependent on them. However, we view the current climate related components of the proposed inflation reduction act as incremental positive for the renewable industry. We believe the passage of these provisions could accelerate renewable generation and related infrastructure investment over the coming years and provide Quanta with greater visibility into future opportunities for growth. We are particularly pleased with the performance of our underground utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment in the second quarter. Our industrial services operations continue to execute very well and experienced strong demand as capital spending resumes and pent-up activity from 2 years of deferred maintenance in this part. We also continue to experience solid demand for our gas utility and pipeline integrity operations, which are executing well and driven by regulated spend to modernize systems, reduce methane emissions, ensure environmental compliance and improved safety and reliability. Looking to the coming years. We also continue to see emerging opportunities for Quanta's, underground utility and infrastructure solutions operations to play an evolving and increasing role with customers as they move forward with strategies to reduce their carbon footprint and diversify their operations and assets towards greener business opportunities. Quanta is successfully executing on our strategic initiatives to drive operational excellence, total cost solutions for our clients, profitable growth for the and value for our stakeholders. Our strategic initiatives are designed to uniquely position us not only to capitalize on the mega trends of our end markets, but also enhance our customer relationships and market positioning. As a result, we are able to collaborate with our clients to execute their capital deployment plans, even during challenging conditions like the ones we face today for supply chain inflation, COVID-19, regulatory and economic uncertainties. These dynamics are not easy to navigate, but we expect to continue to successfully manage through them. We believe we have taken a prudent approach to our guidance for the remainder of the year to incorporate these factors. It is during these times that Quanta demonstrates its resilience which we believe shows the strength of our operations portfolio and platform of solutions. As I hope you gather from my remarks this morning, demand for our services is robust across our portfolio and driven by long-term visible and resilient megatrends. As a result of our solid first half financial results, greater visibility and continued overall favorable end-market drivers, we remain confident in our 2022 consolidated financial expectations. More importantly, as we look to the medium and long term, we are incrementally more positive as energy transition and carbon reduction initiatives accelerate. We believe the infrastructure investment and renewable generation necessary to support these initiatives are still in the early stages of deployment. We have profitably grown the company and executed well in the past and expect to continue to do so. We are focused on operating the business for the long term and expect to continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class build leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's base business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's diversity, unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset form the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen for his review of our second quarter results and 2022 expectations. Derrick?\nDerrick Jensen: Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by saying that we've received so many phone calls and e-mails for an encore performance, and I'm doing 1 more quarter call, but after this call on dropping the mic. As Kip commented, see is doing fine and those who is not joining the call today, she has been overseeing the quarter and will be signed in the certification for our filing. She will be delivering next quarter's call notes as I wonder a round back stage. With that, I'll turn to our earnings release where today, we announced record second quarter revenues of $4.2 billion. Net income attributable to common stock was $88 million or $0.59 per diluted share and adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure, was a record for the second quarter at $1.54. Our electric power revenues were $2.2 billion, a quarterly record and a 21% increase when compared to the second quarter of 2021. This increase was primarily due to growth in spending by our utility customers on grid modernization and hardening resulting in increased demand for our electric power services as well as approximately $80 million in revenues attributable to acquired businesses. Electric segment operating income margins in 2Q '22 were 10.6% compared to 11.4% in 2Q '21. The margin reduction is largely attributable to normal project variability. However, margins were pressured somewhat by inefficiencies attributable to supply chain disruptions impacting certain operations and elevated consumables costs. Despite those headwinds, we were able to deliver double-digit margins in line with our expectations for the quarter. Also included within our Electric segment are our communications operations, which delivered improved sequential and quarter-over-quarter margins, putting us on pace for upper single-digit to double-digit margins for the year. Renewable Energy Infrastructure segment revenues for 2Q '22 were $924 million, a substantial increase from 2Q '21 primarily due to $490 million in revenues attributable to acquired businesses. Operating income margins in QQ '22 were 8.8% comparable to the 9% in 2Q '21. Underground Utility & Infrastructure segment revenues were a record $1.1 billion for the quarter. higher than 2Q '21, reflecting increased demand from our gas utility and industrial customers as well as an increased contribution from larger pipeline projects. Operating income margins for the segment were 8.1%, 530 basis points higher than 2Q '21. The margins reflect strong performance across the segment, most notably by our industrial operations, which had record quarterly revenues. One below the item -- going below the line item I want to mention is our other income and expense. As I discussed last quarter, we hold a common equity interest in the fixed wireless broadband technology provider, Star Group Holdings, Inc. As required, we remeasured the fair value of this investment based on the market price of the publicly traded company stock as of June 30, 2022, which resulted in the recognition of an unrealized loss of $41.7 million during the quarter. While the unrealized loss is significant, we remain confident in the store business as well as our scalable wireless platform and the right future for the deployment of Starry's fixed wireless technology. And we are not alone in this assessment. As a point of reference, the analyst community has an average price target starting above $9 per share. Our total backlog was $19.9 billion, a reduction of $0.6 billion compared to last quarter. The reduction is primarily attributable to our multiyear MSAs, which saw a reduction in estimated value due to 1 quarter's worth of backlog turning into recognized revenues during the second quarter. Our 12-month backlog is a record $11.6 billion, a slight increase compared to last quarter, indicating consistent levels of committed work over the near term. With the continued demand for our services and robust activity across all of our segments, we fully expect backlog to remain strong and to report new record levels of backlog in subsequent quarters. For the second quarter of 2022, we had free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure at $14 million compared to $126 million of free cash flow in 2Q '21. Free cash flow for the quarter was below our expectations, with the shortfall largely attributable to timing on certain renewable contract awards, which typically have favorable cash terms and continued elevated working capital requirements associated with the large ongoing Canadian renewable transmission project driving an increase in contract assets, which we've discussed in prior quarters. Regarding the Canadian renewable transmission project, we continue to work with the customer to address the growing contract asset balance. Expensive schedule delays, primarily due to COVID restrictions and its impact on remote locations of the project have extended production schedules through another build season. This and other factors have negatively impacted our ability to meet contractual billing milestones and have also increased costs as a direct result. Discussions are ongoing with the customer with the revised build schedule agreed to by both parties. We've engaged in discussions regarding adjusting billing milestones and remain confident in our cost position, a resolution of certain of these amounts will likely extend beyond this year and have impacted free cash flow and will continue to impact DSO in the near term. The estimated impact of these dynamics is currently increasing DSOs by as much as 5 to 6 days. On a positive note, another previously discussed large Canadian electric transmission projects that dealt with similar challenges received customer approval for a significant portion of the contract assets associated with change orders during the quarter. The approved amounts were billed during the quarter, and we expect flex in 3Q '22, with resolution of the smaller remaining balance expected by the end of the year. Days sales outstanding, or DSO, measured 81 days for the second quarter of 2022, a decrease of 2 days compared to the second quarter of 2021 and Start and an increase of 1 day compared to year-end. The decrease from 2Q '21, was primarily due to the favorable impact of the acquisition of Latina, which historically operates with a lower DSO than certain of our other larger operating companies. This positive impact was partially offset by the previously discussed working capital dynamics associated with the 2 large Canadian transmission projects. As of June 30, 2022, we had total liquidity of approximately $1.8 billion and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.4x as calculated under our credit agreement. We expect continued earnings growth and cash generation to support our ability to efficiently delever over the following quarters while continuing to create stockholder value through our dividend and repurchase programs as well as strategic acquisitions. As of July 31, 2022, we've acquired approximately $104 million worth of stock since the beginning of the year as part of our repurchase program. And in July, we acquired a utility contract in the West that specializes in underground construction. Turning to our guidance. We had a solid first half of the year, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver against the guidance we laid out on our last call. However, the composition of our earnings across our segments is slightly different than our initial expectations, which we believe reflects the benefit and strength of our portfolio of solutions. We continue to see strong demand for the services across our electric segment, and we now expect revenues to range between $8.5 billion and $8.6 billion, a $200 million increase from our previous range. However, as Duke commented, portions of our transmission operations are being negatively impacted by customer-driven material delays. And accordingly, we're moving labor and equipment to address our customers' growing distribution needs. The shuffling of resources is creating inefficiencies as we also grow headcount, which we expect will slightly pressure margins in the back half of the year. As a result, we now expect margins for the segment to range between 10.6% and 10.8%, still a double-digit operating profile, but slightly below our previous expectations. Our Renewables segment was negatively impacted by the uncertainty on project timing attributable to potential supply chain disruptions However, we've seen some improvement in that regard over the last month. We currently see the opportunity for the back half of the year to be stronger with full year revenues now expected to range between $4 billion and $4.2 billion, a $200 million increase from our previous range and operating margins continuing to range between 8.5% and 9%. Our Underground segment has had a great start to the year. Given the solid performance to date and improved visibility into the remainder of the year, we are tightening our full year range of expectations. We now expect full year revenues for the segment to range between $4.1 billion and $4.2 billion, with margins expected to range between 7% and 7.5%, which puts our previous midpoint expectation as the new low end of the margin range. With regard to free cash flow, we are lowering our full year expectations, primarily due to the Canadian transmission project dynamics we're working through, but also due to incremental revenue growth that will require additional working capital. Accordingly, we now expect free cash flow for the year to range between $550 million and $750 million. Due to the lower free cash flow, coupled with increased interest rates on our variable rate debt, we now expect full year interest expense to range between $120 million and $123 million. In the aggregate, our consolidated expectations for full year diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock are now expected to range between $3.32 and $3.65. And full year adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock, a non-GAAP financial measure to range between $6.10 and $6.44. Additionally, we now expect adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, to range between $1.64 billion and $1.71 billion for the year. For quarterly commentary and additional details on our financial expectations, please refer to our outlook summary, which can be found in the Financial Info section of our IR website at quantaservices.com. From a long-term perspective, the tailwinds behind our end markets remain robust. We believe our industry-leading solutions differentiate us from our peers and present management with the opportunity to deliver significant stockholder value through organic growth and strategic capital deployments through 2026 and beyond. I'll now turn it back over to our operator for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse.\nJamie Cook: Congrats on a nice quarter. I guess my first question, you -- the market has talked about and you sort of alluded to, to supply chain labor inflationary pressures. Can you talk to where that is most pronounced sort of how you're managing through that? And to what degree do you see that as a risk of project delays and/or to your guidance? And then my second question, Derrick, I guess I'll ask you because this will be the last time I get to ask you a question on a public call. Was pleasantly surprised by the underground margins in the quarter. So can you talk to how much of that was just the industrial business is picking up? Or is there anything structural going on there that you feel more confident that margins were closer to getting your margins to your targeted range?\nEarl Austin: Yes. Thank you, Jamie. I think when we look at supply chain, as we're building crew counts and things of that nature, there is some small impacts on mono material throughout the utility system. And it does create some inefficiencies with our crews especially when we're building. So those impacts, coupled with some inflationary pressures on consumables, it does pressure a bit. I do not think that's something that given the guidance, we took all that into account if it does levelize or if it does get better throughout the quarter by the end of the year, certainly, it will move upwards. It's utilization and the buildup for future years and working with the client in a collaborative manner, which is what the company has done in the past and we'll continue to do on a go-forward basis, all for really the outer years. And I think it's really important for us to make sure that we're building these crews while working with the client on these modern material issues throughout the system. So we don't really see the impact. It's not the solar we talked extensively about that last quarter and work through that and like I probably would. So really nothing there to speak of. So all in all, really good from our standpoint, macro markets are strong, not seeing large supply chain issues. And the ones that we are, I think it's opportunities for us to work with the client. And I'll just say a little bit on the margin, and I'll give it to Derrick. We've said all along that we view the company as a portfolio and that we get to double-digit EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA margins and through the portfolio. And I think it's prevalent. It resonates. We continue to see the portfolio rise throughout. And it's really whether it's industrial, Canada or whatever, the whole portfolio continues to move forward and upward. But I'll let Derrick comment.\nDerrick Jensen: Yes, I would say that unique to the quarter, there wasn't anything individual, I'd call out is really kind of across the segment performance. Industrial led the way record revenues for them. solid margins. They're looking to be into a pre-COVID type of performance levels for the rest of this year. So -- but the entire segment is seeing improvements, better utilizations, good execution, utilizing some of those resources to it and the electric power side as well as a reminder. And then it's also towards our path to being able to execute on that group in that upper single-digit profile, and we're seeing that through this year and go as well as we go forward.\nOperator: Our next question is from Steven Fisher with UBS.\nSteven Fisher: Just looking at the decline in the backlog here a little bit, just focusing on renewables. To what extent was that decline a function of some of the tariff dynamics in the quarter and the uncertainties that, that brought with it? Because if that's the case, that's understandable. But I guess what is your expectation -- or is it your expectation that, that backlog in renewables will start growing again as soon as the third quarter? I know you've got some limited notice to proceed, but should we expect that backlog to start growing again in the near term?\nEarl Austin: Yes. Thanks, Steve. The renewable backlog when we look at it and the amount of inbound calls, it's probably one of the most robust times that we've had at the company from that standpoint. I believe the backlog will build substantially throughout the year in the renewable segment. Timing, the LNTPs are really more so when you say limited notice to proceed, we did not put those in backlog. And as that becomes contract, then we'll put them in. I just -- the amount of LNTPs to contract that time has elongated a bit through the cycle, just primarily around the solar impact as well as some of the land portfolio moving up. I just -- we see that growing throughout the year, timing of which it could be the fourth quarter, it could be the third quarter, maybe early next year. But again, we reiterated where we think the segment, where we thought flatting would be and continue to be more confident about where that renewable segment is going today than I've ever been.\nDerrick Jensen: I'll add to everything Duke said, I'll add that we've always talked about how backlog can be lumpy for Quanta as a whole. I'll emphasize that in previous calls, we've commented that it could be more so in this renewable segment, right? It is an aggregate of project type dynamics that manage a little bit less base business component to it. So you might see a little bit more ups and downs at any given point in time, and that doesn't necessarily indicate the trend. We continue to feel quite confident in the multiyear market.\nSteven Fisher: Okay. Just a follow-up. Can you give us a sense of the size of that EV charging MSA? And I think you have -- you mentioned a bunch of other MSAs you have in the works. How many of those are completely new types of arrangements versus renewables -- renewals of what you already have?\nEarl Austin: Yes, Steve, it's meaningful. I would say it's more about for us, when it's going to get started, how it's looking on a go-forward basis. We're having the same discussions with multiple clients, multiple programs. But it's also the ancillary effect on the utility system, and I'll continue to say that is more important of what happens to the system. And really utility spend against EV charging and what's necessary to make that work on a consistent basis day to day, it's substantial and substantially more than the EV charging network itself. But we are seeing those projects come to fruition here.\nOperator: Our next question is from Chad Dillard with Bernstein.\nChad Dillard: So I want to go back to your comment about electric power margins and bringing it down this quarter. So can you just break out the impact from headcount, the customer-driven material delays and I think you mentioned consumables? And then just like is there any opportunity to recover this? And just like how broad-based are these issues in your portfolio?\nEarl Austin: I don't think the issue is systemic. I don't think it's elongated. We're building crews. Normally, the company runs right through it. We did increase headcount around 1,000 in the quarter. it does create some pressure, the material -- mono-material delays with that with some inflationary pressure on consumables altogether. Look, it does impact still a little bit. I do not think it's we're going to work with our clients long term. We're a company that really collaborates. So I don't see us getting any recovery on it. We'll work through it. It will be a long term for us over the next 10 years. The gains today for the next -- the future. So in my mind, a little bit of margin pressure, not bad. We'll work through it. I'm not also when we look outward against what we've seen in the past, if you think about storm, our guidance is like $100-plus million and last year, we did $400 million in the last 2 quarters. So we're not baking any of that in. It will depend on utilization and we get prudent guidance, and I believe there's upside potential to the backside given where we sit, if we get supply chain coming through or any kind of major storm event.\nChad Dillard: Got it. That's helpful. And then it's almost been a year since you've acquired Blattner announced the acquisition. So just curious to get some update on progress on what you're seeing in terms of sell-through from legacy Quanta customers and later? And are you seeing an uptick in regulated utilities to appetite to shift the mix towards renewables?\nEarl Austin: I think the business itself, we continue to be pleased with what we said. We're making good progress on synergies. We constantly are in contact with our clients about both in solar, not only on utilities or developers, but also our UI segment. All of our customers are really looking towards the carbon-free footprint. And when we think through it, we thought that we could sit at the tip of the sphere on energy transition, we think we're at the tip of the sphere on energy transition with Blattner and certainly believe that every bit today as we did before and we're proving it out every day.\nOperator: Our next question is from Justin Hauke with Baird.\nJustin Hauke: Derrick, I guess last time we'll talk this way on these calls. But I guess I had a question on the guidance with the upside from the JV contribution from LUMA, I guess it implies the base segment margins are a little bit lower, but I was more interested in kind of where the upside is coming from that. I know there was opportunity for earnouts and some additional project pickup. So I guess I'm wondering if it's from that or is this the base contract expanded and there still is more opportunity from those other items?\nDerrick Jensen: Yes, it's really the latter. A lot of it was associated with us basically some carets cost management side of the equation on activities that we're doing. As of yet, we haven't started anything for the new project type dynamics, which would be incremental to the base project. Those things are still yet to come. They're imminent. But right now, the differential this quarter is basically kind of cumulative cost management type dynamics. And looking forward, you can see that we're still forecasting the contribution to be comparable to our previous forecast levels for the third and fourth quarter.\nEarl Austin: I do think we're seeing some fame funding coming through now on the island. And I do think there'll be opportunities for us in 2023 to actually perform some construction that's outside the contract.\nDerrick Jensen: Another plant there is that, that line item has multiple joint ventures, not just another joint venture. So we had a few joint ventures that actually executed quite well during the quarter. So not all of that variance is unique to LUMA. .\nJustin Hauke: Okay. And I guess my second question is just going back to Blattner again. So the revenue contribution for the segment at least from M&A, $490 million, that's kind of comparable to what it was in 1Q. I guess we would have thought there would have been maybe a little bit more tick up. You guys have been pretty upfront about the challenges from the tariffs on the renewables business here in the first half. But I'm just curious with your outlook for that business, are you still thinking $2.5 billion of revenue contribution? Or is that a little bit different this year than maybe what was originally claimed?\nEarl Austin: No. We reiterated our guidance on the acquisition as well as the segments. So obviously, I mean, I think in my mind, it's every bit as good as what we have said. And I think the longer term, even '23, the build in '23 and beyond is greater than we thought.\nOperator: Our next question is from Noelle Dilts with Stifel.\nNoelle Dilts: So I wanted to dig into the cost side a little bit more just because I think it's been tough from a cost perspective kind of across the industry. You've discussed before that fuel is a relatively small percentage of your total cost, I think, at about 2%. Could you speak to how you've dealt with fuel cost increases in the quarter and the extent to which you've been able to pass them on to customers? And also sort of with labor and equipment and components, have there been -- have you been able to pass that through reasonably well? Or have there been instances where you've had to go back to the customer and get some relief? I'm just kind of curious what the process has been like for some of those challenges in the quarter.\nEarl Austin: Thanks, Noelle. The costs certainly have increased, but typically, we're able to work through those, do scale through collaborating with the client. We are building crews. And I do think the build is really what's causing most of our issues as well as the inefficiencies of the supply chain. It's not necessarily the fuel or the inflation. We can usually work through those kind of pressures and have -- we work with the client on that. And I do think it's just the culmination of all 3 kind of in a quarter, you see a little bit of pressure. Actually, internally, we're on kind of where we thought we would be from a margin standpoint. If the guide going forward that we've prudent on and I believe in my mind, special the overall segment margin is not where we sit in the first 6 months. Can we operate through that in the latter half? Maybe. We certainly take a prudent approach to guidance. We thought we should at least acknowledge that there is some pressure, but we're not seeing the pressure that -- and we're not going to talk about fuel and crew counts and those things on a daily basis. We can work through those through on the way that we get cost recovery as well as get more efficient as a company in scale.\nNoelle Dilts: Okay. And then in the past, we've talked about your -- how to think about labor costs given that your union and you typically have some visibility as it relates to the electric workforce. Any updated thoughts on how we should think about coming labor cost increases and what the conversations with the unions are like and generally, how to think about overall, what that looks like as we're kind of ending this year and heading into '23?\nEarl Austin: No, I think when you look at the company, that's our core, is across scale labor and our ability to work with unions as well as all of our trade associations, I think, are really important. And the way that we set our apology is the way that we've done our training for the last 6, 7 years, the amount that we put into this in my mind, we're really helping and collaborating with the client and talking through any kind of escalations in the future. We've worked really nicely to collaborate on these things, even the inflationary bill that has some of the language in it. We've worked through all that. So we sit in a really good position there and all, and I think we've got those cover going forward.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research.\nMichael Dudas: Duke, can you maybe share some thoughts on the opportunities that you're seeing? I'm sure they're quite broad on the high-voltage transmission projects, the larger ones. And given your -- where your base businesses, how selective do you plan on being? What kind of room do you think you have on the EP side for those types of projects? And then even on the pipeline side, there's been quite a bit of news lately from Washington about certain pipelines and certain opportunities and changing some regulatory aspects. You just share your appetite on both sides has it changed much in the last 6, 12 months? Or given the cash flow issues at a you may be seeing out of Canada, how selective you might be given the base business seems to be doing quite well?\nEarl Austin: No, when we look at the large transmission, certainly, it's a robust environment. We're talking a lot. I do think the states have a lot of say even if it has good visibility and there is a large number of projects that get stated, it's still tough on those big projects. But that said, we are in the middle of quite a few, more so now than in the past. So we are looking at a lot of bigger products. I wouldn't say we're around the edges on the mall, try to collaborate with the client on these and certainly, for us, it's about planning and helping upfront. So we have success in the future. And I think that's our job is to work with the client to be successful on these larger projects. Canada, it's always we've been 5 or 6 projects, takes a little bit to get cash. We always work through those with the client. We worked through 1 successfully in the quarter, we'll work through the next one. The southern one did the remaining this year and the next. But we are executing well. We are known for northern camps. Our people in the field are world-class. And that project, it's remarkable what we've done through COVID. So I'm highly confident where we sit there and then our collectibility there as well as getting our cash flow a little better than it is today. Canada was certainly impacted more so than the Lower 48, when you look at COVID and things of that nature, especially with 12 camps on a job. So look, I think both Canada from the pipe side, even some in the Lower 48, there is some projects moving around. But our base business is robust. Those are all really additive in our thinking to the future versus where we sit, anything there would be additive the way I see it. We're really not going to chase shiny objects. We're really working on our base business. And if the shiny objects happen to come in, it will only increase our guidance going forward.\nOperator: Our next question is from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson, Davis.\nAdam Thalhimer: Nice quarter. First question, I wanted to ask about your MSAs. Did those have inflation protection baked into them coming into this year? Or is that something you need to work on as you renegotiate those going forward?\nEarl Austin: They're all different, but I would say we typically have some escalations, labor escalations for sure, which is typically around 60%, 70% of the project. So normally, that's in there and some of the consumables would be in there, again, feels about 2% of cost. And so it's really the buildup, your training, all the things that are necessary to put new people in the field, which we've done a nice job through the colleges and the pre-apprentices. But that, coupled with some of the inflationary pressures, certainly in the quarter, I would say we just took a prudent approach in the future on guidance. We're really on target the way I see it for the quarter.\nAdam Thalhimer: I agree. Okay. And then I wanted to ask about the EV charging opportunity. Is the big opportunity for Quanta. Is it actually installing the bay? Or is there a substation and transformer work behind that, that's more meaningful for you guys?\nEarl Austin: I think it's both. But what I would tell you is it's 100x more meaningful on the back side than it is on the station itself or the bay itself. And the reason is the load is at really at the distribution level, particularly. And so as that happens, to get the low to the distribution level is substantial, both in -- from a generation standpoint through the sub down through into the distribution side of the business. It's like big -- I don't know I'll explain a big pipe going into a little fiat doesn't have any room. So you need bigger pipe all the way through. So in my mind, it's just a lot on the system that needs to be modernized, and we're in the early stages of starting that distribution bill across North America.\nOperator: Our next question is from Alex Rygiel with B. Riley.\nAlexander Rygiel: You've been through many different economic cycles. Can you talk to us a little bit about your experiences at the beginning or an inflection point of an economic cycle? And how many we might want to think about sort of the next 12 to 18 months as to how that kind of might impact your core electrical power business?\nEarl Austin: Yes. Thanks, Alex. Normally, in other cycles, typically, when you're looking at inflationary pressure, natural gas today, $8, it does impact the consumer. And the consumer in my mind, as you start increasing bills, that the regulators certainly look at this. The problem, I think, this time with -- it's not a problem that's what's -- what we're faced with as a country when we're going towards a carbon-free environment, and EV penetration has already left the building. There's no choice in my mind, other than to put capital into these systems in order to enhance and modernize them for those impacts. The only pressure you could do is just stop and I don't believe the country is going to stop the carbon-fee environment at this point. I'm not saying there is load growth now. And when you think about it, in the past, there was no load growth. We're getting 2%, 3%, 5% load growth in places, and that is offsetting some of the cost of capital going into the systems as well. So the ultimate impact of the consumer for the grid build is not showing up. But the fuel cost, I do think natural gas needs to regulate a bit, get down where it should be. And I do think that will help the bill and everything else. So I don't see the real impacts that I would have seen -- we would have seen in the past. But look, we're always cautionary about the inflationary pressures. They're really in place, and we should be prudent about how we think about it, but we're not seeing it show up at all yet.\nAlexander Rygiel: And then sorry if I missed this, but what is your backlog within the Telecom segment? And what is this backlog telling you about organic growth kind of on a go-forward 12-month basis? Is it accelerating? Can we see double-digit organic growth out of that segment?\nEarl Austin: Yes, we're about $1 billion in backlog in telecom. We stay about $1 billion in backlog and telecom. We could build it, Alex. It's just something I find the carriers to be more cyclical and more spontaneous than our regulated utilities as well as our developers. And so we'll be cautious about that as we grow the business. We faced that growth on purpose. I do think the margins are upper single digits going to double digits, which is really what we're after. So I'm happy where we sit. We could grow. I feel comfortable that our platform will allow us. The company has really worked hard on the portfolio. You're seeing it show up in the UI margins. I know we've talked a lot about electric, we talked a lot about renewables. But that portfolio, the way that we're displacing G&A and the things that we've done internally and this management team has really bought into 1 single brand, 1 single location. You're seeing the impacts across the board at Quanta as we pick up the adjusted EBITDA.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citi Group.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Maybe you could give us more color regarding your negotiations with utilities, regarding re-upping MSAs. Are MSAs of the existing customers continuing to increase given the amount of electric power work your customers have? Is there evidence of that moving to more outsourcing? And are you seeing evidence of new MSAs as your customers likely are quite tight with their own labor?\nEarl Austin: I think when we look at the customer collaborate quite a bit, Nothing's changed there. We continue to have a robust environment, good macro markets sit well in the marketplace and our ability to execute in the field safely, on time, on budget. It makes it an easy conversation and it always has. As long as we continue to execute in the field. And those conversations are pretty easy.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: So Doug, maybe can you give us an update on what you're seeing in undergrounding, whether it's the PG&E project or anything else you're working on? Do you see undergrounding becoming a much more meaningful part of your business as you head into 2023?\nEarl Austin: It not only in the West, you're seeing undergrounding across the Gulf Coast for storm hardening. I do think undergrounding will be a big portion of the West going forward. But it is moving forward, all the capital budgets, if you look back and you see where per mile, what the utilities in the West are anticipating in '23 is substantially different than in '22. Early stages, the West is tough to work and the lot permitting, a lot of environmental planning. I do think our front-end business, we talked about it quite a bit that the engineering, permitting, all the things that we're doing on the front end is really helping us get prepared for those bills and helping us with the client the reduced cost on that. So I like what we said there. I think it is something that you'll see in '23 show up and off in the Gulf Coast.\nOperator: Our next question is from Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nSean Eastman: I wanted to come back to the comment about wind projects being pulled forward. What does the sort of come back on the wind side? Tell us about the anticipated margin progression in the Renewables segment. Because I thought that -- and correct me if I'm wrong, but a lot of this year-over-year softness in the Blattner business that we're seeing in 2022 from a margin perspective, is that softer win dynamic? So I wanted to check in on that.\nEarl Austin: I don't know we are seeing any margin issues with Blattner. But that being said, it's down a little bit. I don't think it has anything to do with the Blattner or the platform whether it's on or solar. I think it had everything to do with us taking a prudent approach to it worry through inflationary pressures as well as guidance on not we did that on a go-forward basis to scale, I don't think the mix of work impacts the margins there in the segment. The segment does have large electric transmission as well as solar station interconnect. So those kind of things are in the segment. It's not just Blattner. And I do think as we move forward, certainly, the wind coming in helps and -- but wherever this happy with solar is low. I think when we see it, we thought we would have some delay in '22, we did. But we took that into account early even when we made the acquisition. And we also reiterated a long-term kind of $3.6 billion in '26. I do think that's pulled in. I think you'll see a significant amount of growth there in '23 as well as and beyond.\nDerrick Jensen: Yes. And maybe color as well, as we commented that we felt the latter would be able to exit the double-digit EBITDA levels and they continue to execute at those levels.\nSean Eastman: They do. Okay. Great. I didn't frame that question properly. I just -- I thought it was kind of exciting to see wind coming back in the mix. I guess, really, it's not a margin dynamic. It's more just additive to that stronger visibility around growth for renewables into the out years. And then...\nEarl Austin: So I'm not saying we can't increase margin on a go-forward basis in the segment. If you -- it's all scale. Look, if it's solar, wind doesn't matter. If you get more scale out of it and cover off G&A, we'll certainly increase the margins there.\nSean Eastman: Okay. That's really helpful, Duke. And then moving over to the cash flows, just this Canadian transmission project dynamic. Is this more an element of working through the bureaucracy with the client versus some sort of point of contention with the client? Is that a fair comment, Derrick?\nEarl Austin: This is Duke. I'll deal with them quite a bit. And we went through -- we had 2 large projects, 1 just completed. No one's ever been through COVID in Canada. So it's a justification of cost. against where you're at for one part. And then the way the milestone billing works on the second one, look, we didn't anticipate the delays in winter delays that we have today. And so those milestones, we have to escalate them off, work with the clients get paid earlier. I don't think there's -- we're working through those now. There's no contention and it's just it's really a matter of fact, going through it, justifying it and moving forward. A lot of paper, I would say, from my standpoint, a little more than normal. But look, it's -- we've been through this many times in Canada. We'll get through with good documentation. We know we've taken the same approach, we've taken to every other one there. I'm only confident that we'll work through this in the coming quarters.\nDerrick Jensen: I agree.\nOperator: Our next question is from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta: The first question was around the renewables legislation that's making its way through Congress right now. And I recognize it's an unbelievably dynamic environment to try to process it. But just any early observations of what that can mean for the opportunity set in your business? And clearly, it could be positive for renewable energy infrastructure solutions, but do you see a way it could also tie into the electric power infrastructure solutions as well?\nEarl Austin: For sure, anything renewable, I'll go backwards on the question, but anything renewable and the legislation affects the grid. No question. And so anything we're talking about impacts the backside of the grid. And so I think, yes, a substantial increase in utility spend either way, I don't think look, the legislation is great. It's all incrementally positive at 780 pages. I don't want to comment on it other than just to say it's positive for us in many ways. And if it does pass, as stated, we're extremely happy.\nNeil Mehta: That makes sense. And I just wanted to follow up on the free cash flow question. I think you provided some clarity around the specific project in Canada. But can you help us bridge between the previous free cash flow guidance on this one? And how much was that specific project versus other items?\nEarl Austin: That's why Derrick came back, if you want to answer that.\nNeil Mehta: All right. That's why Derrick is never going to do another one of these calls again.\nDerrick Jensen: Well, look, I mean, the biggest portion of what drives our cash flow is the working capital demands of the business. We've talked at length about the fact that higher levels of growth put pressure on working capital. At this stage, our organic revenue growth for the year will exceed double digits. And in the past, we've talked about when you see that, you can start to see free cash flow conversion against probably drifting down to like the 30% to 40% range. And I think if you look at the math, you're going to see the running about 35%. The uptick in the revenues for the year, about $400 million, running 10% to 11% trailing 12 months. Working capital is going to get you into about $40 million to $50 million of the uptick in the decrease in free cash flow is associated with the uptick in the revenue guidance. So I think it's all still running across the same formula. Having said that, yes, I think the remaining delta would largely be the individual timing of the project issues we were talking about.\nOperator: Our next question is from Gus Richard with Northland.\nAuguste Richard: Yes. Thanks for letting us ask a question on Derrick's second final farewell tour. High-power see kind of in limited supply. The largest supplier is in Germany. The OEMs that provide utilities with equipment are not high-volume customers typically don't get favorable allocation I'm seeing lead times as long as 50 weeks for IGBTs, et cetera. And I'm just wondering, my question is the supply chain issues that your customers are seeing, are they getting worse at it getting better? What are your customers saying about this? And is it going to continue to cause disruptions in your business?\nEarl Austin: Yes, we're seeing some of the spot really transformers, honestly, I think, are the bigger thing, distribution transformers are kind of what I see. A little stuff here or there, but that's what we're focused on, trying to collaborate with the client on those at this point. Some transmission items are -- we've seen some delay in those as well. But look, our workforce is pretty nimble. We can move through these kind of issues and work with the client on those supply chains. The utility industry is very resilient. We're coming out with solutions on a daily basis in a collaborative manner. They collaborate quite a bit. I don't think this is long term. We're working through all these issues. You can double shift factories. You can do a lot of different things to expedite all the modern equipment. So look, there's always a big lag on your big HVDC transformers and turbines and those kind of things. So I do think that is already in baked in the system, and we're working through these minor issues with the client. It is a place where I believe Quanta can collaborate and move forward the business on that end and certainly front side of our business. the planning and the things that we're doing there is helping us be successful to execute in the field.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing comments.\nEarl Austin: Yes. I want to -- first, I want to thank Derrick for stepping in here. It certainly eases the mine to have someone of his caller here at on the management team and shows a lot about the family aspect of the company. Jayshree is doing great, and she's listening to the call, Jayshree. And we know you've done a lot here in the quarter to make this successful. So thank you. And all of them and women in the field that make our job easy and make this call easy for us. as you execute so well, we truly appreciate you and everyone that participated in the call today. Thanks for your interest in Quanta.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Derrick Jensen",
            "content": "Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by saying that we've received so many phone calls and e-mails for an encore performance, and I'm doing 1 more quarter call, but after this call on dropping the mic. As Kip commented, see is doing fine and those who is not joining the call today, she has been overseeing the quarter and will be signed in the certification for our filing. She will be delivering next quarter's call notes as I wonder a round back stage. With that, I'll turn to our earnings release where today, we announced record second quarter revenues of $4.2 billion. Net income attributable to common stock was $88 million or $0.59 per diluted share and adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure, was a record for the second quarter at $1.54. Our electric power revenues were $2.2 billion, a quarterly record and a 21% increase when compared to the second quarter of 2021. This increase was primarily due to growth in spending by our utility customers on grid modernization and hardening resulting in increased demand for our electric power services as well as approximately $80 million in revenues attributable to acquired businesses. Electric segment operating income margins in 2Q '22 were 10.6% compared to 11.4% in 2Q '21. The margin reduction is largely attributable to normal project variability. However, margins were pressured somewhat by inefficiencies attributable to supply chain disruptions impacting certain operations and elevated consumables costs. Despite those headwinds, we were able to deliver double-digit margins in line with our expectations for the quarter. Also included within our Electric segment are our communications operations, which delivered improved sequential and quarter-over-quarter margins, putting us on pace for upper single-digit to double-digit margins for the year. Renewable Energy Infrastructure segment revenues for 2Q '22 were $924 million, a substantial increase from 2Q '21 primarily due to $490 million in revenues attributable to acquired businesses. Operating income margins in QQ '22 were 8.8% comparable to the 9% in 2Q '21. Underground Utility & Infrastructure segment revenues were a record $1.1 billion for the quarter. higher than 2Q '21, reflecting increased demand from our gas utility and industrial customers as well as an increased contribution from larger pipeline projects. Operating income margins for the segment were 8.1%, 530 basis points higher than 2Q '21. The margins reflect strong performance across the segment, most notably by our industrial operations, which had record quarterly revenues. One below the item -- going below the line item I want to mention is our other income and expense. As I discussed last quarter, we hold a common equity interest in the fixed wireless broadband technology provider, Star Group Holdings, Inc. As required, we remeasured the fair value of this investment based on the market price of the publicly traded company stock as of June 30, 2022, which resulted in the recognition of an unrealized loss of $41.7 million during the quarter. While the unrealized loss is significant, we remain confident in the store business as well as our scalable wireless platform and the right future for the deployment of Starry's fixed wireless technology. And we are not alone in this assessment. As a point of reference, the analyst community has an average price target starting above $9 per share. Our total backlog was $19.9 billion, a reduction of $0.6 billion compared to last quarter. The reduction is primarily attributable to our multiyear MSAs, which saw a reduction in estimated value due to 1 quarter's worth of backlog turning into recognized revenues during the second quarter. Our 12-month backlog is a record $11.6 billion, a slight increase compared to last quarter, indicating consistent levels of committed work over the near term. With the continued demand for our services and robust activity across all of our segments, we fully expect backlog to remain strong and to report new record levels of backlog in subsequent quarters. For the second quarter of 2022, we had free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure at $14 million compared to $126 million of free cash flow in 2Q '21. Free cash flow for the quarter was below our expectations, with the shortfall largely attributable to timing on certain renewable contract awards, which typically have favorable cash terms and continued elevated working capital requirements associated with the large ongoing Canadian renewable transmission project driving an increase in contract assets, which we've discussed in prior quarters. Regarding the Canadian renewable transmission project, we continue to work with the customer to address the growing contract asset balance. Expensive schedule delays, primarily due to COVID restrictions and its impact on remote locations of the project have extended production schedules through another build season. This and other factors have negatively impacted our ability to meet contractual billing milestones and have also increased costs as a direct result. Discussions are ongoing with the customer with the revised build schedule agreed to by both parties. We've engaged in discussions regarding adjusting billing milestones and remain confident in our cost position, a resolution of certain of these amounts will likely extend beyond this year and have impacted free cash flow and will continue to impact DSO in the near term. The estimated impact of these dynamics is currently increasing DSOs by as much as 5 to 6 days. On a positive note, another previously discussed large Canadian electric transmission projects that dealt with similar challenges received customer approval for a significant portion of the contract assets associated with change orders during the quarter. The approved amounts were billed during the quarter, and we expect flex in 3Q '22, with resolution of the smaller remaining balance expected by the end of the year. Days sales outstanding, or DSO, measured 81 days for the second quarter of 2022, a decrease of 2 days compared to the second quarter of 2021 and Start and an increase of 1 day compared to year-end. The decrease from 2Q '21, was primarily due to the favorable impact of the acquisition of Latina, which historically operates with a lower DSO than certain of our other larger operating companies. This positive impact was partially offset by the previously discussed working capital dynamics associated with the 2 large Canadian transmission projects. As of June 30, 2022, we had total liquidity of approximately $1.8 billion and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.4x as calculated under our credit agreement. We expect continued earnings growth and cash generation to support our ability to efficiently delever over the following quarters while continuing to create stockholder value through our dividend and repurchase programs as well as strategic acquisitions. As of July 31, 2022, we've acquired approximately $104 million worth of stock since the beginning of the year as part of our repurchase program. And in July, we acquired a utility contract in the West that specializes in underground construction. Turning to our guidance. We had a solid first half of the year, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver against the guidance we laid out on our last call. However, the composition of our earnings across our segments is slightly different than our initial expectations, which we believe reflects the benefit and strength of our portfolio of solutions. We continue to see strong demand for the services across our electric segment, and we now expect revenues to range between $8.5 billion and $8.6 billion, a $200 million increase from our previous range. However, as Duke commented, portions of our transmission operations are being negatively impacted by customer-driven material delays. And accordingly, we're moving labor and equipment to address our customers' growing distribution needs. The shuffling of resources is creating inefficiencies as we also grow headcount, which we expect will slightly pressure margins in the back half of the year. As a result, we now expect margins for the segment to range between 10.6% and 10.8%, still a double-digit operating profile, but slightly below our previous expectations. Our Renewables segment was negatively impacted by the uncertainty on project timing attributable to potential supply chain disruptions However, we've seen some improvement in that regard over the last month. We currently see the opportunity for the back half of the year to be stronger with full year revenues now expected to range between $4 billion and $4.2 billion, a $200 million increase from our previous range and operating margins continuing to range between 8.5% and 9%. Our Underground segment has had a great start to the year. Given the solid performance to date and improved visibility into the remainder of the year, we are tightening our full year range of expectations. We now expect full year revenues for the segment to range between $4.1 billion and $4.2 billion, with margins expected to range between 7% and 7.5%, which puts our previous midpoint expectation as the new low end of the margin range. With regard to free cash flow, we are lowering our full year expectations, primarily due to the Canadian transmission project dynamics we're working through, but also due to incremental revenue growth that will require additional working capital. Accordingly, we now expect free cash flow for the year to range between $550 million and $750 million. Due to the lower free cash flow, coupled with increased interest rates on our variable rate debt, we now expect full year interest expense to range between $120 million and $123 million. In the aggregate, our consolidated expectations for full year diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock are now expected to range between $3.32 and $3.65. And full year adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock, a non-GAAP financial measure to range between $6.10 and $6.44. Additionally, we now expect adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, to range between $1.64 billion and $1.71 billion for the year. For quarterly commentary and additional details on our financial expectations, please refer to our outlook summary, which can be found in the Financial Info section of our IR website at quantaservices.com. From a long-term perspective, the tailwinds behind our end markets remain robust. We believe our industry-leading solutions differentiate us from our peers and present management with the opportunity to deliver significant stockholder value through organic growth and strategic capital deployments through 2026 and beyond. I'll now turn it back over to our operator for Q&A. Operator? Yes, I would say that unique to the quarter, there wasn't anything individual, I'd call out is really kind of across the segment performance. Industrial led the way record revenues for them. solid margins. They're looking to be into a pre-COVID type of performance levels for the rest of this year. So -- but the entire segment is seeing improvements, better utilizations, good execution, utilizing some of those resources to it and the electric power side as well as a reminder. And then it's also towards our path to being able to execute on that group in that upper single-digit profile, and we're seeing that through this year and go as well as we go forward. I'll add to everything Duke said, I'll add that we've always talked about how backlog can be lumpy for Quanta as a whole. I'll emphasize that in previous calls, we've commented that it could be more so in this renewable segment, right? It is an aggregate of project type dynamics that manage a little bit less base business component to it. So you might see a little bit more ups and downs at any given point in time, and that doesn't necessarily indicate the trend. We continue to feel quite confident in the multiyear market. Yes, it's really the latter. A lot of it was associated with us basically some carets cost management side of the equation on activities that we're doing. As of yet, we haven't started anything for the new project type dynamics, which would be incremental to the base project. Those things are still yet to come. They're imminent. But right now, the differential this quarter is basically kind of cumulative cost management type dynamics. And looking forward, you can see that we're still forecasting the contribution to be comparable to our previous forecast levels for the third and fourth quarter. Another plant there is that, that line item has multiple joint ventures, not just another joint venture. So we had a few joint ventures that actually executed quite well during the quarter. So not all of that variance is unique to LUMA. . Yes. And maybe color as well, as we commented that we felt the latter would be able to exit the double-digit EBITDA levels and they continue to execute at those levels. I agree. Well, look, I mean, the biggest portion of what drives our cash flow is the working capital demands of the business. We've talked at length about the fact that higher levels of growth put pressure on working capital. At this stage, our organic revenue growth for the year will exceed double digits. And in the past, we've talked about when you see that, you can start to see free cash flow conversion against probably drifting down to like the 30% to 40% range. And I think if you look at the math, you're going to see the running about 35%. The uptick in the revenues for the year, about $400 million, running 10% to 11% trailing 12 months. Working capital is going to get you into about $40 million to $50 million of the uptick in the decrease in free cash flow is associated with the uptick in the revenue guidance. So I think it's all still running across the same formula. Having said that, yes, I think the remaining delta would largely be the individual timing of the project issues we were talking about."

            "name": "Earl Austin",
            "content": "Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today, I will provide operational and strategic commentary, and we'll then turn it over to Derrick Jensen, who as Kip said, is making a current call appearance, filling in for Jayshree today. He will provide a review of our second quarter results and full year 2022 financial expectations. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions. Our second quarter results continue our solid start to the year. with record quarterly revenues exceeding $4 billion for the first time in our history as well as record quarterly adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. We also believe momentum is building for a continued profitable growth next year, and we continue to see opportunities for multiyear expansion across our service lines, driven by our collaborative solutions-based approach. The growth of programmatic spending with existing and new customers and favorable megatrends. We are negotiating several large master service agreement or MSA renewals with utilities. As significant levels of limited notices to proceed for projects across our segments, and we are actively pursuing numerous larger transmission projects. As a result, we believe there is opportunity to achieve record backlog levels again in the coming quarters. Our Electric Power Infrastructure Solutions segment performed well overall during the quarter, despite some supply chain challenges causing delays and resource utilization and efficiencies. The impact on our business has been relatively limited, and these challenges are not causing meaningful delays in our overall utility capital spending. We also believe these are shorter-term conditions that have resulted in mostly short-term delays in the timing of certain electric transmission work. and we continue to collaborate and partner with our customers to manage through these dynamics and work on potential mitigation solutions, which we believe will further enhance our relationships going forward. Demand for our services continue to be driven by broad-based business strength from utility grid modernization and system hardening initiatives as well as our reputation for solid and safe execution. Additionally, our communications operations continue to execute well from both a revenue and margin perspective and remain on track for improved performance this year. Overall, our electric power outlook remains strong, driven primarily by increasing service line opportunities and market share gains on our base business. Incrementally, we continue to actively pursue large utility programs that are designed to modernize the grid, support growing electric vehicle penetration and on other new technology adoption, and hardened systems to be more resilient to wildfire and severe weather events. To that end, in our earnings release this morning, we highlighted an MSA we secured in July to provide turnkey engineering construction and program management solutions in support of the deployment of a national electric vehicle direct current, fast charging network. This program brings together 1 of the largest auto manufacturers, North America's largest operator of travel centers and the nation's largest public fast charging network for electric vehicles. These companies are collaborating on a fast-charging network that is expected to include as many as 2,000 DC charging stalls at hundreds of travel locations across the United States. We expect to begin engineering work on this program this year, with construction expected to begin in 2023. This is just 1 example of several large electric vehicle charging deployment programs that we have been pursuing. Additionally, we believe the need to modernize and enhance the power grid to enable higher levels of load growth and continuous power demand caused by growing electric vehicle penetration will create significant opportunity for Quanta. Renewable developers and utilities are leading the effort to reduce carbon emissions, many with significant carbon reduction commitments through aggressive efforts to expand our renewable generation portfolios. Achieving their goals will also require substantial incremental investment in transmission and substation infrastructure to interconnect new renewable generation facilities to the power grid and to ensure grid reliability due to the significant increase of intermittent power added to the system. Over the near and longer term, we believe substantial load growth favorable public policy and overall positive sentiment supporting a greener environment will continue to drive North America's power generation mix, increasingly towards renewables. Our Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions segment performed well during the quarter and successfully managed through general supply chain challenges and solar project in disruption caused by the Department of Commerce's investigation into solar panel manufacturers in several Southeast Asian countries, the impact of which has since been mitigated through an executive order by President Biden. While the first 6 months of 2022 presented challenges to the renewable industry, we are on track and expect to build momentum through the rest of this year. Interestingly, due to the initial solar industry uncertainty and project delays caused by the Department of Commerce investigation, a number of renewable developers and utilities have them for projects in their wind portfolios to be built over the next several years. We believe this incremental wind activity could create a stacking effect in future years on top of existing industry expectations for accelerated solar and battery storage project investment. To that end, we are actively collaborating with existing and potential renewable generation customers on their multiyear programs with some discussions in planning extending out to 2026. Additionally, we are pursuing several large, high-voltage electric transmission projects designed to support renewable generation and overall system reliability. And these projects have made meaningful progress with permitting and approvals. We are the leading high-voltage electric transmission infrastructure solutions provider in North America and believe we are well positioned to be selected for these projects. As we have commented previously about both proposed and enacted federal infrastructure legislation, our positive month a year outlook is not dependent on them. However, we view the current climate related components of the proposed inflation reduction act as incremental positive for the renewable industry. We believe the passage of these provisions could accelerate renewable generation and related infrastructure investment over the coming years and provide Quanta with greater visibility into future opportunities for growth. We are particularly pleased with the performance of our underground utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment in the second quarter. Our industrial services operations continue to execute very well and experienced strong demand as capital spending resumes and pent-up activity from 2 years of deferred maintenance in this part. We also continue to experience solid demand for our gas utility and pipeline integrity operations, which are executing well and driven by regulated spend to modernize systems, reduce methane emissions, ensure environmental compliance and improved safety and reliability. Looking to the coming years. We also continue to see emerging opportunities for Quanta's, underground utility and infrastructure solutions operations to play an evolving and increasing role with customers as they move forward with strategies to reduce their carbon footprint and diversify their operations and assets towards greener business opportunities. Quanta is successfully executing on our strategic initiatives to drive operational excellence, total cost solutions for our clients, profitable growth for the and value for our stakeholders. Our strategic initiatives are designed to uniquely position us not only to capitalize on the mega trends of our end markets, but also enhance our customer relationships and market positioning. As a result, we are able to collaborate with our clients to execute their capital deployment plans, even during challenging conditions like the ones we face today for supply chain inflation, COVID-19, regulatory and economic uncertainties. These dynamics are not easy to navigate, but we expect to continue to successfully manage through them. We believe we have taken a prudent approach to our guidance for the remainder of the year to incorporate these factors. It is during these times that Quanta demonstrates its resilience which we believe shows the strength of our operations portfolio and platform of solutions. As I hope you gather from my remarks this morning, demand for our services is robust across our portfolio and driven by long-term visible and resilient megatrends. As a result of our solid first half financial results, greater visibility and continued overall favorable end-market drivers, we remain confident in our 2022 consolidated financial expectations. More importantly, as we look to the medium and long term, we are incrementally more positive as energy transition and carbon reduction initiatives accelerate. We believe the infrastructure investment and renewable generation necessary to support these initiatives are still in the early stages of deployment. We have profitably grown the company and executed well in the past and expect to continue to do so. We are focused on operating the business for the long term and expect to continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class build leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's base business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's diversity, unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset form the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen for his review of our second quarter results and 2022 expectations. Derrick? Yes. Thank you, Jamie. I think when we look at supply chain, as we're building crew counts and things of that nature, there is some small impacts on mono material throughout the utility system. And it does create some inefficiencies with our crews especially when we're building. So those impacts, coupled with some inflationary pressures on consumables, it does pressure a bit. I do not think that's something that given the guidance, we took all that into account if it does levelize or if it does get better throughout the quarter by the end of the year, certainly, it will move upwards. It's utilization and the buildup for future years and working with the client in a collaborative manner, which is what the company has done in the past and we'll continue to do on a go-forward basis, all for really the outer years. And I think it's really important for us to make sure that we're building these crews while working with the client on these modern material issues throughout the system. So we don't really see the impact. It's not the solar we talked extensively about that last quarter and work through that and like I probably would. So really nothing there to speak of. So all in all, really good from our standpoint, macro markets are strong, not seeing large supply chain issues. And the ones that we are, I think it's opportunities for us to work with the client. And I'll just say a little bit on the margin, and I'll give it to Derrick. We've said all along that we view the company as a portfolio and that we get to double-digit EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA margins and through the portfolio. And I think it's prevalent. It resonates. We continue to see the portfolio rise throughout. And it's really whether it's industrial, Canada or whatever, the whole portfolio continues to move forward and upward. But I'll let Derrick comment. Yes. Thanks, Steve. The renewable backlog when we look at it and the amount of inbound calls, it's probably one of the most robust times that we've had at the company from that standpoint. I believe the backlog will build substantially throughout the year in the renewable segment. Timing, the LNTPs are really more so when you say limited notice to proceed, we did not put those in backlog. And as that becomes contract, then we'll put them in. I just -- the amount of LNTPs to contract that time has elongated a bit through the cycle, just primarily around the solar impact as well as some of the land portfolio moving up. I just -- we see that growing throughout the year, timing of which it could be the fourth quarter, it could be the third quarter, maybe early next year. But again, we reiterated where we think the segment, where we thought flatting would be and continue to be more confident about where that renewable segment is going today than I've ever been. Yes, Steve, it's meaningful. I would say it's more about for us, when it's going to get started, how it's looking on a go-forward basis. We're having the same discussions with multiple clients, multiple programs. But it's also the ancillary effect on the utility system, and I'll continue to say that is more important of what happens to the system. And really utility spend against EV charging and what's necessary to make that work on a consistent basis day to day, it's substantial and substantially more than the EV charging network itself. But we are seeing those projects come to fruition here. I don't think the issue is systemic. I don't think it's elongated. We're building crews. Normally, the company runs right through it. We did increase headcount around 1,000 in the quarter. it does create some pressure, the material -- mono-material delays with that with some inflationary pressure on consumables altogether. Look, it does impact still a little bit. I do not think it's we're going to work with our clients long term. We're a company that really collaborates. So I don't see us getting any recovery on it. We'll work through it. It will be a long term for us over the next 10 years. The gains today for the next -- the future. So in my mind, a little bit of margin pressure, not bad. We'll work through it. I'm not also when we look outward against what we've seen in the past, if you think about storm, our guidance is like $100-plus million and last year, we did $400 million in the last 2 quarters. So we're not baking any of that in. It will depend on utilization and we get prudent guidance, and I believe there's upside potential to the backside given where we sit, if we get supply chain coming through or any kind of major storm event. I think the business itself, we continue to be pleased with what we said. We're making good progress on synergies. We constantly are in contact with our clients about both in solar, not only on utilities or developers, but also our UI segment. All of our customers are really looking towards the carbon-free footprint. And when we think through it, we thought that we could sit at the tip of the sphere on energy transition, we think we're at the tip of the sphere on energy transition with Blattner and certainly believe that every bit today as we did before and we're proving it out every day. I do think we're seeing some fame funding coming through now on the island. And I do think there'll be opportunities for us in 2023 to actually perform some construction that's outside the contract. No. We reiterated our guidance on the acquisition as well as the segments. So obviously, I mean, I think in my mind, it's every bit as good as what we have said. And I think the longer term, even '23, the build in '23 and beyond is greater than we thought. Thanks, Noelle. The costs certainly have increased, but typically, we're able to work through those, do scale through collaborating with the client. We are building crews. And I do think the build is really what's causing most of our issues as well as the inefficiencies of the supply chain. It's not necessarily the fuel or the inflation. We can usually work through those kind of pressures and have -- we work with the client on that. And I do think it's just the culmination of all 3 kind of in a quarter, you see a little bit of pressure. Actually, internally, we're on kind of where we thought we would be from a margin standpoint. If the guide going forward that we've prudent on and I believe in my mind, special the overall segment margin is not where we sit in the first 6 months. Can we operate through that in the latter half? Maybe. We certainly take a prudent approach to guidance. We thought we should at least acknowledge that there is some pressure, but we're not seeing the pressure that -- and we're not going to talk about fuel and crew counts and those things on a daily basis. We can work through those through on the way that we get cost recovery as well as get more efficient as a company in scale. No, I think when you look at the company, that's our core, is across scale labor and our ability to work with unions as well as all of our trade associations, I think, are really important. And the way that we set our apology is the way that we've done our training for the last 6, 7 years, the amount that we put into this in my mind, we're really helping and collaborating with the client and talking through any kind of escalations in the future. We've worked really nicely to collaborate on these things, even the inflationary bill that has some of the language in it. We've worked through all that. So we sit in a really good position there and all, and I think we've got those cover going forward. No, when we look at the large transmission, certainly, it's a robust environment. We're talking a lot. I do think the states have a lot of say even if it has good visibility and there is a large number of projects that get stated, it's still tough on those big projects. But that said, we are in the middle of quite a few, more so now than in the past. So we are looking at a lot of bigger products. I wouldn't say we're around the edges on the mall, try to collaborate with the client on these and certainly, for us, it's about planning and helping upfront. So we have success in the future. And I think that's our job is to work with the client to be successful on these larger projects. Canada, it's always we've been 5 or 6 projects, takes a little bit to get cash. We always work through those with the client. We worked through 1 successfully in the quarter, we'll work through the next one. The southern one did the remaining this year and the next. But we are executing well. We are known for northern camps. Our people in the field are world-class. And that project, it's remarkable what we've done through COVID. So I'm highly confident where we sit there and then our collectibility there as well as getting our cash flow a little better than it is today. Canada was certainly impacted more so than the Lower 48, when you look at COVID and things of that nature, especially with 12 camps on a job. So look, I think both Canada from the pipe side, even some in the Lower 48, there is some projects moving around. But our base business is robust. Those are all really additive in our thinking to the future versus where we sit, anything there would be additive the way I see it. We're really not going to chase shiny objects. We're really working on our base business. And if the shiny objects happen to come in, it will only increase our guidance going forward. They're all different, but I would say we typically have some escalations, labor escalations for sure, which is typically around 60%, 70% of the project. So normally, that's in there and some of the consumables would be in there, again, feels about 2% of cost. And so it's really the buildup, your training, all the things that are necessary to put new people in the field, which we've done a nice job through the colleges and the pre-apprentices. But that, coupled with some of the inflationary pressures, certainly in the quarter, I would say we just took a prudent approach in the future on guidance. We're really on target the way I see it for the quarter. I think it's both. But what I would tell you is it's 100x more meaningful on the back side than it is on the station itself or the bay itself. And the reason is the load is at really at the distribution level, particularly. And so as that happens, to get the low to the distribution level is substantial, both in -- from a generation standpoint through the sub down through into the distribution side of the business. It's like big -- I don't know I'll explain a big pipe going into a little fiat doesn't have any room. So you need bigger pipe all the way through. So in my mind, it's just a lot on the system that needs to be modernized, and we're in the early stages of starting that distribution bill across North America. Yes. Thanks, Alex. Normally, in other cycles, typically, when you're looking at inflationary pressure, natural gas today, $8, it does impact the consumer. And the consumer in my mind, as you start increasing bills, that the regulators certainly look at this. The problem, I think, this time with -- it's not a problem that's what's -- what we're faced with as a country when we're going towards a carbon-free environment, and EV penetration has already left the building. There's no choice in my mind, other than to put capital into these systems in order to enhance and modernize them for those impacts. The only pressure you could do is just stop and I don't believe the country is going to stop the carbon-fee environment at this point. I'm not saying there is load growth now. And when you think about it, in the past, there was no load growth. We're getting 2%, 3%, 5% load growth in places, and that is offsetting some of the cost of capital going into the systems as well. So the ultimate impact of the consumer for the grid build is not showing up. But the fuel cost, I do think natural gas needs to regulate a bit, get down where it should be. And I do think that will help the bill and everything else. So I don't see the real impacts that I would have seen -- we would have seen in the past. But look, we're always cautionary about the inflationary pressures. They're really in place, and we should be prudent about how we think about it, but we're not seeing it show up at all yet. Yes, we're about $1 billion in backlog in telecom. We stay about $1 billion in backlog and telecom. We could build it, Alex. It's just something I find the carriers to be more cyclical and more spontaneous than our regulated utilities as well as our developers. And so we'll be cautious about that as we grow the business. We faced that growth on purpose. I do think the margins are upper single digits going to double digits, which is really what we're after. So I'm happy where we sit. We could grow. I feel comfortable that our platform will allow us. The company has really worked hard on the portfolio. You're seeing it show up in the UI margins. I know we've talked a lot about electric, we talked a lot about renewables. But that portfolio, the way that we're displacing G&A and the things that we've done internally and this management team has really bought into 1 single brand, 1 single location. You're seeing the impacts across the board at Quanta as we pick up the adjusted EBITDA. I think when we look at the customer collaborate quite a bit, Nothing's changed there. We continue to have a robust environment, good macro markets sit well in the marketplace and our ability to execute in the field safely, on time, on budget. It makes it an easy conversation and it always has. As long as we continue to execute in the field. And those conversations are pretty easy. It not only in the West, you're seeing undergrounding across the Gulf Coast for storm hardening. I do think undergrounding will be a big portion of the West going forward. But it is moving forward, all the capital budgets, if you look back and you see where per mile, what the utilities in the West are anticipating in '23 is substantially different than in '22. Early stages, the West is tough to work and the lot permitting, a lot of environmental planning. I do think our front-end business, we talked about it quite a bit that the engineering, permitting, all the things that we're doing on the front end is really helping us get prepared for those bills and helping us with the client the reduced cost on that. So I like what we said there. I think it is something that you'll see in '23 show up and off in the Gulf Coast. I don't know we are seeing any margin issues with Blattner. But that being said, it's down a little bit. I don't think it has anything to do with the Blattner or the platform whether it's on or solar. I think it had everything to do with us taking a prudent approach to it worry through inflationary pressures as well as guidance on not we did that on a go-forward basis to scale, I don't think the mix of work impacts the margins there in the segment. The segment does have large electric transmission as well as solar station interconnect. So those kind of things are in the segment. It's not just Blattner. And I do think as we move forward, certainly, the wind coming in helps and -- but wherever this happy with solar is low. I think when we see it, we thought we would have some delay in '22, we did. But we took that into account early even when we made the acquisition. And we also reiterated a long-term kind of $3.6 billion in '26. I do think that's pulled in. I think you'll see a significant amount of growth there in '23 as well as and beyond. So I'm not saying we can't increase margin on a go-forward basis in the segment. If you -- it's all scale. Look, if it's solar, wind doesn't matter. If you get more scale out of it and cover off G&A, we'll certainly increase the margins there. This is Duke. I'll deal with them quite a bit. And we went through -- we had 2 large projects, 1 just completed. No one's ever been through COVID in Canada. So it's a justification of cost. against where you're at for one part. And then the way the milestone billing works on the second one, look, we didn't anticipate the delays in winter delays that we have today. And so those milestones, we have to escalate them off, work with the clients get paid earlier. I don't think there's -- we're working through those now. There's no contention and it's just it's really a matter of fact, going through it, justifying it and moving forward. A lot of paper, I would say, from my standpoint, a little more than normal. But look, it's -- we've been through this many times in Canada. We'll get through with good documentation. We know we've taken the same approach, we've taken to every other one there. I'm only confident that we'll work through this in the coming quarters. For sure, anything renewable, I'll go backwards on the question, but anything renewable and the legislation affects the grid. No question. And so anything we're talking about impacts the backside of the grid. And so I think, yes, a substantial increase in utility spend either way, I don't think look, the legislation is great. It's all incrementally positive at 780 pages. I don't want to comment on it other than just to say it's positive for us in many ways. And if it does pass, as stated, we're extremely happy. That's why Derrick came back, if you want to answer that. Yes, we're seeing some of the spot really transformers, honestly, I think, are the bigger thing, distribution transformers are kind of what I see. A little stuff here or there, but that's what we're focused on, trying to collaborate with the client on those at this point. Some transmission items are -- we've seen some delay in those as well. But look, our workforce is pretty nimble. We can move through these kind of issues and work with the client on those supply chains. The utility industry is very resilient. We're coming out with solutions on a daily basis in a collaborative manner. They collaborate quite a bit. I don't think this is long term. We're working through all these issues. You can double shift factories. You can do a lot of different things to expedite all the modern equipment. So look, there's always a big lag on your big HVDC transformers and turbines and those kind of things. So I do think that is already in baked in the system, and we're working through these minor issues with the client. It is a place where I believe Quanta can collaborate and move forward the business on that end and certainly front side of our business. the planning and the things that we're doing there is helping us be successful to execute in the field. Yes. I want to -- first, I want to thank Derrick for stepping in here. It certainly eases the mine to have someone of his caller here at on the management team and shows a lot about the family aspect of the company. Jayshree is doing great, and she's listening to the call, Jayshree. And we know you've done a lot here in the quarter to make this successful. So thank you. And all of them and women in the field that make our job easy and make this call easy for us. as you execute so well, we truly appreciate you and everyone that participated in the call today. Thanks for your interest in Quanta."

With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Duke Austin, Quanta\u2019s President and CEO. Duke?\nDuke Austin: Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Quanta Services first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. On the call today, I will provide operational and strategic commentary, and we\u2019ll then turn it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a review of our first quarter results and full year 2022 financial expectations. Following Derrick\u2019s comments, we welcome your questions. Our first quarter results show that Quanta is off to a great start this year with quarterly revenues of $4 billion, each segment generated strong revenue growth during the quarter despite the impact of normal seasonality, with GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.57 and a record $1.37 respectively. Additionally, total backlog at the quarter end exceeded $20 billion for the first time, which continues to support our 2022 financial expectations. We continue to see opportunities across our service lines, driven by our collaborative solution-based approach. The growth of programmatic spending with existing and new customers and the favorable mega trends we discussed at our recent Investor Day, which provides strong visibility into near and long-term growth. Our Electric Power Infrastructure Solutions operations continued to perform well during the quarter, driven by broad based business strength from ongoing utility grid modernization and system hardening initiatives and solid and safe execution. Additionally, our communications operations are moving in the right direction, and performed well during the quarter. Our electric power outlook remains strong, driven primarily by increasing service line opportunities and market share gains on our base business. Further, we continue to actively pursue large new master service agreements, or MSAs, that are designed to modernize the grid and to support growing electric vehicle penetration and other need technology adoption and to harden the system to be more resilient to wildfire and severe weather events. We believe these trends provide opportunity for materially greater backlog levels this year. Our conversations about Quanta\u2019s EV charging program management solutions continues to advance with companies throughout the electric vehicle ecosystem. Our revenues from EV charging infrastructure work are relatively small, but are expected to increase significantly this year and beyond. We believe EV charging infrastructure opportunities are on the cusp of accelerating and are only just beginning. Additionally, we believe the need to modernize and enhance the power grid to enable higher levels of load growth and continuous power demand caused by growing EV penetration could create significant opportunity for Quanta. Our Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions segment performed well during the quarter. Many of the macroeconomic uncertainties we are managing through today were known unknowns when we announced our intention to acquire Blattner in September of 2021 and we have prudently taken these risks into consideration for our full year 2022 guidance. We also believe Quanta\u2019s and Blattner\u2019s market leading position, scope and scale and technology and geographic diversity, positions the company to manage through times of uncertainty. That said, we reiterate that we did not acquire Blattner for 2022. The addition of Blattner\u2019s utility scale renewable generation solutions to Quanta\u2019s existing holistic grid solutions transforms our ability to collaborate early with our customers their energy transition strategies over the coming decades, which we believe creates a value proposition unique to the industry. We are increasingly confident in our strategy to position Quanta as the infrastructure solutions leader in the energy transition. We are pleased with the performance of our underground utility and infrastructure solution segment, which delivered strong revenue growth and profitability in the quarter. In particular, our industrial services operations executed well and are experiencing strong demands as a global economy continues to recover and two years of pent up demand from deferred maintenance and capital spending resumes. We also continue to experience solid demand for our gas, utility and pipeline integrity services, which are driven by regulated spend to modernized systems, reduce methane emissions, ensure environmental compliance and improve safety and reliability. Looking through the coming years, we continue to see emerging opportunities for Quanta\u2019s underground utility and infrastructure solution operations playing evolving and increasing role with customers as they increasingly pursue strategies to reduce their carbon footprint and diversify their operations and assets towards greener business opportunities. As we discussed in detail a month ago during our 2022 Investor Day in New York City, Quanta is successfully executing on strategic initiatives to drive operational excellence, total cost solutions for our clients, profitable growth and value for our stakeholders. Our strategic initiatives, uniquely position us to not only capitalize on the mega trends, but also enhance our customer relationships and market positioning. As a result, we are able to collaborate with our clients to execute their capital deployment plans, even during challenging conditions like the ones we face today, including supply chain, inflation, COVID-19 and regulatory uncertainties. These dynamics are not easy to navigate, but we expect to continue to successfully manage through them. It is during these times that Quanta demonstrates its resilience, which we believe shows the strength of our operation\u2019s portfolio, strategic initiatives and platform of solutions. Furthermore, we are developing new solutions throughout the supply chain, which we believe will be a differentiator and will expand our customer base. We believe the glass out full and see these challenges as opportunities for us to take strategic actions, to further differentiate our solutions and mitigate risk for our company and our customers. Quanta is a portfolio of exceptional companies with geographic and service line diversity. We are anchored by our commitment to cross skill labor and our self-performed capabilities and remain dedicated to growing and enhancing our portfolios services, which strengthens our ability to capture more of a customer\u2019s large programmatic spending programs and to operate in a responsible and sustainable way, while maintaining a strong financial profile. Looking to the medium- and long-term as energy transition and carbon reduction initiatives accelerate, we believe the infrastructure investment and renewable generation necessary to support these initiatives are still in early stages of deployment. And that this is arguably the most exciting time in Quanta\u2019s history. We have profitably grown the company and executed well and expect to continue to do so. Demand for services is robust across our portfolio and driven by long-term visible and resilient energy transition, and technology enablement, mega trends. We are confident in the strategic initiatives. We are executing on the competitive position we have in the marketplace and our position \u2013 positive multiyear outlook. As a result, we believe Quanta has built a platform with the opportunity to deliver a 10% organic adjusted earnings per share CAGR and a strategy with the opportunity to deliver a 15% or better adjusted EPS CAGR through 2026. We are focused on operating the business for the long-term and expect to continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class build leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta space business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta\u2019s diversity, unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset form the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO for his review of our first quarter results and 2022 expectations. Derrick?\nDerrick Jensen: Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today we announced record first quarter revenues of $4 billion. Net income attributable to commerce stock was $85 million or $0.57 per diluted share and adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure was a record for the first quarter at $1.37. Our electric power revenues were $2.1 billion, a quarterly record and a 28% increase from compared to the first quarter of 2021. This increase is primarily due to growth in spending by our utility customers on grid modernization resulting in increased demand for our electric power services, as well as approximately $75 million in revenues attributable to required businesses. Electric segment operating income margins in 1Q 2022 are 9.5%, a 30 basis point improvement compared to 9.2% in 1Q 2021. However, margins were slightly impacted during the quarter for certain Canadian projects due to substantial COVID delays. That said our U.S. electric operations continued to perform well delivering another double-digit quarter. Also included within our electric segment, our communications operations, which delivered mid-single digit margins during the quarter, and remain on track for upper-single digit margins for the year. Renewable energy infrastructure segment revenues for 1Q 2022 were $876 million a substantial increase from 1Q 2021, primarily due to $470 million in revenues attributable to required businesses. Operating income margins in 1Q 2022 were 8% in line with our expectations for the quarter, but lower than the 11.8% in 1Q 2021, due to the change in the mix of work as a result of the acquisitions and due to normal project variability. Underground utility and infrastructure segment revenues were $951 million for the quarter, 48% higher than 1Q 2021, reflecting increased levels of activity across all of our segment operations. Operating income margins for the segment were 5.1%, 370 basis points higher than 1Q 2021. The margin improvement was largely due to the increase in revenues and improved performance from our industrial operations with COVID-related headwinds previously impacting these operations, largely absent in this segment for 1Q 2022. One below the line item I want to mention is our 1Q 2022 other income and expense. As I mentioned last quarter, we hold an investment in a fixed wireless broadband technology provider. Then the March of 2022 became Starry Group Holdings, Inc., a publicly traded company at which point our interest became a common equity interest in the publicly traded company. We re-measured the fair value of this investment based on the market price of the publicly traded company stock as of March 31, 2022, which resulted in the recognition of an unrealized loss at $8.4 million during the quarter. The value of this investment must be mark-to-market at each quarter and as long as this investment is held. On a non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share and adjusted EBITDA basis, we\u2019ve removed the unrealized loss associated with this investment for the quarter and plan to continue adjusting our non-GAAP measures for mark-to-market volatility in future periods. Our total backlog was a record $20.5 billion at the end of the first quarter. Additionally, 12 month backlog of $11.5 billion also represents a quarterly record. Although, backlog includes some nice project awards during the first quarter, our backlog growth continues to be driven primarily by multi-year MSA programs of North American utilities, which we believe reinforces the repeatable and sustainable nature of the largest portion of our revenues and earnings. As expected for the first quarter of 2022, we had negative free cash flow and non-GAAP measure of $16 million compared to $49 million of positive free cash flow in 1Q 2021. Net cash provided by operating activities during the first quarter of 2022 was lower due to higher revenues and corresponding increases in working capital demands compared to 1Q 2021. Day sales outstanding or DSO measured 80 days for the first quarter of 2022, a decrease of nine days compared to the first quarter of 2021 and the same as year-end. The decrease from 1Q 2021 was primarily due to the favorable impact of the acquisition of Blattner, which has traditionally had a lower DSO than certain of our other larger operating companies. This positive impact was partially offset by continued elevated working capital requirements associated with two large Canadian transmission projects, driving an increase in contract assets, which we\u2019ve discussed in prior quarters. Both projects were incrementally impacted by COVID during the first quarter, increasing our change order positions. In total, the amounts being pursued are currently impacting DSOs by as much as four to five days. However, one of those projects reached substantial completion during the first quarter and we expect those contract assets to be billed and collected over the remainder of the year. As of March 31, 2022, we have total liquidity of approximately $2 billion and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.3 as calculated under our credit agreement. We expect continued earnings growth and cash generation to support our ability to efficiently delever over the following quarters, while continuing to create shareholder values through our dividend and repurchase programs, as well as strategic acquisitions. Through the date of this earnings release, we\u2019ve required approximately $21 million worth of stock since the beginning of the year, as part of our repurchase program and we continue to evaluate potential acquisitions that fit our strategic objectives. Turning to guidance, I\u2019m pleased with the start to our year and have little change for our overall expectations for 2022. We now expect electric power revenues to range between $8.3 billion and $8.4 billion with margin expectations unchanged ranging between 10.7% and 11.3%. Similarly, we\u2019re increasing our underground revenue expectations to range between $4.1 billion and $4.3 billion with margins expected to range between 6.5% and 7.5% consistent with our previous expectations. Our renewable segment revenue expectations are unchanged. However, with the uncertainty on project timing attributable to potential supply chain disruptions, we have widened our operating margin range a bit to 8.5% and 9%. We believe these dynamics are short-term in nature and the opportunity to overcome them and deliver margins at our original 9% level and above continues to exist. Additionally, higher interest rates on our variable rate debt are resulting in increased interest expense for the year, which we now expect to range between $113 million and $117 million for the year. In the aggregate, our consolidated expectations for adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA remain unchanged for the year, reflecting the strength of our portfolio. For additional information, please refer to our outlet summary, which can be found in the Financial Info section of our IR website at quantaservices.com. From a long-term perspective, as we laid out in April at our Investor Day, the tailwinds behind our end markets and our industry-leading solutions present management with the opportunity to deliver significant shareholder value through organic growth and strategic capital deployment through 2026 and beyond. And speaking of management, as we disclosed in today\u2019s additional release, I\u2019m pleased to announce my plan transition from the role of Chief Financial Officer to the new role of Executive Vice President of Business Operations, transitioning into the role of Chief Financial Officer is Jayshree Desai. Jayshree has been a valuable partner to me and Duke and all of our leadership teams since she joined the organization in 2020. And she is well suited to guide our financial organization going forward. It has been the highlight of my career to service Quanta\u2019s Chief Financial Officer over the last 10 years. As the longest standing employee of Quanta, I\u2019ve spent almost half my life helping to lead our financial organization and support our world-class operating leadership. I\u2019m incredibly excited to continue supporting our strategic growth within the different capacity going forward. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Duke for closing remarks.\nDuke Austin: Thanks Derrick. Before going to Q&A, I wanted to thank and recognize Derrick for his many years of continued dedication to Quanta and for his partnership. This is a purposeful transition and is a role that will enhance our ability to reach our targets. I\u2019m grateful Derrick embraced and led this transition and look forward to driving operations together. It is congratulations today, but maybe condolences later. I also want to congratulate Jayshree on her new role as CFO. She has been a great addition to our senior leadership team. I am excited about Quanta\u2019s future and look forward to working closely with Derrick and Jayshree and their new roles. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ian MacPherson from Piper Sandler. Go ahead, Ian.\nIan MacPherson: Thanks. Good morning, team. Congratulations, Derrick and Jayshree on your new postings. And I guess Duke, what I wanted to ask first was I thought the mix of your backlog was a pretty interesting here for the quarter especially the accelerated growth and backlog for renewables and for underground. And I wanted to get your perspective on maybe what the drivers were there in Q1 and what your outlook is for relative growth across your three verticals over the foreseeable timeframe this year.\nDuke Austin: Yes, thank you. When we look at the business, we do look at it as a portfolio and I \u2013 we saw broad base growth across all segments. Sometimes the backlog within the segment\u2019s lumpy a bit, but the continued MSA growth from our base business on both gas, electric telecom, as well as renewables continues. And I don\u2019t see that stopping and we continue to see inbound calls daily on capital spends and how can we help on a programmatic way? So the company is in a really good position and I do believe backlog will grow, continue to grow. And we\u2019ve talked about the growth of the company on a EPS basis. So we stand by.\nIan MacPherson: That\u2019s fine. I mean I think we probed a little bit at the Analyst Day around maybe the sensitivities for REIS bookings this year, given tariff uncertainty. And you\u2019d spoke to the flexibility of the large operators across their portfolios as well, in terms of developing solar, wind and storage, at sort of flexible cadences maybe. And I guess the tariff issue is still very much up in the air, but have you seen a more of a surge in rotating some CapEx towards the wind side in the front half of this year? Or is that a \u2013 maybe a misperception on my part?\nDuke Austin: I mean the tariff commentary is valid and it\u2019s out there. So we \u2013 let\u2019s address it. When we talk about Blattner, we talk about the acquisition, we talk about megawatts, gigawatts and it\u2019s still the same. It\u2019s megawatt, gigawatts that we can change with our customers. It\u2019s much like MSAs and the larger customers we can flex to wind. We can flex the solar. We can flex the batteries. The segment is much bigger than just Blattner. It does have all \u2013 some of our larger transmission projects in it as well. We really like our positioning in these type of markets. It allows us to collaborate and provide solutions to the client, which ultimately puts us in a different position than others with the scale of the company. So in saying that with times of we\u2019ve been through a pandemic, we\u2019ve been through many, many things and through this company\u2019s existence, and we\u2019ve continued to provide those solutions back to the client, collaborate that\u2019s who we are that\u2019s who Blattner is. And we continue to be positive \u2013 incrementally positive about the markets. That said, look, it\u2019s \u2013 solar is up in the air due to the tariff. And I do think it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ve got incrementally positive news as this memos continue to come out. We believe that ultimately the energy transition is happening. Solar will be a big piece of that as well as wind and batteries. So that\u2019s said long-term, the demand is outpaces anything and any kind of movement you would have and solar would go into 2023, 2024 build. So we stand by our 2022 guidance that we\u2019ve given on Blattner $2.5 billion and stand by \u2013 continue standby with the tariff, without a tariff and the future is just continues to get better.\nIan MacPherson: All right. Well, thank you very much. Appreciate that perspective.\nDuke Austin: Sure.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Sean Eastman from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Go ahead, Sean.\nSean Eastman: Hi team, thanks for taking my questions. So nice start to the year. It does appear that you guys are running ahead of schedule relative to that more or less intact, full year guidance. So I know you guys are going to hate this one, but what should we take away from that? Is it that the balance of the year? Is now softer or more variable? Or is it that we can kind of consider the rest of the year having more cushion after this strong first quarter? How would you frame that?\nDuke Austin: Sean, as always, I think we take a prudent approach to our guidance and with three months into a year and was certainly some regulatory impacts and things of that nature that we see. So that supply chains everything else, I just \u2013 we didn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s prudent to step into, let\u2019s raise guidance, let\u2019s get out there on this. We took a prudent approach to it, hit it down the middle. Can we beat it? Should we beat it? Are we striving to beat it? Yes. But that said, there\u2019s factors out of our control that are out there that we want to be prudent about it. And I do believe we\u2019ve hit the guidance number and what we thought for the year, right down the middle and opportunities to beat it as well. And there\u2019s a range in there that we stood by. So I like where we sit. I do think it\u2019s nice to come out and have a strong first quarter, but again, you had some pull in a bit from the second and as well as strength to the later half. So we\u2019ve got to deliver on the backside of it. It\u2019s third and fourth quarter, always our biggest quarter. So that\u2019s where the bulk of earnings power is. And we need to make sure that over the next three or four months, it sets the way it should and I believe it will.\nSean Eastman: Okay. Thanks for that, Duke. And clearly, there\u2019s some noise around solar development pipelines and timing there, but I\u2019m just curious as you look out over the balance of this year and into next year, what you\u2019re seeing from sort of a CapEx toggling perspective? Are you seeing evidence that \u2013 those capital dollars that would\u2019ve gone into solar over the next 12, 24 months are kind of actively pivoting to T&D wind battery? What are you seeing there even just anecdotally, that\u2019d be interesting?\nDuke Austin: I mean, I think if they pivot to any of those markets, we\u2019re in a great place. So those pivots allow us to be extremely flexible with the client. And it says much about who we are and what we continue to say is our skeleton scope and flexibility along megawatts, gigawatts and renewables, as well as our T&D infrastructure is why we believe that the Blattner acquisition really puts us in the forefront of this energy transition, exactly your commentary and the portfolio that we built as a company allows the growth and the growth platform, even in an environment like this. As I said in the script, the glass is not full for us and we just need to deliver the solutions to the client.\nSean Eastman: Okay. Thanks, Duke. I\u2019ll turn it over there. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Go ahead, Andy.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Good morning, everyone. Congratulations, Duke and Derrick. Duke, can you give us more color into the drivers of your electric power organic growth in the quarter in the low 20% range? It seemed like a material step up from where you\u2019ve been. I know you mentioned, just more general spend on grid modernization. But did you see that large U.S. transmission project one last quarter start to ramp up? Or is this really just a pickup in sort of your MSA spend that all of your customers are within their existing contracts, increasing their level of spend given the environment?\nDuke Austin: I mean the larger project we discussed last quarter is in a renewable segment. So it\u2019s not a part of the electric segment. The overall company, if you look at organic growth basis, it\u2019s up 23% year-over-year. So I do think we\u2019re doing the right things. Do I think that\u2019s sustainable? No. And we\u2019ve talked about the growth rates that we believe are possible within the company. And look, we\u2019ve got a good head start on growth rates with the kind of a 23% organic growth. That said, we still will be treated about how we talk about the growth. We have done some things that allow us to organically grow this company meaningfully through our colleges and the way that we put kids in the field, young ones in the field. And I do think our safety records, the way we work with the client on the capital spends and collaborate will ultimately allow us to get those growth rates. We just \u2013 I think you can see it in the electric segment, the MSAs are getting bigger. We talked about the mega trends that are out there around EV, the hardening in the west, it continues up and down the west coast as well as over in the storm prone areas. So we\u2019re in a good spot and we continue to try to work with a client on their capital budgets.\nAndy Kaplowitz: And Duke, you only \u2013 you had a modest change some renewables margin that you mentioned, to 8.5% to 9% \u2013 from 9%. It doesn\u2019t seem like a big change in the context of \u2013 what seems like a pretty difficult supply chain environment for your customers. So maybe just talk about sort of the confidence level. I know that you\u2019ve talked about Blattner being sort of best in class and maybe that sort of what keeps you there and keeps you at high levels of margin, but just talk about the confidence level to achieve those margins this year.\nDuke Austin: I mean, I think we stand by the numbers and when we \u2013 8.5% to 9%, we really floored it and it gave you more variable. And I honestly \u2013 we\u2019re shooting for the top end of that. And the company strives to beat those margins and believe we can operate in double digits over time and we\u2019ll. So that said, I mean, I do believe we\u2019re in unprecedented times around supply chains and terrorists and wars and pandemics that we\u2019re still working through, but ultimately as we work with supply chains, it makes us a better company in understanding the verticals of the total cost of our projects. So that said, I do believe \u2013 as I said, the glasses have full, we\u2019re working with our clients on supply chains. We\u2019ve had to sequence work differently, do things differently than we ever have, but that\u2019s who we are. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do with the client to make sure that the ultimate project is a success for us and the customers. So we\u2019re doing those things, I like what we said.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Appreciate it, Duke.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer from Thompson, Davis. Go ahead, Adam.\nAdam Thalhimer: Hey, good morning guys. Derrick, sorry to see you go, enjoyed working with you. Congratulations, Jayshree. Hey, one of the things that stood out to me in the first quarter was the high operating margin in underground. Can you comment on that? And was there any thought to raising the margin guidance for the year for underground?\nDerrick Jensen: Yes, the first quarter, I mean, we\u2019ve anticipated, we were going to see an uptake, right? I mean, the biggest portion of pressure and underground over the last few years has been a COVID related in the industrial portion of it. As we came into 22, we anticipated, we were going to be largely past that. You\u2019re seeing that typically the underground \u2013 all of our segments typically have lower margins in the first quarter and most specifically in the underground group, but combination of coming on the other side of that industrial at a nice quarter. And then we did do some larger pipeline work as well, contributing. Good strong performance. When we think about the margins there, we\u2019re continuing to feel comfortable. We can see that up in the 7% range for 2022. And our longer term continue to see improve in our minds more towards that further upper single digit.\nDuke Austin: I want to also say Derrick not going anywhere, but that being said\u2026\nAdam Thalhimer: Well, he won\u2019t be on the call\u2026\nDuke Austin: You never know. We\u2019ve worked together a long time. So I would say, he\u2019ll be around. That said, the portfolio of the company we\u2019ve talked about in commented on it many times. And we\u2019ve said that if we start doing more underground, we\u2019ll get operating leverage. We\u2019re starting to see that come through on some of the gas margins, because if you\u2019re operating leverage on electric and your offices in the field, and you\u2019ll continue to see that to \u2013 going to get in those upper single digs, that\u2019s what we\u2019re striving for.\nAdam Thalhimer: Great. And then the other thing that struck me was zero acquisitions in the quarter. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever seen that. Can you just talk about your M&A outlook?\nDuke Austin: I think we\u2019ve always said that you have quarters that are \u2013 we have five, I believe in the fourth quarter, so it probably moves. And again, we\u2019re inquisitive. We look at companies, family businesses all the time. We see the right ones we lean in. I don\u2019t \u2013 there\u2019s nothing to think about it. We\u2019re not out looking, but we do have holes in regions. We do have things we would like to do as a company, we either organically grow it or look at acquisitions, not to signal a thing. It\u2019s the same process we\u2019ve used over the last six years. And we\u2019ll continue to do so.\nAdam Thalhimer: Thanks, guys.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Michael Dudas from Vertical Research. Go ahead, Michael.\nMichael Dudas: Good morning, Kip, Duke, and well done, Derrick.\nDerrick Jensen: Thank you.\nMichael Dudas: Duke, just two thoughts, one lot of activities, certainly given high natural gas prices here and abroad. Any observations on what the activity in the Gulf Coast and some of the LNG opportunities? And what your customers on industrial side, are they feeling much better? Are they moving through that deferred maintenance backlog pretty quickly. And then on the communication side, it seems like things are working in a good measure there. Are the opportunities and some of the workflow again, should start to accelerate as some of the 5G issues we\u2019ve been reading about start to alleviate. Thanks.\nDuke Austin: Yes. Thanks Mike. The industrial base, we talked about it before, when it was back in 2008, 2009 and they came out of it 2011, 2012, 2013. It was really kind of robust. I think you\u2019ll see that that those type of numbers coming through here. There\u2019s some capital projects for your plastics coming in online, big capital projects along the Gulf Coast, as well as LNG, so all those things provide opportunities for us around really every one of our service lines on the industrial side. So we\u2019re excited about those. And I do think we\u2019ve said all along, we have a great management team that really understands markets and position us quite well to take advantage of these opportunities as the market changes. So like our positioning as always, we stayed with it. We really work at that even when it causes a little bit of margin degradation. We keep our people, we work through them and make sure that we\u2019re lean as well as and capture the opportunities that we see in the industrial space, which we do. As far as communications, it\u2019s a robust market. The technology changes daily. I do believe we see more carriers working together around fiber, around high band \u2013 high bandwidth type scenarios. And so I do think that will ultimately drive the macro market for the foreseeable future, or certainly around our wireless capabilities. We\u2019ve invested there, we\u2019re working on that vertical as well as many others. So we sit nicely, we talked about $700 million plus this year in telecom, we stand by that and the margins are improving. Got a nice start here for the year, we like where we\u2019re going.\nMichael Dudas: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Brent Thielman from D.A. Davidson. Go ahead, Brent.\nBrent Thielman: Great. Thank you. All the best as well, Derrick. I guess, first question just on the underground business. It looked like \u2013 looked to me like a big jump in the total backlog, just first the 12 month backlog quarter-over-quarter. Just wondering what was driving that. Did you pick up some sort of longer-term capital projects, anything to read into there?\nDuke Austin: No, I mean, I list some opportunities in Canada. We took advantage of, we talked about that before on the large pipe side and some of that came through as well as just in general, our backlog there on the MSAs. And I do think it\u2019ll continue to grow and our industrial base has moved upward and we\u2019ll continue to do so in that segment.\nBrent Thielman: Okay. Appreciate that. And Duke the slide deck mentioned it, and it seems like utilities are talking more and more about it at least, but the hydrogen blending just among gas utilities. I mean, what kinds of opportunities could come from that per quanta? How do you play a role in terms of affecting that?\nDuke Austin: I mean, I think we\u2019re right in the middle of that in front of it. In fact, we see unique opportunities there it\u2019s early. But there is some blending going on. We\u2019re seeing some \u2013 one of our partners in Canada, I saw an announcement yesterday on some hydrogen blending there around buses and other things that are out there. So you\u2019re starting to see that as a fuel source. You\u2019ll continue \u2013 I believe, continue to see that as part of the solution on the transition and we\u2019re right in front of that. So I like what we said.\nBrent Thielman: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Alex Rigel from B. Riley. Go ahead, Alex.\nAlex Rigel: Thank you and very nice quarter gentlemen. Couple quick questions. First as it relates to EV charging stations, can you quantify the annual revenue opportunity of this business either, over the next year, over the next couple years? And what the margin profile of that could look like?\nDuke Austin: It\u2019s difficult for us to say exactly what the way we see that working out, because couple things, one is we want to participate on the larger scale, high voltage charging \u2013 larger scale charging station. So to say what that number is, I\u2019m not \u2013 I\u2019d be remiss at this point. It\u2019s not \u2013 it will drive the business, it\u2019s not something that is a billion dollar type number. I don\u2019t believe. So we\u2019ll see. That said, what\u2019s behind it on the grid is, I believe, probably one of the bigger drivers that we\u2019ll ever see and will ultimately change the security and almost rebuild it in many ways on the distribution networks. As well as when you start moving back and load the distribution networks, you\u2019re also loading back on your transmission throughout. So, I do believe that incremental fact is what we see more so. But we\u2019ll take advantage of our partnerships with the OEMs as well as the batteries, the way we can scale and our program on expense and capture as much of that spend as we can, but it does set us up to do other things as well the size charging in a programmatic way, which we like a lot.\nAlex Rigel: And then as it relates to the telecom business, how has the backlog changed over the last quarter or so? And how do you think backlog could change between now and year-end?\nDuke Austin: We paced the backlog. I mean, it\u2019s up quarter-over-quarter. It continues to look better. The markets are better. We\u2019ve been prudent about how we \u2013 how we\u2019ve taken backlog and what kind of backlog we have on a go-forward basis due to the fact that. When we started, we got some larger projects that obviously weighed down a bit and we\u2019ve said it before, I\u2019ll say it again, we need to get ourselves upwards in some margins to double-digit margins at parity with the electric segment, and we can and will. So that said, we\u2019ll take advantage of those opportunities in the cities that we\u2019re dense in as well as some of the wireless capabilities that we have now and obviously, our investment in Star and that technology, we\u2019re excited about and how we look at that in a programmatic way.\nDerrick Jensen: Against to year-end, backlog is relatively flat. It\u2019s about $1.2 billion, but it\u2019s continued to grow throughout from a year ago into today for certain.\nAlex Rigel: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Go ahead, Jamie.\nJamie Cook: Hi, good morning. Congrats on quarter and promotions. I guess my first question. The margins in electric power were a little lighter. I know you talked about the projects in Canada and COVID, but any way you can quantify that? And then it also struck me, you maintained your margin guidance despite that. So if the underlying business, the profitability is trending better than your expectations? And then second, underground and utility had better margins than I expected, which doesn\u2019t usually happen. I understand a lot of that stronghold, but any way you can parse out what\u2019s stronghold versus what the \u2013 how the profitability of the rest of the business is trending? Thank you.\nDerrick Jensen: Yes, Jamie. So, we had anticipated to have a lower margin than the electric power in this quarter, right? And when we talked about being around 10% in our original guidance, came in about that 9.5% overall. That is largely influenced by the Canadian work. The U.S. margins were effectively double-digit. Telecom did quite well, although that\u2019s slightly dilutive overall, but still well. But it\u2019s just that COVID dynamic that we leaned into in those two projects. We\u2019re trying to take a conservative approach. We feel like we have every reason to solve, we have recoverability there, but the Canadian weather type dynamic is press it. You saw Canada in kind of almost a clearly a low single-digit even breakeven type dynamic associated with those two projects, but are largely driven by those two projects. But that\u2019s quarterly only. It doesn\u2019t relate to any about the overall profitability for the year. Continue to quite confident in our ability to execute to the risk of electric power through the year, giving us confidence that actually, like you said, to reiterate the overall margin guidance for electric power. Underground, we had commented implicitly that we thought that coming out of a COVID environment, that the underground group would be able to be back into a margin profile closer to that 7% type range for the year. And it\u2019s really that lower first quarter dynamic that we\u2019ve always seen in the underground associated with the seasonality. But that second, third and fourth quarter continues to see the ability to have that higher margin profile averaging against it, getting it into that annual margin perspective. Industrial was a nice contributor to the first quarter, but honestly, across the board, we saw solid margins for the first quarter for the remainder of the group as well.\nDuke Austin: I like to add a little bit to you. We\u2019re on-boarding quite a few people, and I do think your on-boarding and also re-sequencing some work. It certainly just a bit, but we don\u2019t see that on a go-forward basis and have ourselves set up nicely for the rest of the year.\nJamie Cook: Okay. Thank you. Congrats again.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Go ahead Neil.\nNeil Mehta: Good morning team and congrats on the promotions in the quarter here. The first question was related to the current labor market conditions. As it pertains to Quanta\u2019s ability to scale up for higher activity over the next couple of years, has labor market tightness start to wane a bit? Or is it still an elevated headwind in the industry broadly? And then how do you think about your own competitive advantage as you have an advantage capability as it relates to labor relative to some of your competitors?\nDuke Austin: I mean, we\u2019re up 9,000 year-over-year employees. So, I do think we have the ability to scale that significantly with the colleges with what we\u2019ve done and what we\u2019ve invested in cross-skill labor, which is the core of this business. It really allows us to not only train, but getting the fill faster and we like a tight labor market in many ways. It separates us for the investments that we do put into our safety and our training, so I like it. We\u2019re in good shape. And I do think we can grow with the markets as we see them and work with our clients on our capital spends.\nNeil Mehta: The follow-up is just around Blattner. It\u2019s been a couple of months now since that\u2019s been brought into the portfolio. We spent some time talking about the uncertainty on solar development. But could you talk about cultural integration, how you\u2019re feeling about the achievability around targets as well from a financial perspective. And has it effect \u2013 has it impacted your ability in your go-to-market to your customers to have a more comprehensive platform?\nDuke Austin: I think when you look at the pandemic, the war, the \u2013 everything that you hear and maybe you\u2019ve heard and you see where we\u2019re at in results and how we\u2019re moving forward and reiterating guidance on Blattner as well as the company. We sit in the very forefront of the synergy transition. Blattner made us better and it allows us to have a different conversation around the transition on a go-forward basis for many, many years to come. I think they made us better to culturally, they\u2019re very much \u2013 you could take a mirror and look and you would see Quanta on the balance of plant renewable solar it\u2019s megawatts, gigawatts and I say dialogue with their clients, flexibility, scale, everything you\u2019d want and our ability to think differently and differentiate in markets that are, in many ways, hype from supply chain as well as regulatory effects. We can certainly be flexible. So that\u2019s a different discussion. It\u2019s something that we can provide to the client that separates Quanta even better than we were before.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks, Duke.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Noelle Dilts from Stifel. Go ahead, Noelle.\nNoelle Dilts: Hi and thank you for taking my question. First, I just wanted to go back to labor a little bit and maybe ask a question from a slightly different perspective. But I know that given your majority union labor, particularly on the electrical side, you have visibility into wage increases. But I\u2019m just curious if you could comment sort of on what you\u2019re seeing from a trend perspective in terms of wages within T&D. And again, if you could revisit the visibility you have into those increases. Thanks.\nDuke Austin: And it usually runs 3% to 5%, so I would say the upper end of that at this point, you\u2019re seeing 5% type increases across the board, some more in certain areas, but that\u2019s relatively below what we see and what we plan for as well. And I do think when we look at it, that\u2019s in many ways for us to see that \u2013 to see it coming a long time ago and allows a different conversation. We do have resources, Canadian resources and other ways that we can look at labor. So how we go about it, how we think the work and work plans will matter on a go forward basis. It separates Quanta, our ability in the field to think differently and differentiate in these markets are something that we like.\nNoelle Dilts: Sure. Okay, great. And then kind of recognizing your \u2013 what all of your guidance commentary already on the Blattner. I was just \u2013 I\u2019m just trying to get a better sense of like how to think about if we\u2019re seeing delays yet if MYR Group came out and kind of talked about the amount of work that they\u2019ve seen that\u2019s pushed a little bit to the right. I don\u2019t know if you could comment on if you\u2019re seeing delays today. I guess what I\u2019m trying to think about is if we do see some projects kind of put on pause, does that hit more in the third quarter and the fourth quarter because a lot of the channels for the projects that are happening now have already been sourced. Could you just talk about the timing and sort of what you\u2019re looking for as you think about the range of potential outcomes this year? Thanks.\nDuke Austin: No, I think the difference is, I\u2019ve said this before, is we\u2019re doing in 30, 40, 50 type projects, utility scale type projects on a given day. So where we couldn\u2019t really think of if we have a certain amount of customers that we work with, we can certainly broaden our customer base out and provide the same type of service that we have to our other customers. And the inbound calls are certainly exponential without \u2013 if we had any gap. So we feel good about the guidance. We feel good about where we\u2019re at. We have the ability to get to win solar battery or largely that segment is made up of much more than just wind, solar, battery and we have long-haul transmission interconnections, all kinds of things. And as a portfolio, we continue to believe we\u2019re in a really good spot for this transition, and it has not impacted Blattner or Quanta at this point.\nNoelle Dilts: Okay. Got it. Thanks.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Justin Hauke from Baird. Go ahead, Justin.\nJustin Hauke: Yes. Hi. Good morning and I guess since we\u2019re all congratulating, Derrick, I\u2019ll ask a question here for you. But I was just curious you talked about the unapproved change orders on the Canadian jobs. The balance last quarter is $370 million, and that\u2019s up from it has been pretty steady to $150 million. So I guess I\u2019m just curious what\u2019s the balance as of today? And then how much of your $650 million to $850 million guidance for the year is kind of conditional on getting those cleared this year?\nDuke Austin: Yes. So the balance you\u2019re making reference to is the 10-Q disclosure, which includes more than just the changeovers associated with these projects. That\u2019s an aggregate disclosure. That number is going to grow a little bit, it exceed $400 million at this stage in the game as an aggregate disclosure. I made reference to the specifics of these \u2013 unique to these two projects being about the four to five day impact to DSO. So it is the majority of those balances, but it is not all of those balances. And then I\u2019ll tell you that we do believe that one of the positions is something that we\u2019ll be looking to build. That project is as reach substantial completion, we\u2019ll be looking to bill and settle that within 2022, the other project will actually continue on into 2023 and even 2024 of that. So I think that you\u2019ll see some of that cash flow drift into there. Relative to the overall cash flow guidance for the year, the one that we \u2013 as I commented to that we look to be building this year that is included as part of the 2022 cash flow guidance.\nDerrick Jensen: Yes, Duke. I would say on the Canadian projects, when we think about it, longstanding customers on both projects, we\u2019re working with them. Many of the things that were anticipated at the start, such as your pandemics. The way that we build, the way that they building milestones, all those different things, the pandemics certainly impacted those things as well. So we\u2019re working with the client now on cash flows and things of that nature. We do not see any issues with that and we\u2019ll continue to collaborate there to get paid and ultimately, I believe both will be good projects.\nJustin Hauke: Okay. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I guess, the other one I have here, and I know this is kind of a moving target, but of the $3 billion of the renewable segment backlog. Can you quantify how much of that is solar projects? How much is wind? How much is battery? Just any color you can give on kind of the breakdown of that as it stands today.\nDuke Austin: I can, but I\u2019m not. And so one thing about that, what I would say is, your LNTPs like your limited notice to proceed. I think we\u2019re stacking the LNTPs a bit too on a go forward basis, because of the unknowns in many areas of commodities [indiscernible] so I do believe your backlog will be always be a little bit lumpier, but you\u2019re seeing exponential. So our exponential negotiation verbal awards in LNTPs is much larger than it\u2019s been over many years. So you will see that come in and if it doesn\u2019t go in 2022, it\u2019s going to go in 2023, 2024. So it\u2019s just building in many ways. And we still reiterate 2022 \u2013 reiterate guidance. We took that further approach to start with, our dialogues with the customers is fantastic. How we\u2019re working with supply chains, how we\u2019re working with them on sequencing variability, our ability to move and scale, I think is there. And it\u2019s more about how do we do all the work in 2023 and 2024 more so than learn about 2022 at this point. That\u2019s the way we see it.\nJustin Hauke: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Steven Fisher from UBS. Go ahead, Steven.\nSteven Fisher: Thanks and add my congratulations on the role changes and just to continue this discussion on the renewable side. It seems very clear that you think you could change your mix fairly seamlessly within Blattner. To the extent, it\u2019s needed. I guess I\u2019m curious, how do you factor the supply chain situation into that seamlessness? Like if you needed to shift to wind, is there enough lead time with the supply chain to manage that within 2022? And then I guess, related how varied is the response from your customer base in terms of when the solar impact might be, is it more \u2013 is it consistently, this is a 2022 uncertainty or is this maybe more 2023 uncertainty?\nDuke Austin: Steve, primarily talking about panels. So there\u2019s a lot of different things you can do around balance of plant besides panels. So some of them is re-sequencing, some of it\u2019s moving, when some of it\u2019s repowering, there\u2019s many things \u2013 someones moving into T&D. We can do all kinds of different aspects of these transitions within the energy space and even in the renewable segment. So our concerns, we work \u2013 is to work with the client to make sure anything that gets pushed into 2022, 2023, we have the ability to deliver. And that\u2019s the bigger concern is making sure that we have that capacity, as well as what\u2019s ongoing in 2022, we felt comfortable when we gave guidance. It was down a bit from the three plus that had been done with Blattner. We said that from the start, we felt like the supply chain would push a bit on it and it did. So that said, it\u2019s reiterated. We believe we have every ability to work through the supply chain aspects, as well as the tariff. And every day, the tariff gets a little bit clearer. And I do think that it\u2019s short term, because of the way that the memos are coming out. The things that we see are incrementally positive around crystal ones and things of that nature. I don\u2019t want to get into weeds on it, but I do believe that it\u2019s better. And you can\u2019t get to where you want to go in this transition without clearing these things up for the developer for ultimately the utility customer, which in many ways, your energy, your geopolitics around energy, your renewable certainly is a piece of that that would clear some of that up.\nSteven Fisher: Got it. And then it seems like there\u2019s some momentum building on the pipeline piece of the business. I\u2019m just curious where you see the biggest opportunities forming based on your customer discussions? Is it more things in Canada, you mentioned the big booking there earlier this year? Or is it the U.S.? Is it maybe traditional oil and gas? Or is it the carbon capture? Where is the biggest momentum building on the pipeline piece?\nDuke Austin: I think we\u2019re working with the client on their \u2013 the way that they view carbon-free, the way that they\u2019re transitioning to a cleaner fuels and how we\u2019re going to use pipe through LNG, all those kind of different aspects of it. So we\u2019re working with them quite a bit on what I would consider their profiles around the carbon environment. So you will see carbon frustration. You\u2019ll see hydrogen blending. You\u2019ll see LNG pipe. We\u2019ve said it all along, we\u2019ll be around the edges on that. Our Canadian business is going well today. I do think Lower 48 has some what I would consider opportunities, and we\u2019ll stay on the front side of that. But the portfolio itself, our LDC business, our industrial business, the way that we\u2019re moving what I would consider typical gas type resources over indel. Later is certainly something that we\u2019re doing and doing it well. So we\u2019re pleased.\nSteven Fisher: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Chad Dillard from Bernstein. Go ahead Chad.\nCharles Dillard: Hi, good morning guys.\nDuke Austin: Good morning Charles.\nCharles Dillard: So I want to go back to your EV charging opportunities that you talked about earlier on the call. So how differentiated is the programmatic approach that you guys are taking versus your competition? And then just in terms of customers, I have to imagine that you\u2019re expanding a little bit beyond the utility customers that you typically service. And I just want to understand go-to-market approach with these guys? And then lastly, just margins for EV charging, how does it compare versus your broader electric power segment?\nDuke Austin: When you look at EV charging, either from the OEM or from the charters theirselves as a business, it\u2019s certainly early. And I do think you\u2019re starting to see battery manufacturing, you\u2019re starting to see your OEMs move all towards batteries and probably, in my mind, much quicker than anyone anticipated. That said, the charging stations or high-voltage charging stations need to go quicker. And as you start to move into bigger vehicles, such as your trucks, your heavy-duty trucks, we\u2019ve signed a partnership with GM to the west on battery Silverados. We\u2019ve done a lot of things internally. So we\u2019re very close to the OEMs on what they\u2019re doing and believe that charging is here. It\u2019s coming quicker than thought and our ability to work with the utilities on how we build out that infrastructure is something that we sit right on the front of, and I do believe it provides significant opportunity not only for the charging station itself, but also on the backside of your grid and which is even what I\u2019ve said before, exponential in nature. So the opportunities there, how we \u2013 they are smaller projects, so you couldn\u2019t go do a one-off project in every city, it doesn\u2019t make sense. So you need a program to really for us to really scale it. And I do think those programs are large in nature and where we have density around the country, we\u2019re able to do these smaller type projects with the underground groups that we have. So lots of that makes sense for us, and we\u2019ll take advantage of those markets.\nCharles Dillard: Great. And then just a second question, just going back to the two Canadian projects with change orders. How big of a margin drag is baked in here your guidance for those projects?\nDuke Austin: I don\u2019t think when you see those projects, it\u2019s more cash drags than anything. It\u2019s just cash flows. And obviously, Canada is lower than the \u2013 we took a prudent approach to it because we need to execute the contingencies, but that said, I mean, it\u2019s Canada\u2019s down from Lower 48 a bit. When you look at the margin profile, so it\u2019s always been that way. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s new.\nDerrick Jensen: Yes, which is just the broader aspect of what we see from a Canada perspective versus what\u2019s happening unique gross margin in those projects the projects put a little bit of margin pressure in this quarter because we dealt with some conservatism relative to the new COVID impact, but the projects themselves are profitable and nice projects.\nDuke Austin: We\u2019re able to pursue those resources in Lower 48 as well.\nCharles Dillard: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude our Q&A. I would now like to turn it over to management for any closing remarks.\nDuke Austin: Yes, I want to thank Derrick for really standing by me as a partnership for the last six years as CFO, and it will be bounty in his new role. So I\u2019m looking forward to working with Jayshree\u2019s exceptional and she\u2019ll do a great job as CFO and as a team. We have a solid management team. The men and women in the field and what they\u2019re doing on a daily basis and they Quanta. So we\u2019re excited about it. We\u2019re excited where we\u2019re going. We appreciate what they do, and I want to thank you all for participating in our conference call. We appreciate your questions and ongoing interest in Quanta Services. Thank you. This concludes our call.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Duke Austin",
            "content": "Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Quanta Services first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. On the call today, I will provide operational and strategic commentary, and we'll then turn it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a review of our first quarter results and full year 2022 financial expectations. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions. Our first quarter results show that Quanta is off to a great start this year with quarterly revenues of $4 billion, each segment generated strong revenue growth during the quarter despite the impact of normal seasonality, with GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.57 and a record $1.37 respectively. Additionally, total backlog at the quarter end exceeded $20 billion for the first time, which continues to support our 2022 financial expectations. We continue to see opportunities across our service lines, driven by our collaborative solution-based approach. The growth of programmatic spending with existing and new customers and the favorable mega trends we discussed at our recent Investor Day, which provides strong visibility into near and long-term growth. Our Electric Power Infrastructure Solutions operations continued to perform well during the quarter, driven by broad based business strength from ongoing utility grid modernization and system hardening initiatives and solid and safe execution. Additionally, our communications operations are moving in the right direction, and performed well during the quarter. Our electric power outlook remains strong, driven primarily by increasing service line opportunities and market share gains on our base business. Further, we continue to actively pursue large new master service agreements, or MSAs, that are designed to modernize the grid and to support growing electric vehicle penetration and other need technology adoption and to harden the system to be more resilient to wildfire and severe weather events. We believe these trends provide opportunity for materially greater backlog levels this year. Our conversations about Quanta's EV charging program management solutions continues to advance with companies throughout the electric vehicle ecosystem. Our revenues from EV charging infrastructure work are relatively small, but are expected to increase significantly this year and beyond. We believe EV charging infrastructure opportunities are on the cusp of accelerating and are only just beginning. Additionally, we believe the need to modernize and enhance the power grid to enable higher levels of load growth and continuous power demand caused by growing EV penetration could create significant opportunity for Quanta. Our Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions segment performed well during the quarter. Many of the macroeconomic uncertainties we are managing through today were known unknowns when we announced our intention to acquire Blattner in September of 2021 and we have prudently taken these risks into consideration for our full year 2022 guidance. We also believe Quanta's and Blattner's market leading position, scope and scale and technology and geographic diversity, positions the company to manage through times of uncertainty. That said, we reiterate that we did not acquire Blattner for 2022. The addition of Blattner's utility scale renewable generation solutions to Quanta's existing holistic grid solutions transforms our ability to collaborate early with our customers their energy transition strategies over the coming decades, which we believe creates a value proposition unique to the industry. We are increasingly confident in our strategy to position Quanta as the infrastructure solutions leader in the energy transition. We are pleased with the performance of our underground utility and infrastructure solution segment, which delivered strong revenue growth and profitability in the quarter. In particular, our industrial services operations executed well and are experiencing strong demands as a global economy continues to recover and two years of pent up demand from deferred maintenance and capital spending resumes. We also continue to experience solid demand for our gas, utility and pipeline integrity services, which are driven by regulated spend to modernized systems, reduce methane emissions, ensure environmental compliance and improve safety and reliability. Looking through the coming years, we continue to see emerging opportunities for Quanta's underground utility and infrastructure solution operations playing evolving and increasing role with customers as they increasingly pursue strategies to reduce their carbon footprint and diversify their operations and assets towards greener business opportunities. As we discussed in detail a month ago during our 2022 Investor Day in New York City, Quanta is successfully executing on strategic initiatives to drive operational excellence, total cost solutions for our clients, profitable growth and value for our stakeholders. Our strategic initiatives, uniquely position us to not only capitalize on the mega trends, but also enhance our customer relationships and market positioning. As a result, we are able to collaborate with our clients to execute their capital deployment plans, even during challenging conditions like the ones we face today, including supply chain, inflation, COVID-19 and regulatory uncertainties. These dynamics are not easy to navigate, but we expect to continue to successfully manage through them. It is during these times that Quanta demonstrates its resilience, which we believe shows the strength of our operation's portfolio, strategic initiatives and platform of solutions. Furthermore, we are developing new solutions throughout the supply chain, which we believe will be a differentiator and will expand our customer base. We believe the glass out full and see these challenges as opportunities for us to take strategic actions, to further differentiate our solutions and mitigate risk for our company and our customers. Quanta is a portfolio of exceptional companies with geographic and service line diversity. We are anchored by our commitment to cross skill labor and our self-performed capabilities and remain dedicated to growing and enhancing our portfolios services, which strengthens our ability to capture more of a customer's large programmatic spending programs and to operate in a responsible and sustainable way, while maintaining a strong financial profile. Looking to the medium- and long-term as energy transition and carbon reduction initiatives accelerate, we believe the infrastructure investment and renewable generation necessary to support these initiatives are still in early stages of deployment. And that this is arguably the most exciting time in Quanta's history. We have profitably grown the company and executed well and expect to continue to do so. Demand for services is robust across our portfolio and driven by long-term visible and resilient energy transition, and technology enablement, mega trends. We are confident in the strategic initiatives. We are executing on the competitive position we have in the marketplace and our position \u2013 positive multiyear outlook. As a result, we believe Quanta has built a platform with the opportunity to deliver a 10% organic adjusted earnings per share CAGR and a strategy with the opportunity to deliver a 15% or better adjusted EPS CAGR through 2026. We are focused on operating the business for the long-term and expect to continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class build leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta space business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's diversity, unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset form the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO for his review of our first quarter results and 2022 expectations. Derrick? Thanks Derrick. Before going to Q&A, I wanted to thank and recognize Derrick for his many years of continued dedication to Quanta and for his partnership. This is a purposeful transition and is a role that will enhance our ability to reach our targets. I'm grateful Derrick embraced and led this transition and look forward to driving operations together. It is congratulations today, but maybe condolences later. I also want to congratulate Jayshree on her new role as CFO. She has been a great addition to our senior leadership team. I am excited about Quanta's future and look forward to working closely with Derrick and Jayshree and their new roles. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A. Yes, thank you. When we look at the business, we do look at it as a portfolio and I \u2013 we saw broad base growth across all segments. Sometimes the backlog within the segment's lumpy a bit, but the continued MSA growth from our base business on both gas, electric telecom, as well as renewables continues. And I don't see that stopping and we continue to see inbound calls daily on capital spends and how can we help on a programmatic way? So the company is in a really good position and I do believe backlog will grow, continue to grow. And we've talked about the growth of the company on a EPS basis. So we stand by. I mean the tariff commentary is valid and it's out there. So we \u2013 let's address it. When we talk about Blattner, we talk about the acquisition, we talk about megawatts, gigawatts and it's still the same. It's megawatt, gigawatts that we can change with our customers. It's much like MSAs and the larger customers we can flex to wind. We can flex the solar. We can flex the batteries. The segment is much bigger than just Blattner. It does have all \u2013 some of our larger transmission projects in it as well. We really like our positioning in these type of markets. It allows us to collaborate and provide solutions to the client, which ultimately puts us in a different position than others with the scale of the company. So in saying that with times of we've been through a pandemic, we've been through many, many things and through this company's existence, and we've continued to provide those solutions back to the client, collaborate that's who we are that's who Blattner is. And we continue to be positive \u2013 incrementally positive about the markets. That said, look, it's \u2013 solar is up in the air due to the tariff. And I do think it's \u2013 we've got incrementally positive news as this memos continue to come out. We believe that ultimately the energy transition is happening. Solar will be a big piece of that as well as wind and batteries. So that's said long-term, the demand is outpaces anything and any kind of movement you would have and solar would go into 2023, 2024 build. So we stand by our 2022 guidance that we've given on Blattner $2.5 billion and stand by \u2013 continue standby with the tariff, without a tariff and the future is just continues to get better. Sure. Sean, as always, I think we take a prudent approach to our guidance and with three months into a year and was certainly some regulatory impacts and things of that nature that we see. So that supply chains everything else, I just \u2013 we didn't feel like it's prudent to step into, let's raise guidance, let's get out there on this. We took a prudent approach to it, hit it down the middle. Can we beat it? Should we beat it? Are we striving to beat it? Yes. But that said, there's factors out of our control that are out there that we want to be prudent about it. And I do believe we've hit the guidance number and what we thought for the year, right down the middle and opportunities to beat it as well. And there's a range in there that we stood by. So I like where we sit. I do think it's nice to come out and have a strong first quarter, but again, you had some pull in a bit from the second and as well as strength to the later half. So we've got to deliver on the backside of it. It's third and fourth quarter, always our biggest quarter. So that's where the bulk of earnings power is. And we need to make sure that over the next three or four months, it sets the way it should and I believe it will. I mean, I think if they pivot to any of those markets, we're in a great place. So those pivots allow us to be extremely flexible with the client. And it says much about who we are and what we continue to say is our skeleton scope and flexibility along megawatts, gigawatts and renewables, as well as our T&D infrastructure is why we believe that the Blattner acquisition really puts us in the forefront of this energy transition, exactly your commentary and the portfolio that we built as a company allows the growth and the growth platform, even in an environment like this. As I said in the script, the glass is not full for us and we just need to deliver the solutions to the client. I mean the larger project we discussed last quarter is in a renewable segment. So it's not a part of the electric segment. The overall company, if you look at organic growth basis, it's up 23% year-over-year. So I do think we're doing the right things. Do I think that's sustainable? No. And we've talked about the growth rates that we believe are possible within the company. And look, we've got a good head start on growth rates with the kind of a 23% organic growth. That said, we still will be treated about how we talk about the growth. We have done some things that allow us to organically grow this company meaningfully through our colleges and the way that we put kids in the field, young ones in the field. And I do think our safety records, the way we work with the client on the capital spends and collaborate will ultimately allow us to get those growth rates. We just \u2013 I think you can see it in the electric segment, the MSAs are getting bigger. We talked about the mega trends that are out there around EV, the hardening in the west, it continues up and down the west coast as well as over in the storm prone areas. So we're in a good spot and we continue to try to work with a client on their capital budgets. I mean, I think we stand by the numbers and when we \u2013 8.5% to 9%, we really floored it and it gave you more variable. And I honestly \u2013 we're shooting for the top end of that. And the company strives to beat those margins and believe we can operate in double digits over time and we'll. So that said, I mean, I do believe we're in unprecedented times around supply chains and terrorists and wars and pandemics that we're still working through, but ultimately as we work with supply chains, it makes us a better company in understanding the verticals of the total cost of our projects. So that said, I do believe \u2013 as I said, the glasses have full, we're working with our clients on supply chains. We've had to sequence work differently, do things differently than we ever have, but that's who we are. That's what we're trying to do with the client to make sure that the ultimate project is a success for us and the customers. So we're doing those things, I like what we said. I want to also say Derrick not going anywhere, but that being said... You never know. We've worked together a long time. So I would say, he'll be around. That said, the portfolio of the company we've talked about in commented on it many times. And we've said that if we start doing more underground, we'll get operating leverage. We're starting to see that come through on some of the gas margins, because if you're operating leverage on electric and your offices in the field, and you'll continue to see that to \u2013 going to get in those upper single digs, that's what we're striving for. I think we've always said that you have quarters that are \u2013 we have five, I believe in the fourth quarter, so it probably moves. And again, we're inquisitive. We look at companies, family businesses all the time. We see the right ones we lean in. I don't \u2013 there's nothing to think about it. We're not out looking, but we do have holes in regions. We do have things we would like to do as a company, we either organically grow it or look at acquisitions, not to signal a thing. It's the same process we've used over the last six years. And we'll continue to do so. Yes. Thanks Mike. The industrial base, we talked about it before, when it was back in 2008, 2009 and they came out of it 2011, 2012, 2013. It was really kind of robust. I think you'll see that that those type of numbers coming through here. There's some capital projects for your plastics coming in online, big capital projects along the Gulf Coast, as well as LNG, so all those things provide opportunities for us around really every one of our service lines on the industrial side. So we're excited about those. And I do think we've said all along, we have a great management team that really understands markets and position us quite well to take advantage of these opportunities as the market changes. So like our positioning as always, we stayed with it. We really work at that even when it causes a little bit of margin degradation. We keep our people, we work through them and make sure that we're lean as well as and capture the opportunities that we see in the industrial space, which we do. As far as communications, it's a robust market. The technology changes daily. I do believe we see more carriers working together around fiber, around high band \u2013 high bandwidth type scenarios. And so I do think that will ultimately drive the macro market for the foreseeable future, or certainly around our wireless capabilities. We've invested there, we're working on that vertical as well as many others. So we sit nicely, we talked about $700 million plus this year in telecom, we stand by that and the margins are improving. Got a nice start here for the year, we like where we're going. No, I mean, I list some opportunities in Canada. We took advantage of, we talked about that before on the large pipe side and some of that came through as well as just in general, our backlog there on the MSAs. And I do think it'll continue to grow and our industrial base has moved upward and we'll continue to do so in that segment. I mean, I think we're right in the middle of that in front of it. In fact, we see unique opportunities there it's early. But there is some blending going on. We're seeing some \u2013 one of our partners in Canada, I saw an announcement yesterday on some hydrogen blending there around buses and other things that are out there. So you're starting to see that as a fuel source. You'll continue \u2013 I believe, continue to see that as part of the solution on the transition and we're right in front of that. So I like what we said. It's difficult for us to say exactly what the way we see that working out, because couple things, one is we want to participate on the larger scale, high voltage charging \u2013 larger scale charging station. So to say what that number is, I'm not \u2013 I'd be remiss at this point. It's not \u2013 it will drive the business, it's not something that is a billion dollar type number. I don't believe. So we'll see. That said, what's behind it on the grid is, I believe, probably one of the bigger drivers that we'll ever see and will ultimately change the security and almost rebuild it in many ways on the distribution networks. As well as when you start moving back and load the distribution networks, you're also loading back on your transmission throughout. So, I do believe that incremental fact is what we see more so. But we'll take advantage of our partnerships with the OEMs as well as the batteries, the way we can scale and our program on expense and capture as much of that spend as we can, but it does set us up to do other things as well the size charging in a programmatic way, which we like a lot. We paced the backlog. I mean, it's up quarter-over-quarter. It continues to look better. The markets are better. We've been prudent about how we \u2013 how we've taken backlog and what kind of backlog we have on a go-forward basis due to the fact that. When we started, we got some larger projects that obviously weighed down a bit and we've said it before, I'll say it again, we need to get ourselves upwards in some margins to double-digit margins at parity with the electric segment, and we can and will. So that said, we'll take advantage of those opportunities in the cities that we're dense in as well as some of the wireless capabilities that we have now and obviously, our investment in Star and that technology, we're excited about and how we look at that in a programmatic way. I like to add a little bit to you. We're on-boarding quite a few people, and I do think your on-boarding and also re-sequencing some work. It certainly just a bit, but we don't see that on a go-forward basis and have ourselves set up nicely for the rest of the year. I mean, we're up 9,000 year-over-year employees. So, I do think we have the ability to scale that significantly with the colleges with what we've done and what we've invested in cross-skill labor, which is the core of this business. It really allows us to not only train, but getting the fill faster and we like a tight labor market in many ways. It separates us for the investments that we do put into our safety and our training, so I like it. We're in good shape. And I do think we can grow with the markets as we see them and work with our clients on our capital spends. I think when you look at the pandemic, the war, the \u2013 everything that you hear and maybe you've heard and you see where we're at in results and how we're moving forward and reiterating guidance on Blattner as well as the company. We sit in the very forefront of the synergy transition. Blattner made us better and it allows us to have a different conversation around the transition on a go-forward basis for many, many years to come. I think they made us better to culturally, they're very much \u2013 you could take a mirror and look and you would see Quanta on the balance of plant renewable solar it's megawatts, gigawatts and I say dialogue with their clients, flexibility, scale, everything you'd want and our ability to think differently and differentiate in markets that are, in many ways, hype from supply chain as well as regulatory effects. We can certainly be flexible. So that's a different discussion. It's something that we can provide to the client that separates Quanta even better than we were before. And it usually runs 3% to 5%, so I would say the upper end of that at this point, you're seeing 5% type increases across the board, some more in certain areas, but that's relatively below what we see and what we plan for as well. And I do think when we look at it, that's in many ways for us to see that \u2013 to see it coming a long time ago and allows a different conversation. We do have resources, Canadian resources and other ways that we can look at labor. So how we go about it, how we think the work and work plans will matter on a go forward basis. It separates Quanta, our ability in the field to think differently and differentiate in these markets are something that we like. No, I think the difference is, I've said this before, is we're doing in 30, 40, 50 type projects, utility scale type projects on a given day. So where we couldn't really think of if we have a certain amount of customers that we work with, we can certainly broaden our customer base out and provide the same type of service that we have to our other customers. And the inbound calls are certainly exponential without \u2013 if we had any gap. So we feel good about the guidance. We feel good about where we're at. We have the ability to get to win solar battery or largely that segment is made up of much more than just wind, solar, battery and we have long-haul transmission interconnections, all kinds of things. And as a portfolio, we continue to believe we're in a really good spot for this transition, and it has not impacted Blattner or Quanta at this point. Yes. So the balance you're making reference to is the 10-Q disclosure, which includes more than just the changeovers associated with these projects. That's an aggregate disclosure. That number is going to grow a little bit, it exceed $400 million at this stage in the game as an aggregate disclosure. I made reference to the specifics of these \u2013 unique to these two projects being about the four to five day impact to DSO. So it is the majority of those balances, but it is not all of those balances. And then I'll tell you that we do believe that one of the positions is something that we'll be looking to build. That project is as reach substantial completion, we'll be looking to bill and settle that within 2022, the other project will actually continue on into 2023 and even 2024 of that. So I think that you'll see some of that cash flow drift into there. Relative to the overall cash flow guidance for the year, the one that we \u2013 as I commented to that we look to be building this year that is included as part of the 2022 cash flow guidance. I can, but I'm not. And so one thing about that, what I would say is, your LNTPs like your limited notice to proceed. I think we're stacking the LNTPs a bit too on a go forward basis, because of the unknowns in many areas of commodities [indiscernible] so I do believe your backlog will be always be a little bit lumpier, but you're seeing exponential. So our exponential negotiation verbal awards in LNTPs is much larger than it's been over many years. So you will see that come in and if it doesn't go in 2022, it's going to go in 2023, 2024. So it's just building in many ways. And we still reiterate 2022 \u2013 reiterate guidance. We took that further approach to start with, our dialogues with the customers is fantastic. How we're working with supply chains, how we're working with them on sequencing variability, our ability to move and scale, I think is there. And it's more about how do we do all the work in 2023 and 2024 more so than learn about 2022 at this point. That's the way we see it. Steve, primarily talking about panels. So there's a lot of different things you can do around balance of plant besides panels. So some of them is re-sequencing, some of it's moving, when some of it's repowering, there's many things \u2013 someones moving into T&D. We can do all kinds of different aspects of these transitions within the energy space and even in the renewable segment. So our concerns, we work \u2013 is to work with the client to make sure anything that gets pushed into 2022, 2023, we have the ability to deliver. And that's the bigger concern is making sure that we have that capacity, as well as what's ongoing in 2022, we felt comfortable when we gave guidance. It was down a bit from the three plus that had been done with Blattner. We said that from the start, we felt like the supply chain would push a bit on it and it did. So that said, it's reiterated. We believe we have every ability to work through the supply chain aspects, as well as the tariff. And every day, the tariff gets a little bit clearer. And I do think that it's short term, because of the way that the memos are coming out. The things that we see are incrementally positive around crystal ones and things of that nature. I don't want to get into weeds on it, but I do believe that it's better. And you can't get to where you want to go in this transition without clearing these things up for the developer for ultimately the utility customer, which in many ways, your energy, your geopolitics around energy, your renewable certainly is a piece of that that would clear some of that up. I think we're working with the client on their \u2013 the way that they view carbon-free, the way that they're transitioning to a cleaner fuels and how we're going to use pipe through LNG, all those kind of different aspects of it. So we're working with them quite a bit on what I would consider their profiles around the carbon environment. So you will see carbon frustration. You'll see hydrogen blending. You'll see LNG pipe. We've said it all along, we'll be around the edges on that. Our Canadian business is going well today. I do think Lower 48 has some what I would consider opportunities, and we'll stay on the front side of that. But the portfolio itself, our LDC business, our industrial business, the way that we're moving what I would consider typical gas type resources over indel. Later is certainly something that we're doing and doing it well. So we're pleased. Good morning Charles. When you look at EV charging, either from the OEM or from the charters theirselves as a business, it's certainly early. And I do think you're starting to see battery manufacturing, you're starting to see your OEMs move all towards batteries and probably, in my mind, much quicker than anyone anticipated. That said, the charging stations or high-voltage charging stations need to go quicker. And as you start to move into bigger vehicles, such as your trucks, your heavy-duty trucks, we've signed a partnership with GM to the west on battery Silverados. We've done a lot of things internally. So we're very close to the OEMs on what they're doing and believe that charging is here. It's coming quicker than thought and our ability to work with the utilities on how we build out that infrastructure is something that we sit right on the front of, and I do believe it provides significant opportunity not only for the charging station itself, but also on the backside of your grid and which is even what I've said before, exponential in nature. So the opportunities there, how we \u2013 they are smaller projects, so you couldn't go do a one-off project in every city, it doesn't make sense. So you need a program to really for us to really scale it. And I do think those programs are large in nature and where we have density around the country, we're able to do these smaller type projects with the underground groups that we have. So lots of that makes sense for us, and we'll take advantage of those markets. I don't think when you see those projects, it's more cash drags than anything. It's just cash flows. And obviously, Canada is lower than the \u2013 we took a prudent approach to it because we need to execute the contingencies, but that said, I mean, it's Canada's down from Lower 48 a bit. When you look at the margin profile, so it's always been that way. It's not something that's new. We're able to pursue those resources in Lower 48 as well. Yes, I want to thank Derrick for really standing by me as a partnership for the last six years as CFO, and it will be bounty in his new role. So I'm looking forward to working with Jayshree's exceptional and she'll do a great job as CFO and as a team. We have a solid management team. The men and women in the field and what they're doing on a daily basis and they Quanta. So we're excited about it. We're excited where we're going. We appreciate what they do, and I want to thank you all for participating in our conference call. We appreciate your questions and ongoing interest in Quanta Services. Thank you. This concludes our call."

            "content": "Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today we announced record first quarter revenues of $4 billion. Net income attributable to commerce stock was $85 million or $0.57 per diluted share and adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure was a record for the first quarter at $1.37. Our electric power revenues were $2.1 billion, a quarterly record and a 28% increase from compared to the first quarter of 2021. This increase is primarily due to growth in spending by our utility customers on grid modernization resulting in increased demand for our electric power services, as well as approximately $75 million in revenues attributable to required businesses. Electric segment operating income margins in 1Q 2022 are 9.5%, a 30 basis point improvement compared to 9.2% in 1Q 2021. However, margins were slightly impacted during the quarter for certain Canadian projects due to substantial COVID delays. That said our U.S. electric operations continued to perform well delivering another double-digit quarter. Also included within our electric segment, our communications operations, which delivered mid-single digit margins during the quarter, and remain on track for upper-single digit margins for the year. Renewable energy infrastructure segment revenues for 1Q 2022 were $876 million a substantial increase from 1Q 2021, primarily due to $470 million in revenues attributable to required businesses. Operating income margins in 1Q 2022 were 8% in line with our expectations for the quarter, but lower than the 11.8% in 1Q 2021, due to the change in the mix of work as a result of the acquisitions and due to normal project variability. Underground utility and infrastructure segment revenues were $951 million for the quarter, 48% higher than 1Q 2021, reflecting increased levels of activity across all of our segment operations. Operating income margins for the segment were 5.1%, 370 basis points higher than 1Q 2021. The margin improvement was largely due to the increase in revenues and improved performance from our industrial operations with COVID-related headwinds previously impacting these operations, largely absent in this segment for 1Q 2022. One below the line item I want to mention is our 1Q 2022 other income and expense. As I mentioned last quarter, we hold an investment in a fixed wireless broadband technology provider. Then the March of 2022 became Starry Group Holdings, Inc., a publicly traded company at which point our interest became a common equity interest in the publicly traded company. We re-measured the fair value of this investment based on the market price of the publicly traded company stock as of March 31, 2022, which resulted in the recognition of an unrealized loss at $8.4 million during the quarter. The value of this investment must be mark-to-market at each quarter and as long as this investment is held. On a non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share and adjusted EBITDA basis, we've removed the unrealized loss associated with this investment for the quarter and plan to continue adjusting our non-GAAP measures for mark-to-market volatility in future periods. Our total backlog was a record $20.5 billion at the end of the first quarter. Additionally, 12 month backlog of $11.5 billion also represents a quarterly record. Although, backlog includes some nice project awards during the first quarter, our backlog growth continues to be driven primarily by multi-year MSA programs of North American utilities, which we believe reinforces the repeatable and sustainable nature of the largest portion of our revenues and earnings. As expected for the first quarter of 2022, we had negative free cash flow and non-GAAP measure of $16 million compared to $49 million of positive free cash flow in 1Q 2021. Net cash provided by operating activities during the first quarter of 2022 was lower due to higher revenues and corresponding increases in working capital demands compared to 1Q 2021. Day sales outstanding or DSO measured 80 days for the first quarter of 2022, a decrease of nine days compared to the first quarter of 2021 and the same as year-end. The decrease from 1Q 2021 was primarily due to the favorable impact of the acquisition of Blattner, which has traditionally had a lower DSO than certain of our other larger operating companies. This positive impact was partially offset by continued elevated working capital requirements associated with two large Canadian transmission projects, driving an increase in contract assets, which we've discussed in prior quarters. Both projects were incrementally impacted by COVID during the first quarter, increasing our change order positions. In total, the amounts being pursued are currently impacting DSOs by as much as four to five days. However, one of those projects reached substantial completion during the first quarter and we expect those contract assets to be billed and collected over the remainder of the year. As of March 31, 2022, we have total liquidity of approximately $2 billion and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.3 as calculated under our credit agreement. We expect continued earnings growth and cash generation to support our ability to efficiently delever over the following quarters, while continuing to create shareholder values through our dividend and repurchase programs, as well as strategic acquisitions. Through the date of this earnings release, we've required approximately $21 million worth of stock since the beginning of the year, as part of our repurchase program and we continue to evaluate potential acquisitions that fit our strategic objectives. Turning to guidance, I'm pleased with the start to our year and have little change for our overall expectations for 2022. We now expect electric power revenues to range between $8.3 billion and $8.4 billion with margin expectations unchanged ranging between 10.7% and 11.3%. Similarly, we're increasing our underground revenue expectations to range between $4.1 billion and $4.3 billion with margins expected to range between 6.5% and 7.5% consistent with our previous expectations. Our renewable segment revenue expectations are unchanged. However, with the uncertainty on project timing attributable to potential supply chain disruptions, we have widened our operating margin range a bit to 8.5% and 9%. We believe these dynamics are short-term in nature and the opportunity to overcome them and deliver margins at our original 9% level and above continues to exist. Additionally, higher interest rates on our variable rate debt are resulting in increased interest expense for the year, which we now expect to range between $113 million and $117 million for the year. In the aggregate, our consolidated expectations for adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA remain unchanged for the year, reflecting the strength of our portfolio. For additional information, please refer to our outlet summary, which can be found in the Financial Info section of our IR website at quantaservices.com. From a long-term perspective, as we laid out in April at our Investor Day, the tailwinds behind our end markets and our industry-leading solutions present management with the opportunity to deliver significant shareholder value through organic growth and strategic capital deployment through 2026 and beyond. And speaking of management, as we disclosed in today's additional release, I'm pleased to announce my plan transition from the role of Chief Financial Officer to the new role of Executive Vice President of Business Operations, transitioning into the role of Chief Financial Officer is Jayshree Desai. Jayshree has been a valuable partner to me and Duke and all of our leadership teams since she joined the organization in 2020. And she is well suited to guide our financial organization going forward. It has been the highlight of my career to service Quanta's Chief Financial Officer over the last 10 years. As the longest standing employee of Quanta, I've spent almost half my life helping to lead our financial organization and support our world-class operating leadership. I'm incredibly excited to continue supporting our strategic growth within the different capacity going forward. I'll now turn the call back over to Duke for closing remarks. Yes, the first quarter, I mean, we've anticipated, we were going to see an uptake, right? I mean, the biggest portion of pressure and underground over the last few years has been a COVID related in the industrial portion of it. As we came into 22, we anticipated, we were going to be largely past that. You're seeing that typically the underground \u2013 all of our segments typically have lower margins in the first quarter and most specifically in the underground group, but combination of coming on the other side of that industrial at a nice quarter. And then we did do some larger pipeline work as well, contributing. Good strong performance. When we think about the margins there, we're continuing to feel comfortable. We can see that up in the 7% range for 2022. And our longer term continue to see improve in our minds more towards that further upper single digit. Thank you. Against to year-end, backlog is relatively flat. It's about $1.2 billion, but it's continued to grow throughout from a year ago into today for certain. Yes, Jamie. So, we had anticipated to have a lower margin than the electric power in this quarter, right? And when we talked about being around 10% in our original guidance, came in about that 9.5% overall. That is largely influenced by the Canadian work. The U.S. margins were effectively double-digit. Telecom did quite well, although that's slightly dilutive overall, but still well. But it's just that COVID dynamic that we leaned into in those two projects. We're trying to take a conservative approach. We feel like we have every reason to solve, we have recoverability there, but the Canadian weather type dynamic is press it. You saw Canada in kind of almost a clearly a low single-digit even breakeven type dynamic associated with those two projects, but are largely driven by those two projects. But that's quarterly only. It doesn't relate to any about the overall profitability for the year. Continue to quite confident in our ability to execute to the risk of electric power through the year, giving us confidence that actually, like you said, to reiterate the overall margin guidance for electric power. Underground, we had commented implicitly that we thought that coming out of a COVID environment, that the underground group would be able to be back into a margin profile closer to that 7% type range for the year. And it's really that lower first quarter dynamic that we've always seen in the underground associated with the seasonality. But that second, third and fourth quarter continues to see the ability to have that higher margin profile averaging against it, getting it into that annual margin perspective. Industrial was a nice contributor to the first quarter, but honestly, across the board, we saw solid margins for the first quarter for the remainder of the group as well. Yes, Duke. I would say on the Canadian projects, when we think about it, longstanding customers on both projects, we're working with them. Many of the things that were anticipated at the start, such as your pandemics. The way that we build, the way that they building milestones, all those different things, the pandemics certainly impacted those things as well. So we're working with the client now on cash flows and things of that nature. We do not see any issues with that and we'll continue to collaborate there to get paid and ultimately, I believe both will be good projects. Yes, which is just the broader aspect of what we see from a Canada perspective versus what's happening unique gross margin in those projects the projects put a little bit of margin pressure in this quarter because we dealt with some conservatism relative to the new COVID impact, but the projects themselves are profitable and nice projects."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Kip Rupp, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nKip Rupp: Thank you and welcome everyone to the Quanta Services fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings conference call. This morning, we issued a press release announcing our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results, which can be found in the Investor Relations' section of our website at quantaservices.com. As highlighted in our earnings release this morning, as well as in the earnings press release announcing our earnings call schedule a couple of weeks ago, we've updated our earnings call format and supplemental materials. As a result, shortly after the release of our financial results this morning, we posted our fourth quarter and full year 2023 operational and financial commentary and our 2024 outlook expectation summary on Quanta's Investor Relations website.

With that, I would like to now turn the call over to Mr. Duke Austin, Quanta's President and CEO. Duke?\nDuke Austin: Thanks Kip. Good morning everyone and welcome to the Quanta Services fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings conference call. This morning, we reported fourth quarter and full year 2023 results, which included double-digit growth in revenues and earnings and included a number of record financial metrics, which we believe reflects robust demand for our services and solid execution. Total backlog at year-end was $30.1 billion, which we believe reflects the value of our collaborative client relationships, and evidences the momentum we see for 2024. Of note, Quanta has delivered record revenue six of the last seven years. Six consecutive years of record adjusted EBITDA and seven consecutive years of record adjusted diluted earnings per share. These results were built off an industry-leading operational and financial platform, and made possible by our more than 50,000 dedicated Quanta employees, whom we believe are the very best in our industry. As outlined in our operational and financial commentary, 2023 was a significant year for Quanta strategically, operationally, and financially. And though we are proud of our many accomplishments during the year, we continue to look forward with excitement towards the multiyear strategic initiatives, we are working on and the goals we expect to achieve in this and the coming years. We are positioning Quanta for decades of expected necessary infrastructure investment and believe our service line diversity creates platforms for growth that expand our total addressable market. Our portfolio approach and focus on craft skill labor is strategic advantage that provides us the ability to manage risk and ship resources across service lines and geographies. Which we believe will become increasingly important, as the energy transition accelerates. We believe our portfolio approach positions us well to allocate resources to the opportunities we find the most economically attractive and to achieve operating efficiencies and consistent financial results. I will now turn the call over to Jayshree Desai, Quanta's CFO, to provide a few remarks about our results and 2024 guidance, and then we will take your questions. Jayshree?\nJayshree Desai: Thanks Duke and good morning everyone. Quanta completed the year with fourth quarter revenues of $5.8 billion, net income attributable to common stock of $210.9 million or $1.42 per diluted share, and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.04. Adjusted EBITDA was $550.2 million or 9.5% of revenue. Of note, our cash flow in the fourth quarter and for the full year was very strong with both setting period records. For the fourth quarter and full year of 2023, we had free cash flow of $915.5 million and $1.2 billion, respectively, which exceeded the upper end of our free cash flow guidance expectations. We ended the year with liquidity and a balance sheet that will position us to support our organic growth expectations in 2024, annually increase our dividend, and opportunistically invest capital. To that end, in January, we acquired two companies for aggregate consideration of approximately $425 million. This morning, we also provided our full year 2024 financial expectations, which calls for another year of profitable growth with record revenues, improved margins and opportunity for double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDA, adjusted earnings per share, and free cash flow. We believe our expectations demonstrate the strength of our portfolio approach to the business, our commitment to our long-term strategy, our favorable end market trends, and our competitive position in the marketplace. Additional details and commentary about our 2024 financial guidance can be found in our operational and financial commentary and outlook expectation summary, both of which are posted on our IR website. With that, we are happy to answer your questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chad Dillard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nChad Dillard: Hi, good morning everyone.\nDuke Austin: Good morning.\nJayshree Desai: Morning.\nChad Dillard: So, I want to spend some time on margins, particularly in Electric Power. So, I think in some of the prepared remarks or it sounds like there is some pressure happening in Canada. So, I just wanted to know whether you plan to right-size the business? Or is there no future work out there to continue at the current footprint? Just trying to think through how you think about the trade-off there?\nDuke Austin: Yes. Thanks Chad. When looking at margins, I think we've always discussed around 10% at the Electric segment, 10.5% with the impact of Puerto Rico is how you should guide it. We continue to believe that's the case. Is there opportunity for upside on the Electric side? Yes. We do believe there is. It depends on storms. It depends on utilizations. We need to get through some things. As we start our larger projects in the Renewable segment and in the Electric segment, we're in early stages of the larger dynamics such as SunZia, other big programs that we're starting. So, as we get good cadence and as we continue to win these larger projects in the future, the cadence will be -- we're always running through contingency philosophically. We need to operate in the field. We need to execute as we do, we'll release contingencies, as we see it. And normally, there's upside opportunities in both segments. We've historically operated in both segments in double-digit type margins, and we believe we can operate there in the future. Certainly, we've been through some things where the business has been with the panels and some other things on the renewable side. That's starting to kind of starting to get good cadence there. It's early, we'll see where we get to by the end of the year, but we feel confident over time in our historical numbers that we'll be able to operate in double-digits if you -- especially if you take both segments as one. If the crews do move from one to the other. So, for me, the Renewable segment and Electric segment, as I see it, put them together and we should be able to operate in double-digits.\nChad Dillard: Okay, that's helpful. And so in your prepared commentary, you mentioned that visibility of high-voltage transmission projects is improving. Can you give a little more on this, what's changed? And how much more visibility do you have?\nDuke Austin: Look, we've said all along, and we think that the nation's grid is underinvested in transmission. I don't think that's news to anyone that we said, if you go to Europe and you look at the way the things happen in the corridor is it three times bigger than anything we have here. We've barely invested in the transmission system of this nation. And in order to do the things that we want to do with this transition, whether it be EV, whether it be batteries, your fuel switching, the cheapest form to get the generation to the customer is transmission. So, I think that's the key to this and the whole key of the securitization of the country as well as for us to get to a carbon-free environment, we'll have to build tons and tons of transmission. So, I think you're -- we're just getting started in these bigger projects. We're seeing more and more come in our way. There is some push on clean affordable energy. But I believe that the transmission is the cheapest way as well. So, I -- we're seeing more on the books. We're continuing to be around the edges on all those projects. So Chad starting, and we're confident in our ability to execute and win.\nChad Dillard: Great. Thanks. I'll leave it there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ati Modak with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nAti Modak: Hi, good morning team. Thank you for taking my questions. I just wanted to touch on the acquisitions. You previously talked about your thought process there. I think it was mostly trying to internally source your capabilities. But maybe if you can touch about -- touch on the two acquisitions you've made and the thought process around the industrial solutions side, in particular, as you go forward from here?\nDuke Austin: Yes, the acquisitions, as we look at them, truthfully, I think we've always said that the industrial business, as far as in the UUI segment, we like it, it's resilient. The nature of it is much like our MSAs on other businesses. The environmental solutions that we can provide on the industrial base, we believe that the base of the business will stay for decades, you're going to continue to refine, continue to have plastics and things of that nature done on the Gulf Coast. So, the assets that keep the plants running and things of that nature will certainly be here for a long time and be more valuable over time. We're in the cables [ph] business as well, where we have high voltage and now, our environmental solutions business, we like them all through. There are synergies along. There was very little overlap in the business. So, it gives us really a good customer base. We don't apply synergies in our model. So there is synergies for sure. As we move forward, we'll identify them and I think you'll see them show up on our numbers. So, we like the management team on our industrial side. We're fully behind that for the long run, great opportunity to get an environmental piece of the business here and really see our service line grow and expand in that area. So, again, we're -- the portfolio is something that we value, as things move around, but the industrial base and the industrial side of our business is great, coming off a near record or record year, very close to it. So, we're confident long-term and -- the second piece of it was an internal supply chain that we feel like necessary to, from a cost standpoint as well as to make sure that we can -- we self-perform about 85% of the work, between 85% and 90%, and the tooling and all the equipment and things that we can do from this platform really allow us to make sure that we can man the work, man of people, any kind of bottlenecks for us, they're not acceptable. So, we'll make sure the supply chains are steady and that we can continue to grow.\nAti Modak: Thanks for that. And then I think there has been a lot of market concerns around how your customers are thinking of projects. And I know you've mentioned the requirement around transmission and guide came in a lot better than what I think a lot of the Street was expecting. But maybe you can touch on how your customers are thinking of this year and the sensitivity around this potential regulatory changes, anything that's latest in your conversations?\nDuke Austin: Yes, I'm not seeing that. I'm not hearing that, I'm not hearing our customers back off anything. I've heard some switching from distribution and transmission, but their capital continues to grow. You have data centers, you have load growth, that's pushing in every jurisdiction we're in. The data centers are not going away, that load is not going away. The onboarding of manufacturing is not going away. EV penetration may stall a bit. We've always said we think that this is a longer build, not shorter. So, they were saying 2030, maybe it's 2040, maybe it's 2050 for all EV penetration. But that's something on the distribution system that is not impacting as bad yet. We do need to plan as an industry. We do need to get in front of that, but we also have to be cognizant of the state regulators and as well as affordability at the customer level, ultimate customers. So, yes, we're concerned with that as an industry. So, distribution is something that you may see slip a little. The demand and what needs to be done to the system in order to electrify it, securitize it, is there, and it has -- it remains. Data center push is now in generation switching is now. So, you'll see probably some switch into transmission. It does not affect our portfolio whatsoever. The numbers you can see them. We stand by them. We've given good guidance. We've taken all this into account, when we give out the 12-month guidance. And look, it's a prudent number in my mind. It's right where we need to be.\nAti Modak: All right. Appreciate the answers. Thank you. I'll turn it over.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey good morning team. Thanks for giving me time. Duke, I'm actually going to flip the last question. So, we've seen your utility customers kind of raise CapEx in high teens. Even Illinois companies came out with their latest CapEx guidance, double-digit increases. What is factored into your 2024 guidance? Should we assume that the forward-looking capital plan increases are factored in? Or are you still learning them? And I guess what I'm asking is what kind of conservatism are you baking into 2024 guidance, as you've seen a pretty significant step up, quite frankly, a step change in utility CapEx plans?\nDuke Austin: I think we're in a good spot for the start of the year, where we're at. And when we look at it, we look at our historicals, and we're going to talk about EPS growth. If you look at EPS growth, what we've said is we grow double-digits in the CAGR basis, have the opportunity to grow 15%, the transition, everything that's ongoing that can allow that 15% growth. If you go back and you look at our historicals, it's 15% growth. So, do I think there's opportunity? Yes. It depends on storms. It depends on other things that are out of our control at times. So, we'll take a prudent nature to it, election year, things like that. We've taken all that into account, when we give guidance. I do think there's opportunities for us to grow 15%. I do. We've said it. And I don't think it's changed. I think -- when I look at it, when I look at our opportunities, given the fact that the tech push on AI, on all the things that you can do from a data center, it's backing up everything plus. So, your fuel switching is one thing, but when you think through it and you see the load growth in data centers, it really pushes the transmission system and generation system because at tech, they want clean power, and they want it now. So, I think that push on the industry is something that is why you're seeing such confidence in the capital spend in the transmission systems. It does affect our distribution a bit. I said it, but, we've taken all that into account, I expect latter half of the year, distribution to grow as well in a meaningful way. So, it's something that we've taken into account.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. That is very clear. Thank you. And then maybe could you just address risks related to the SunZia project, and I'm not sure if you can, but can you quantify what are you modeling is, is EBITDA for those projects?\nDuke Austin: We don't look at it project-by-project like that. I'm confident in the numbers we've given. SunZia, the whole thing was about 50 miles. I think the job is 1,000 miles. We have plenty of room to move and work with our client on stretch, as a right away here or there, but that is not a meaningful -- a bit will alleviate as we move through. We're not concerned. The project starts now, ramps throughout the year, part of why you see some guidance move into the second half as the ramp on these larger projects in the back half. But they're known projects, they're contracted projects. So, that's the difference is we know we're moving on and now and we know what the ramp looks like, in the back half. And I do expect us to get more awards in the back half. And so we'll continue to ramp. It's just -- it's some seasonality that you see early that ramps in the back. But SunZia, I'm not concerned at this point.\nDurgesh Chopra: Thank you very much. Appreciate the time guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Fisher: Thanks. Good morning and congrats on a nice 2023. Just curious how we should think about that 20% growth in the renewables segment in 2024? Clearly, there's SunZia, I think there's maybe a piece of PTT, that you are allocating into that segment. So, how should we think about the growth rate of the renewables business separately from those couple of pieces? And really just trying to think about the big picture here about renewables. I mean SunZia is kind of a unique project. But at a higher level, to what extent do we think like this is the year where Renewables kind of breaks that out from a more restrained 2022 and 2023 from some of the various uncertainties that have been going on in the marketplace?\nDuke Austin: I don't know what our growth was last year, but it was significant. So, -- and then 2022 is significant. So, I think from our standpoint, we've had phenomenal growth in the renewables side, both in 2022 and 2023. Off those big growth on balance of plant, solar, wind. And when you go into 2024, we've got good growth in double-digits plus, on both sides of that, whether it be our legacy business or balance of plant going forward. We continue to see 2025, 2026 and beyond, there is some pressure with -- when you think about when wins starting to come in for us with SunZia and other repower opportunities there, Steve. So, we're starting to see some assets like cranes, things like that, that we were sitting on some indirect costs on the wind side of the business, that will help the overall margins in the back half. As we see wind come in with the solar as that mix starts to change a bit more you'll continue to see margins move up due to some of the overheads and indirect costs that move through, as well as our Canadian operations are looking better from the renewable side. So, all those things will come into impact, you'll continue to see margins move up and I do believe the top line in the renewables segment will move up.\nSteven Fisher: Great, that's very helpful. And then when you think Duke about the portfolio approach that you've been implementing, where do you think that's going to have the biggest benefit impact in 2024? Curious where the kind of the directional flow is mostly going to be? Is it still sort of underground work moving to Electric segment, Canada to the U.S.? Anything else to note about how to think about the portfolio approach in 2024?\nDuke Austin: From a service line standpoint, I think our distribution business will start to ramp in the back half more than it is today. Canada geographically is down. We know it's down. We're seeing latter half of this year, 2024 with awards and how we're starting projects in the latter half of 2024 and also what we're seeing from government to the west in BC, as well as the East. So, we're seeing the amount of capital getting put into the same kind of fuel switching you're seeing here in the States. So, I do believe Canada starts to move back into good markets, call it, late 2024 and beyond, as far as we can see. So, it does help us there. But we've rightsized that business. And yes, it's pulling margins down a bit in the States, but the assets there. We're utilizing here, in Lower 48 as well as across the company. So that's where the portfolio comes into play, the front side of our business, things like that, that we have there, that gives us some abilities, here in the Lower48. Look, we're not hitting on all cylinders. So, I would say, as the portfolio as that moves forward, both geographic and service lines, as they mature, you'll see some undergrounding move from gas to electric. But look, we're taking advantage of those leverage -- things we can leverage at the local levels and making sure that we're in the right place. I'm not too concerned with if we're pulling electric pipe or gas or whatever it is, we're just trying to optimize our resources. So, that's the big thing. It should increase margins. We're not where we want to be from a company in the portfolio, a double-digit type EBITDA margins, across the board. We do believe we can operate there. So, as we look at the portfolio and everything that we're doing, it should be the optimization of our margins. But I will say that if you look at the way of adjusted returns, our returns are going up substantially. You can see it with cash, you can see return on invested capital.\nSteven Fisher: Very good. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Dudas: Morning Jayshree, Kip, Duke.\nJayshree Desai: Morning.\nDuke Austin: Hi Mike.\nMichael Dudas: Duke, it seemed like the life plug went off with your utility clients and everybody because of AI, as you discussed earlier, data center, demand that people want to just get out and spend and do stuff. How do you -- how you guys allocate your very dear and tight resources relative to your client base or where the opportunities are? And is the demand for contracting and your type of services very tight right now relative to supply? And how is that relative to your current ability to bring folks on and under graduation rates at the colleges. And are the utilities maybe pushing off some of those retirements because they're just going to be so busy?\nDuke Austin: I think on the transition side of the business, we're seeing a significant amount of ramp there in areas. It's spotty. No, we're not anywhere near capacity from my standpoint. I think we've got a lot of room. We've not seen anything that would back us off, to say that we're concerned with labor at this point. We're in good shape. Look, we have a good look at it, a good five-year look at what we see, very close to the business, very close to our clients. We work with them quite a bit on long-term natures and programs and what's going on, when you go from West to East and the coverage that we have, you're able to see the things that we know are going to happen, they start in the West like when you start to see vehicle penetration in the West, you know it's going to move across the country. And we're starting to see those impacts. I think Edison had a good report on kind of how their grid is changing. And I think it gets -- it gets worse, not better. I think capital goes up even from what they're seeing. And I think you'll continue to see that, as you see the total cost impacts of energy really require the grid to be robust to create the environment that you want, which is the customer builds going down, you have to build this infrastructure out to get the total cost of energy down. It's happened in Europe, you'll start to see more and more of that getting fed, which is really important for us to get in front of the necessary capital at the local level, at the state levels, so they understand in order to get the cost down and you've got to get the infrastructure. And it's also security for the country, is to get the grid where we need it to be. And you're going to see that with loads going up in places, no one expected load to go up like this. The areas that you're seeing a load, they did not expect data cities to come in and take, call it, 3 gigs, 5 gigs and they don't want -- they want secure power. So sometimes that requires multiple lines. And when you look at all this and you look at what's coming at you, you're backed up by this. The technology that's coming into the world that requires our services, across the board, in the utilities rooting growth business, they're growing. And it's necessary for them to spend capital, it's just a matter of getting it through from a federal push into the state regulators. And we kind of said that all along that this is necessary, it's going to come to a head, and you're seeing it. This transition will be noisy. It will be things that you'll see, it's not straight up every day. It's going to have CAGR look to it at times, in parts of the business. That's why I like the portfolio so much, as we can move around and kind of get through this transition here and continue to what I believe perform at a high level and deliver the results we have.\nMichael Dudas: Excellent. Good. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gus Richard with Northland Capital. Please proceed with your question.\nGus Richard: Yes, thanks for taking the question. The AI data center, not only needs a lot of power, but it needs a lot of bandwidth. And I'm just wondering if you guys are seeing along with the AI boom, a big demand for your comm services? And is there any synergies between those two pieces, the power and the comp? thank you.\nDuke Austin: I think so. When you look at our communications business, I mean, we've done nicely, we're growing double-digits. It's not something that we're investing a lot of capital in, but I do see it. I do see technology itself needing -- you're going to strip some of the fiber capacity, are stripping some of the fiber capacity out there. And especially when you start putting big data in different parts of the country, it's much easier to build a telecom line and get telecom service, than it is transmission. So, sometimes in my mind, you'll see data centers start to locate, where the power is, almost. And right now, if you can't get power to the East and you can't get it to the West, you start to see the Midwest build. And then if you can't get it there, you start to see the South build. So, everywhere that you can get affordable power today or in the next 24 months, you'll start to see data centers go up. Even if there's not fiber, so you're going to get fiber going to them, at some point, nodes. Certainly, some of it is getting alleviated with satellites, things like that, but still you need the fiber on the ground. So, I do believe they'll push it, and yes, there's opportunity.\nGus Richard: Got it. And then just on the underground side. There's -- there was a pause in three years out on build-out of LNG export capacity. And I'm just wondering what you're seeing in that business are projects still moving forward? And just the state of natural gas and that business for you?\nDuke Austin: It's $500 million to $600 million in the guidance, it will be $500 million to $600 million, next year, in the next year and the next year. We don't -- we're not going to -- that's why we moved off long-haul pipe and big pipe. We just can't -- we can't build the business around it. It's certainly something, we'll take every bit of opportunity we can. We did $1 billion plus in big pipe last year. So, you're seeing some offset in the top line because of that because we guided $500 million to $600 million. Is there opportunities for $1 billion plus? Sure. But the government regulations and difficulty in building a large diameter pipe, anywhere in the country, but Canada is -- a little better opportunities in Canada. But we're just -- we can't take that and build it in guidance and give you any kind of firmness to our numbers. So, I -- look, I think there's opportunities. But it doesn't -- LNG, if everything goes and it doesn't go, it doesn't matter to the guide we've given you. It doesn't matter.\nGus Richard: Got it. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Brophy with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Brophy: Yes, thanks. Good morning everybody. I wanted to ask about free cash flow guidance. was quite a bit higher than we were expecting? Your free cash flow conversion is above long-term targets this year. How much of this is more of the onetime collections that you called out, in the commentary versus potentially a more permanent improvement in free cash flow conversion, here as renewable energy mix has grown? Thanks.\nJayshree Desai: Yes. As we've talked about in the Investor Day, and as you've seen in the fourth quarter last year, the renewable business with the way those contracts are set up, has a very favorable cash flow profile and the working capital profile is very good. And so, as revenue and renewable side pushes up, you'll see better conversion just as we saw in 2023. Going into 2024, we did take that into consideration, but we did range it. There's a range for a reason. As I just said, renewables can push us in the higher end of that range of 45% to 55% that we talked about at Investor Day. But if you've got -- if it's more growth coming from our electric and underground segments, it can push the other way, right? And so we've given you what we think is a good prudent look at where free cash flow will be. But having said that, if the mix of work between renewables and electric and utility underground changes, you will see outside of that range or either a high end of that range or the low end of the range. The one-time cash flow impact of the large Canadian Renewable project, we do believe we will collect next year. We -- excuse me, in 2024. We -- as we talked about the last several quarters, as construction winds down, which we expect in the next several months, a couple of months. Conversations with the customer continues to go very well. So, we're optimistic we'll be able to collect all of that as well this year. But on an ongoing basis, I think you would be good to look at a range of between 45% to 55% conversion.\nBrian Brophy: Okay. Thanks. And then just wanted to touch on how you're thinking about capital allocation more broadly this year given that you're in line with some of your longer term leverage targets now? Should we be expecting more buybacks this year? How are you thinking about M&A? Any thoughts there would be helpful. Thanks.\nDuke Austin: Sure. We'll be opportunistic in how we look at it like we have in the past, no different. We are below some of our targets. It allows us flexibility, which I like a lot. Certainly, there's things that we can be opportunistic in. But the strategies won't change. We've laid out a good strategy plan. Can we get -- can we go faster, as we delever, things like that, sure. So, I think ultimately, we're moving faster across the five-year plan. As we said last quarter and continue to say, we're moving faster through it. We'll be opportunistic with the balance sheet. But again, with the conservative nature of the company and -- we'll -- we have opportunities, across multiple fronts, and we'll take advantage of all of them.\nBrian Brophy: Excellent. Thanks. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Martin Malloy with Johnson Rice. Please proceed with your question.\nMartin Malloy: Good morning. I wanted to ask about the trend with higher attach rates for energy storage associated with utility scale solar and wind projects and could you maybe speak to how that impacts your scope of work and margins?\nDuke Austin: The tax rate, the PTC and ITCs and those things, they're in place. I've not seen them come off at this point, whether it's IRA or PTC, how it moves in or ITCs, how it moves in, I think it's the same. Now, if it was repealed, I do -- you could see some issues there. I do not believe that will be the case going forward. That's something that gives certainty to the industry. So, I continue to believe that how you get them and our customers have been able to get in front of this. And I think our customer base is -- these things kind of figured out. The IRA has some different things, you can get more, not less. So, I actually think we're in early stages of the IRA, which should give it's going forward, not less. So, I see it as more opportunities. We should check the box on from a standpoint of U.S.-type apprenticeship programs, U.S. type materials, things of that nature, even internally. So, we really set ourselves up to take advantage of that for the customer. So, I feel good about it. I'm not seeing it slow down from that standpoint. I mean, everyone's watching from our customer viewpoint, they got it figured out and tax credit figured out.\nMartin Malloy: I'm sorry, I appreciate your comments. I wasn't clear, I was actually asking about energy storage, tax rate, at utility scale solar and wind projects with adding energy storage in conjunction with those projects and what that means for your scope of work and profit margin soon?\nDuke Austin: I think -- I mean, I think I understand what you're saying. But from a tax rate standpoint, I don't know if it does much, but from a combination, it actually expands many of the projects that we've built in the past are adding storage to it. Our, storage business is growing nicely, and our battery business is growing nicely. So, I like that. We continue to add that capability and get more refine there, as we move forward across geographies. So, when you ask that, I think it's just more opportunity to increase the size and scope of these projects.\nMartin Malloy: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis & Company. Please proceed with your question.\nAdam Thalhimer: Hey good morning guys. Congrats on the solid result. Quick question on the project funnel for Blattner, is that still dominated by solar? Or are you seeing wind pick up?\nDuke Austin: I mean, SunZia is a nice project that's on the wind side. We're seeing more opportunities repower. I think you'll see a lot of repower work going forward. You're in early stages of the cycle coming back from wind. So, we're starting to see more and more in the outer years of wind coming into the portfolio. I don't think it's going to be any like large windfall in 2024 by any means, but I do think 2025, 2026, it starts to move up significantly as we move out in the outer years, the curves get, where wind makes a lot more sense in areas. So, you'll start -- transmission needs to be built, too. Like we've got to get the transmission built before you can get wind out. And that's the other piece of this is you need long-haul transmission to move wind out of those sources into load centers. So, it's very taking out the egg sometimes, and I do think both are coming into play. And the Wind business gets better from, call it, 2024 on.\nAdam Thalhimer: That's great. And then I also wanted to get your early thoughts on PTT and the timing of the capacity expansion there?\nDuke Austin: We continue to expand capacity there. There's a lot of things that we can do internally to expand. We're expanding like the business ever more so today than we did -- today looked at it. So, it gets better the opportunities and synergies, the things that we can do for the clients with PTT, U.S. base, Union in Pennsylvania, a great place to invest and we're lacking that business a lot.\nAdam Thalhimer: Thanks Duke.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sangita Jain with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nSangita Jain: Thank you so much for taking my question. So, you gave earnings cadence of -- which is kind of back-end loaded, which is generally normal for you. And I was wondering if it was just weather and seasonality or if there is something more to read into how the projects ramp as the year progresses?\nJayshree Desai: No, I think it's mostly seasonality typical of what we run. We did -- as Duke talked about, there's a little bit of Canadian pressure in the first half of the year. But it's just normal seasonality. And we do expect with the additional SunZia work and some other projects, more back half weighted, but again, nothing more unusual than that.\nSangita Jain: Great. Thank you. And I just have one follow-up. And that\u2019s on the renewables side. The Biden moratorium on the tariffs comes to an end in June. So, I was wondering if you're seeing any kind of pull-forward on the part of developers, who want to install within that 180-day timeline between purchase and installation?\nJayshree Desai: The customers we work with, have been planning for the tariff situation for a while now. So, I think we're -- our customers have been planning this moratorium being lifted in June. So, it's -- I don't know -- I can't answer directly, if we're seeing some pull forward, I just know that the customers we've been working with for years, now planned for this very well. They know how to work this. They've been prudent about how they think about their panel procurement, and we continue to see good growth in our renewable segment as a result.\nSangita Jain: Great. Awesome. Thank you so much for answering my questions.\nDuke Austin: Thank you.\nOperator: Seeing no other questions in queue. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks.\nDuke Austin: Yes. Thank you. I want to thank the 50,000-plus men and women, in the field, they're the best in the business. They allow us to have these kind of calls and give this kind of profile for the company, so, we thank them. And I want to thank you for participating in the conference call. We appreciate your questions and your ongoing interest in Quanta Services. This concludes our call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Duke Austin",
            "content": "Thanks Kip. Good morning everyone and welcome to the Quanta Services fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings conference call. This morning, we reported fourth quarter and full year 2023 results, which included double-digit growth in revenues and earnings and included a number of record financial metrics, which we believe reflects robust demand for our services and solid execution. Total backlog at year-end was $30.1 billion, which we believe reflects the value of our collaborative client relationships, and evidences the momentum we see for 2024. Of note, Quanta has delivered record revenue six of the last seven years. Six consecutive years of record adjusted EBITDA and seven consecutive years of record adjusted diluted earnings per share. These results were built off an industry-leading operational and financial platform, and made possible by our more than 50,000 dedicated Quanta employees, whom we believe are the very best in our industry. As outlined in our operational and financial commentary, 2023 was a significant year for Quanta strategically, operationally, and financially. And though we are proud of our many accomplishments during the year, we continue to look forward with excitement towards the multiyear strategic initiatives, we are working on and the goals we expect to achieve in this and the coming years. We are positioning Quanta for decades of expected necessary infrastructure investment and believe our service line diversity creates platforms for growth that expand our total addressable market. Our portfolio approach and focus on craft skill labor is strategic advantage that provides us the ability to manage risk and ship resources across service lines and geographies. Which we believe will become increasingly important, as the energy transition accelerates. We believe our portfolio approach positions us well to allocate resources to the opportunities we find the most economically attractive and to achieve operating efficiencies and consistent financial results. I will now turn the call over to Jayshree Desai, Quanta's CFO, to provide a few remarks about our results and 2024 guidance, and then we will take your questions. Jayshree? Good morning. Yes. Thanks Chad. When looking at margins, I think we've always discussed around 10% at the Electric segment, 10.5% with the impact of Puerto Rico is how you should guide it. We continue to believe that's the case. Is there opportunity for upside on the Electric side? Yes. We do believe there is. It depends on storms. It depends on utilizations. We need to get through some things. As we start our larger projects in the Renewable segment and in the Electric segment, we're in early stages of the larger dynamics such as SunZia, other big programs that we're starting. So, as we get good cadence and as we continue to win these larger projects in the future, the cadence will be -- we're always running through contingency philosophically. We need to operate in the field. We need to execute as we do, we'll release contingencies, as we see it. And normally, there's upside opportunities in both segments. We've historically operated in both segments in double-digit type margins, and we believe we can operate there in the future. Certainly, we've been through some things where the business has been with the panels and some other things on the renewable side. That's starting to kind of starting to get good cadence there. It's early, we'll see where we get to by the end of the year, but we feel confident over time in our historical numbers that we'll be able to operate in double-digits if you -- especially if you take both segments as one. If the crews do move from one to the other. So, for me, the Renewable segment and Electric segment, as I see it, put them together and we should be able to operate in double-digits. Look, we've said all along, and we think that the nation's grid is underinvested in transmission. I don't think that's news to anyone that we said, if you go to Europe and you look at the way the things happen in the corridor is it three times bigger than anything we have here. We've barely invested in the transmission system of this nation. And in order to do the things that we want to do with this transition, whether it be EV, whether it be batteries, your fuel switching, the cheapest form to get the generation to the customer is transmission. So, I think that's the key to this and the whole key of the securitization of the country as well as for us to get to a carbon-free environment, we'll have to build tons and tons of transmission. So, I think you're -- we're just getting started in these bigger projects. We're seeing more and more come in our way. There is some push on clean affordable energy. But I believe that the transmission is the cheapest way as well. So, I -- we're seeing more on the books. We're continuing to be around the edges on all those projects. So Chad starting, and we're confident in our ability to execute and win. Yes, the acquisitions, as we look at them, truthfully, I think we've always said that the industrial business, as far as in the UUI segment, we like it, it's resilient. The nature of it is much like our MSAs on other businesses. The environmental solutions that we can provide on the industrial base, we believe that the base of the business will stay for decades, you're going to continue to refine, continue to have plastics and things of that nature done on the Gulf Coast. So, the assets that keep the plants running and things of that nature will certainly be here for a long time and be more valuable over time. We're in the cables [ph] business as well, where we have high voltage and now, our environmental solutions business, we like them all through. There are synergies along. There was very little overlap in the business. So, it gives us really a good customer base. We don't apply synergies in our model. So there is synergies for sure. As we move forward, we'll identify them and I think you'll see them show up on our numbers. So, we like the management team on our industrial side. We're fully behind that for the long run, great opportunity to get an environmental piece of the business here and really see our service line grow and expand in that area. So, again, we're -- the portfolio is something that we value, as things move around, but the industrial base and the industrial side of our business is great, coming off a near record or record year, very close to it. So, we're confident long-term and -- the second piece of it was an internal supply chain that we feel like necessary to, from a cost standpoint as well as to make sure that we can -- we self-perform about 85% of the work, between 85% and 90%, and the tooling and all the equipment and things that we can do from this platform really allow us to make sure that we can man the work, man of people, any kind of bottlenecks for us, they're not acceptable. So, we'll make sure the supply chains are steady and that we can continue to grow. Yes, I'm not seeing that. I'm not hearing that, I'm not hearing our customers back off anything. I've heard some switching from distribution and transmission, but their capital continues to grow. You have data centers, you have load growth, that's pushing in every jurisdiction we're in. The data centers are not going away, that load is not going away. The onboarding of manufacturing is not going away. EV penetration may stall a bit. We've always said we think that this is a longer build, not shorter. So, they were saying 2030, maybe it's 2040, maybe it's 2050 for all EV penetration. But that's something on the distribution system that is not impacting as bad yet. We do need to plan as an industry. We do need to get in front of that, but we also have to be cognizant of the state regulators and as well as affordability at the customer level, ultimate customers. So, yes, we're concerned with that as an industry. So, distribution is something that you may see slip a little. The demand and what needs to be done to the system in order to electrify it, securitize it, is there, and it has -- it remains. Data center push is now in generation switching is now. So, you'll see probably some switch into transmission. It does not affect our portfolio whatsoever. The numbers you can see them. We stand by them. We've given good guidance. We've taken all this into account, when we give out the 12-month guidance. And look, it's a prudent number in my mind. It's right where we need to be. I think we're in a good spot for the start of the year, where we're at. And when we look at it, we look at our historicals, and we're going to talk about EPS growth. If you look at EPS growth, what we've said is we grow double-digits in the CAGR basis, have the opportunity to grow 15%, the transition, everything that's ongoing that can allow that 15% growth. If you go back and you look at our historicals, it's 15% growth. So, do I think there's opportunity? Yes. It depends on storms. It depends on other things that are out of our control at times. So, we'll take a prudent nature to it, election year, things like that. We've taken all that into account, when we give guidance. I do think there's opportunities for us to grow 15%. I do. We've said it. And I don't think it's changed. I think -- when I look at it, when I look at our opportunities, given the fact that the tech push on AI, on all the things that you can do from a data center, it's backing up everything plus. So, your fuel switching is one thing, but when you think through it and you see the load growth in data centers, it really pushes the transmission system and generation system because at tech, they want clean power, and they want it now. So, I think that push on the industry is something that is why you're seeing such confidence in the capital spend in the transmission systems. It does affect our distribution a bit. I said it, but, we've taken all that into account, I expect latter half of the year, distribution to grow as well in a meaningful way. So, it's something that we've taken into account. We don't look at it project-by-project like that. I'm confident in the numbers we've given. SunZia, the whole thing was about 50 miles. I think the job is 1,000 miles. We have plenty of room to move and work with our client on stretch, as a right away here or there, but that is not a meaningful -- a bit will alleviate as we move through. We're not concerned. The project starts now, ramps throughout the year, part of why you see some guidance move into the second half as the ramp on these larger projects in the back half. But they're known projects, they're contracted projects. So, that's the difference is we know we're moving on and now and we know what the ramp looks like, in the back half. And I do expect us to get more awards in the back half. And so we'll continue to ramp. It's just -- it's some seasonality that you see early that ramps in the back. But SunZia, I'm not concerned at this point. I don't know what our growth was last year, but it was significant. So, -- and then 2022 is significant. So, I think from our standpoint, we've had phenomenal growth in the renewables side, both in 2022 and 2023. Off those big growth on balance of plant, solar, wind. And when you go into 2024, we've got good growth in double-digits plus, on both sides of that, whether it be our legacy business or balance of plant going forward. We continue to see 2025, 2026 and beyond, there is some pressure with -- when you think about when wins starting to come in for us with SunZia and other repower opportunities there, Steve. So, we're starting to see some assets like cranes, things like that, that we were sitting on some indirect costs on the wind side of the business, that will help the overall margins in the back half. As we see wind come in with the solar as that mix starts to change a bit more you'll continue to see margins move up due to some of the overheads and indirect costs that move through, as well as our Canadian operations are looking better from the renewable side. So, all those things will come into impact, you'll continue to see margins move up and I do believe the top line in the renewables segment will move up. From a service line standpoint, I think our distribution business will start to ramp in the back half more than it is today. Canada geographically is down. We know it's down. We're seeing latter half of this year, 2024 with awards and how we're starting projects in the latter half of 2024 and also what we're seeing from government to the west in BC, as well as the East. So, we're seeing the amount of capital getting put into the same kind of fuel switching you're seeing here in the States. So, I do believe Canada starts to move back into good markets, call it, late 2024 and beyond, as far as we can see. So, it does help us there. But we've rightsized that business. And yes, it's pulling margins down a bit in the States, but the assets there. We're utilizing here, in Lower 48 as well as across the company. So that's where the portfolio comes into play, the front side of our business, things like that, that we have there, that gives us some abilities, here in the Lower48. Look, we're not hitting on all cylinders. So, I would say, as the portfolio as that moves forward, both geographic and service lines, as they mature, you'll see some undergrounding move from gas to electric. But look, we're taking advantage of those leverage -- things we can leverage at the local levels and making sure that we're in the right place. I'm not too concerned with if we're pulling electric pipe or gas or whatever it is, we're just trying to optimize our resources. So, that's the big thing. It should increase margins. We're not where we want to be from a company in the portfolio, a double-digit type EBITDA margins, across the board. We do believe we can operate there. So, as we look at the portfolio and everything that we're doing, it should be the optimization of our margins. But I will say that if you look at the way of adjusted returns, our returns are going up substantially. You can see it with cash, you can see return on invested capital. Hi Mike. I think on the transition side of the business, we're seeing a significant amount of ramp there in areas. It's spotty. No, we're not anywhere near capacity from my standpoint. I think we've got a lot of room. We've not seen anything that would back us off, to say that we're concerned with labor at this point. We're in good shape. Look, we have a good look at it, a good five-year look at what we see, very close to the business, very close to our clients. We work with them quite a bit on long-term natures and programs and what's going on, when you go from West to East and the coverage that we have, you're able to see the things that we know are going to happen, they start in the West like when you start to see vehicle penetration in the West, you know it's going to move across the country. And we're starting to see those impacts. I think Edison had a good report on kind of how their grid is changing. And I think it gets -- it gets worse, not better. I think capital goes up even from what they're seeing. And I think you'll continue to see that, as you see the total cost impacts of energy really require the grid to be robust to create the environment that you want, which is the customer builds going down, you have to build this infrastructure out to get the total cost of energy down. It's happened in Europe, you'll start to see more and more of that getting fed, which is really important for us to get in front of the necessary capital at the local level, at the state levels, so they understand in order to get the cost down and you've got to get the infrastructure. And it's also security for the country, is to get the grid where we need it to be. And you're going to see that with loads going up in places, no one expected load to go up like this. The areas that you're seeing a load, they did not expect data cities to come in and take, call it, 3 gigs, 5 gigs and they don't want -- they want secure power. So sometimes that requires multiple lines. And when you look at all this and you look at what's coming at you, you're backed up by this. The technology that's coming into the world that requires our services, across the board, in the utilities rooting growth business, they're growing. And it's necessary for them to spend capital, it's just a matter of getting it through from a federal push into the state regulators. And we kind of said that all along that this is necessary, it's going to come to a head, and you're seeing it. This transition will be noisy. It will be things that you'll see, it's not straight up every day. It's going to have CAGR look to it at times, in parts of the business. That's why I like the portfolio so much, as we can move around and kind of get through this transition here and continue to what I believe perform at a high level and deliver the results we have. I think so. When you look at our communications business, I mean, we've done nicely, we're growing double-digits. It's not something that we're investing a lot of capital in, but I do see it. I do see technology itself needing -- you're going to strip some of the fiber capacity, are stripping some of the fiber capacity out there. And especially when you start putting big data in different parts of the country, it's much easier to build a telecom line and get telecom service, than it is transmission. So, sometimes in my mind, you'll see data centers start to locate, where the power is, almost. And right now, if you can't get power to the East and you can't get it to the West, you start to see the Midwest build. And then if you can't get it there, you start to see the South build. So, everywhere that you can get affordable power today or in the next 24 months, you'll start to see data centers go up. Even if there's not fiber, so you're going to get fiber going to them, at some point, nodes. Certainly, some of it is getting alleviated with satellites, things like that, but still you need the fiber on the ground. So, I do believe they'll push it, and yes, there's opportunity. It's $500 million to $600 million in the guidance, it will be $500 million to $600 million, next year, in the next year and the next year. We don't -- we're not going to -- that's why we moved off long-haul pipe and big pipe. We just can't -- we can't build the business around it. It's certainly something, we'll take every bit of opportunity we can. We did $1 billion plus in big pipe last year. So, you're seeing some offset in the top line because of that because we guided $500 million to $600 million. Is there opportunities for $1 billion plus? Sure. But the government regulations and difficulty in building a large diameter pipe, anywhere in the country, but Canada is -- a little better opportunities in Canada. But we're just -- we can't take that and build it in guidance and give you any kind of firmness to our numbers. So, I -- look, I think there's opportunities. But it doesn't -- LNG, if everything goes and it doesn't go, it doesn't matter to the guide we've given you. It doesn't matter. Sure. We'll be opportunistic in how we look at it like we have in the past, no different. We are below some of our targets. It allows us flexibility, which I like a lot. Certainly, there's things that we can be opportunistic in. But the strategies won't change. We've laid out a good strategy plan. Can we get -- can we go faster, as we delever, things like that, sure. So, I think ultimately, we're moving faster across the five-year plan. As we said last quarter and continue to say, we're moving faster through it. We'll be opportunistic with the balance sheet. But again, with the conservative nature of the company and -- we'll -- we have opportunities, across multiple fronts, and we'll take advantage of all of them. The tax rate, the PTC and ITCs and those things, they're in place. I've not seen them come off at this point, whether it's IRA or PTC, how it moves in or ITCs, how it moves in, I think it's the same. Now, if it was repealed, I do -- you could see some issues there. I do not believe that will be the case going forward. That's something that gives certainty to the industry. So, I continue to believe that how you get them and our customers have been able to get in front of this. And I think our customer base is -- these things kind of figured out. The IRA has some different things, you can get more, not less. So, I actually think we're in early stages of the IRA, which should give it's going forward, not less. So, I see it as more opportunities. We should check the box on from a standpoint of U.S.-type apprenticeship programs, U.S. type materials, things of that nature, even internally. So, we really set ourselves up to take advantage of that for the customer. So, I feel good about it. I'm not seeing it slow down from that standpoint. I mean, everyone's watching from our customer viewpoint, they got it figured out and tax credit figured out. I think -- I mean, I think I understand what you're saying. But from a tax rate standpoint, I don't know if it does much, but from a combination, it actually expands many of the projects that we've built in the past are adding storage to it. Our, storage business is growing nicely, and our battery business is growing nicely. So, I like that. We continue to add that capability and get more refine there, as we move forward across geographies. So, when you ask that, I think it's just more opportunity to increase the size and scope of these projects. I mean, SunZia is a nice project that's on the wind side. We're seeing more opportunities repower. I think you'll see a lot of repower work going forward. You're in early stages of the cycle coming back from wind. So, we're starting to see more and more in the outer years of wind coming into the portfolio. I don't think it's going to be any like large windfall in 2024 by any means, but I do think 2025, 2026, it starts to move up significantly as we move out in the outer years, the curves get, where wind makes a lot more sense in areas. So, you'll start -- transmission needs to be built, too. Like we've got to get the transmission built before you can get wind out. And that's the other piece of this is you need long-haul transmission to move wind out of those sources into load centers. So, it's very taking out the egg sometimes, and I do think both are coming into play. And the Wind business gets better from, call it, 2024 on. We continue to expand capacity there. There's a lot of things that we can do internally to expand. We're expanding like the business ever more so today than we did -- today looked at it. So, it gets better the opportunities and synergies, the things that we can do for the clients with PTT, U.S. base, Union in Pennsylvania, a great place to invest and we're lacking that business a lot. Thank you. Yes. Thank you. I want to thank the 50,000-plus men and women, in the field, they're the best in the business. They allow us to have these kind of calls and give this kind of profile for the company, so, we thank them. And I want to thank you for participating in the conference call. We appreciate your questions and your ongoing interest in Quanta Services. This concludes our call."

            "content": "Thanks Duke and good morning everyone. Quanta completed the year with fourth quarter revenues of $5.8 billion, net income attributable to common stock of $210.9 million or $1.42 per diluted share, and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.04. Adjusted EBITDA was $550.2 million or 9.5% of revenue. Of note, our cash flow in the fourth quarter and for the full year was very strong with both setting period records. For the fourth quarter and full year of 2023, we had free cash flow of $915.5 million and $1.2 billion, respectively, which exceeded the upper end of our free cash flow guidance expectations. We ended the year with liquidity and a balance sheet that will position us to support our organic growth expectations in 2024, annually increase our dividend, and opportunistically invest capital. To that end, in January, we acquired two companies for aggregate consideration of approximately $425 million. This morning, we also provided our full year 2024 financial expectations, which calls for another year of profitable growth with record revenues, improved margins and opportunity for double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDA, adjusted earnings per share, and free cash flow. We believe our expectations demonstrate the strength of our portfolio approach to the business, our commitment to our long-term strategy, our favorable end market trends, and our competitive position in the marketplace. Additional details and commentary about our 2024 financial guidance can be found in our operational and financial commentary and outlook expectation summary, both of which are posted on our IR website. With that, we are happy to answer your questions. Operator? Morning. Morning. Yes. As we've talked about in the Investor Day, and as you've seen in the fourth quarter last year, the renewable business with the way those contracts are set up, has a very favorable cash flow profile and the working capital profile is very good. And so, as revenue and renewable side pushes up, you'll see better conversion just as we saw in 2023. Going into 2024, we did take that into consideration, but we did range it. There's a range for a reason. As I just said, renewables can push us in the higher end of that range of 45% to 55% that we talked about at Investor Day. But if you've got -- if it's more growth coming from our electric and underground segments, it can push the other way, right? And so we've given you what we think is a good prudent look at where free cash flow will be. But having said that, if the mix of work between renewables and electric and utility underground changes, you will see outside of that range or either a high end of that range or the low end of the range. The one-time cash flow impact of the large Canadian Renewable project, we do believe we will collect next year. We -- excuse me, in 2024. We -- as we talked about the last several quarters, as construction winds down, which we expect in the next several months, a couple of months. Conversations with the customer continues to go very well. So, we're optimistic we'll be able to collect all of that as well this year. But on an ongoing basis, I think you would be good to look at a range of between 45% to 55% conversion. No, I think it's mostly seasonality typical of what we run. We did -- as Duke talked about, there's a little bit of Canadian pressure in the first half of the year. But it's just normal seasonality. And we do expect with the additional SunZia work and some other projects, more back half weighted, but again, nothing more unusual than that. The customers we work with, have been planning for the tariff situation for a while now. So, I think we're -- our customers have been planning this moratorium being lifted in June. So, it's -- I don't know -- I can't answer directly, if we're seeing some pull forward, I just know that the customers we've been working with for years, now planned for this very well. They know how to work this. They've been prudent about how they think about their panel procurement, and we continue to see good growth in our renewable segment as a result."

With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Duke Austin, Quanta\u2019s President and CEO. Duke?\nDuke Austin: Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. On the call today, I will provide operational and strategic commentary and we\u2019ll then turn it over to Jayshree Desai, Quanta CFO, to provide a review of our third quarter results and full year 2023 financial expectations. Following Jayshree\u2019s comments, we welcome your questions. This morning, we reported our third quarter results, which included strong double-digit revenue growth and a number of record financial metrics, which we believe reflects robust demand for our services and solid execution. Of note, our Electric Power Infrastructure Solutions and Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions segments drove our revenue and profit growth, reflecting ongoing capital deployment into grid modernization and hardening. Power grid expansion and construction of new renewable generation and other necessary investments needed for North America\u2019s emerging energy transition. Total backlog at quarter end was $30.1 billion, an all-time record high, which we believe reflects value of our collaborative client relationships and indicates momentum for 2024. We are positioning Quanta for decades of expected necessary infrastructure investment and continue to believe our operational portfolio is a strategic advantage that provides us the ability to manage risk and shift resources across service lines and geographies, which we believe will become increasingly important as the energy transition accelerates. We believe our portfolio approach positions us well to allocate resources to the opportunities we find most economically attractive and to achieve operating efficiencies and consistent financial results. Our Electric Power Operations are performing well. Demand for our Electric Power Infrastructure Solutions is robust driven by broad-based business activity from utility grid modernization, grid security and system hardening initiatives as well as our reputation for consistent and safe execution. This is further evidenced by the meaningful increase in backlog for the segment in the third quarter. Accordingly, we continue to invest in resources ahead of the anticipated start-up of multiple multiyear utility programs and projects. We believe Quanta Solutions offering and ability to safely and consistently execute as industry-leading, and we are uniquely positioned to collaborate with our clients on their multiyear grid programs. Additionally, our communications operations continue to execute well with double-digit revenue growth and margins. We believe these results reflect our focus on being selective with the risk and margin profile of the work we pursued as well as solid execution. Renewable Infrastructure Solutions segment revenues increased significantly in the third quarter as construction of renewable generation projects ramped up, including solar, wind and battery storage. High voltage electric transmission and substation work also remained active. Segment total backlog reached a record $7.9 billion at quarter end, driven by the addition of a portion of the SunZia Wind contract and various renewable generation, transmission and substation projects. We have mobilized resources for the SunZia project and are performing early stages \u2013 stage construction activities. Though the vast majority of the work is expected to be performed in 2024 and 2025. We believe the infrastructure solutions we provide to the renewable industry are gaining momentum as the energy transition gains pace. We are continuing to make the necessary investments to scale our resources and capacity to handle large-scale multiyear renewable programs that we expect will yield record levels of renewable generation over the coming decade, driven by the IRA and the acceleration of North America\u2019s energy transition. Additionally, we are pursuing billions of dollars of high-voltage transmission projects that are designed to support connectivity of current and future renewable generation capacity growth and overall system reliability. In this morning\u2019s earnings release, we also announced a strategic acquisition of Pennsylvania Transformer Technology or PTT, led by an experienced management team with dedicated employees. PTT is an established and reliable domestic manufacturer of power transformers and components for the investor-owned utility \u2013 electric utility, renewable energy, municipal power and industrial markets. Transformers are a critical path of power grid \u2013 of the power grid that facilitate the safe and efficient transmission of electricity from generators to end users. North America\u2019s energy transition and other megatrends that are driving current and anticipated future demand for our electric power and renewable energy solutions are also driving significant demand and growth for the transformer market. As a result, lead times are extended and demand and supply imbalances are only expected to intensify as energy-intensive sectors such as electric vehicles, renewable energy, data centers and manufacturing challenge power infrastructure capacity. As we have discussed previously, several years ago, Quanta began developing its strategy to create supply chain solutions that are designed to help our clients navigate equipment shortages and delays, reduce cost, improve availability and enhanced capital deployment efficiency, all of which can ultimately benefit the consumer. For Quanta, the addition of PTT should allow us to better manage the availability of certain critical grid components, which in turn should help us better manage our work schedules and productivity. We believe PTT provides Quanta and our clients an important, secure and domestic supply chain solution that is consistent with our strategy. The strong and visible demand dynamics for transformer market provide a favorable long-term profitable growth opportunity for PTT. The company also possesses intellectual property for certain grid [ph] components, not currently in its production, but that are also in high demand by the utility industry. As a part of Quanta, we believe there are opportunities to enhance and expand PTT\u2019s capacity and product offering, which could accelerate PTT\u2019s growth and provide incremental growth synergies for Quanta\u2019s Electric Power and Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions. The Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment continues to deliver with double-digit revenue growth and solid profitability. Our industrial services operation executed well and we had strong demand for our gas utility and pipeline integrity operations, driven by regulated spend to modernize systems, reduce methane emissions, ensure environmental compliance, and improve safety and reliability. Additionally, we are increasingly leveraging our underground resources and capabilities to perform underground electric work. While that work is recognized in our electric power segment, it evidences the value and flexibility of our solutions portfolio. The transition towards a reduced carbon economy continues to progress, and we believe is gaining momentum. We believe we are in the early stages of capitalizing on significant opportunities across our service lines and geographies, driven by our collaborative solution-based approach designed to ultimately benefit consumers. Additionally, the growth of programmatic spending with existing and new customers as well as increased renewable generation activity and favorable megatrends provide greater visibility into our near- and long-term growth outlook. We are currently pacing ahead of long-term financial targets articulated at our Investor Day last year and are increasingly comfortable with our ability to achieve them. This belief is driven by the long-term programmatic spend customers and favorable long-term megatrend opportunities across our portfolio of services, which we believe are in the beginning stages of a multi-decade process. Quanta is investing in the future to meet the needs of our customers and take advantage of the visible opportunities ahead of us, which we believe positions us well for double-digit EPS growth in 2024 and beyond. We are focused on operating the business for the long term and expect to continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class build leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta\u2019s base business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta\u2019s diversity, unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset form the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for all our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Jayshree Desai, our CFO, for her review of our third quarter results and 2023 expectations. Jayshree?\nJayshree Desai: Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced record third quarter revenues of $5.6 billion. Net income attributable to common stock was $273 million or $1.83 per diluted share and adjusted diluted earnings per share was a record $2.24. Our third quarter electric power revenues were $2.5 billion, and operating income margins were 11.9% as a result of the exceptional performance by our base business activities and telecom operations. Renewable Energy Infrastructure segment revenues for third quarter 2023 was $1.7 billion with operating income margins of 8.7%. The revenue strength in the quarter reflects continued momentum behind renewable energy infrastructure, the quality of our customers and our comprehensive solutions-based approach to the energy transition. Segment margins improved sequentially as construction activities accelerated across our portfolio of projects. However, they were pressured somewhat by lower-than-expected contingency releases on more mature projects that progressed during the quarter. It\u2019s also worth noting that profit associated with revenues from early-stage work is generally recognized at a lower margin as risk contingencies are included in the cost to complete. During periods of high growth and new project starts, this margin dynamic can be exacerbated, which is influencing 2023 segment margins as year-to-date renewable revenues have grown roughly 50% from 2022. Underground Utility and Infrastructure segment revenues were $1.4 billion for the quarter, and operating income margins were 8.9%, driven by high volumes, solid execution and better fixed cost absorption on increased revenues. For additional commentary comparing third quarter 2023 to third quarter 2022, please refer to the slides accompanying this call, At September 30, 2023, total backlog was a record $30.1 billion, an increase of $2.9 billion compared to June 30, with growth coming from both large project awards and our base business activities. Our 12-month backlog is also at a record level of $17 billion, approximately $1.4 billion higher than June 30. For the third quarter of 2023, we had free cash flow of $280 million. DSO measured 79 days for the third quarter, aided by favorable billing arrangements associated with certain awards during the quarter. Regarding the Canadian renewable transmission project we\u2019ve discussed in prior calls, the contract asset balance grew during the quarter as we progressed closer to completion. We continue to have favorable discussions with the customer regarding significant portions of the balance representing approximately seven days of DSO as of September 30, and we remain confident in our position. As of September 30, 2023, we had total liquidity of approximately $2 billion and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.2 times as calculated under our credit agreement. During the quarter, we made a small acquisition that will primarily report through our Electric segment and as we announced in today\u2019s release, earlier this week, we closed on the strategic acquisition of Pennsylvania Transformer to help address a critical supply chain constraint for our utility, renewable and industrial customers. While we always measure capital deployment against the return opportunities presented by stock repurchases, we continue to see an active pipeline of strategic opportunities that we believe can be executed at accretive valuation and have the ability to drive significant stockholder value. Turning to our guidance. We performed well through the first nine months of the year, and demand for our portfolio of solutions remains robust. As a result, we are raising our consolidated revenue expectations for the year to range between $20.1 billion and $20.4 billion. From a segment perspective, last quarter, we expected electric volumes to ramp in the fourth quarter. However, as it stands today, we now see revenues in the fourth quarter comparable to the third quarter. Part of the fourth quarter reduction reflects the transferability of resources between the Electric and Renewable segments as renewable revenues continue to expand and encompass both interconnection and generation projects, with interconnection work being performed by crews that would otherwise be captured in the Electric segment. Additionally, we are seeing pockets of inefficiencies due to supply chain dynamics as well as timing of capital deployment in certain regions shifting into 2024. This variability is a periodic disruption to an otherwise growing demand for our electric solutions, as evidenced by our backlog growth from June 30 levels. Accordingly, we now see Electric segment revenues for the year between $9.6 billion and $9.7 billion, and full year margins for the segment ranging between 10.4% and 10.6% as we continue to build crews and carry costs necessary to execute on the anticipated growth in multiyear utility programs. Of note, we are forecasting storm revenues for the year of around $300 million, roughly 3% of segment revenues for the year, the lowest level of 2019. Regarding our Renewable segment, given the performance of the third quarter and continued backlog growth, we are raising our full year revenue expectations to range between $5.8 billion and $5.9 billion. Because of the previously described margin dynamics as well as continued investments in labor, training and equipment required to address the segment\u2019s building backlog, we now expect margins for the segment to be around 8% for the year. After another strong quarter, we now expect revenue from our Underground segment to range between $4.7 billion and $4.8 billion, a $300 million increase at the midpoint. From a margin perspective, we expect full year margins for the segment to range between 7.6% and 7.8%, an improved outlook and above the previous high end of our range. Not included in our expectations are contributions from Pennsylvania Transformer, which will be captured in both our Electric and Renewable segments. We are working through purchase price allocation and accounting considerations and aren\u2019t prepared to give any definitive guidance, but given the size of the business today, we don\u2019t expect the contribution to be material to our quarterly results. In the aggregate, we expect revenues for the year to be almost 20% higher than 2022, and we\u2019ve increased our expectations for full year adjusted EBITDA to range between $1.91 billion and $1.95 billion. For full year adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock, we\u2019ve now narrowed our prior range, maintained our previous midpoint and now expect between $7 and $7.20. With regard to free cash flow, we continue to expect between $800 million and $1 billion. We slightly modified other aspects of our guidance, the details of which are included in our outlook summary, which can be found in the Financial Information section of our IR website at quantaservices.com. Our growing backlog and favorable multiyear outlook continues to give us confidence in our ability to achieve the multiyear targets we laid out in our April 2022 Investor Day. Additionally, we believe the acquisition of Pennsylvania Transformer further cements our ability to provide differentiating solutions to our core customers and elevates the critical role we play in the North American energy transition. We are uniquely positioned in the markets we serve and believe we have the opportunity to continue improving our return on invested capital and generating significant stockholder value through organic growth and strategic capital deployment. I\u2019ll now turn it back to the operator for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Dudas: Hello, thank you very much. Good morning, Jayshree, Kip, Duke.\nDuke Austin: Morning.\nJayshree Desai: Good morning.\nMichael Dudas: Duke as you might have noticed, there\u2019s been a lot of noise, a lot of difficult news flow around the utility sector the last four weeks to six weeks and competitors and concerns about renewable energy pace, et cetera. Maybe you can kind of share your observations on that relative to what your customers are engaging with you, especially as you\u2019re looking into the planning budgets for 2024 and beyond and how that differs or is confirming of those expectations, again, given your position in the \u2013 with the lens that you look through with your electric utility and development customers?\nDuke Austin: Yes. Thanks, Mike. For us, when we look at the customer base and when we think about where we\u2019re at and where the industry sits, I think \u2013 it\u2019s a great time to be in this business and its growth. We see growth. We see load growth at the customer level as an industry. You have trends, megatrends that are really pushing on interconnections and EV penetration in the distribution systems. So from our standpoint, at a philosophical level, you have a supply and demand issue, and you have a significant amount of build necessary for infrastructure. So the macro market is great. As far as the noise, I believe, look, from my standpoint, what we said, we\u2019re trying to provide solutions to our clients, we get pushed into a contractor, which were not, we provide the solutions. And our customer bases are much different than you may hear from others on calls. So our customers are different. And the way that our customers view the markets versus others is different. So they don\u2019t have tax equity problems. They don\u2019t have some of the problems that you hear, and we do a really nice job of talking to them and collaborating with them about where we\u2019re going, not where we\u2019re at. And so that\u2019s the difference is. We\u2019re ahead years of planning and with these clients long term versus what you may hear in the market over the next 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, we\u2019re talking decades. So I really feel comfortable with where we\u2019re at. I feel comfortable that the industry will solve the issues. Yes, there\u2019s some affordability issues running around and you\u2019re hearing about it. But this industry will solve those issues.\nMichael Dudas: Appreciate that, Duke. My follow-up is with regard to your PTT acquisition. Obviously, you see a tightness in the marketplace and you expect revenue growth from the company. Do they have the capacity to meet the needs now and there a lot of investment required given certainly the demand for their products and how you\u2019re going to be able to leverage that through your customer base?\nDuke Austin: Yes, Mike, we\u2019ve worked on the acquisition for quite a while and also philosophically, how to help our customers with supply chain. So I think in general, Pennsylvania Transformer, U.S.-based domestic product, that really fits the goals of the interconnections, the queues, the larger transmission substations that are necessary to facilitate renewable load growth. When I look at it, when we think about it, yes, we can. It\u2019s not a manufacturing play for Quanta. It\u2019s more of a solution to the client. So, I wouldn\u2019t expect us to go out and buy 20 transformer companies. What I would expect us to do is add capacity to our facility. It\u2019s a one million square foot facility, one of the biggest in U.S. So we\u2019re able to really add to it. And I don\u2019t \u2013 we see some investment in it to get productivity up. Yes. We can \u2013 we will increase \u2013 there\u2019s some component lines that we\u2019ll start making that are about 1,000 days plus that we have the IP on. So there\u2019s some things there that we can do to really enhance where we sit as a solution provider in the industry.\nMichael Dudas: Thank you, Duke. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Hauke with Baird. Please proceed with your question. \nJustin Hauke: Yes, good morning everyone. I guess, I just wanted to piggyback on the renewables, I guess, question. And you guys took up your revenue guidance there. I\u2019m just curious how much of that is coming through, I guess, maybe projects that you\u2019re procuring and the costs are going up. And so there\u2019s more of like a CFM pass-through that is driving the revenue higher and maybe you don\u2019t pick up margin on that versus how much is like volume. So I know it\u2019s hard to think about volume price in this business, but any context around that would be helpful.\nDuke Austin: I mean look, I think we price it the same, honestly, the customer \u2013 our customers may be passing on PPA pricing and things like that, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking. But as far as from where we stand, we\u2019re on 60-plus large-scale renewable-type projects that are like we said in the past, are moving up our revenue. So I feel like it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ve got really, really good customer base that we\u2019re supplying, and they continue to build their backlogs and they\u2019re not having tax equity problems and things of that nature.\nJayshree Desai: Yes. Justin, and the margins are improving in that segment. We have been able to absorb some of the fixed costs that we had built in earlier in the year, ramping up for the significant growth that we had this quarter and continue to see. So it\u2019s moving in the right direction. There are some material components to the segment, no doubt that\u2019s higher than our electric segment. But overall, we\u2019re seeing margins moving in line with what we had said to you all in the Investor Day in that 9% to 10% range. We did have a little bit of pressure this quarter because of our expectation on some contingency releases that didn\u2019t materialize. Those projects still are performing quite well. It just didn\u2019t knock it out of the park, which we had thought we could have in the second quarter. It\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s really some of that. And then at the same time, you have the significant ramp in renewables, that new project dynamic as it comes in, they\u2019d come in at a lower margin because you need to execute the contingencies before we can raise those margins. And so that is providing \u2013 that is creating some dilutive pressure, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing in the third quarter. There is no \u2013 there is no other dynamic around the business itself that\u2019s causing anything. It will get better and it is continuing to get better.\nJustin Hauke: Okay. I appreciate that. And then I guess the second question here, on PTT. I understand you\u2019re still finalizing the purchase price allocation. But can you give us some context of just the size of that acquisition? And then two manufacturing facilities, I\u2019m just trying to understand, I mean, how accretive is this to margins from a materiality standpoint because I would think that its margins are much higher than probably your base business, but I just don\u2019t know how big this acquisition is. And then maybe the last question as part of that would be, is there any change on CapEx outlook thinking about the expansion of additional facilities for them?\nDuke Austin: The company itself, the revenue size is over $100 million. We\u2019re not going to disclose purchase price. I\u2019m sure you can find it in the K. So \u2013 but in general, it\u2019s really not about the manufacturing capacity. It\u2019s what we can do with it, the synergies we can get with it with the client. We can add some production fairly quickly.  It\u2019s an underinvested facility. We will put some money in it. I don\u2019t see our capital structure changing at all. And next year, we don\u2019t need to do a lot to the facility. So I feel good about the capital deployment in there and the productivity lines and things like that, the things that we can do with the manufacturing facility. So I like that part of it. It is booked pretty good in 2024, 2025. And so it will be about us getting more productivity out of it and really working with our clients on what capacity looks like in the future. So that\u2019s what we\u2019ll be working on and putting that into the way that we provide the solution to the client.\nJustin Hauke: Okay. Great. We\u2019ll look forward to the K then later. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. \nNeil Mehta: Yes. Thanks so much. Duke, I wanted to start off on the customer base because I think there\u2019s an important point, which is a lot of your renewable focused investment is with the large utilities as opposed to some of those private developers. So is there any way you can quantify that customer composition for you as you think about your backlog there? And as you have conversations with utility CEOs, are you seeing any change in their commitment to the business? We did, for example, note, accel, if anything, accelerated the renewables investments in Colorado? Thanks. \nDuke Austin: Thanks, Neil. When we look at our customer base, we\u2019ve said all along. We work for the top 10 developers as well as the utilities and the world for that matter. So I feel good about where they\u2019re at. I feel good about where they\u2019re going all of basically the trends and what we see from backlog as well as opportunities continue to grow, both with the utility business as well as developer business. I go back and say, we look at our portfolio that we put together, we\u2019ve derisked it and then we\u2019ve also said we could stack on to it. The company has grown in 2021. We\u2019ve grown 16% in 2022. We grew 30%. This year, we\u2019re expected to grow 18%. So I don\u2019t think we have a problem with the customer base. I think we are doing really nicely. We are working on margins, as Jayshree said. But that said, sequentially, when you look at quarter-over-quarter, we said there were some cadence issues in our renewables or some cadence issues in the jobs. It\u2019s not a margin issue, it\u2019s a cadence issue. And every single quarter, we\u2019ll get better. We expect to operate in double digits next year.\nNeil Mehta: Okay. Thank you. And then the follow-up for Jayshree. You made a comment that you\u2019re on track for the plan are tracking ahead of the long-term plan. Any early thoughts on 2024? You mentioned you\u2019re on track to be double-digit EPS growth, but considerations, we want to keep in mind as we build up the model for next year?\nDuke Austin: I think when we look at it, we still feel comfortable with kind of the model that we put together. It\u2019s way too early to give guidance on exactly what that will look like. It would be a disservice to you and us. But I do expect us over time, had the opportunity to operate above double digits on the EPS line at times, and I feel comfortable with the opportunity next year to operate in double digits.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks, Duke. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. \nAndy Kaplowitz: Good morning everyone.\nJayshree Desai: Good morning.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Duke, I think I know the answer to this, but you mentioned you\u2019re still pursuing many large new T&D projects. Do you still have good visibility toward backlog growth as you go into 2024? And how do you compare this T&D cycle to other cycles? You mentioned that just to Neil\u2019s question, you mentioned you\u2019re ahead of the long-term plan but part of the upside. I think when you did your Investor Day, it was going to come from megatrends. Have you seen the megatrends develop faster than you would have expected then?\nDuke Austin: It\u2019s \u2013 I see when we look at the market, it\u2019s the best it\u2019s been in our career, and it\u2019s all about the macro market demands. People are underestimating data centers and the loads on data centers, they\u2019re underestimating EV. You\u2019re up to about 7% of new car sales into EV globally. That\u2019s a big number for everyone. Your interconnections, you\u2019re even on batteries just to make the batteries and the demand on the power cycle there. So I think all those things are underestimated when you start looking at where the business is going. And so for us, the long-term nature and the megatrends that we see continue to compound, you can delay some things. It\u2019s really \u2013 for us, it\u2019s really worrying about the ultimate customer and affordability at the ultimate customer level and how do we help our clients and help the ultimate customer get a cost price that makes sense. And as you see, as you get leverage across what you\u2019re building with more demand, what you\u2019re seeing 3% demand almost every single place has at least some demand growth, load growth, that load growth itself is really, really enhancing what a utility can spend on capital. Obviously, the market\u2019s a little constrained there on the capital markets, but the demand is outfitting supply. So it\u2019s some timing in places. But like I\u2019ve never seen where we see so many things at once coming at you from a macro market. So we\u2019re real proud to be in this business. And look, I get up every day and happy about me in here and trying to execute on the work that we have. I think that\u2019s the big thing is just execution at this point.\nAndy Kaplowitz: And then, Duke, yesterday, there was quite a bit of angst that I thought you were caught up in a little bit with actually offshore wind, and I don\u2019t think you have any exposure there or very little, but could you remind us of if you have any on that side?\nDuke Austin: Yes. Thanks for the question. We\u2019re very deliberate about no boats, no water. So we\u2019ve been there, done that. We\u2019re not involved in anything offshore other than onshore approaches and some we will help others onshore to fab or whatever it may be offshore, but we\u2019re not in the water at all and have no exposure really to offshore wind other than transmission that may be built onshore.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Appreciate that, Duke.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Marc Bianchi with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question. \nMarc Bianchi: Hey, thanks. I wanted to ask about the market structure and sort of go forward in electric power and infrastructure. And this relates to some of the concerns around utility ability to sort of spend in this higher interest rate environment. I appreciate that you guys are doing a good job in long-term discussions with the customers and so forth. But from a macro perspective, is there anything about the current rate environment that maybe limits the growth opportunity in that segment? Obviously, you can continue to grow, but maybe not quite at the rate. Just curious if you can talk to that dynamic at all. \nDuke Austin: I do think you can push some things out. I mean you can \u2013 EV penetration is not there so you cannot plan and have interconnections at the distribution level. We\u2019re seeing some where our crews, for example, are working 60, 70 hours, you\u2019re working 50 hours, but you\u2019re not losing crews, you\u2019re just working less hours and you\u2019re seeing some of that in the fourth quarter where we have crews that are just working 40. And that\u2019s fine, but we\u2019re adding crews as well. So really, as you move into 2024, they move capital budgets up, things look better. I do think load growth will exceed what most people think, it really helps with higher interest and costs. So I think we can get through that as an industry. The only thing is if you had like crazy interest, and I don\u2019t see that coming. I do believe we\u2019ve kind of stabilized there and utilities either. You see some that are selling assets to put it back in the regulated business. But look, you have a duty to serve and you\u2019ve seen in California where they have like 120 days to make interconnections now by law. That\u2019s going to come \u2013 it\u2019s going to be prevalent across the country. And I just don\u2019t believe that you can delay interconnections nor can you delay queue and the queue is coming out of everyone, and we\u2019ve got \u2013 as an industry, we got a plan a little better. We\u2019ve got to do some things, and we\u2019ve got to get in front of this. And then you can\u2019t be selective in urgency here. We\u2019ve got to get the planning done and the work done for the next couple of decades. So we feel confident, yes, you can have some bounces along the way, but we\u2019ve always said that there\u2019ll be starts and stops a bit, but the CAGR itself will continue to drive the market for long term any kind of delay you have just means it\u2019s pent-up demand, it\u2019s coming at you. So we feel good. We feel good with our customers and our conversations have been. You may not see them grow capital 20%, they just grew at 15% or from upward levels, but I don\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m not seeing much pullback at all. In fact, I\u2019m seeing more growth to capital with our clients.\nMarc Bianchi: That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, Duke. And then on 2024 I know you don\u2019t want to get into giving guidance, but double-digit growth is what you\u2019ve said. And if I look at consensus, it\u2019s up almost 20%. I\u2019m curious if that\u2019s attainable, knowing that you\u2019re not guiding to it, but just trying to understand the brackets around what\u2019s possible in 2024. \nDuke Austin: Yes. We\u2019re not giving guidance. So I\u2019ve given the buzz all I\u2019m going to give. And so we\u2019ve talked about the opportunity to grow double digits. I think that\u2019s there. We can stack on at times. It\u2019s too early to say. The models that are out there, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in their Kip or Jayshree can go look at it, but I didn\u2019t look at it, I just feel comfortable in the double-digit, talking about double-digit margin growth at this point opportunity for that as well.\nJayshree Desai: Double-digit EPS.\nDuke Austin: EPS growth. Thanks. \nMarc Bianchi: Yep. Okay, thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chad Dillard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. \nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, how are you? This is Erico [ph] filling in for Chad Dillard. How we should think about the mix of large versus small projects going into 2024? How will the \u2013 how would that impact margin profile?\nDuke Austin: Can you say that again? I\u2019m sorry, you broke up.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes. Sorry. How we should think about the mix of large versus small projects going into 2024? And how will that impact the margin profile?\nDuke Austin: I think they\u2019re both growing, and we stand by the state of margins to operate in double digits. We certainly have the opportunity to operate in double digits in the renewable segment as well as the Electric segment at upper singles in the UUI [ph] business, very much like we started \u2013 we\u2019ll be prudent about how we guide. So you can expect us to guide prudently in 2024. I do \u2013 we do see growth to 2024. So the same approach we\u2019ve taken for the last eight years, seven years will be taken going forward. As far as the mix, it\u2019s still running mid 80%, 85% base business, something like that. And I believe that will be there. But the large project dynamic certainly there, we\u2019re seeing multiple fronts of large projects. It will be early, but we do believe that is starting to stack a bit.\nJayshree Desai: As well as our base business growth.\nDuke Austin: Yes. Grows at the same rate. \nUnidentified Analyst: How sustainable are underground margins?\nDuke Austin: Look, we\u2019ve always said we can get leverage out of the UUI margins. Our industrial business is probably a record year this year. We still like the industrial business a lot. So the margins have picked up. We have got levers. We do move back and forth. But I caution everyone again that this is a portfolio. This portfolio moves around, and you\u2019ve got to look at it as a portfolio. It derisks you down at the bottom. That\u2019s why you\u2019re not seeing the blips at the bottom. Now you\u2019re seeing double-digit growth. And again, I\u2019d caution that if we get into this segment discussion, it\u2019s these crews go from electric to gas to telecom and we should perform well in all of them. And our goal is to make sure that the company itself grows and our margin profile stays sustained over time. And that\u2019s the portfolio we\u2019ve built to derisk the investor as well as provide opportunities for beyond double-digit growth. And look, we\u2019ll talk about the segments, but I go back and I point to 18% top line growth, still performing at high margins across the segments, and we\u2019re delivering double-digit EPS.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you very much. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Fisher with UBS. Please proceed with your question. \nSteven Fisher: Thanks. Good morning. Duke, your comments on that last question, notwithstanding, I will ask you a segment margin question. And maybe for Jayshree, I don\u2019t know. But your guidance for renewables still implies ramping to double digits in Q4 margins. And so I\u2019m just curious what\u2019s going to be different in Q4 relative to Q3, that\u2019s going to allow you to hit those double-digit margins. I mean you\u2019re still going to be in early stages of projects. So you mentioned about carrying lower accruals. It sounds like there is a cadence issue not sort of an execution issue. So what \u2013 what\u2019s going to be different in Q4? And then how does that carry into 2024?\nDuke Austin: Yes. I think it\u2019s where you started on all your renewables. We kind of started early in the year and late last year with multiple large projects there. So as those \u2013 and we booked all the way through, still booking. So you\u2019re getting a better cadence in the larger project dynamics. So some of them are finishing up and so that allows us to obviously look at contingent releases, things like that in the fourth quarter in the renewable segment. So that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing. And you\u2019re also getting scale out of that business as well. As you go into 2024, same thing, the cadence, you are starting some larger line projects on transmission there. And so it will have a little bit of effect, but you don\u2019t have Canada coming in, things like that. And I can let Jayshree to comment on the rest.\nJayshree Desai: Yes. I mean, that\u2019s exactly right. There\u2019s that \u2013 and then we\u2019ll continue to progress on the other parts of the segment, right? As those projects mature, there are opportunities, and there were opportunities to release contingencies. We\u2019ll continue to see that in the fourth quarter. And as Duke said, the scale it was for growing you\u2019re going to start seeing \u2013 you\u2019re seeing more and more of that fixed cost absorption. There will be more of that in the fourth quarter. So the combination of matured projects as well as that fixed cost absorption is allowing us to feel comfortable with the guide in the fourth quarter.\nDuke Austin: Yes, Steven, I would also add that we talked about 3,000 add last quarter, we added roughly 4,000 in this quarter. So we\u2019re up to 56,000 employees adding 3,000 on cadence per quarter is not easy, and it does press a bit. So I\u2019d just caution some of that\u2019s in there. And as you start working through that and you get good cadence with it, we can absorb a lot.\nSteven Fisher: That\u2019s really helpful. And then maybe just to ask about the electric segment. You\u2019ve talked in prior quarters about some efficiencies in terms of Canadian underutilization as that market structure is a little different than the U.S. Can you just give us an update on that influence and maybe supply chain as well for the broader electric segment. Is that any particular influence at this time? And what visibility you have to those things kind of smoothing out?\nDuke Austin: Yes. We\u2019re operating really well in the electric segment. I mean, over time, I\u2019ve always said double digits, 10%, 10.5% with into 11%, between 10% and 11% is our comfort spot and we\u2019re operating at those levels. Canada is a drag. We\u2019ve addressed a lot of things there. I think in the next year, we won\u2019t have the drag this year. So pretty optimistic with some of that. We are getting some utilizations in the Lower 48 with some Canadian influence. But in general, we can do a lot of things on the front-end engineering. We can do a lot of things from our Canadian assets in Lower 48. So we will be utilizing them here in those assets. So I\u2019m comfortable with where we sit in the next year. We do expect and we\u2019re still negotiating some, but I feel confident that the larger project dynamic will start stacking in 2024, albeit early, but you\u2019ll start to see some stocking in 2024. \nSteven Fisher: Perfect. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing remarks.\nDuke Austin: Yes. First, I want to thank our 56,000 employees out in the field that put the numbers up every day that work hard and safe and allow us to have a good call this morning. They\u2019re dedicated shareholders as well. So we do appreciate them. And I\u2019d like to thank you all for participating in our conference call. We appreciate your questions and your ongoing interest in Quanta. Thank you. This concludes our call.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Duke Austin",
            "content": "Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. On the call today, I will provide operational and strategic commentary and we'll then turn it over to Jayshree Desai, Quanta CFO, to provide a review of our third quarter results and full year 2023 financial expectations. Following Jayshree's comments, we welcome your questions. This morning, we reported our third quarter results, which included strong double-digit revenue growth and a number of record financial metrics, which we believe reflects robust demand for our services and solid execution. Of note, our Electric Power Infrastructure Solutions and Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions segments drove our revenue and profit growth, reflecting ongoing capital deployment into grid modernization and hardening. Power grid expansion and construction of new renewable generation and other necessary investments needed for North America's emerging energy transition. Total backlog at quarter end was $30.1 billion, an all-time record high, which we believe reflects value of our collaborative client relationships and indicates momentum for 2024. We are positioning Quanta for decades of expected necessary infrastructure investment and continue to believe our operational portfolio is a strategic advantage that provides us the ability to manage risk and shift resources across service lines and geographies, which we believe will become increasingly important as the energy transition accelerates. We believe our portfolio approach positions us well to allocate resources to the opportunities we find most economically attractive and to achieve operating efficiencies and consistent financial results. Our Electric Power Operations are performing well. Demand for our Electric Power Infrastructure Solutions is robust driven by broad-based business activity from utility grid modernization, grid security and system hardening initiatives as well as our reputation for consistent and safe execution. This is further evidenced by the meaningful increase in backlog for the segment in the third quarter. Accordingly, we continue to invest in resources ahead of the anticipated start-up of multiple multiyear utility programs and projects. We believe Quanta Solutions offering and ability to safely and consistently execute as industry-leading, and we are uniquely positioned to collaborate with our clients on their multiyear grid programs. Additionally, our communications operations continue to execute well with double-digit revenue growth and margins. We believe these results reflect our focus on being selective with the risk and margin profile of the work we pursued as well as solid execution. Renewable Infrastructure Solutions segment revenues increased significantly in the third quarter as construction of renewable generation projects ramped up, including solar, wind and battery storage. High voltage electric transmission and substation work also remained active. Segment total backlog reached a record $7.9 billion at quarter end, driven by the addition of a portion of the SunZia Wind contract and various renewable generation, transmission and substation projects. We have mobilized resources for the SunZia project and are performing early stages \u2013 stage construction activities. Though the vast majority of the work is expected to be performed in 2024 and 2025. We believe the infrastructure solutions we provide to the renewable industry are gaining momentum as the energy transition gains pace. We are continuing to make the necessary investments to scale our resources and capacity to handle large-scale multiyear renewable programs that we expect will yield record levels of renewable generation over the coming decade, driven by the IRA and the acceleration of North America's energy transition. Additionally, we are pursuing billions of dollars of high-voltage transmission projects that are designed to support connectivity of current and future renewable generation capacity growth and overall system reliability. In this morning's earnings release, we also announced a strategic acquisition of Pennsylvania Transformer Technology or PTT, led by an experienced management team with dedicated employees. PTT is an established and reliable domestic manufacturer of power transformers and components for the investor-owned utility \u2013 electric utility, renewable energy, municipal power and industrial markets. Transformers are a critical path of power grid \u2013 of the power grid that facilitate the safe and efficient transmission of electricity from generators to end users. North America's energy transition and other megatrends that are driving current and anticipated future demand for our electric power and renewable energy solutions are also driving significant demand and growth for the transformer market. As a result, lead times are extended and demand and supply imbalances are only expected to intensify as energy-intensive sectors such as electric vehicles, renewable energy, data centers and manufacturing challenge power infrastructure capacity. As we have discussed previously, several years ago, Quanta began developing its strategy to create supply chain solutions that are designed to help our clients navigate equipment shortages and delays, reduce cost, improve availability and enhanced capital deployment efficiency, all of which can ultimately benefit the consumer. For Quanta, the addition of PTT should allow us to better manage the availability of certain critical grid components, which in turn should help us better manage our work schedules and productivity. We believe PTT provides Quanta and our clients an important, secure and domestic supply chain solution that is consistent with our strategy. The strong and visible demand dynamics for transformer market provide a favorable long-term profitable growth opportunity for PTT. The company also possesses intellectual property for certain grid [ph] components, not currently in its production, but that are also in high demand by the utility industry. As a part of Quanta, we believe there are opportunities to enhance and expand PTT's capacity and product offering, which could accelerate PTT's growth and provide incremental growth synergies for Quanta's Electric Power and Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions. The Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment continues to deliver with double-digit revenue growth and solid profitability. Our industrial services operation executed well and we had strong demand for our gas utility and pipeline integrity operations, driven by regulated spend to modernize systems, reduce methane emissions, ensure environmental compliance, and improve safety and reliability. Additionally, we are increasingly leveraging our underground resources and capabilities to perform underground electric work. While that work is recognized in our electric power segment, it evidences the value and flexibility of our solutions portfolio. The transition towards a reduced carbon economy continues to progress, and we believe is gaining momentum. We believe we are in the early stages of capitalizing on significant opportunities across our service lines and geographies, driven by our collaborative solution-based approach designed to ultimately benefit consumers. Additionally, the growth of programmatic spending with existing and new customers as well as increased renewable generation activity and favorable megatrends provide greater visibility into our near- and long-term growth outlook. We are currently pacing ahead of long-term financial targets articulated at our Investor Day last year and are increasingly comfortable with our ability to achieve them. This belief is driven by the long-term programmatic spend customers and favorable long-term megatrend opportunities across our portfolio of services, which we believe are in the beginning stages of a multi-decade process. Quanta is investing in the future to meet the needs of our customers and take advantage of the visible opportunities ahead of us, which we believe positions us well for double-digit EPS growth in 2024 and beyond. We are focused on operating the business for the long term and expect to continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class build leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's base business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's diversity, unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset form the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for all our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Jayshree Desai, our CFO, for her review of our third quarter results and 2023 expectations. Jayshree? Morning. Yes. Thanks, Mike. For us, when we look at the customer base and when we think about where we're at and where the industry sits, I think \u2013 it's a great time to be in this business and its growth. We see growth. We see load growth at the customer level as an industry. You have trends, megatrends that are really pushing on interconnections and EV penetration in the distribution systems. So from our standpoint, at a philosophical level, you have a supply and demand issue, and you have a significant amount of build necessary for infrastructure. So the macro market is great. As far as the noise, I believe, look, from my standpoint, what we said, we're trying to provide solutions to our clients, we get pushed into a contractor, which were not, we provide the solutions. And our customer bases are much different than you may hear from others on calls. So our customers are different. And the way that our customers view the markets versus others is different. So they don't have tax equity problems. They don't have some of the problems that you hear, and we do a really nice job of talking to them and collaborating with them about where we're going, not where we're at. And so that's the difference is. We're ahead years of planning and with these clients long term versus what you may hear in the market over the next 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, we're talking decades. So I really feel comfortable with where we're at. I feel comfortable that the industry will solve the issues. Yes, there's some affordability issues running around and you're hearing about it. But this industry will solve those issues. Yes, Mike, we've worked on the acquisition for quite a while and also philosophically, how to help our customers with supply chain. So I think in general, Pennsylvania Transformer, U.S.-based domestic product, that really fits the goals of the interconnections, the queues, the larger transmission substations that are necessary to facilitate renewable load growth. When I look at it, when we think about it, yes, we can. It's not a manufacturing play for Quanta. It's more of a solution to the client. So, I wouldn't expect us to go out and buy 20 transformer companies. What I would expect us to do is add capacity to our facility. It's a one million square foot facility, one of the biggest in U.S. So we're able to really add to it. And I don't \u2013 we see some investment in it to get productivity up. Yes. We can \u2013 we will increase \u2013 there's some component lines that we'll start making that are about 1,000 days plus that we have the IP on. So there's some things there that we can do to really enhance where we sit as a solution provider in the industry. I mean look, I think we price it the same, honestly, the customer \u2013 our customers may be passing on PPA pricing and things like that, if that's what you're asking. But as far as from where we stand, we're on 60-plus large-scale renewable-type projects that are like we said in the past, are moving up our revenue. So I feel like it's \u2013 we've got really, really good customer base that we're supplying, and they continue to build their backlogs and they're not having tax equity problems and things of that nature. The company itself, the revenue size is over $100 million. We're not going to disclose purchase price. I'm sure you can find it in the K. So \u2013 but in general, it's really not about the manufacturing capacity. It's what we can do with it, the synergies we can get with it with the client. We can add some production fairly quickly.  It's an underinvested facility. We will put some money in it. I don't see our capital structure changing at all. And next year, we don't need to do a lot to the facility. So I feel good about the capital deployment in there and the productivity lines and things like that, the things that we can do with the manufacturing facility. So I like that part of it. It is booked pretty good in 2024, 2025. And so it will be about us getting more productivity out of it and really working with our clients on what capacity looks like in the future. So that's what we'll be working on and putting that into the way that we provide the solution to the client. Thanks, Neil. When we look at our customer base, we've said all along. We work for the top 10 developers as well as the utilities and the world for that matter. So I feel good about where they're at. I feel good about where they're going all of basically the trends and what we see from backlog as well as opportunities continue to grow, both with the utility business as well as developer business. I go back and say, we look at our portfolio that we put together, we've derisked it and then we've also said we could stack on to it. The company has grown in 2021. We've grown 16% in 2022. We grew 30%. This year, we're expected to grow 18%. So I don't think we have a problem with the customer base. I think we are doing really nicely. We are working on margins, as Jayshree said. But that said, sequentially, when you look at quarter-over-quarter, we said there were some cadence issues in our renewables or some cadence issues in the jobs. It's not a margin issue, it's a cadence issue. And every single quarter, we'll get better. We expect to operate in double digits next year. I think when we look at it, we still feel comfortable with kind of the model that we put together. It's way too early to give guidance on exactly what that will look like. It would be a disservice to you and us. But I do expect us over time, had the opportunity to operate above double digits on the EPS line at times, and I feel comfortable with the opportunity next year to operate in double digits. It's \u2013 I see when we look at the market, it's the best it's been in our career, and it's all about the macro market demands. People are underestimating data centers and the loads on data centers, they're underestimating EV. You're up to about 7% of new car sales into EV globally. That's a big number for everyone. Your interconnections, you're even on batteries just to make the batteries and the demand on the power cycle there. So I think all those things are underestimated when you start looking at where the business is going. And so for us, the long-term nature and the megatrends that we see continue to compound, you can delay some things. It's really \u2013 for us, it's really worrying about the ultimate customer and affordability at the ultimate customer level and how do we help our clients and help the ultimate customer get a cost price that makes sense. And as you see, as you get leverage across what you're building with more demand, what you're seeing 3% demand almost every single place has at least some demand growth, load growth, that load growth itself is really, really enhancing what a utility can spend on capital. Obviously, the market's a little constrained there on the capital markets, but the demand is outfitting supply. So it's some timing in places. But like I've never seen where we see so many things at once coming at you from a macro market. So we're real proud to be in this business. And look, I get up every day and happy about me in here and trying to execute on the work that we have. I think that's the big thing is just execution at this point. Yes. Thanks for the question. We're very deliberate about no boats, no water. So we've been there, done that. We're not involved in anything offshore other than onshore approaches and some we will help others onshore to fab or whatever it may be offshore, but we're not in the water at all and have no exposure really to offshore wind other than transmission that may be built onshore. I do think you can push some things out. I mean you can \u2013 EV penetration is not there so you cannot plan and have interconnections at the distribution level. We're seeing some where our crews, for example, are working 60, 70 hours, you're working 50 hours, but you're not losing crews, you're just working less hours and you're seeing some of that in the fourth quarter where we have crews that are just working 40. And that's fine, but we're adding crews as well. So really, as you move into 2024, they move capital budgets up, things look better. I do think load growth will exceed what most people think, it really helps with higher interest and costs. So I think we can get through that as an industry. The only thing is if you had like crazy interest, and I don't see that coming. I do believe we've kind of stabilized there and utilities either. You see some that are selling assets to put it back in the regulated business. But look, you have a duty to serve and you've seen in California where they have like 120 days to make interconnections now by law. That's going to come \u2013 it's going to be prevalent across the country. And I just don't believe that you can delay interconnections nor can you delay queue and the queue is coming out of everyone, and we've got \u2013 as an industry, we got a plan a little better. We've got to do some things, and we've got to get in front of this. And then you can't be selective in urgency here. We've got to get the planning done and the work done for the next couple of decades. So we feel confident, yes, you can have some bounces along the way, but we've always said that there'll be starts and stops a bit, but the CAGR itself will continue to drive the market for long term any kind of delay you have just means it's pent-up demand, it's coming at you. So we feel good. We feel good with our customers and our conversations have been. You may not see them grow capital 20%, they just grew at 15% or from upward levels, but I don't \u2013 I'm not seeing much pullback at all. In fact, I'm seeing more growth to capital with our clients. Yes. We're not giving guidance. So I've given the buzz all I'm going to give. And so we've talked about the opportunity to grow double digits. I think that's there. We can stack on at times. It's too early to say. The models that are out there, I don't know what's in their Kip or Jayshree can go look at it, but I didn't look at it, I just feel comfortable in the double-digit, talking about double-digit margin growth at this point opportunity for that as well. EPS growth. Thanks. Can you say that again? I'm sorry, you broke up. I think they're both growing, and we stand by the state of margins to operate in double digits. We certainly have the opportunity to operate in double digits in the renewable segment as well as the Electric segment at upper singles in the UUI [ph] business, very much like we started \u2013 we'll be prudent about how we guide. So you can expect us to guide prudently in 2024. I do \u2013 we do see growth to 2024. So the same approach we've taken for the last eight years, seven years will be taken going forward. As far as the mix, it's still running mid 80%, 85% base business, something like that. And I believe that will be there. But the large project dynamic certainly there, we're seeing multiple fronts of large projects. It will be early, but we do believe that is starting to stack a bit. Yes. Grows at the same rate. Look, we've always said we can get leverage out of the UUI margins. Our industrial business is probably a record year this year. We still like the industrial business a lot. So the margins have picked up. We have got levers. We do move back and forth. But I caution everyone again that this is a portfolio. This portfolio moves around, and you've got to look at it as a portfolio. It derisks you down at the bottom. That's why you're not seeing the blips at the bottom. Now you're seeing double-digit growth. And again, I'd caution that if we get into this segment discussion, it's these crews go from electric to gas to telecom and we should perform well in all of them. And our goal is to make sure that the company itself grows and our margin profile stays sustained over time. And that's the portfolio we've built to derisk the investor as well as provide opportunities for beyond double-digit growth. And look, we'll talk about the segments, but I go back and I point to 18% top line growth, still performing at high margins across the segments, and we're delivering double-digit EPS. Yes. I think it's where you started on all your renewables. We kind of started early in the year and late last year with multiple large projects there. So as those \u2013 and we booked all the way through, still booking. So you're getting a better cadence in the larger project dynamics. So some of them are finishing up and so that allows us to obviously look at contingent releases, things like that in the fourth quarter in the renewable segment. So that's what you're seeing. And you're also getting scale out of that business as well. As you go into 2024, same thing, the cadence, you are starting some larger line projects on transmission there. And so it will have a little bit of effect, but you don't have Canada coming in, things like that. And I can let Jayshree to comment on the rest. Yes, Steven, I would also add that we talked about 3,000 add last quarter, we added roughly 4,000 in this quarter. So we're up to 56,000 employees adding 3,000 on cadence per quarter is not easy, and it does press a bit. So I'd just caution some of that's in there. And as you start working through that and you get good cadence with it, we can absorb a lot. Yes. We're operating really well in the electric segment. I mean, over time, I've always said double digits, 10%, 10.5% with into 11%, between 10% and 11% is our comfort spot and we're operating at those levels. Canada is a drag. We've addressed a lot of things there. I think in the next year, we won't have the drag this year. So pretty optimistic with some of that. We are getting some utilizations in the Lower 48 with some Canadian influence. But in general, we can do a lot of things on the front-end engineering. We can do a lot of things from our Canadian assets in Lower 48. So we will be utilizing them here in those assets. So I'm comfortable with where we sit in the next year. We do expect and we're still negotiating some, but I feel confident that the larger project dynamic will start stacking in 2024, albeit early, but you'll start to see some stocking in 2024. Yes. First, I want to thank our 56,000 employees out in the field that put the numbers up every day that work hard and safe and allow us to have a good call this morning. They're dedicated shareholders as well. So we do appreciate them. And I'd like to thank you all for participating in our conference call. We appreciate your questions and your ongoing interest in Quanta. Thank you. This concludes our call."

            "name": "Jayshree Desai",
            "content": "Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced record third quarter revenues of $5.6 billion. Net income attributable to common stock was $273 million or $1.83 per diluted share and adjusted diluted earnings per share was a record $2.24. Our third quarter electric power revenues were $2.5 billion, and operating income margins were 11.9% as a result of the exceptional performance by our base business activities and telecom operations. Renewable Energy Infrastructure segment revenues for third quarter 2023 was $1.7 billion with operating income margins of 8.7%. The revenue strength in the quarter reflects continued momentum behind renewable energy infrastructure, the quality of our customers and our comprehensive solutions-based approach to the energy transition. Segment margins improved sequentially as construction activities accelerated across our portfolio of projects. However, they were pressured somewhat by lower-than-expected contingency releases on more mature projects that progressed during the quarter. It's also worth noting that profit associated with revenues from early-stage work is generally recognized at a lower margin as risk contingencies are included in the cost to complete. During periods of high growth and new project starts, this margin dynamic can be exacerbated, which is influencing 2023 segment margins as year-to-date renewable revenues have grown roughly 50% from 2022. Underground Utility and Infrastructure segment revenues were $1.4 billion for the quarter, and operating income margins were 8.9%, driven by high volumes, solid execution and better fixed cost absorption on increased revenues. For additional commentary comparing third quarter 2023 to third quarter 2022, please refer to the slides accompanying this call, At September 30, 2023, total backlog was a record $30.1 billion, an increase of $2.9 billion compared to June 30, with growth coming from both large project awards and our base business activities. Our 12-month backlog is also at a record level of $17 billion, approximately $1.4 billion higher than June 30. For the third quarter of 2023, we had free cash flow of $280 million. DSO measured 79 days for the third quarter, aided by favorable billing arrangements associated with certain awards during the quarter. Regarding the Canadian renewable transmission project we've discussed in prior calls, the contract asset balance grew during the quarter as we progressed closer to completion. We continue to have favorable discussions with the customer regarding significant portions of the balance representing approximately seven days of DSO as of September 30, and we remain confident in our position. As of September 30, 2023, we had total liquidity of approximately $2 billion and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.2 times as calculated under our credit agreement. During the quarter, we made a small acquisition that will primarily report through our Electric segment and as we announced in today's release, earlier this week, we closed on the strategic acquisition of Pennsylvania Transformer to help address a critical supply chain constraint for our utility, renewable and industrial customers. While we always measure capital deployment against the return opportunities presented by stock repurchases, we continue to see an active pipeline of strategic opportunities that we believe can be executed at accretive valuation and have the ability to drive significant stockholder value. Turning to our guidance. We performed well through the first nine months of the year, and demand for our portfolio of solutions remains robust. As a result, we are raising our consolidated revenue expectations for the year to range between $20.1 billion and $20.4 billion. From a segment perspective, last quarter, we expected electric volumes to ramp in the fourth quarter. However, as it stands today, we now see revenues in the fourth quarter comparable to the third quarter. Part of the fourth quarter reduction reflects the transferability of resources between the Electric and Renewable segments as renewable revenues continue to expand and encompass both interconnection and generation projects, with interconnection work being performed by crews that would otherwise be captured in the Electric segment. Additionally, we are seeing pockets of inefficiencies due to supply chain dynamics as well as timing of capital deployment in certain regions shifting into 2024. This variability is a periodic disruption to an otherwise growing demand for our electric solutions, as evidenced by our backlog growth from June 30 levels. Accordingly, we now see Electric segment revenues for the year between $9.6 billion and $9.7 billion, and full year margins for the segment ranging between 10.4% and 10.6% as we continue to build crews and carry costs necessary to execute on the anticipated growth in multiyear utility programs. Of note, we are forecasting storm revenues for the year of around $300 million, roughly 3% of segment revenues for the year, the lowest level of 2019. Regarding our Renewable segment, given the performance of the third quarter and continued backlog growth, we are raising our full year revenue expectations to range between $5.8 billion and $5.9 billion. Because of the previously described margin dynamics as well as continued investments in labor, training and equipment required to address the segment's building backlog, we now expect margins for the segment to be around 8% for the year. After another strong quarter, we now expect revenue from our Underground segment to range between $4.7 billion and $4.8 billion, a $300 million increase at the midpoint. From a margin perspective, we expect full year margins for the segment to range between 7.6% and 7.8%, an improved outlook and above the previous high end of our range. Not included in our expectations are contributions from Pennsylvania Transformer, which will be captured in both our Electric and Renewable segments. We are working through purchase price allocation and accounting considerations and aren't prepared to give any definitive guidance, but given the size of the business today, we don't expect the contribution to be material to our quarterly results. In the aggregate, we expect revenues for the year to be almost 20% higher than 2022, and we've increased our expectations for full year adjusted EBITDA to range between $1.91 billion and $1.95 billion. For full year adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock, we've now narrowed our prior range, maintained our previous midpoint and now expect between $7 and $7.20. With regard to free cash flow, we continue to expect between $800 million and $1 billion. We slightly modified other aspects of our guidance, the details of which are included in our outlook summary, which can be found in the Financial Information section of our IR website at quantaservices.com. Our growing backlog and favorable multiyear outlook continues to give us confidence in our ability to achieve the multiyear targets we laid out in our April 2022 Investor Day. Additionally, we believe the acquisition of Pennsylvania Transformer further cements our ability to provide differentiating solutions to our core customers and elevates the critical role we play in the North American energy transition. We are uniquely positioned in the markets we serve and believe we have the opportunity to continue improving our return on invested capital and generating significant stockholder value through organic growth and strategic capital deployment. I'll now turn it back to the operator for Q&A. Operator? Good morning. Yes. Justin, and the margins are improving in that segment. We have been able to absorb some of the fixed costs that we had built in earlier in the year, ramping up for the significant growth that we had this quarter and continue to see. So it's moving in the right direction. There are some material components to the segment, no doubt that's higher than our electric segment. But overall, we're seeing margins moving in line with what we had said to you all in the Investor Day in that 9% to 10% range. We did have a little bit of pressure this quarter because of our expectation on some contingency releases that didn't materialize. Those projects still are performing quite well. It just didn't knock it out of the park, which we had thought we could have in the second quarter. It's \u2013 it's really some of that. And then at the same time, you have the significant ramp in renewables, that new project dynamic as it comes in, they'd come in at a lower margin because you need to execute the contingencies before we can raise those margins. And so that is providing \u2013 that is creating some dilutive pressure, and that's what you're seeing in the third quarter. There is no \u2013 there is no other dynamic around the business itself that's causing anything. It will get better and it is continuing to get better. Good morning. Double-digit EPS. As well as our base business growth. Yes. I mean, that's exactly right. There's that \u2013 and then we'll continue to progress on the other parts of the segment, right? As those projects mature, there are opportunities, and there were opportunities to release contingencies. We'll continue to see that in the fourth quarter. And as Duke said, the scale it was for growing you're going to start seeing \u2013 you're seeing more and more of that fixed cost absorption. There will be more of that in the fourth quarter. So the combination of matured projects as well as that fixed cost absorption is allowing us to feel comfortable with the guide in the fourth quarter."

With that, I will now turn the call over to Duke Austin, Quanta's President and CEO. Duke?\nEarl Austin: Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today, I will provide operational and strategic commentary, and we'll then turn it over to Jayshree Desai, Quanta's CFO, to provide a review of our second quarter results and full-year 2023 financial expectations. Following Jayshree's comments, we welcome your questions. Our second quarter results continue our solid start to the year with strong double-digit revenue growth that resulted in record quarterly revenues exceeding $5 billion for the first time in our history as well as a record total backlog of $27.2 billion. We added approximately 3,000 employees during the second quarter due to the building momentum and increasing demand for our infrastructure solutions. We are investing in safety and training programs for our employees expanding various service lines and advancing our supply chain and other solutions. We are positioning Quanta for decades of necessary infrastructure investment and continue to believe our operational portfolio is a strategic advantage that provides us the ability to manage risk and shift resources across service lines and geographies, which we believe will become increasingly important as the energy transition accelerates. We believe our portfolio approach positions us well to allocate resources to the opportunities we find the most economically attractive and to achieve operating efficiencies and consistent financial results. Our Electric Power Operations are performing well overall, though segment margin experienced some pressure from lower utilizations in Canada. Demand for our Electric Power Infrastructure Solutions is strong. driven by broad-based business activity from utility grid modernization, grid security and system hardening initiatives as well as our reputation for consistent and safe execution. Accordingly, we are investing in resources ahead of the anticipated start-up of multiple multiyear utility programs and projects. Additionally, our communications operations continue to execute well from both a revenue and margin perspective. Going forward, our utility customers' multiyear CapEx plans remain strong and we are having discussions with a number of them about capital plans and programs looking out in years. North America's power grid continues to be challenged by a number of demands, including the need to increase the pace of modernization and increase the grid's resiliency and reliability through system hardening, enabling new technologies, facilitating higher levels of electric vehicle penetration, meeting growing power load demand and capitalizing on favorable federal and state policies designed to accelerate the energy transition. We believe Quanta Solutions offering and ability to safely consistently execute is industry-leading. We are uniquely positioned to collaborate with our clients on their multiyear grid operations. Renewable Infrastructure Solutions segment revenues increased significantly in the quarter as construction of renewable generation projects within the multiyear programs ramped up and high-voltage electric transmission and substation work remained active. Segment total backlog reached a record $7 billion at quarter end, driven by the addition of SunZia transmission and HPDC converter station contracts and various renewable generation, transmission and substation projects. We believe the momentum in this segment will continue, and we are making the necessary investments to scale our resources and capacity to handle multiyear renewable programs that we expect will yield record levels of new renewable generation over the coming decade, driven by the RA and acceleration of North America's energy transition. Additionally, we are pursuing billions of dollars of high-voltage transmission projects that are designed to support current and future renewable generation capacity growth and overall system reliability. As we have discussed on prior earnings calls and reported more recently in the media, federal and state policies designed to accelerate the energy transition and the electrification of everything, are expected to significantly increase load demand and are already pressuring the power grid. At the same time, there are significant challenges to getting regional transmission infrastructure built in a timely manner, primarily due to obtaining necessary environmental permits and regulatory approvals. The need for collaboration at all levels to ensure great reliability while minimizing cost impacts to the ratepayer remains the industry's greatest challenge. We remain pleased with the performance of our Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment, which delivered double-digit revenue growth and record second quarter profitability, demonstrating solid execution across our operations in this segment. Our Industrial Services Operations executed well, and we had strong demand for our gas utility and pipeline integrity operations, driven by regulated spend to modernize systems, reduced methane emissions, ensured environmental compliance and improved safety and reliability. We believe we are in the early stages of capitalizing on significant opportunities across our service lines and geographies, which are driven by our collaborative solution-based approach that is designed to ultimately benefit consumers. Additionally, the growth of programmatic spending, with existing and new customers, increased renewable generation activity and favorable megatrends provide greater visibility into our near- and long-term growth outlook. As a result of these dynamics and our solid year-to-date financial performance, we have increased our full-year 2023 financial expectations for revenues, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The energy transition towards a reduced carbon economy continues to progress, and we believe is gaining pace. Quanta is successfully executing on our strategic initiatives to drive sustainable and resilient operational excellence, total cost solutions for our clients and consistent profitable growth. We are focused on operating the business for the long term and expect to continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class build leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's base business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's diversity, unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset form the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Jayshree Desai, our CFO, for her review of the second quarter results and 2023 expectations. Jayshree?\nJayshree Desai: Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced record second quarter revenues of $5 billion. Net income attributable to common stock was $166 million or $1.12 per diluted share and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.65. Our second quarter electric power revenues were $2.4 billion and operating income margins were 10.1% consistent with our expectations for sequential revenue growth and margin expansion against our first quarter results. Our base business activities continue to lead the way for the segment of utility investments in hardening and modernization initiatives create growing demand for our comprehensive solutions. While the segment executed at a double-digit margin profile, it was negatively impacted by a lower-than-expected utilization of electric resources in Canada. Renewable Energy Infrastructure segment revenues for second quarter '23 were $1.4 billion, with operating income margins of 8%. The revenue strength in the quarter reflects the growing momentum behind renewable energy infrastructure and our customers' ability to move forward with construction activities in this favorable regulatory environment. Margins improved sequentially as increased revenues contributed to better cost absorption and as we successfully executed through risks on ongoing projects. Underground Utility and Infrastructure segment revenues were $1.2 billion for the quarter, and operating income margins were 8.6%, a noteworthy second quarter performance. Both large projects and base business operations contributed to the elevated revenues with margins benefiting from improved fixed cost absorption. For additional commentary comparing 2Q '23 to 2Q '22, please refer to the slides accompanying this call. Regarding backlog, with the inclusion of two of the three contracts with the previously announced SunZia award and continued robust activity in our Renewable segment we achieved another record level at quarter end. At June 30, 2023, backlog was $27.2 billion, an increase of $1.9 billion compared to March 31. Our 12-month backlog is also at a record level of $15.6 billion, approximately $1 billion higher than March 31. For the second quarter of 2023, we had free cash flow of $46 million. measured 78 days for the second quarter, lower than our historical average and aided by favorable billing arrangements associated with certain awards during the quarter. Regarding the Canadian Renewable Transmission Project, we've discussed in prior quarters, based on operating conditions and our ability to achieve stakeholder targets while overcoming the COVID-19-related challenges encountered throughout the course of the project, we decided to accelerate the construction schedule into the spring and early summer. As a result, the contract asset balance grew during the quarter and continues to pressure DSO, and will do so until we finish the project. Given our successful execution in the field and the ongoing discussions with the customer regarding significant portions of the balance representing approximately six to seven days of DSO as of June 30, we remain confident in our position. As of June 30, 2023, we had total liquidity of approximately $1.8 billion and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5 as calculated under our credit agreement. We expect second half earnings growth and cash generation to support our ability to delever over the coming quarters while continuing to create stockholder value through opportunistic capital deployment. Turning to our guidance. We are pleased with our performance through the first half of the year and see significant strength in the back half of the year, particularly the fourth quarter. From a segment perspective, we continue to expect Electric Segment revenues between $10 billion and $10.1 billion for the year. However, we expect full-year margins will be impacted by the costs incurred this year in preparation for the anticipated growth in multiyear utility programs. That, along with pressure from our Canadian operations, is leading us to lower our full-year margin expectations for the segment to range between 10.5% and 11%. Regarding our Renewables segment, given the performance of the second quarter and increased visibility into project activity, we are raising our full-year revenue expectations for the segment by $700 million, now ranging between $5.2 billion and $5.4 billion. We continue to expect margins around 8.5% for the year as much of the work is just getting started, and we will need to execute through project risks before margins have the opportunity to improve. After a good second quarter, we now expect revenues from our Underground segment to range between $4.4 billion and $4.5 billion, a $250 million increase at the midpoint and we continue to expect full-year margins for the segment to range between 7% and 7.5%. As Duke said, given our performance to date and improved visibility, we are raising our full-year revenue expectations, which we now expect to range between $19.6 billion and $20 billion, a $950 million increase at the midpoint of our range. We've increased our expectation for full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock to now range between $6.90 and $7.30 and increased our expectation for full-year adjusted EBITDA to range between $1.88 billion and $1.97 billion for the year. With regard to free cash flow, we are modestly raising our full-year expectations, primarily due to the expected increase in renewable revenues, which typically have a favorable working capital profile compared to our other segments. Therefore, we now expect free cash flow for the year to range between $800 million and $1 billion, with the highest levels in the fourth quarter as is typically the case. We slightly modified other aspects of our guidance, the details of which are included in our outlook summary, which can be found in the Financial Information Section of our IR website at quantaservices.com. Looking ahead, we are excited by the momentum and highly visible and growing multiyear outlook behind our Electric and Renewable segments. Additionally, we are encouraged by the strength of our underground utility and infrastructure segment, which continues to grow and execute at a high level. With this core operating portfolio, we are confident in our ability to deliver comprehensive solutions to support the energy transition and to create significant shareholder value through organic growth and strategic capital investment. I'll now turn it back to the operator for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed.\nBrent Thielman: Great, hey thank you. Good morning. A nice rebound in renewable margin this quarter. I was wondering if you could just provide an update on solar supply chain pressures previously seen, maybe how that may or may not still be impacting the new renewables business? And should that sort of be a factor here still for you for the rest of the year?\nEarl Austin: Thank you. Good morning. We're seeing what we thought would happen with the solar supply chain slashing in general, I think we are operating through those issues, and we had six months really where the industry stopped. And as we move forward, we thought there would be cadence to the segment to solar in general. That cadence is playing out like we thought. We're certainly increasing guidance due to some of that. And I think as you go through '23 and you operate through '24, you'll get a more balanced quarter-over-quarter type margin profile, but the margin pickups and the opportunities that we see on the other side of the year -- second half of the year into '24, '25 and beyond are certainly what we thought are greater.\nBrent Thielman: Got it. Thanks, Duke. And then just my follow-up. Can you talk about what from SunZia is reflected in bookings this quarter? Is there still more to come as you're likely still in negotiations? Is it all represented here in the financials?\nEarl Austin: No. We're still negotiating a third contract there on the wind side of the business. So that will be -- we believe we'll have that finished up here in the second half of the year, third quarter, fourth quarter, somewhere in there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed.\nMichael Dudas: Good morning, Kip, Duke, Jayshree.\nEarl Austin: Good morning, Mike.\nMichael Dudas: Duke, I want to follow-up on your prepared remarks, you talked about the challenges that the customers, utilities and regulators are facing. Have -- I assume to date, they've been overcome? Are there -- do you anticipate or given your discussions with your utility clients that there's going to be much more coming ahead like in the next 12 to 18 months? Or is it sooner? And is that impacting any of the mix of what type of either wind or solar development or what -- from regulators and customer base are looking at as you pace out your backlog opportunities?\nEarl Austin: Yes, Mike, good question. When we look at regulation and you look at the -- what's going on at the consumer level, when you rebate EVs, the way we're rebating and then the grid itself at the distribution level certainly needs a rebuild, a significant modernization. So that needs to get started now, not when the consumer is getting his car and bringing it to the home, and they have no way to power their vehicle or it's inter-minute power. So I think as an industry, we've always been in front of what we anticipate. In those levels, we have to get in front of that. So at a federal level and state level, the collaboration with -- along with utility customer is necessary and where you have states that are worried on the bill and the capital at the consumer level, which we are as well, and you have federal pushing the other direction. We've just got to get a better mechanism to make sure that we can service what's coming at us. I think when you listen to the car manufacturers, when you listen to anything that we've been talking about, we thought that generation would double, we're here in triple now. There's no question it's moving forward. If it's double, if it's triple and you're also decreasing the decarbonization of coal and gas with renewables, the impacts for interconnections for transmission, the rebuilds that are necessary are monumental and the necessary capital to go into the grid, although when you look -- when you go forward and you try to net present value, total cost of energy, I think it's the right answer. It's just we have to get started with the capital plans and they're greater than you may anticipate or anyone may anticipate as you move forward. So it's just trying to put people in front of that and make sure the industry is collaborating. When we look at our clients even with inflation, even with everything that's going on, the capital is moving up. It's just the pace of where we need to be five years from now. It's not a matter of tomorrow. It's a matter of three years from now, five years from now in the industry itself is certainly I'm talking about the need for transmission and also the modernization of distribution systems.\nMichael Dudas: So I guess from a -- the industry has been growing base load electricity at very slow rates. And are your customers seeing that going to be accelerating in the next five years? And again, are the plans there to that you have the ability to capacity given your three to five year outlook to execute on that?\nEarl Austin: I think when you look at transmission, certainly, it's necessary if your fuel switching and then where the load is going from data centers, AI to just about everything, you're seeing load growth now in the industry across the board, you've got 110-degree heat. You had a low, what I would consider a mild winter, first quarter was pretty mild for the industry. But July into August, you're 100 plus in many areas. It just -- those impacts to the way capital is spent and where it's necessary to spend. You start moving up deviations of temperatures on this grid from a planning standpoint, it's exponential of load.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS. Please proceed.\nSteven Fisher: Thanks. Good morning. Obviously, some of the investments you're making for growth are weighing a little bit on the electric margins for now, but it's not really a new concept you've long talked about how you need to make investments to prudently support the growth. So can you maybe just talk a little bit about some of those investments that you've made this year already to support the growth, if you can kind of quantify year-over-year what that impact is? And how should we think about the investments for the second half versus the first half kind of where you're making these investments and out of frame what that might look like in '24 relative to the investments in '23?\nEarl Austin: Yes, Steve, I think when you look at the quarter, we added from around 3,000 employees. We normally add about a 1,000. So when you start thinking through that, it does pressure where the company is capable of training, doing all the things that we need to do, the investments are already made. It's just pressure, there's four or five things that we could call out that's pressuring inflation, and you can call out whether we can make all kinds of excuses about it. Really, we can operate much better in Canada than we have been operating. The transition is a little bit behind in Canada, where we can operate Canada at normalized margins. We've been through the pandemic there. We've made different levels of, I would say, balance from G&A to training, to indirect and all those kind of things in Canada. As we move out of '23 into '24, you'll get into more normalized Canadian execution, and I think you'll see much better results that we can absorb just about anything. The portfolio that we put together in the segments, which should allow us to train, to put people in place for the foreseeable future. And still even in outward growth years, produce the type of margins that we produced in the past. I see no reason why we can. And I do believe we can operate the renewable segment in double-digits. I'll stand by it.\nSteven Fisher: Okay. And maybe just to follow-up there. Jayshree mentioned that the Renewables margins are staying in this range until you can get comfortable with, I guess, execution and some of the other risk factors. So how should we think about the timing for allowing some of that upside to be realized in the margins and when could we see that better margin come through Renewables?\nEarl Austin: Yes, Steve. We're starting quite a few large transmission projects in the segment. We're also starting thousands of renewable-type utility scale solar win. So when we look at that and where we're at, the cadence itself, we thought it would be back end loaded. So the start to the jobs as we operate through those contingencies, I think you'll see a more normalized margin profile into '24. We have to operate in double-digits in the second half or you won't get to the numbers that you -- what you see. I do think there's opportunities all the way through for us, we took a prudent approach to it. We tried to hit it down the middle. That's what we've done here. And I do think there's opportunities into '24 to get on a more normalized cadence.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please proceed.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Good morning, everyone.\nJayshree Desai: Good morning.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Would backlogs continue to rise in your underground utility business and revenue has actually continued to pick up. I know last quarter, you were modestly concerned. You did raise the forecast there for the year. for this year. So what are you seeing on the ground there? And how are you thinking about the business moving forward? Could it end up being more resilient even into '24 than you expected?\nEarl Austin: When we look at the UI segment, we've said that we thought we could get scale through some regional offices through the portfolio. I think you're starting to see that show up in the segment. We did -- we've operated great. We've had good industrial performance in the first half of the year. When you get into the back half, we do see some -- we have some pipe awards that we were awarded. We have some good things going on. We don't need those things to make the numbers. So we do see opportunity but you also have the weather impacts. We're doing more electrical underground. And so that will shift some of our UI segment over in the Electric segment. Just the way the segment reporting works, but as far as the crews and what we're doing from the scalability, it should rise our returns on the company. It will rise returns on the company overall. And the segment is also doing nicely in our service lines.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Duke, maybe if I could follow-up on that. You did 8.6 in that UI segment, which is basically as high as we've seen Quanta deliver but it's maybe the consistency over the last few quarters that's been interesting in that segment. So based on your comments, scale, balancing of the businesses there, could you continue to see more consistent and higher margin in that segment moving forward?\nEarl Austin: I always thought we would operate in upper single-digits, and I see expectation. We are prudent about how we got in the second half due to the weather and northern climbs and things of that nature. But I do think that overall segment can operate in that upper single-digit range. We are pushing -- you are getting absorptions throughout due to the fact that you're doing electric and gas and telecom and renewables out of the same offices, you're going to see some scale out of that. And those margins are going to rise a bit, and that's what you're seeing show up.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Justin Hauke with Baird. Please proceed.\nJustin Hauke: Good morning, everybody. I guess I wanted to ask a little bit in the Electric segment, the equity income contribution, which I know is multiple things, but it's mostly LUMA. At $9.4 million this quarter, it's -- it was kind of light last quarter as well. It looks like you took your guidance down a little bit for the contribution from there. Given that last year, it was kind of running almost at double these levels, is there anything that's kind of changed in that business that maybe we should think about that this is kind of the more appropriate run rate of the contribution from that?\nEarl Austin: LUMA is performing as expected, there are some investments that we have in other businesses there that are off on the first half. We expect those to pick up in the '23 and into '24. But Jayshree, you can comment.\nJayshree Desai: Yes, Justin, we had a couple of outsized events from last year. We had a storm that helped our -- some of those entities in that part of the segment. And we also had some catch-up in LUMA, that's what you were seeing last year. This year, in general, the -- that part of the segment is performing very well. We continue to see the operations going as we would expect, a little bit of pullback, but nothing systemic, and we believe we can operate through a lot of that and continue to perform at these levels.\nJustin Hauke: Okay. And then maybe following up on Andy's question on just the margins in underground. Obviously, they were quite strong. Usually, you would have more margin in the second half than you do in 2Q, but your guidance would imply a little bit softer than it was in 2Q. But is there anything unusual like project closeout or something like that, anything quantifiable that was in the quarter that made those margins unexpectedly high?\nJayshree Desai: No.\nEarl Austin: No. I mean we said our Industrial business performed really well in the quarter as well. So that certainly was strength in the quarter. And I do think when you start to look out, you do not have great visibility in the fourth quarter in the Industrial business. So that said, the prudent guidance would be to pull it down a bit in the fourth quarter. And that's kind of what you're seeing show up.\nJustin Hauke: Okay, fair enough. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nNeil Mehta: Yes, thank you. A couple of big picture questions. Duke, maybe your perspective on the M&A markets here. It has clearly been a core competency for you guys, particularly as we saw with Blattner, what do you think the market looks like for M&A? And are you thinking to the extent it is opening up smaller bolt-ons versus larger strategic?\nEarl Austin: Yes. M&A, we have a strategy. We have a five-year strategy to provide solutions to our customers. We see opportunities across the board really to add-on, bolt-on, provide solutions, do some things that we talked about our front-end services. There's no shortage of opportunities out there. We're picky about how we go about it, and we'll follow the strategy. We're watching our cash generation. We're making sure we can absorb what we have, and we'll be prudent about how we go forward. And anything that we're doing is following the five-year plan, the strategy we laid out to our investors and we're ahead of those plans significantly. And I feel like the company is in a great position to provide those solutions that are necessary to keep the company moving forward at the pace that we've seen in the past. And we have good visibility into the next decade. And we're known for execution. We have to keep executing in the field, while looking at the strategy to add on and deploy capital in the proper manner for our stakeholders.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks, Duke. And that was the follow-up. If I go back to last April, you talked about the glide path of $6 to $6.50, I believe it was to $8 to $8.50. So like a 7% to 10% EPS CAGR. But then you talked about upside scenarios where you could get as high as $11 or $12. Just could you just give us a status update on how you think you're tracking relative to that plan? And remind us again, what are the levers that would get you beyond the base case of that $8 to $9.50 to some of those upside scenarios?\nEarl Austin: I think when you look at our guidance at the EPS level, which is what we're measured upon, we're ahead of the 10% guide now on a growth basis this year, relatively 13% or better. So when I think about it, we're already doing that as we sit here today. And I do think we set all levers of the balance sheet, the opportunities that we see going forward. We'll continue to, we hear a lot of big numbers and those kind of things. We're executing at the local level. We're executing across the strategy and doing the things we need to do to drive EPS. And it's not just the top line, it's the quality of earnings. We're constantly talking about quality of earnings. If you look at our returns on return on invested capital and all of our returns, they are moving in the right direction as we go forward.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Martin Malloy with Johnson Rice. Please proceed.\nMartin Malloy: Good morning. Congratulations on the quarter. My first question, I wanted to ask about the outlook for CO2 pipelines related to the carbon capture and sequestration. And just following on Exxon's acquisition of Denbury in part related to Exxon wanting to get larger in terms of the CO2 pipeline infrastructure. And just kind of curious what you're seeing out there in terms of outlook for potential building on those kind of pipelines?\nEarl Austin: Yes. We see opportunities there across the board on hydrogen and also carbon sequestration. We do see that market as being a nice market. The blinds are usually smaller that they run longer, but they're smaller on that type of builds. But we're in constant discussions with the operators as well as the end users of hydrogen and also carbon the way we're looking at it. So I do think you'll see some of those lines move forward in '24, be some opportunities for us. The bill, the RA certainly provides economic benefit on both sides of that. And I do think that will help the market as well. So we are seeing opportunities in that area and staying in front of it. We've had some nice pipe awards. So we're happy with the business. We certainly said we would be able to handle those type of things and we can, and we are. So I think it's opportunities for us. It's not the main stay of the business, but we certainly like it.\nMartin Malloy: Okay. And then for my follow-up question, I wanted to ask about undergrounding of transmission distribution lines. And it seems like it's appearing more in the press and utility company commentary about these multiyear programs to underground electric lines. Can you maybe talk a little bit about what your thing out there from a customer perspective, is that -- is it investment in those type of programs? Is it picking up meaningfully?\nEarl Austin: I mean you see it in the West, the fire hardening that's going on and the fires out West from an insurability and what the punitive nature of a fire is to utility at this point, you have no choice but to start undergrounding. And I think you've seen that in the West. We're in early stages of that. It will continue on. It's decades of type reconstruction, but many of the lines that are out there in fire prone areas will go underground. They're not -- the insurance rates, things of that nature make it economical to underground, which you would have never said that a decade ago. And today, it's the only way. So I do believe you'll see the prevalent underground transmission in the corridors that we are. You have large wire constraints when you start looking at the larger transmission, the wire in Europe and things of that nature, that supply chain is tight. I do believe when you move forward some of those bigger projects that are undergrounding transmission will come about. We're certainly around the edges on those. But I mean, the mainstay work is overhead, long haul will still be in the air. Where in the fire prone areas, you'll see some underground.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard with Bernstein. Please proceed.\nChad Dillard: Hi, good morning guys. So my question is about the large versus small project mix, particularly for Electric Power and Renewables. Can you talk about what that mix is in the first half? What do it look like in the second half? And what did that second half exit rate mean for '24 and ultimately margins?\nEarl Austin: Yes. I don't look at it. We don't look at it like that from our standpoint. It's really utilizations. The utilizations are great on all segments. You'll see bigger work. If you want to talk about a project, it will be more in your Renewables at this point. Your bigger programs, your multi-year programs will be more in Electric. It's just the deployment of capital, same crews, same people, cross and segments. So we're cognizant of that. The utilizations on both sides will be at high levels. What I will say is the company itself, no matter what segment you're in, the project starts are significant, and the cadence will start to stack versus just being a starting -- on the starting line. And right now, we're kind of in the early stages of a lot of large projects and programs. So those early stages will as you move in out of '23 into '24, into '25, you'll start to stack on top of that, and you'll get a normalized cadence where you'll see it as we operate through them contingencies move out, things of that nature as long as we execute like we have the last 25 years. We'll be in good shape, and we'll see those contingencies flow into future earnings.\nChad Dillard: That's helpful. And then my next question is on the Northwest Lineman's College. Just trying to understand your ability to scale that just to meet the demand and labor if we're looking over the next three to five years? Maybe you can talk about like what the capacity is today and where it can go over that time period? And then also the 3,000 people that you brought on what was -- how much came from Northwest versus other channels?\nEarl Austin: We recruit just internally across the Board, Northwest certainly is our some -- there's a lot of curriculum work, a lot of work that's necessary to be able to scale. It's one thing to add -- it's another thing to add 3,000 every quarter or 1,000 every quarter. And also while we're not totally pleased with the Electric margins, it's down 25 basis points or whatever it is on the guide. There's opportunities to operate at the same level we thought. That said, it's not as easy as we make it sound. They are certainly contributing to our ability to put the people in the field and execute very quickly and as we get absorption and things of that nature, that's only -- will only scale. And I do think we've invested in those colleges. We've invested in those curriculums, and we're not having issues with cross-skilled labor or front-end engineering. Could we use more? Yes. But we're able to meet the demands and the foreseeable demands on any type of curve we're looking at. We hope that supply chain catches up with us.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.\nJamie Cook: [Technical Difficulty].\nEarl Austin: Jamie, you're breaking up. I can't hear you. You got to do it again.\nJamie Cook: Right. Hold on. Can you hear me now?\nEarl Austin: Got you.\nJamie Cook: Okay. Sorry. So my first question, if I think about your guide for 2023 and the back half earnings trajectory, it's $2.10 a quarter or so, which implies if we just annualize that earnings of, let's say, a base of $8.40 million and that's without SunZia. So I'm just trying to think about the back half of earnings in the setup and what that implies for 2024 is like can we think of an $8 base for 2024 without SunZia and that would imply upside to that? And then my second question is more to you, strategically. I understand you're fairly comfortable with your ability to ramp labor in this environment and capitalize on the growth opportunities. But to what degree do you get concerned just with projects like the size of SunZia that you want to limit the number of big projects you want to take on just in terms of more from a risk management perspective? Thank you.\nEarl Austin: Thanks, Jamie. I figured I'd get '24 guidance. So I think when we look at it, of course. '24, you have some seasonality in the numbers and the run rate. I do think we talked about double-digit type growth at the EPS line. I don't see no reason why we won't continue those kind of numbers. Can it get outward, yes. We're not ready to guide to that. We see a great market. We're starting on great markets. I agree with you. We're stacking it certainly bodes well for us going into next year. When we look at the projects, the larger projects have been through that before with CREZ and other things in the company. We're highly focused on the customer and the customer level, the baseload work, we're still at a baseload work of 80-plus percent. That hasn't changed. I don't think it will. We will get large projects as we move forward. We are in negotiations constantly around programs and projects. You have to think about some of them being multi-year, five years in nature. Some of them are short nature. So it's just different type of projects. The company itself is focused on execution on those projects. I see both sides of it, I think we're seeing more material content within our EPC business. So just different things that the company is capitalizing on. So when you look at a return basis, our returns go better if we're able to sort of the material content as well. So lots of things going our way on that. And I think it's a competitive advantage for us moving forward as we start to be a large purchaser of material. So I like it. I like what we're doing. I think it will only enhance -- the larger products will only enhance the business and the base business as well as how we provide that solution to the client.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis & Company. Please proceed.\nAdam Thalhimer: Hey, good morning guys. Nice quarter. Hey, Duke, what's the outlook for large T&D projects in Canada? And if it's not good, can you shift some of those resources back to the U.S.?\nEarl Austin: Good question. We see a good market in Canada. We have some awards already that we anticipate starting on by the end of the year. We have some great clients partnering in Puerto Rico. So -- and a lot of customers in Canada, we are able to move resources, engineering capacity. Some of the things that we do in Canada over in the Lower 48. I wish it was easier. I wish the border was easier. It would certainly help us from a skillset standpoint. But that said, the company has done a nice job moving resources and doing some things in Canada. In general, when I look and step back at it, COVID played a big impact much more than we had here in the Lower 48, and we forget about it a lot. And we think, oh, well, it was nothing. It was significant. And we were in camps, we were doing some things there that were different. If we don't see the market will downsize the market, but we do see that -- what we see right now is the transition happening there as well. We're seeing more -- we're seeing wind, solar, some hydro different things in Canada to decarbonize as well. We're right in the middle of those things. It's just a little bit behind the Lower 48. And as we catch up, I think you'll see more normalized margins in Canada and a great market.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. And then in the Renewable segment, I hate to ask about '24. But Jamie started it. You guys kind of -- yes, exactly. You guys kind of blew me away top-line for renewables for 2023. And I'm just curious if you can -- or how you think you might build on that next year?\nEarl Austin: I think we can continue to grow the business in the Renewable segment. We said it when we purchased Blattner kind of the cadence of that, and you're coming off of a year where the outward, what I think pullback was primarily due to the solar panel discussions. And when that cleaned up, there was pent-up demand, but I also see a great future in a future market. You're going to see quite a bit of wind repowering coming up as well as wind projects. And I don't even think you're seeing that yet. And when you start to see the programmatic spends of the wind repower on that as well, the company is positioned nicely for those things, and we'll take advantage of that. That was what led us to the Blattner acquisition, and I think that strategy is playing out. And we see decades of renewable switching, you have load growth as well that will go towards a renewable state. So as you see load growth double and you start to say, okay, well, how much the carbon are we going to take out of the system, while you're getting the load growth, it's significant. EV penetration, all those things are starting to hit the electrification of everything. And then you have the security issue of North America where you're onshoring. All these things are happening at once, and I see really, really good markets for a long time. Can you have some blips in the radar, of course, but on a CAGR basis over time, we like what we see, and we'll continue to execute in the field, which is our main concern is to make sure that we execute, build projects on time, on budget that are at cost that's what we feel economic to the consumer.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our next question comes from the line of Gus Richard with Northland. Please proceed.\nAuguste Richard: Yes, thanks for taking the question. In terms of energy storage. Are you starting to see an increase in demand for that in the renewables segment, if so on what regions and as storage is incentivized at residential, does that have any impact on transmission and distribution?\nEarl Austin: I think energy storage can certainly benefit and we're seeing quite a bit, I would say, we've probably doubled in size in take it plus or minus 10, but we're seeing quite a bit of storage projects. We'll continue to see that to the west. And we see it all over, honestly. It's something from a utility skill standpoint that's necessary with the markets there. We're participating in it, albeit we -- it was a low piece of the business. So don't take that the wrong way. It definitely is growing. We were in front of it. We're doing nicely in the storage business. I do think it can help. It can help alleviate some transmission. But it's not -- batteries will continue to get better as you move forward. The storage capacity will get better. We're not there yet. It will be a small piece of the business for a foreseeable future, but growing. So like the business, like it, it fits nicely with our solar win. We're looking for ways to even get more efficient in batteries. So as we see that, the transmission as well, it can't alleviate a bit, but not to the point where you would see any kind of downturn in transmission at this point.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nSean Eastman: Hi, team. I wanted to come back to the comment about adding basically 3x the normal run rate of people in the quarter? I mean, obviously, that's pretty notable. I mean other than the obvious signal that that's positive for underlying demand trends. What else we should take away from that? Is this showing an ability for the training infrastructure to flex up? Maybe we've hit a new kind of throughput level there? Any additional thoughts on this addition to the human capital story this quarter?\nEarl Austin: I think, Sean, it's just a great example of what we've tried to say for a long period of time that we're able to scale the business. And a lot of people can talk about it and a lot of people can talk about scaling it. I want to see somebody at 3,000 and put the projects in there and execute at the levels we're executing. So I think we put the infrastructure in place to be able to do this, not one quarter, but over time, and it surprised me a bit from a seasonality standpoint, we added quite a bit in Renewable segment. And their ability to scale their business to these utility scale projects as many reasons why we acquired Blattner and we have the resources that we have internally. I just can't say enough about what we do from an execution level in the field every day to put the numbers up we put up. And they're just doing a really, really nice job. And we have great curriculum, great people. We'll continue to build upon what we have. It's exponential the way I see it in the curriculum and the things that we're doing from technology and training and things of that nature. We're certainly in the forefront. I look forward to us continuing down the path that we're on.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Marc Bianchi with TD Cowen. Please proceed.\nMarc Bianchi: Hi, thank you. I wanted to ask about the renewable power growth and kind of as it relates to the CAGR that you outlined at the Analyst Day last year of 10% to 12%. It would seem like you're well above that rate here, exceptional year in '23. But how should we be thinking about that 10% to 12% now? Is there upside to that? And how much of a bottleneck is interconnection? Thank you.\nEarl Austin: I think when you look at it, we talked about kind of a 10% de-risk at the bottom on a CAGR basis and then all levers of the balance sheet, the megatrends that we see, you'll have some 15% outer years as you make acquisitions as you do other things or use your balance sheet with free cash. So those things are there when you look outward, if you take those things into account, if we invest the same way we've invested our capital in the past, I like our chances on the upper ends on the outward looks. But when you look at just organically, the business the way it sits in the queues and things of that nature, yes, there's tightening of your queues. Your transformers are 24, 36 months out on your HVDC. So if you have a project today and you're talking about it and you haven't ordered your transformers to have a spot, you're 24, 36 months out. I don't think it affects our clients, the clients that we work for. You're bigger clients already have transformers or have slots. So there's no real issue for them. But others that are looking for projects, it's not just, hey, I need in the queue. It's -- hey, I need in the queue, but I have my transformer capacity. I have my lines, I have the things that are necessary there. So that planning and things of that nature is a piece of it. I do think you're getting some clarity of regulation. I think the federal government, FERC and the states and the utility business, everyone is trying to collaborate here, more so than I've seen in my career. But I'll say this. It's necessary for us to do this as a group. And we need to collaborate as a group here for the next decade and beyond.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Alex Rygiel with B. Riley Securities. Please proceed.\nAlexRygiel: Thank you. A very nice quarter. DSOs have improved into the 70s from past historical ranges of the high 70s to 90s. Can you talk about the catalyst to this and whether or not mix or contract terms have been a factor? And maybe expand a little bit more on contract terms today versus a handful of years ago, and if they've become a little bit more favorable to the contractor?\nEarl Austin: Yes. I'll say a little bit. We're acquiring more materials and things of that nature, Alex, so it's helping us a bit on some of those projects from a DSO standpoint, but I think that's the bigger piece of what you see from a term standpoint. We need to be able to order outward and you've seen some inventories. Our inventories move up a little bit here or there on some of those things. But that said, I think that's the better terms. And Jayshree, you can comment on the DSOs.\nJayshree Desai: Yes. I think we've talked in the past about our expectations will improve on our DSOs and our working capital, and we're starting to see that. In terms of contract terms, certain parts of our renewable projects definitely allow us to, because the materials or the way the work is performed, allow us to run in a positive working capital. And you're seeing some of that benefit coming in now. But in general, we're feeling good about where our DSOs are headed as well as our cash flow projections. And you see that's why we modestly increased our cash flows for the year. It's moving in what we expected and we'll continue to see that improvement as our business grows in the Renewables segment.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.\nEarl Austin: Thank you. We want to thank the 52,000-plus employees of Quanta for their commitment to safe execution. It does not go un-noticed that you're working in a 100-plus degree heat every day. Thank you. And I want to thank all the participating people in our conference call. We appreciate your questions and your ongoing interest in Quanta Services. Thank you. This concludes our call.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Jayshree Desai",
            "content": "Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced record second quarter revenues of $5 billion. Net income attributable to common stock was $166 million or $1.12 per diluted share and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.65. Our second quarter electric power revenues were $2.4 billion and operating income margins were 10.1% consistent with our expectations for sequential revenue growth and margin expansion against our first quarter results. Our base business activities continue to lead the way for the segment of utility investments in hardening and modernization initiatives create growing demand for our comprehensive solutions. While the segment executed at a double-digit margin profile, it was negatively impacted by a lower-than-expected utilization of electric resources in Canada. Renewable Energy Infrastructure segment revenues for second quarter '23 were $1.4 billion, with operating income margins of 8%. The revenue strength in the quarter reflects the growing momentum behind renewable energy infrastructure and our customers' ability to move forward with construction activities in this favorable regulatory environment. Margins improved sequentially as increased revenues contributed to better cost absorption and as we successfully executed through risks on ongoing projects. Underground Utility and Infrastructure segment revenues were $1.2 billion for the quarter, and operating income margins were 8.6%, a noteworthy second quarter performance. Both large projects and base business operations contributed to the elevated revenues with margins benefiting from improved fixed cost absorption. For additional commentary comparing 2Q '23 to 2Q '22, please refer to the slides accompanying this call. Regarding backlog, with the inclusion of two of the three contracts with the previously announced SunZia award and continued robust activity in our Renewable segment we achieved another record level at quarter end. At June 30, 2023, backlog was $27.2 billion, an increase of $1.9 billion compared to March 31. Our 12-month backlog is also at a record level of $15.6 billion, approximately $1 billion higher than March 31. For the second quarter of 2023, we had free cash flow of $46 million. measured 78 days for the second quarter, lower than our historical average and aided by favorable billing arrangements associated with certain awards during the quarter. Regarding the Canadian Renewable Transmission Project, we've discussed in prior quarters, based on operating conditions and our ability to achieve stakeholder targets while overcoming the COVID-19-related challenges encountered throughout the course of the project, we decided to accelerate the construction schedule into the spring and early summer. As a result, the contract asset balance grew during the quarter and continues to pressure DSO, and will do so until we finish the project. Given our successful execution in the field and the ongoing discussions with the customer regarding significant portions of the balance representing approximately six to seven days of DSO as of June 30, we remain confident in our position. As of June 30, 2023, we had total liquidity of approximately $1.8 billion and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5 as calculated under our credit agreement. We expect second half earnings growth and cash generation to support our ability to delever over the coming quarters while continuing to create stockholder value through opportunistic capital deployment. Turning to our guidance. We are pleased with our performance through the first half of the year and see significant strength in the back half of the year, particularly the fourth quarter. From a segment perspective, we continue to expect Electric Segment revenues between $10 billion and $10.1 billion for the year. However, we expect full-year margins will be impacted by the costs incurred this year in preparation for the anticipated growth in multiyear utility programs. That, along with pressure from our Canadian operations, is leading us to lower our full-year margin expectations for the segment to range between 10.5% and 11%. Regarding our Renewables segment, given the performance of the second quarter and increased visibility into project activity, we are raising our full-year revenue expectations for the segment by $700 million, now ranging between $5.2 billion and $5.4 billion. We continue to expect margins around 8.5% for the year as much of the work is just getting started, and we will need to execute through project risks before margins have the opportunity to improve. After a good second quarter, we now expect revenues from our Underground segment to range between $4.4 billion and $4.5 billion, a $250 million increase at the midpoint and we continue to expect full-year margins for the segment to range between 7% and 7.5%. As Duke said, given our performance to date and improved visibility, we are raising our full-year revenue expectations, which we now expect to range between $19.6 billion and $20 billion, a $950 million increase at the midpoint of our range. We've increased our expectation for full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock to now range between $6.90 and $7.30 and increased our expectation for full-year adjusted EBITDA to range between $1.88 billion and $1.97 billion for the year. With regard to free cash flow, we are modestly raising our full-year expectations, primarily due to the expected increase in renewable revenues, which typically have a favorable working capital profile compared to our other segments. Therefore, we now expect free cash flow for the year to range between $800 million and $1 billion, with the highest levels in the fourth quarter as is typically the case. We slightly modified other aspects of our guidance, the details of which are included in our outlook summary, which can be found in the Financial Information Section of our IR website at quantaservices.com. Looking ahead, we are excited by the momentum and highly visible and growing multiyear outlook behind our Electric and Renewable segments. Additionally, we are encouraged by the strength of our underground utility and infrastructure segment, which continues to grow and execute at a high level. With this core operating portfolio, we are confident in our ability to deliver comprehensive solutions to support the energy transition and to create significant shareholder value through organic growth and strategic capital investment. I'll now turn it back to the operator for Q&A. Operator? Good morning. Yes, Justin, we had a couple of outsized events from last year. We had a storm that helped our -- some of those entities in that part of the segment. And we also had some catch-up in LUMA, that's what you were seeing last year. This year, in general, the -- that part of the segment is performing very well. We continue to see the operations going as we would expect, a little bit of pullback, but nothing systemic, and we believe we can operate through a lot of that and continue to perform at these levels. No. Yes. I think we've talked in the past about our expectations will improve on our DSOs and our working capital, and we're starting to see that. In terms of contract terms, certain parts of our renewable projects definitely allow us to, because the materials or the way the work is performed, allow us to run in a positive working capital. And you're seeing some of that benefit coming in now. But in general, we're feeling good about where our DSOs are headed as well as our cash flow projections. And you see that's why we modestly increased our cash flows for the year. It's moving in what we expected and we'll continue to see that improvement as our business grows in the Renewables segment."

            "name": "Earl Austin",
            "content": "Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today, I will provide operational and strategic commentary, and we'll then turn it over to Jayshree Desai, Quanta's CFO, to provide a review of our second quarter results and full-year 2023 financial expectations. Following Jayshree's comments, we welcome your questions. Our second quarter results continue our solid start to the year with strong double-digit revenue growth that resulted in record quarterly revenues exceeding $5 billion for the first time in our history as well as a record total backlog of $27.2 billion. We added approximately 3,000 employees during the second quarter due to the building momentum and increasing demand for our infrastructure solutions. We are investing in safety and training programs for our employees expanding various service lines and advancing our supply chain and other solutions. We are positioning Quanta for decades of necessary infrastructure investment and continue to believe our operational portfolio is a strategic advantage that provides us the ability to manage risk and shift resources across service lines and geographies, which we believe will become increasingly important as the energy transition accelerates. We believe our portfolio approach positions us well to allocate resources to the opportunities we find the most economically attractive and to achieve operating efficiencies and consistent financial results. Our Electric Power Operations are performing well overall, though segment margin experienced some pressure from lower utilizations in Canada. Demand for our Electric Power Infrastructure Solutions is strong. driven by broad-based business activity from utility grid modernization, grid security and system hardening initiatives as well as our reputation for consistent and safe execution. Accordingly, we are investing in resources ahead of the anticipated start-up of multiple multiyear utility programs and projects. Additionally, our communications operations continue to execute well from both a revenue and margin perspective. Going forward, our utility customers' multiyear CapEx plans remain strong and we are having discussions with a number of them about capital plans and programs looking out in years. North America's power grid continues to be challenged by a number of demands, including the need to increase the pace of modernization and increase the grid's resiliency and reliability through system hardening, enabling new technologies, facilitating higher levels of electric vehicle penetration, meeting growing power load demand and capitalizing on favorable federal and state policies designed to accelerate the energy transition. We believe Quanta Solutions offering and ability to safely consistently execute is industry-leading. We are uniquely positioned to collaborate with our clients on their multiyear grid operations. Renewable Infrastructure Solutions segment revenues increased significantly in the quarter as construction of renewable generation projects within the multiyear programs ramped up and high-voltage electric transmission and substation work remained active. Segment total backlog reached a record $7 billion at quarter end, driven by the addition of SunZia transmission and HPDC converter station contracts and various renewable generation, transmission and substation projects. We believe the momentum in this segment will continue, and we are making the necessary investments to scale our resources and capacity to handle multiyear renewable programs that we expect will yield record levels of new renewable generation over the coming decade, driven by the RA and acceleration of North America's energy transition. Additionally, we are pursuing billions of dollars of high-voltage transmission projects that are designed to support current and future renewable generation capacity growth and overall system reliability. As we have discussed on prior earnings calls and reported more recently in the media, federal and state policies designed to accelerate the energy transition and the electrification of everything, are expected to significantly increase load demand and are already pressuring the power grid. At the same time, there are significant challenges to getting regional transmission infrastructure built in a timely manner, primarily due to obtaining necessary environmental permits and regulatory approvals. The need for collaboration at all levels to ensure great reliability while minimizing cost impacts to the ratepayer remains the industry's greatest challenge. We remain pleased with the performance of our Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment, which delivered double-digit revenue growth and record second quarter profitability, demonstrating solid execution across our operations in this segment. Our Industrial Services Operations executed well, and we had strong demand for our gas utility and pipeline integrity operations, driven by regulated spend to modernize systems, reduced methane emissions, ensured environmental compliance and improved safety and reliability. We believe we are in the early stages of capitalizing on significant opportunities across our service lines and geographies, which are driven by our collaborative solution-based approach that is designed to ultimately benefit consumers. Additionally, the growth of programmatic spending, with existing and new customers, increased renewable generation activity and favorable megatrends provide greater visibility into our near- and long-term growth outlook. As a result of these dynamics and our solid year-to-date financial performance, we have increased our full-year 2023 financial expectations for revenues, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The energy transition towards a reduced carbon economy continues to progress, and we believe is gaining pace. Quanta is successfully executing on our strategic initiatives to drive sustainable and resilient operational excellence, total cost solutions for our clients and consistent profitable growth. We are focused on operating the business for the long term and expect to continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class build leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's base business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's diversity, unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset form the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Jayshree Desai, our CFO, for her review of the second quarter results and 2023 expectations. Jayshree? Thank you. Good morning. We're seeing what we thought would happen with the solar supply chain slashing in general, I think we are operating through those issues, and we had six months really where the industry stopped. And as we move forward, we thought there would be cadence to the segment to solar in general. That cadence is playing out like we thought. We're certainly increasing guidance due to some of that. And I think as you go through '23 and you operate through '24, you'll get a more balanced quarter-over-quarter type margin profile, but the margin pickups and the opportunities that we see on the other side of the year -- second half of the year into '24, '25 and beyond are certainly what we thought are greater. No. We're still negotiating a third contract there on the wind side of the business. So that will be -- we believe we'll have that finished up here in the second half of the year, third quarter, fourth quarter, somewhere in there. Good morning, Mike. Yes, Mike, good question. When we look at regulation and you look at the -- what's going on at the consumer level, when you rebate EVs, the way we're rebating and then the grid itself at the distribution level certainly needs a rebuild, a significant modernization. So that needs to get started now, not when the consumer is getting his car and bringing it to the home, and they have no way to power their vehicle or it's inter-minute power. So I think as an industry, we've always been in front of what we anticipate. In those levels, we have to get in front of that. So at a federal level and state level, the collaboration with -- along with utility customer is necessary and where you have states that are worried on the bill and the capital at the consumer level, which we are as well, and you have federal pushing the other direction. We've just got to get a better mechanism to make sure that we can service what's coming at us. I think when you listen to the car manufacturers, when you listen to anything that we've been talking about, we thought that generation would double, we're here in triple now. There's no question it's moving forward. If it's double, if it's triple and you're also decreasing the decarbonization of coal and gas with renewables, the impacts for interconnections for transmission, the rebuilds that are necessary are monumental and the necessary capital to go into the grid, although when you look -- when you go forward and you try to net present value, total cost of energy, I think it's the right answer. It's just we have to get started with the capital plans and they're greater than you may anticipate or anyone may anticipate as you move forward. So it's just trying to put people in front of that and make sure the industry is collaborating. When we look at our clients even with inflation, even with everything that's going on, the capital is moving up. It's just the pace of where we need to be five years from now. It's not a matter of tomorrow. It's a matter of three years from now, five years from now in the industry itself is certainly I'm talking about the need for transmission and also the modernization of distribution systems. I think when you look at transmission, certainly, it's necessary if your fuel switching and then where the load is going from data centers, AI to just about everything, you're seeing load growth now in the industry across the board, you've got 110-degree heat. You had a low, what I would consider a mild winter, first quarter was pretty mild for the industry. But July into August, you're 100 plus in many areas. It just -- those impacts to the way capital is spent and where it's necessary to spend. You start moving up deviations of temperatures on this grid from a planning standpoint, it's exponential of load. Yes, Steve, I think when you look at the quarter, we added from around 3,000 employees. We normally add about a 1,000. So when you start thinking through that, it does pressure where the company is capable of training, doing all the things that we need to do, the investments are already made. It's just pressure, there's four or five things that we could call out that's pressuring inflation, and you can call out whether we can make all kinds of excuses about it. Really, we can operate much better in Canada than we have been operating. The transition is a little bit behind in Canada, where we can operate Canada at normalized margins. We've been through the pandemic there. We've made different levels of, I would say, balance from G&A to training, to indirect and all those kind of things in Canada. As we move out of '23 into '24, you'll get into more normalized Canadian execution, and I think you'll see much better results that we can absorb just about anything. The portfolio that we put together in the segments, which should allow us to train, to put people in place for the foreseeable future. And still even in outward growth years, produce the type of margins that we produced in the past. I see no reason why we can. And I do believe we can operate the renewable segment in double-digits. I'll stand by it. Yes, Steve. We're starting quite a few large transmission projects in the segment. We're also starting thousands of renewable-type utility scale solar win. So when we look at that and where we're at, the cadence itself, we thought it would be back end loaded. So the start to the jobs as we operate through those contingencies, I think you'll see a more normalized margin profile into '24. We have to operate in double-digits in the second half or you won't get to the numbers that you -- what you see. I do think there's opportunities all the way through for us, we took a prudent approach to it. We tried to hit it down the middle. That's what we've done here. And I do think there's opportunities into '24 to get on a more normalized cadence. When we look at the UI segment, we've said that we thought we could get scale through some regional offices through the portfolio. I think you're starting to see that show up in the segment. We did -- we've operated great. We've had good industrial performance in the first half of the year. When you get into the back half, we do see some -- we have some pipe awards that we were awarded. We have some good things going on. We don't need those things to make the numbers. So we do see opportunity but you also have the weather impacts. We're doing more electrical underground. And so that will shift some of our UI segment over in the Electric segment. Just the way the segment reporting works, but as far as the crews and what we're doing from the scalability, it should rise our returns on the company. It will rise returns on the company overall. And the segment is also doing nicely in our service lines. I always thought we would operate in upper single-digits, and I see expectation. We are prudent about how we got in the second half due to the weather and northern climbs and things of that nature. But I do think that overall segment can operate in that upper single-digit range. We are pushing -- you are getting absorptions throughout due to the fact that you're doing electric and gas and telecom and renewables out of the same offices, you're going to see some scale out of that. And those margins are going to rise a bit, and that's what you're seeing show up. LUMA is performing as expected, there are some investments that we have in other businesses there that are off on the first half. We expect those to pick up in the '23 and into '24. But Jayshree, you can comment. No. I mean we said our Industrial business performed really well in the quarter as well. So that certainly was strength in the quarter. And I do think when you start to look out, you do not have great visibility in the fourth quarter in the Industrial business. So that said, the prudent guidance would be to pull it down a bit in the fourth quarter. And that's kind of what you're seeing show up. Yes. M&A, we have a strategy. We have a five-year strategy to provide solutions to our customers. We see opportunities across the board really to add-on, bolt-on, provide solutions, do some things that we talked about our front-end services. There's no shortage of opportunities out there. We're picky about how we go about it, and we'll follow the strategy. We're watching our cash generation. We're making sure we can absorb what we have, and we'll be prudent about how we go forward. And anything that we're doing is following the five-year plan, the strategy we laid out to our investors and we're ahead of those plans significantly. And I feel like the company is in a great position to provide those solutions that are necessary to keep the company moving forward at the pace that we've seen in the past. And we have good visibility into the next decade. And we're known for execution. We have to keep executing in the field, while looking at the strategy to add on and deploy capital in the proper manner for our stakeholders. I think when you look at our guidance at the EPS level, which is what we're measured upon, we're ahead of the 10% guide now on a growth basis this year, relatively 13% or better. So when I think about it, we're already doing that as we sit here today. And I do think we set all levers of the balance sheet, the opportunities that we see going forward. We'll continue to, we hear a lot of big numbers and those kind of things. We're executing at the local level. We're executing across the strategy and doing the things we need to do to drive EPS. And it's not just the top line, it's the quality of earnings. We're constantly talking about quality of earnings. If you look at our returns on return on invested capital and all of our returns, they are moving in the right direction as we go forward. Yes. We see opportunities there across the board on hydrogen and also carbon sequestration. We do see that market as being a nice market. The blinds are usually smaller that they run longer, but they're smaller on that type of builds. But we're in constant discussions with the operators as well as the end users of hydrogen and also carbon the way we're looking at it. So I do think you'll see some of those lines move forward in '24, be some opportunities for us. The bill, the RA certainly provides economic benefit on both sides of that. And I do think that will help the market as well. So we are seeing opportunities in that area and staying in front of it. We've had some nice pipe awards. So we're happy with the business. We certainly said we would be able to handle those type of things and we can, and we are. So I think it's opportunities for us. It's not the main stay of the business, but we certainly like it. I mean you see it in the West, the fire hardening that's going on and the fires out West from an insurability and what the punitive nature of a fire is to utility at this point, you have no choice but to start undergrounding. And I think you've seen that in the West. We're in early stages of that. It will continue on. It's decades of type reconstruction, but many of the lines that are out there in fire prone areas will go underground. They're not -- the insurance rates, things of that nature make it economical to underground, which you would have never said that a decade ago. And today, it's the only way. So I do believe you'll see the prevalent underground transmission in the corridors that we are. You have large wire constraints when you start looking at the larger transmission, the wire in Europe and things of that nature, that supply chain is tight. I do believe when you move forward some of those bigger projects that are undergrounding transmission will come about. We're certainly around the edges on those. But I mean, the mainstay work is overhead, long haul will still be in the air. Where in the fire prone areas, you'll see some underground. Yes. I don't look at it. We don't look at it like that from our standpoint. It's really utilizations. The utilizations are great on all segments. You'll see bigger work. If you want to talk about a project, it will be more in your Renewables at this point. Your bigger programs, your multi-year programs will be more in Electric. It's just the deployment of capital, same crews, same people, cross and segments. So we're cognizant of that. The utilizations on both sides will be at high levels. What I will say is the company itself, no matter what segment you're in, the project starts are significant, and the cadence will start to stack versus just being a starting -- on the starting line. And right now, we're kind of in the early stages of a lot of large projects and programs. So those early stages will as you move in out of '23 into '24, into '25, you'll start to stack on top of that, and you'll get a normalized cadence where you'll see it as we operate through them contingencies move out, things of that nature as long as we execute like we have the last 25 years. We'll be in good shape, and we'll see those contingencies flow into future earnings. We recruit just internally across the Board, Northwest certainly is our some -- there's a lot of curriculum work, a lot of work that's necessary to be able to scale. It's one thing to add -- it's another thing to add 3,000 every quarter or 1,000 every quarter. And also while we're not totally pleased with the Electric margins, it's down 25 basis points or whatever it is on the guide. There's opportunities to operate at the same level we thought. That said, it's not as easy as we make it sound. They are certainly contributing to our ability to put the people in the field and execute very quickly and as we get absorption and things of that nature, that's only -- will only scale. And I do think we've invested in those colleges. We've invested in those curriculums, and we're not having issues with cross-skilled labor or front-end engineering. Could we use more? Yes. But we're able to meet the demands and the foreseeable demands on any type of curve we're looking at. We hope that supply chain catches up with us. Jamie, you're breaking up. I can't hear you. You got to do it again. Got you. Thanks, Jamie. I figured I'd get '24 guidance. So I think when we look at it, of course. '24, you have some seasonality in the numbers and the run rate. I do think we talked about double-digit type growth at the EPS line. I don't see no reason why we won't continue those kind of numbers. Can it get outward, yes. We're not ready to guide to that. We see a great market. We're starting on great markets. I agree with you. We're stacking it certainly bodes well for us going into next year. When we look at the projects, the larger projects have been through that before with CREZ and other things in the company. We're highly focused on the customer and the customer level, the baseload work, we're still at a baseload work of 80-plus percent. That hasn't changed. I don't think it will. We will get large projects as we move forward. We are in negotiations constantly around programs and projects. You have to think about some of them being multi-year, five years in nature. Some of them are short nature. So it's just different type of projects. The company itself is focused on execution on those projects. I see both sides of it, I think we're seeing more material content within our EPC business. So just different things that the company is capitalizing on. So when you look at a return basis, our returns go better if we're able to sort of the material content as well. So lots of things going our way on that. And I think it's a competitive advantage for us moving forward as we start to be a large purchaser of material. So I like it. I like what we're doing. I think it will only enhance -- the larger products will only enhance the business and the base business as well as how we provide that solution to the client. Good question. We see a good market in Canada. We have some awards already that we anticipate starting on by the end of the year. We have some great clients partnering in Puerto Rico. So -- and a lot of customers in Canada, we are able to move resources, engineering capacity. Some of the things that we do in Canada over in the Lower 48. I wish it was easier. I wish the border was easier. It would certainly help us from a skillset standpoint. But that said, the company has done a nice job moving resources and doing some things in Canada. In general, when I look and step back at it, COVID played a big impact much more than we had here in the Lower 48, and we forget about it a lot. And we think, oh, well, it was nothing. It was significant. And we were in camps, we were doing some things there that were different. If we don't see the market will downsize the market, but we do see that -- what we see right now is the transition happening there as well. We're seeing more -- we're seeing wind, solar, some hydro different things in Canada to decarbonize as well. We're right in the middle of those things. It's just a little bit behind the Lower 48. And as we catch up, I think you'll see more normalized margins in Canada and a great market. I think we can continue to grow the business in the Renewable segment. We said it when we purchased Blattner kind of the cadence of that, and you're coming off of a year where the outward, what I think pullback was primarily due to the solar panel discussions. And when that cleaned up, there was pent-up demand, but I also see a great future in a future market. You're going to see quite a bit of wind repowering coming up as well as wind projects. And I don't even think you're seeing that yet. And when you start to see the programmatic spends of the wind repower on that as well, the company is positioned nicely for those things, and we'll take advantage of that. That was what led us to the Blattner acquisition, and I think that strategy is playing out. And we see decades of renewable switching, you have load growth as well that will go towards a renewable state. So as you see load growth double and you start to say, okay, well, how much the carbon are we going to take out of the system, while you're getting the load growth, it's significant. EV penetration, all those things are starting to hit the electrification of everything. And then you have the security issue of North America where you're onshoring. All these things are happening at once, and I see really, really good markets for a long time. Can you have some blips in the radar, of course, but on a CAGR basis over time, we like what we see, and we'll continue to execute in the field, which is our main concern is to make sure that we execute, build projects on time, on budget that are at cost that's what we feel economic to the consumer. I think energy storage can certainly benefit and we're seeing quite a bit, I would say, we've probably doubled in size in take it plus or minus 10, but we're seeing quite a bit of storage projects. We'll continue to see that to the west. And we see it all over, honestly. It's something from a utility skill standpoint that's necessary with the markets there. We're participating in it, albeit we -- it was a low piece of the business. So don't take that the wrong way. It definitely is growing. We were in front of it. We're doing nicely in the storage business. I do think it can help. It can help alleviate some transmission. But it's not -- batteries will continue to get better as you move forward. The storage capacity will get better. We're not there yet. It will be a small piece of the business for a foreseeable future, but growing. So like the business, like it, it fits nicely with our solar win. We're looking for ways to even get more efficient in batteries. So as we see that, the transmission as well, it can't alleviate a bit, but not to the point where you would see any kind of downturn in transmission at this point. I think, Sean, it's just a great example of what we've tried to say for a long period of time that we're able to scale the business. And a lot of people can talk about it and a lot of people can talk about scaling it. I want to see somebody at 3,000 and put the projects in there and execute at the levels we're executing. So I think we put the infrastructure in place to be able to do this, not one quarter, but over time, and it surprised me a bit from a seasonality standpoint, we added quite a bit in Renewable segment. And their ability to scale their business to these utility scale projects as many reasons why we acquired Blattner and we have the resources that we have internally. I just can't say enough about what we do from an execution level in the field every day to put the numbers up we put up. And they're just doing a really, really nice job. And we have great curriculum, great people. We'll continue to build upon what we have. It's exponential the way I see it in the curriculum and the things that we're doing from technology and training and things of that nature. We're certainly in the forefront. I look forward to us continuing down the path that we're on. I think when you look at it, we talked about kind of a 10% de-risk at the bottom on a CAGR basis and then all levers of the balance sheet, the megatrends that we see, you'll have some 15% outer years as you make acquisitions as you do other things or use your balance sheet with free cash. So those things are there when you look outward, if you take those things into account, if we invest the same way we've invested our capital in the past, I like our chances on the upper ends on the outward looks. But when you look at just organically, the business the way it sits in the queues and things of that nature, yes, there's tightening of your queues. Your transformers are 24, 36 months out on your HVDC. So if you have a project today and you're talking about it and you haven't ordered your transformers to have a spot, you're 24, 36 months out. I don't think it affects our clients, the clients that we work for. You're bigger clients already have transformers or have slots. So there's no real issue for them. But others that are looking for projects, it's not just, hey, I need in the queue. It's -- hey, I need in the queue, but I have my transformer capacity. I have my lines, I have the things that are necessary there. So that planning and things of that nature is a piece of it. I do think you're getting some clarity of regulation. I think the federal government, FERC and the states and the utility business, everyone is trying to collaborate here, more so than I've seen in my career. But I'll say this. It's necessary for us to do this as a group. And we need to collaborate as a group here for the next decade and beyond. Yes. I'll say a little bit. We're acquiring more materials and things of that nature, Alex, so it's helping us a bit on some of those projects from a DSO standpoint, but I think that's the bigger piece of what you see from a term standpoint. We need to be able to order outward and you've seen some inventories. Our inventories move up a little bit here or there on some of those things. But that said, I think that's the better terms. And Jayshree, you can comment on the DSOs. Thank you. We want to thank the 52,000-plus employees of Quanta for their commitment to safe execution. It does not go un-noticed that you're working in a 100-plus degree heat every day. Thank you. And I want to thank all the participating people in our conference call. We appreciate your questions and your ongoing interest in Quanta Services. Thank you. This concludes our call."

With that, I would like to now turn the call over to Mr. Duke Austin, Quanta's President and CEO. Duke?\nDuke Austin: Thanks Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Quanta Services first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. On the call today, I will provide operational and strategic commentary, and we'll turn it over to Jayshree Desai, Quanta's CFO, to provide a review of our first quarter results, full year 2023 financial expectations. Following Jayshree's comments, we welcome your questions. Before we begin reviewing our financial results, I would like to briefly highlight the recognition that Quanta recently received from Engineering News Record, a leading engineering and construction industry publication. In our selected Quanta for its prestigious and highest honor, the award of excellence. Quanta was selected for its safety leadership with our innovative capacity model, a unique safety and training program that is designed to not only create a work environment that prevents incidents, but also build in the capacity to sell safely and it focuses on learning from mistakes in order to drive improved outcomes. Quanta is changing how we, our customers and the industry think about safety excellence, and I want to congratulate Quanta employees for their dedication to safety and their shared success in being recognized with this award. Our first quarter results, which include double-digit revenue growth and adjusted diluted EPS of $1.24 demonstrate a good start to the year. More importantly, we continue to enhance our self-perform model and remain on track to achieve our full year 2023 and multiyear expectations. Additionally, total backlog at the quarter end was $25.3 billion, a record and considerably higher than the same period last year. Notably, we see opportunity to significantly increase backlog as we move through the year, driven by our base business and larger energy transition projects, such as the SunZia Transmission and SunZia Wind projects we announced this morning. We believe we are in the early stages of capitalizing on significant opportunities across our service lines, which are driven by our collaborative solution-based approach that is designed to ultimately benefit consumers. Additionally, the growth of the programmatic spending with existing and new customers and favorable megatrends provide greater flex visibility into our near and long-term growth outlook. Our Electric Power Infrastructure Solutions segment continued to perform well and generated record quarterly revenues. Demand for our services is strong, driven by broad-based business activity from utility grid modernization, grid security and system hardening initiatives, as well as our reputation for consistent and safe execution. We continue to work with our customers to provide them with resources to meet their capital deployment initiatives and to help them address supply chain constraints. As we have discussed over the past several quarters, our view is that the electric power grid will require significant upgrade and modernization to handle the energy transition. We also believe that electric vehicle penetration could increase at a faster rate than expected, which could create significant grid constraints that we believe are underappreciated by many. We expect the issue in the near term, the medium term in most regions will not be generation load supply availability, but the inability to move supply to areas with accelerating EV-driven low demand through the current distribution system. According to estimates from UBS, United States EV car penetration is expected to be more than quadruple from approximately 4% in 2025 to approximately 19% by 2030. We believe this developing grid capacity challenge will be acutely impacted as commercial fleets, medium and heavy-duty trucks and buses become increasingly electrified. For example, yesterday, Navistar a long-standing key partner to Quanta for medium and heavy-duty trucks announced a partnership with us to provide its customers a turnkey, battery electric vehicle products and charging infrastructure solution that enables fleets to deploy battery EVs quickly and efficiently. The partnership intends to leverage Navistar's approach to delivering fully integrated e-mobility solutions to its customers with Quanta's expertise in assessing and designing EV charging infrastructure and building the interconnecting EV battery charging infrastructure into the power grid. Quanta understands infrastructure and its partnership agreement with Navistar, as an example, of unique vantage point we have into the growing challenges with the power grid as the energy transition and electrification of everything accelerates. As we have discussed on prior calls, to meaningfully reduce carbon emissions and increased electrification of the economy will require substantial incremental investment in transmission, substation and renewable generation facilities to produce and transport Clean Power and to ensure grid reliability due to the growth of intermittent power added to the system. One of the strategic reasons we acquired Blattner was because we believe the addition of utility-scale renewable generation solutions to Quanta's holistic grid solutions will transform our ability to collaborate early with our customers on their energy transition strategies over the coming decades and create a value proposition unique in the industry. To that end, this morning, we announced that Quanta was selected by Pattern Energy to provide comprehensive infrastructure solutions for the SunZia Transmission and SunZia Wind projects, which together compromise the largest clean energy infrastructure project in the United States history. Quanta will leverage the capabilities of multiple operating companies to execute these projects for Pattern Energy. We believe these project awards validate the power of our combined high-voltage transmission and renewable generation solutions and demonstrate the value of our collaborative approach to providing energy transition infrastructure solutions, which can serve as a model for the renewable and utility industries going forward. As expected, normal seasonality in the solar panel supply chain and regulatory hurdles from last year resulted in a slow start for our renewable generation project activities in the first quarter. However, these dynamics are improving and renewable generation project activity is accelerating, which we expect to continue throughout the year. For example, at the end of April, we were in various levels of construction on 28 utility-scale renewable generation projects. Further, we are in active discussions with clients about projects in 2024 and beyond and are focused on scaling our resources and capacity handle what we expect to be record levels of new renewable generation capacity additions over the coming decade, at least. Additionally, we are pursuing billions of dollars of high-voltage transmission projects that are designed to support current and future renewable generation capacity growth and overall system reliability. We are pleased with the performance of our Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment in the first quarter, which delivered double-digit revenue growth and record levels of first quarter profitability, demonstrating solid execution across our operations in this segment. Our industrial services operations executed well and experienced strong demand following 2 years of deferred activity during the pandemic. We also experienced solid demand for our gas utility and pipeline integrity operations, which are executing well and are driven by regulated spend to modernize systems, reduce methane emissions, ensure environmental compliance and improve safety and reliability. We continue to believe our operational portfolio is a strategic advantage that provides us the ability to ship resources across service lines and geographies, which we believe will become increasingly important as the energy transition accelerates. We believe our portfolio approach positions us well to allocate resources to the opportunities. We find the most economical and attractive to achieve operating efficiencies that enhance our operational and financial consistency. The energy transition towards a reduced economy continues to progress and we believe is gaining pace. Quanta is successfully executing on our strategic initiatives to drive sustainable and resilient operational excellence, total cost solutions for our clients, consistent profitable and value - consistent profitable growth and value for our stakeholders, all of which gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on our 2023 and multiyear financial expectations. We are focused on operating the business for the long term and expect to continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class field leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's base business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe on the diversity, unique operating model and entrepreneur mindset form the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for all our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Jayshree Desai, our CFO, for her review of our first quarter results and 2023 expectations. Jayshree?\nJayshree Desai: Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced record first quarter revenues of $4.4 billion. Net income attributable to common stock was $95 million or $0.64 per diluted share and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.24. Our first quarter electric power revenues were $2.3 billion, and operating income margins were 9.2% and consistent with the directional views provided on last quarter's call and reflecting successful execution across the segment. Our base business continues to lead the way for the segment as utility investments in hardening and modernization initiatives create growing demand for our comprehensive solutions. Renewable Energy Infrastructure segment revenues for first quarter '23 were $1 billion with operating income margins of 3.5%. Revenues in the quarter were better than expected due to the acceleration of construction activities as our renewable customers move forward with projects. As we mentioned on our last call, we anticipated first quarter renewable revenues to be the segment's lowest of the year and the lower volumes would create fixed cost absorption pressure on segment margins. In light of that expected pressure from a margin perspective, we are pleased with the results from the bulk of our project activities. The overall segment margin was affected, however, by the large renewable transmission project in Canada, which we've discussed on prior calls. With over 90% of the project complete as of March 31, construction activities were quite successful during the quarter, and we believe we are positioned to achieve substantial completion after the next winter build season. Yet despite the significant progress, access delays, logistics and other issues outside of our control, increased our cost on the project negatively impacting quarter margins by approximately 120 basis points. We are working collaboratively with the customer to recover the financial impacts associated with these and other issues and are confident in an equitable outcome. Underground Utility and Infrastructure segment revenues were $1.1 billion for the quarter and operating income margins were 5.7%. Continued strength from our base business operations drove the performance with margins exceeding expectations, benefiting from improved fixed cost absorption on higher than anticipated revenue levels. For additional commentary comparing first quarter '23 to first quarter '22, please refer to the slides accompanying this call. With regard to backlog, we continue to achieve record levels. At March 31, 2023, backlog was $25.3 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion compared to December 31 and did not include amounts related to SunZia, which we announced this morning and was awarded subsequent to the quarter end. Our 12-month backlog is also at a record level of $14.6 billion which we believe is another indicator of the steady growing demand for our base business solutions. Our end markets remain robust with opportunities that can lead to new record levels of backlog in subsequent quarters. For the first quarter of 2023, as expected, we had negative free cash flow of $31 million, driven by working capital demands from the aforementioned Canadian renewables project as well as a ramp-up of work activities following the holidays, which is typical for the first quarter. DSO measured 77 days for the first quarter of 2023, lower than our historical average, aided by favorable billing arrangements associated with certain awards during the quarter. Regarding the Canadian renewable transmission project, the contract asset balance grew during first quarter '23 and continues to pressure DSO. Positive discussions with the customer regarding portions of the balance are ongoing, which represents approximately 5 to 6 days of DSO as of March 31, and we are increasingly confident in our position. As of March 31, 2023, we had total liquidity of approximately $1.8 billion and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5x as calculated under our credit agreement. The decrease in liquidity and increased leverage profile is due to roughly $450 million of capital deployed on acquisitions in the first quarter. We expect continued earnings growth and cash generation to support our ability to efficiently delever over the coming quarters while continuing to create stockholder value through incremental capital deployment. Turning to our guidance. We had a nice start to the year with record first quarter revenues and strong performance in the field. Given that strength, we are raising our revenue expectations for the year by $200 million, while our expectations for full year adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock are unchanged, ranging between $6.75 and $7.25. From a segment perspective, we continue to see Electric segment revenues between $10 billion and $10.1 billion for the year, with full year margins between 10.7% and 11.3%. We expect segment margins to be somewhat pressured in the second quarter due to challenging weather conditions throughout the northern and western parts of North America. Regarding our Renewable segment, given the strength of the first quarter and increased project awards, we are raising our full year revenue expectations for the segment by $200 million, ranking between $4.5 billion and $4.7 billion. We continue to expect margins around 8.5% for the year, with second quarter margins in the upper single digits. The increase in renewables is being offset by a reduction in our Underground segment due to a shift in the expected portfolio mix. Our segment revenue expectations are unchanged, but we now expect full year margins to range between 7% and 7.5%. We slightly modified other aspects of our guidance, the details of which are included in our outlook summary, which can be found in the Financial Information section of our IR website at quantaservices.com. Looking ahead, our end markets continue to strengthen, led by utilities, modernizing their infrastructure to support increased load driven by electrification trends and most importantly, to support North America's transition to a reduced carbon future. We believe we are uniquely positioned to deliver comprehensive solutions to the markets we serve and to create significant shareholder value through organic growth and strategic capital investment. I'll now turn it back to the operator for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Good morning, everyone.\nDuke Austin: Morning.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Duke, your backlog has been accelerating over the last few quarters. It seems like you are announcing more large projects are you just generally seeing an acceleration in these types of projects? And would you expect their frequency to continue? And then I know you talked about backlog continue to increase, does the higher backlog in your view raised the probability that Quanta could deliver at higher end? I think you had told us at the Analyst Day like 15% plus term EPS growth that you discussed.\nDuke Austin: Yes. Thanks, Andy. I think when we look at the market and especially the larger projects within the market, there's a significant amount that you got to get through permitting, you've got to get through a lot of different things. More importantly, if you're going to transition the need for transmission in North America, for that matter, is significant, way more than what people will estimate. I think you hear it quite a bit where were moving towards the transition we are. So that said, we do see large projects across the board, but you have multiyear projects as well with existing customers that are also addressing this need to provide load to the load centers from the areas where you have renewables. So those things, along with what you're doing with EV penetration and things like that are certainly increasing. Our dialogue with customers is robust. The amount of capital necessary to go where we want to go, continues to grow. I don't see a path to get to anywhere near where we want to go in 2030, 2040, 2050 without significant infrastructure build across this grid. It's not meant to handle the modernization, the penetration of electric vehicles and what we're trying to do from a carbon environment without modernizing this infrastructure in a significant way.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Are we at least trending towards your higher-end target that you talked about last year?\nDuke Austin: Our backlog growing. We don't even have SunZia and it will go up significantly. I think it will go up significantly every single quarter throughout the year. It may not be a perfect CAGR, but it will grow through this year, and I don't see that stopping. I mean we've given you good guidance on a multiyear 10% type growth at the EPS line with the ability to grow 15%. I stand by it today, even more so.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Adam Thalhimer with Thomson, Davis. Please proceed with your question.\nAdam Thalhimer: Hey. Good morning, guys. Congrats on a strong start to the year. Duke at a high level, where do things stand with renewable - with the renewable supply chain?\nDuke Austin: I think it's getting better. I mean you still you still hear Congress even today or yesterday, I can't remember. You start to see things around your reliance on China for panels. And I do think that will continue to play through this. But all in all, for what we see for what we have, we certainly have risk-adjusted kind of how we're guiding this year. So I do think we've watched it. We know what panels are in. We know what panels aren't in. I do believe that has alleviated a bit and we'll continue - so the supply chain has gotten better in many ways. Certainly, if there's any kind of regulation or things like that, it could change. But I do see more for that matter, everything being more onshore than offshore. And I do think that's a good trend for us in the way that we think about providing those solutions. Jayshree can comment.\nJayshree Desai: No, I have nothing more to add. That's right. I think it is opening up. We're seeing the supply chain, the panel manufacturers make -- do a better job of ensuring that they're meeting their requirements under the -- under the tariff provisions. But yes, if there is any sort of regulation, any sort of anti-China sentiment that continues to push through, that can obviously affect the supply chain again.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Alex Rygiel with B. Riley. Please proceed with your question.\nAlex Rygiel: Thank you, gentlemen. Real quick question here. Where do you stand on the percentage of revenue generated from self-perform versus external subs? And how could it change over the coming years?\nDuke Austin: Yes. Thanks, Alex. I think in general, we're about 85% still. I think that remains the work mix for us. If it's more material concentric, we'll make some comment on it. Today, it's the same for about 85% of the business is still self-performed. We like that. We like that mix. I think it will continue. We certainly to have certainty in our projects and to the client on delivery times and on for our ability to provide earnings power, we need to be able to self-perform about that mix. And the constraints that we have, no one understands those and we have to make sure that we can operate through any kind of issue. So that's about the mix you'll see.\nAlex Rygiel: And then secondly, can you talk a little bit about the competitive environment, particularly as it relates to SunZia? Congratulations on that. But how many bidders were on that? And how does that compare to a few years ago?\nDuke Austin: Yes. Honestly, I don't have any idea. I know we had a great collaboration with the client. It was a collaborative effort. And I believe it shows what the Blattner acquisition did for us. When you put both of us together what we can do together, what we can do for the client, the synergies that we can create for a client in a project like this. I would say it's proof of concept, it's proof of what can be done with the client to ultimate consumer and I don't think there is anyone that can do what we can do with these type of projects based upon history based upon what we're able to really think through for early in construction we can certainly create impacts and solutions to both sides of this transition, unlike any other.\nAlex Rygiel: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Justin Hauke with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nJustin Hauke: Great, thanks. So I guess I had a couple of questions on SunZia, just because it's been out there, obviously, forever, it's had all kinds of moving pieces on the financing side and the regulatory side. I'm just curious, is there anything that it still has outstanding that it needs to receive to start construction in 4Q? Or is that pretty much all cleared up? And then I guess related to that, is there any contribution that you're assuming in your guidance for this year from it?\nDuke Austin: Yes. We have some revenue in our guidance this year from it. It was in our uncommitted prior to the award. But that said, it's minimal. And I don't -- we don't see a pullback or a path where it doesn't go. So there's a lot of commitments being made here. We feel like the project is a go project, it's a great project, patterns of long time customer, Blattner and IRA for that matter. So we're confident, and we've worked hard with the client to make sure that this project is a showcase for them and us and the industry, what can be done through hard work. And yes, it's a long, long project. It took a long time. It shouldn't take this long in America to build infrastructure. So certainly, it's -- we're glad to get it across the finish line for everyone.\nJustin Hauke: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then I guess my second question is just on the Canadian renewable job. You said it's 90% complete, and you're expecting it to complete with the next winter build. So does that mean that for the next couple of quarters, there's really no contribution on that, and so we shouldn't think of that as kind of a source of potential pressure and it won't start up again until we get back to next winter when it completes? Is that the right way to think about it?\nDuke Austin: Yes, a little bit on the project. That's the way to think about it, but a little bit on that project, just so we can discuss it a bit -- it's a project that we did through the pandemic. And it's a project no one's done in northern climes like this, where we've taken people off fuel and putting them on renewable power I think it's significant in the way you think about the northern climes and what can be done. Our people work through a pandemic and built this. And so that said, no one's ever done that. No one's ever -- so the way that we're thinking through it, we've taken a prudent approach taking a prudent approach the way we've looked at it. All I can say is we can build things in northern climes better than anyone in the world. I'm confident in our position. I think it's much better than what we have, but we took a prudent approach to it. We'll continue to do so. I don't think you'll see any more fluctuations unless it goes the other way. I feel confident in where we're at, and it was our decision really to make sure we derisk the rest of the year and the rest of the job with the approach that we've taken. So we're extremely happy with our people, this build was significant for us in a code-free environment of what's possible. Our productivity rates and everything else were off the chart. So real pleased with how we finished up, and I do believe it will pay dividends in the long term.\nJustin Hauke: Okay, great. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Fisher: Thanks. Good morning. Congrats on SunZia. I just wanted to follow up on that last point there. I mean, this seems to be a reminder that things can happen on these renewable projects. And so how can we get comfortable that these risks can be reasonably controlled what comfort can you give investors that SunZia is not going to be an execution overhang on Blattner has done other work in New Mexico before. You're taking great efforts to derisk the business, but it's obviously -- it's a big, huge project. We do have a margin impact this quarter from renewables projects. So what comfort can you give investors that there's not going to be an execution overhang now? Thank you.\nDuke Austin: Thanks, Steve. SunZia is right down the middle for us, both from -- we just got off a wind project, with pattern did really nicely. We built line across that part of the world, many, many times, not concerned. What I can't control is a pandemic, so if our project has a 24-month pandemic in it, I don't know how to address that yet. I'll let you know when we get done with all the settlements on the claim. But the one in Canada, we work through a 24-month pandemic in a camp in the most northern territory in North America. So - and by the way, like every other project up there is off the rails. So look at coastal gas, look at Trans Mountain what they did compared to what we've done. I like our chances. So I know - we know we're doing on large projects, and this one is right on the middle. I expect many more of them to come.\nSteven Fisher: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Chad Dillard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nChad Dillard: Hi. Good morning, guys. First of all, can you talk about what is the mix of small versus large projects today, particularly in electric transmission? And then like with the recent spate of large wins that you've had over the couple of quarters, like where do you think that mix goes over the next couple of years? And what I'm multiple trying to understand is like how should we think about the margin impact of a potential mix shift?\nDuke Austin: I think when you look at it, it's about the same between 80%, 85% base business, the why we've laid it out. Large projects will grow significantly. Our base business will grow significantly. We're signing much larger MSA type programmatic expense than the projects that you're seeing. It's just there over multiyears. This -- SunZia is over -- I think we get done in '26, end of '26, the line goes a little faster, '25. But that said, we have multiyear type MSAs type agreements with our current customers that are longer in nature that are much bigger. So we continue to see both the base as well as these larger projects, as we've talked about the stacking effect due to the transition and all the things that we're able to accomplish there on the company is in front of it. And I do believe the outlook looks good. And certainly, our strategies are 5 years out. And I like where we're at. And I think we're right on track, maybe a little better.\nChad Dillard: That's helpful. And then, can you give a little more color on the Navistar partnership? Is this something where it's exclusive for Quanta? And then just like at what stage of the sales cycle is Quanta brought in? And is this like the type of like pro work that you've been talking about?\nDuke Austin: Yes. When we look at the Navistar contract, I think it's just how we relate with our -- not only us, but our suppliers we collaborate. And that collaboration leads to other things that we can do together such as try to create the safest truck in the industry, which I think is where the start was trying to create the safest truck what can we do with automated driving, what can we do with other things. And then it led to -- well, what can we do together to build the infrastructure necessary to go to electric vehicles. That said, if you think about Navistar's -- their amount of market share in school buses, in every school district across North America, it's significant. Many of the school districts load once you put buses and you go to an EV type bus, it will pull more load at the bus depot than the town. So when you start thinking through that and you're struggling in all the school districts that are out there, I think it's a significant build. It's meaningful for the company. And if we work together, we work with our utility clients and municipalities on the front end of this, we can certainly do it cost effective and create an environment that allows everyone to move towards carbon free.\nChad Dillard: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nJamie Cook: Hi, good morning. Congrats on SunZia. I guess first question, is there any way you could size the number of projects or in dollars, what you're bidding on, where you're bidding both the transmission and the renewable side sort of like SunZia, so we can see how many more opportunities that are out there? And to what degree are you worried - or I know you've been investing in labor for some period of time, and you always have, but that you need to ramp your investment in labor even more? And could that be a risk to margins in the short term? And then my second modeling question is just on within renewables, understanding the first quarter margins were below your expectations, and you explained that fine, but I think you maintained your renewable margin guidance for the year despite the first quarter being lower. So I'm wondering if that implies potentially the rest of the business is performing at a level slightly better than you expected? Thanks.\nDuke Austin: Good morning, Jamie. So I do think when you think about that we're on call it, 25 renewable projects today. All those have interconnections. The discussions with the customer are usually when we didn't have Blattner, you weren't combining that. You were really -- we were doing a lot of the interconnections for the utilities or for the developers. Some are going towards a combined approach I think the more we show the economics around it, the more we think through it, the bigger the projects, certainly, the more economical it is for us to think through both wind solar and interconnection with the client, and we do that quite a bit. As far as -- there's a significant amount of projects out there that are ongoing or from utilities driving win towards the West on the East Coast coming down from Canada, where you're absolutely bringing load wind, whether we're on the wind side or not. Usually, we're on both sides of it. If they combine it is better. I think it's our job to show the client the economics around that and how we see it. And is that the ultimate is that the ultimate project for the consumer at the end. Can we do it cheaper and more efficient. So I do think I like our chances. SunZia is certainly a highlight of what can be done. And I think it -- when you collaborate early, you get those kind of results and everyone wins. As far as the margins on renewables, I think a lot of that was the Canadian project pulling it down a bit. I do believe when you start to scale the way we're scaling, what happened in the renewable business across the board, you had a stop 6 months, 9 months where no one did much because of all the regulations in '22. And that -- and also the IRA coming in. As the IRA comes in, you're going to get on more of a run rate base rate that you can see and you'll stock on top of that as you grow, I don't think you'll have this cadence that you have where you're growing from the first quarter significantly into the second, into the third and the fourth. And you get more -- obviously we have to perform on the back side much better than we did on front. And I believe everything in historical, nothing on the back side outside of any historical margins. In fact, it's right down the middle for us on the backside of this. And I think that should create -- you'll have some seasonality in the first quarter, but your fourth quarter is going to obviously grow you have some impacts in the second due to our -- the way that we're mobilizing on projects and things of that user, but it should smooth on out into '24 and beyond.\nJayshree Desai: Yes. And we are seeing better performance in the rest of our business, Jamie. When you see the impact of the Canadian project at 120 basis points. The rest of the business, we were we were pleased, as I said, the performance there margins are doing better than we expected. And as Duke said, as we move out of first quarter into second, third, you're going to have more volume, you're going to have better fixed cost absorption and you're going to just have better productivity as a result of getting into better climates.\nJamie Cook: Well, not to push you, I'm just wondering if the back half margin implied double-digit if that's a new run rate going forward given just what you're seeing in the market?\nDuke Austin: We don't have enough history Jamie to give you that. If I can get 12 months' worth of run clean on renewables, I'll be in a much better place to give you some dialogue, but it certainly will -- if you do the math, you've got to be in double digits on the back half.\nJamie Cook: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Marc Bianchi with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nMarc Bianchi: Thank you. How much should SunZia contribute to backlog here in the, I guess, second and third quarter? And then how is your - how does that constrained, if at all, your bandwidth to take on additional work? Is there a level where backlog gets filled up and you're probably just going to continue to work on that level for several quarters?\nDuke Austin: I think we'll continue to grow backlog. We're not going to comment on how big the job was. We said is the largest renewable project in North America, so it's quite large. We'll put it in backlog next quarter, and you can infer what that looks like. But -- that said, in general, as far -- we hear a lot around constraints. The company has grown about 1,000 employees a quarter. We're roughly very close to 50,000 today. And I do think that growth continues. We were set up to meet the demands out there. I've not seen the demand outpaced our ability to grow and grow in a efficient way where we can certainly put the resources on the projects and that we see anything we've seen in the market anything out there we're bidding on. We can certainly handle and handle more of it. I challenge the supply chain to catch our ability to perform the labor because that's where the problem is.\nMarc Bianchi: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nNeil Mehta: Good morning, Duke and team. And I guess my first question is just around the cash flow, free cash flow progression over the course of the year and how we should be thinking about the $750 million to $1 billion guidance and whether you're on track and whether you're targeting where -- within that band you see yourself being.\nJayshree Desai: Yes. Hi, Neil, yes, we are tracking toward that $750 million to $1 billion. We still feel good about it. Our first quarter was negative, which is typical for us in the first quarter, given the working capital requirements coming back from the holidays, ramping up. We did also have a little bit of pressure in the first quarter with some retainage as well as some material procurement that impacted our DPOs. But again, well within our expectations, and moving forward, as the work increases, we've got more renewable projects coming through. You're going to see that cash flow and the revenue come in as a result. Our expectations are still within that $750 million to $1 billion. I think we're on the midpoint is where -- Neil, if you're asking me today where we are, that midpoint is right down the middle and where we would be. And so we feel good about where we are today and see no reason to change that.\nNeil Mehta: Okay. That's really helpful. And then the follow-up is just on one of the core competencies and capabilities of your organization has been around making strategic acquisitions, not just large ones like Blattner, but also smaller bolt-on ones as well. What's the opportunity set in the M&A market for tuck-ins, recognizing big strategic points are probably less likely as you are working to integrate Blattner right now?\nDuke Austin: We made three in the first quarter, I think, are extremely strategic, so that said, it addresses the mid-market solar and many other things. So our ability to think differently and to get in front of these type trends as well as families that want to perpetuate their business I do believe we'll have the ability to do that. We'll certainly weigh that against organic growth on the way that we're thinking about the market. So there's opportunities for sure. And I'll go back to cash flow. If we grow the business for every $100 million we grow, we pull cash out. I think it's around $12 million of free cash, somewhere in there. So don't -- like if we grow another $500 million of guidance, you're going to pull out another $70 million of $60 million of cash. So just that happens. We've got to make sure that everyone understands that is if we grow more than what we say, it does pull cash.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nSean Eastman: Hi, team. So it's great to see the later kind of revenue synergy story coming together with this big SunZia win. Duke, you had alluded to the economics to the customer being better when you guys kind of come to market with this combined transmission generation solution. Could you give us a little more color on that and kind of what the go-to-market pitch is? And what the benefit to the customer is here?\nDuke Austin: Yes. I mean I just -- there's a lot of synergies, Sean. It's kind of like the Coke secret sauce, I'm not going to tell you what it looks like. with the ingredients are. So the issue is, for us, if you get us in early, our ability to put a construction-led engineering package together is what I think leads the industry forward, not only from a safety standpoint, just the way we think about supply chains, everything with a long the build. So it's just our ability really to think through how we're going to build something and then make sure the engineering matches and where we build all kinds of different things from logistics to everything else, and we know a ton. And look, we know who's going to build it. So we know the craft that's going to build now the superintendents that are going to build it. When they sit with the customer early it always ends well.\nSean Eastman: Okay. Interesting. And then a little bit more granular. We haven't hit on the Underground segment. The first quarter margin performance was quite a bit better than we expected. And then I think the guidance for the full year has come down. So I just want to understand what's happening under the hood around that mix shift you described.\nDuke Austin: I just think in the Underground, when we look at it, I think the way we see capital spend at our customers, you can see some pull in from gas LDC into maybe Electric or Electric to Underground more so another half of the year. The total portfolio rises, you may have some impacts on a little overhead here or there. On your gas, your industrial business in the back half, we need to watch it. We have good visibility for 6 months and then you can't see the back half. So you're hesitant on putting something forward that is not there at this point. So we'll watch the underground business. That said, I do think that mix shift happens and there'll be some portfolio adjustments year-over-year all the time because the difference between electric and electric creating renewables or electric creating electric it's nothing. It's the same. You just -- it's the work type, who you're working for primarily or what you're doing with the work. So that said, I mean, they can -- we could grow the electric side of the business faster than the renewable side at times and the renewable side faster than the electric at times I just -- that was going to blend in and the underground business is the same thing. We can be doing telecom 1 day and gas the next, that's the beauty of the portfolio. And I think if you -- if we get operating leverage, if what the company is doing right, we'll continue to see some work mix shifts in underground, but you're going to higher margins in electric and telecom. It's a good thing.\nSean Eastman: Okay, interesting. Thanks. I'll turn it over.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Please proceed with your question\nMichael Dudas: Good morning, Kip, Duke and Jayshree.\nJayshree Desai: Good morning.\nMichael Dudas: Following up on, you mentioned telecom. Maybe you could share it seems like your revenue expectations remain what they have been. What are some of the trends you're seeing, anything that's been more beneficial Quanta? And could you - there any visibility into, say, 2024 on some of the programs and where you guys can get involved?\nDuke Austin: Yes, Mike, we're starting to see more and more programs from your non-traditional customers. So I think [indiscernible] close to $1 billion double digits which is what we are trying to accomplish, and we're very, very close. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if we surpass it. I think we pace the growth right. I think we've done purposefully there and we'll continue to take advantage of the market. That said, we're not investing a lot in that from acquisitions or things like that, it's primarily around organic growth at this point. So it allows us to really expand our other things against that market. So we're pacing our growth. I do big opportunities in 2024 really and beyond. '23 is nice, but we'll continue to watch it. It does get tickle at times.\nMichael Dudas: Thanks, Duke.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question.\nBrent Thielman: Hey. Thanks for taking the question. Duke, curious the outlook for sort of other new wind bookings opportunities. It seems like solar is kind of in the hot market last few years. Wondering if you're seeing RFP is picking up and wind and maybe that's another significant lever, I guess, beyond some from bookings in the coming quarters and years. And I guess, of that, too, are the economics of those projects more attractive than solar? Because it seems like it would be a less saturated sort of competitive environment given the technical necessities there.\nDuke Austin: Yes. I mean we're seeing more opportunities in the outer years. And when I mean the curves to the cards work and what you need so your battery projects are going to pick up significantly to handle some of the intermittence fees as well as the wind in certain areas. You have to have transmission interconnects and things of that nature. So a lot of it is the transmission cues as you get these larger lines built, you'll start to see more wind behind them. But they're not going to build the wind if they don't have anywhere to put it. And repowering certainly is a big business that we'll continue to see that repowering market is nice. And I'll let Jayshree comment on this.\nJayshree Desai: And the only thing I'd add to Duke's comment is wind is starting to get some momentum. I still think -- and we're still seeing that it's more back-half weighted as projects have to get through the permitting and interconnection cues. And for all the reasons Duke mentioned about the complexities of moving that wind power to where the load is, it just -- it's harder and it takes more time. And you have the IRA coming in as well, which will allow for more wind and have wind be as competitive solar. But again, the projects have to move through the development cycle to be ready to be built. But in terms of economics, no, I think we are comfortable with both. Blattner especially has a strong history in building wind and now solar and they've proven themselves to be successful in both.\nBrent Thielman: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question this morning will be from the line of Marc Bianchi with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nMarc Bianchi: Hi, thanks. I wanted to ask on the back half renewable margins here. You mentioned the, I think, 120 basis point burden in the first quarter. I'm curious what that Canadian project would be burdening the back half by just so we could get a sense of what it would look like once that's out of the backlog?\nDuke Austin: Yes, I think it's not material, if anything, on the back half. It's in the '22 a bit. So I think when you look at '22, it's down a bit and it won't - Canadian has been an impact in that segment. So there's not as much Canadian content in the back half of our year. And so we're confident in the historical performance of both sides of the business to be able to perform double digits in the back side of this - of the year.\nMarc Bianchi: Okay, super. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. And I'll turn the floor over to management for closing remarks.\nDuke Austin: Yes. I want to mainly thank our people in the field. We had a really, really nice quarter through tough winter that the foot of snow in places, these guys, women in the perform in northern climes better than anyone in the world and what they do every day is remarkable. They're building the nation's grid. And I'm real proud of where they're at from a safety standpoint and where we're at. And I'd like to thank them and you for participating in our conference call. We appreciate your questions and ongoing interest in Quanta Services. Thank you. This concludes our call.\nOperator: Thank you. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Duke Austin",
            "content": "Thanks Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Quanta Services first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. On the call today, I will provide operational and strategic commentary, and we'll turn it over to Jayshree Desai, Quanta's CFO, to provide a review of our first quarter results, full year 2023 financial expectations. Following Jayshree's comments, we welcome your questions. Before we begin reviewing our financial results, I would like to briefly highlight the recognition that Quanta recently received from Engineering News Record, a leading engineering and construction industry publication. In our selected Quanta for its prestigious and highest honor, the award of excellence. Quanta was selected for its safety leadership with our innovative capacity model, a unique safety and training program that is designed to not only create a work environment that prevents incidents, but also build in the capacity to sell safely and it focuses on learning from mistakes in order to drive improved outcomes. Quanta is changing how we, our customers and the industry think about safety excellence, and I want to congratulate Quanta employees for their dedication to safety and their shared success in being recognized with this award. Our first quarter results, which include double-digit revenue growth and adjusted diluted EPS of $1.24 demonstrate a good start to the year. More importantly, we continue to enhance our self-perform model and remain on track to achieve our full year 2023 and multiyear expectations. Additionally, total backlog at the quarter end was $25.3 billion, a record and considerably higher than the same period last year. Notably, we see opportunity to significantly increase backlog as we move through the year, driven by our base business and larger energy transition projects, such as the SunZia Transmission and SunZia Wind projects we announced this morning. We believe we are in the early stages of capitalizing on significant opportunities across our service lines, which are driven by our collaborative solution-based approach that is designed to ultimately benefit consumers. Additionally, the growth of the programmatic spending with existing and new customers and favorable megatrends provide greater flex visibility into our near and long-term growth outlook. Our Electric Power Infrastructure Solutions segment continued to perform well and generated record quarterly revenues. Demand for our services is strong, driven by broad-based business activity from utility grid modernization, grid security and system hardening initiatives, as well as our reputation for consistent and safe execution. We continue to work with our customers to provide them with resources to meet their capital deployment initiatives and to help them address supply chain constraints. As we have discussed over the past several quarters, our view is that the electric power grid will require significant upgrade and modernization to handle the energy transition. We also believe that electric vehicle penetration could increase at a faster rate than expected, which could create significant grid constraints that we believe are underappreciated by many. We expect the issue in the near term, the medium term in most regions will not be generation load supply availability, but the inability to move supply to areas with accelerating EV-driven low demand through the current distribution system. According to estimates from UBS, United States EV car penetration is expected to be more than quadruple from approximately 4% in 2025 to approximately 19% by 2030. We believe this developing grid capacity challenge will be acutely impacted as commercial fleets, medium and heavy-duty trucks and buses become increasingly electrified. For example, yesterday, Navistar a long-standing key partner to Quanta for medium and heavy-duty trucks announced a partnership with us to provide its customers a turnkey, battery electric vehicle products and charging infrastructure solution that enables fleets to deploy battery EVs quickly and efficiently. The partnership intends to leverage Navistar's approach to delivering fully integrated e-mobility solutions to its customers with Quanta's expertise in assessing and designing EV charging infrastructure and building the interconnecting EV battery charging infrastructure into the power grid. Quanta understands infrastructure and its partnership agreement with Navistar, as an example, of unique vantage point we have into the growing challenges with the power grid as the energy transition and electrification of everything accelerates. As we have discussed on prior calls, to meaningfully reduce carbon emissions and increased electrification of the economy will require substantial incremental investment in transmission, substation and renewable generation facilities to produce and transport Clean Power and to ensure grid reliability due to the growth of intermittent power added to the system. One of the strategic reasons we acquired Blattner was because we believe the addition of utility-scale renewable generation solutions to Quanta's holistic grid solutions will transform our ability to collaborate early with our customers on their energy transition strategies over the coming decades and create a value proposition unique in the industry. To that end, this morning, we announced that Quanta was selected by Pattern Energy to provide comprehensive infrastructure solutions for the SunZia Transmission and SunZia Wind projects, which together compromise the largest clean energy infrastructure project in the United States history. Quanta will leverage the capabilities of multiple operating companies to execute these projects for Pattern Energy. We believe these project awards validate the power of our combined high-voltage transmission and renewable generation solutions and demonstrate the value of our collaborative approach to providing energy transition infrastructure solutions, which can serve as a model for the renewable and utility industries going forward. As expected, normal seasonality in the solar panel supply chain and regulatory hurdles from last year resulted in a slow start for our renewable generation project activities in the first quarter. However, these dynamics are improving and renewable generation project activity is accelerating, which we expect to continue throughout the year. For example, at the end of April, we were in various levels of construction on 28 utility-scale renewable generation projects. Further, we are in active discussions with clients about projects in 2024 and beyond and are focused on scaling our resources and capacity handle what we expect to be record levels of new renewable generation capacity additions over the coming decade, at least. Additionally, we are pursuing billions of dollars of high-voltage transmission projects that are designed to support current and future renewable generation capacity growth and overall system reliability. We are pleased with the performance of our Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment in the first quarter, which delivered double-digit revenue growth and record levels of first quarter profitability, demonstrating solid execution across our operations in this segment. Our industrial services operations executed well and experienced strong demand following 2 years of deferred activity during the pandemic. We also experienced solid demand for our gas utility and pipeline integrity operations, which are executing well and are driven by regulated spend to modernize systems, reduce methane emissions, ensure environmental compliance and improve safety and reliability. We continue to believe our operational portfolio is a strategic advantage that provides us the ability to ship resources across service lines and geographies, which we believe will become increasingly important as the energy transition accelerates. We believe our portfolio approach positions us well to allocate resources to the opportunities. We find the most economical and attractive to achieve operating efficiencies that enhance our operational and financial consistency. The energy transition towards a reduced economy continues to progress and we believe is gaining pace. Quanta is successfully executing on our strategic initiatives to drive sustainable and resilient operational excellence, total cost solutions for our clients, consistent profitable and value - consistent profitable growth and value for our stakeholders, all of which gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on our 2023 and multiyear financial expectations. We are focused on operating the business for the long term and expect to continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class field leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's base business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe on the diversity, unique operating model and entrepreneur mindset form the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for all our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Jayshree Desai, our CFO, for her review of our first quarter results and 2023 expectations. Jayshree? Morning. Yes. Thanks, Andy. I think when we look at the market and especially the larger projects within the market, there's a significant amount that you got to get through permitting, you've got to get through a lot of different things. More importantly, if you're going to transition the need for transmission in North America, for that matter, is significant, way more than what people will estimate. I think you hear it quite a bit where were moving towards the transition we are. So that said, we do see large projects across the board, but you have multiyear projects as well with existing customers that are also addressing this need to provide load to the load centers from the areas where you have renewables. So those things, along with what you're doing with EV penetration and things like that are certainly increasing. Our dialogue with customers is robust. The amount of capital necessary to go where we want to go, continues to grow. I don't see a path to get to anywhere near where we want to go in 2030, 2040, 2050 without significant infrastructure build across this grid. It's not meant to handle the modernization, the penetration of electric vehicles and what we're trying to do from a carbon environment without modernizing this infrastructure in a significant way. Our backlog growing. We don't even have SunZia and it will go up significantly. I think it will go up significantly every single quarter throughout the year. It may not be a perfect CAGR, but it will grow through this year, and I don't see that stopping. I mean we've given you good guidance on a multiyear 10% type growth at the EPS line with the ability to grow 15%. I stand by it today, even more so. I think it's getting better. I mean you still you still hear Congress even today or yesterday, I can't remember. You start to see things around your reliance on China for panels. And I do think that will continue to play through this. But all in all, for what we see for what we have, we certainly have risk-adjusted kind of how we're guiding this year. So I do think we've watched it. We know what panels are in. We know what panels aren't in. I do believe that has alleviated a bit and we'll continue - so the supply chain has gotten better in many ways. Certainly, if there's any kind of regulation or things like that, it could change. But I do see more for that matter, everything being more onshore than offshore. And I do think that's a good trend for us in the way that we think about providing those solutions. Jayshree can comment. Yes. Thanks, Alex. I think in general, we're about 85% still. I think that remains the work mix for us. If it's more material concentric, we'll make some comment on it. Today, it's the same for about 85% of the business is still self-performed. We like that. We like that mix. I think it will continue. We certainly to have certainty in our projects and to the client on delivery times and on for our ability to provide earnings power, we need to be able to self-perform about that mix. And the constraints that we have, no one understands those and we have to make sure that we can operate through any kind of issue. So that's about the mix you'll see. Yes. Honestly, I don't have any idea. I know we had a great collaboration with the client. It was a collaborative effort. And I believe it shows what the Blattner acquisition did for us. When you put both of us together what we can do together, what we can do for the client, the synergies that we can create for a client in a project like this. I would say it's proof of concept, it's proof of what can be done with the client to ultimate consumer and I don't think there is anyone that can do what we can do with these type of projects based upon history based upon what we're able to really think through for early in construction we can certainly create impacts and solutions to both sides of this transition, unlike any other. Yes. We have some revenue in our guidance this year from it. It was in our uncommitted prior to the award. But that said, it's minimal. And I don't -- we don't see a pullback or a path where it doesn't go. So there's a lot of commitments being made here. We feel like the project is a go project, it's a great project, patterns of long time customer, Blattner and IRA for that matter. So we're confident, and we've worked hard with the client to make sure that this project is a showcase for them and us and the industry, what can be done through hard work. And yes, it's a long, long project. It took a long time. It shouldn't take this long in America to build infrastructure. So certainly, it's -- we're glad to get it across the finish line for everyone. Yes, a little bit on the project. That's the way to think about it, but a little bit on that project, just so we can discuss it a bit -- it's a project that we did through the pandemic. And it's a project no one's done in northern climes like this, where we've taken people off fuel and putting them on renewable power I think it's significant in the way you think about the northern climes and what can be done. Our people work through a pandemic and built this. And so that said, no one's ever done that. No one's ever -- so the way that we're thinking through it, we've taken a prudent approach taking a prudent approach the way we've looked at it. All I can say is we can build things in northern climes better than anyone in the world. I'm confident in our position. I think it's much better than what we have, but we took a prudent approach to it. We'll continue to do so. I don't think you'll see any more fluctuations unless it goes the other way. I feel confident in where we're at, and it was our decision really to make sure we derisk the rest of the year and the rest of the job with the approach that we've taken. So we're extremely happy with our people, this build was significant for us in a code-free environment of what's possible. Our productivity rates and everything else were off the chart. So real pleased with how we finished up, and I do believe it will pay dividends in the long term. Thanks, Steve. SunZia is right down the middle for us, both from -- we just got off a wind project, with pattern did really nicely. We built line across that part of the world, many, many times, not concerned. What I can't control is a pandemic, so if our project has a 24-month pandemic in it, I don't know how to address that yet. I'll let you know when we get done with all the settlements on the claim. But the one in Canada, we work through a 24-month pandemic in a camp in the most northern territory in North America. So - and by the way, like every other project up there is off the rails. So look at coastal gas, look at Trans Mountain what they did compared to what we've done. I like our chances. So I know - we know we're doing on large projects, and this one is right on the middle. I expect many more of them to come. I think when you look at it, it's about the same between 80%, 85% base business, the why we've laid it out. Large projects will grow significantly. Our base business will grow significantly. We're signing much larger MSA type programmatic expense than the projects that you're seeing. It's just there over multiyears. This -- SunZia is over -- I think we get done in '26, end of '26, the line goes a little faster, '25. But that said, we have multiyear type MSAs type agreements with our current customers that are longer in nature that are much bigger. So we continue to see both the base as well as these larger projects, as we've talked about the stacking effect due to the transition and all the things that we're able to accomplish there on the company is in front of it. And I do believe the outlook looks good. And certainly, our strategies are 5 years out. And I like where we're at. And I think we're right on track, maybe a little better. Yes. When we look at the Navistar contract, I think it's just how we relate with our -- not only us, but our suppliers we collaborate. And that collaboration leads to other things that we can do together such as try to create the safest truck in the industry, which I think is where the start was trying to create the safest truck what can we do with automated driving, what can we do with other things. And then it led to -- well, what can we do together to build the infrastructure necessary to go to electric vehicles. That said, if you think about Navistar's -- their amount of market share in school buses, in every school district across North America, it's significant. Many of the school districts load once you put buses and you go to an EV type bus, it will pull more load at the bus depot than the town. So when you start thinking through that and you're struggling in all the school districts that are out there, I think it's a significant build. It's meaningful for the company. And if we work together, we work with our utility clients and municipalities on the front end of this, we can certainly do it cost effective and create an environment that allows everyone to move towards carbon free. Good morning, Jamie. So I do think when you think about that we're on call it, 25 renewable projects today. All those have interconnections. The discussions with the customer are usually when we didn't have Blattner, you weren't combining that. You were really -- we were doing a lot of the interconnections for the utilities or for the developers. Some are going towards a combined approach I think the more we show the economics around it, the more we think through it, the bigger the projects, certainly, the more economical it is for us to think through both wind solar and interconnection with the client, and we do that quite a bit. As far as -- there's a significant amount of projects out there that are ongoing or from utilities driving win towards the West on the East Coast coming down from Canada, where you're absolutely bringing load wind, whether we're on the wind side or not. Usually, we're on both sides of it. If they combine it is better. I think it's our job to show the client the economics around that and how we see it. And is that the ultimate is that the ultimate project for the consumer at the end. Can we do it cheaper and more efficient. So I do think I like our chances. SunZia is certainly a highlight of what can be done. And I think it -- when you collaborate early, you get those kind of results and everyone wins. As far as the margins on renewables, I think a lot of that was the Canadian project pulling it down a bit. I do believe when you start to scale the way we're scaling, what happened in the renewable business across the board, you had a stop 6 months, 9 months where no one did much because of all the regulations in '22. And that -- and also the IRA coming in. As the IRA comes in, you're going to get on more of a run rate base rate that you can see and you'll stock on top of that as you grow, I don't think you'll have this cadence that you have where you're growing from the first quarter significantly into the second, into the third and the fourth. And you get more -- obviously we have to perform on the back side much better than we did on front. And I believe everything in historical, nothing on the back side outside of any historical margins. In fact, it's right down the middle for us on the backside of this. And I think that should create -- you'll have some seasonality in the first quarter, but your fourth quarter is going to obviously grow you have some impacts in the second due to our -- the way that we're mobilizing on projects and things of that user, but it should smooth on out into '24 and beyond. We don't have enough history Jamie to give you that. If I can get 12 months' worth of run clean on renewables, I'll be in a much better place to give you some dialogue, but it certainly will -- if you do the math, you've got to be in double digits on the back half. I think we'll continue to grow backlog. We're not going to comment on how big the job was. We said is the largest renewable project in North America, so it's quite large. We'll put it in backlog next quarter, and you can infer what that looks like. But -- that said, in general, as far -- we hear a lot around constraints. The company has grown about 1,000 employees a quarter. We're roughly very close to 50,000 today. And I do think that growth continues. We were set up to meet the demands out there. I've not seen the demand outpaced our ability to grow and grow in a efficient way where we can certainly put the resources on the projects and that we see anything we've seen in the market anything out there we're bidding on. We can certainly handle and handle more of it. I challenge the supply chain to catch our ability to perform the labor because that's where the problem is. We made three in the first quarter, I think, are extremely strategic, so that said, it addresses the mid-market solar and many other things. So our ability to think differently and to get in front of these type trends as well as families that want to perpetuate their business I do believe we'll have the ability to do that. We'll certainly weigh that against organic growth on the way that we're thinking about the market. So there's opportunities for sure. And I'll go back to cash flow. If we grow the business for every $100 million we grow, we pull cash out. I think it's around $12 million of free cash, somewhere in there. So don't -- like if we grow another $500 million of guidance, you're going to pull out another $70 million of $60 million of cash. So just that happens. We've got to make sure that everyone understands that is if we grow more than what we say, it does pull cash. Yes. I mean I just -- there's a lot of synergies, Sean. It's kind of like the Coke secret sauce, I'm not going to tell you what it looks like. with the ingredients are. So the issue is, for us, if you get us in early, our ability to put a construction-led engineering package together is what I think leads the industry forward, not only from a safety standpoint, just the way we think about supply chains, everything with a long the build. So it's just our ability really to think through how we're going to build something and then make sure the engineering matches and where we build all kinds of different things from logistics to everything else, and we know a ton. And look, we know who's going to build it. So we know the craft that's going to build now the superintendents that are going to build it. When they sit with the customer early it always ends well. I just think in the Underground, when we look at it, I think the way we see capital spend at our customers, you can see some pull in from gas LDC into maybe Electric or Electric to Underground more so another half of the year. The total portfolio rises, you may have some impacts on a little overhead here or there. On your gas, your industrial business in the back half, we need to watch it. We have good visibility for 6 months and then you can't see the back half. So you're hesitant on putting something forward that is not there at this point. So we'll watch the underground business. That said, I do think that mix shift happens and there'll be some portfolio adjustments year-over-year all the time because the difference between electric and electric creating renewables or electric creating electric it's nothing. It's the same. You just -- it's the work type, who you're working for primarily or what you're doing with the work. So that said, I mean, they can -- we could grow the electric side of the business faster than the renewable side at times and the renewable side faster than the electric at times I just -- that was going to blend in and the underground business is the same thing. We can be doing telecom 1 day and gas the next, that's the beauty of the portfolio. And I think if you -- if we get operating leverage, if what the company is doing right, we'll continue to see some work mix shifts in underground, but you're going to higher margins in electric and telecom. It's a good thing. Yes, Mike, we're starting to see more and more programs from your non-traditional customers. So I think [indiscernible] close to $1 billion double digits which is what we are trying to accomplish, and we're very, very close. It wouldn't surprise me if we surpass it. I think we pace the growth right. I think we've done purposefully there and we'll continue to take advantage of the market. That said, we're not investing a lot in that from acquisitions or things like that, it's primarily around organic growth at this point. So it allows us to really expand our other things against that market. So we're pacing our growth. I do big opportunities in 2024 really and beyond. '23 is nice, but we'll continue to watch it. It does get tickle at times. Yes. I mean we're seeing more opportunities in the outer years. And when I mean the curves to the cards work and what you need so your battery projects are going to pick up significantly to handle some of the intermittence fees as well as the wind in certain areas. You have to have transmission interconnects and things of that nature. So a lot of it is the transmission cues as you get these larger lines built, you'll start to see more wind behind them. But they're not going to build the wind if they don't have anywhere to put it. And repowering certainly is a big business that we'll continue to see that repowering market is nice. And I'll let Jayshree comment on this. Yes, I think it's not material, if anything, on the back half. It's in the '22 a bit. So I think when you look at '22, it's down a bit and it won't - Canadian has been an impact in that segment. So there's not as much Canadian content in the back half of our year. And so we're confident in the historical performance of both sides of the business to be able to perform double digits in the back side of this - of the year. Yes. I want to mainly thank our people in the field. We had a really, really nice quarter through tough winter that the foot of snow in places, these guys, women in the perform in northern climes better than anyone in the world and what they do every day is remarkable. They're building the nation's grid. And I'm real proud of where they're at from a safety standpoint and where we're at. And I'd like to thank them and you for participating in our conference call. We appreciate your questions and ongoing interest in Quanta Services. Thank you. This concludes our call."

            "name": "Jayshree Desai",
            "content": "Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced record first quarter revenues of $4.4 billion. Net income attributable to common stock was $95 million or $0.64 per diluted share and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.24. Our first quarter electric power revenues were $2.3 billion, and operating income margins were 9.2% and consistent with the directional views provided on last quarter's call and reflecting successful execution across the segment. Our base business continues to lead the way for the segment as utility investments in hardening and modernization initiatives create growing demand for our comprehensive solutions. Renewable Energy Infrastructure segment revenues for first quarter '23 were $1 billion with operating income margins of 3.5%. Revenues in the quarter were better than expected due to the acceleration of construction activities as our renewable customers move forward with projects. As we mentioned on our last call, we anticipated first quarter renewable revenues to be the segment's lowest of the year and the lower volumes would create fixed cost absorption pressure on segment margins. In light of that expected pressure from a margin perspective, we are pleased with the results from the bulk of our project activities. The overall segment margin was affected, however, by the large renewable transmission project in Canada, which we've discussed on prior calls. With over 90% of the project complete as of March 31, construction activities were quite successful during the quarter, and we believe we are positioned to achieve substantial completion after the next winter build season. Yet despite the significant progress, access delays, logistics and other issues outside of our control, increased our cost on the project negatively impacting quarter margins by approximately 120 basis points. We are working collaboratively with the customer to recover the financial impacts associated with these and other issues and are confident in an equitable outcome. Underground Utility and Infrastructure segment revenues were $1.1 billion for the quarter and operating income margins were 5.7%. Continued strength from our base business operations drove the performance with margins exceeding expectations, benefiting from improved fixed cost absorption on higher than anticipated revenue levels. For additional commentary comparing first quarter '23 to first quarter '22, please refer to the slides accompanying this call. With regard to backlog, we continue to achieve record levels. At March 31, 2023, backlog was $25.3 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion compared to December 31 and did not include amounts related to SunZia, which we announced this morning and was awarded subsequent to the quarter end. Our 12-month backlog is also at a record level of $14.6 billion which we believe is another indicator of the steady growing demand for our base business solutions. Our end markets remain robust with opportunities that can lead to new record levels of backlog in subsequent quarters. For the first quarter of 2023, as expected, we had negative free cash flow of $31 million, driven by working capital demands from the aforementioned Canadian renewables project as well as a ramp-up of work activities following the holidays, which is typical for the first quarter. DSO measured 77 days for the first quarter of 2023, lower than our historical average, aided by favorable billing arrangements associated with certain awards during the quarter. Regarding the Canadian renewable transmission project, the contract asset balance grew during first quarter '23 and continues to pressure DSO. Positive discussions with the customer regarding portions of the balance are ongoing, which represents approximately 5 to 6 days of DSO as of March 31, and we are increasingly confident in our position. As of March 31, 2023, we had total liquidity of approximately $1.8 billion and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5x as calculated under our credit agreement. The decrease in liquidity and increased leverage profile is due to roughly $450 million of capital deployed on acquisitions in the first quarter. We expect continued earnings growth and cash generation to support our ability to efficiently delever over the coming quarters while continuing to create stockholder value through incremental capital deployment. Turning to our guidance. We had a nice start to the year with record first quarter revenues and strong performance in the field. Given that strength, we are raising our revenue expectations for the year by $200 million, while our expectations for full year adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock are unchanged, ranging between $6.75 and $7.25. From a segment perspective, we continue to see Electric segment revenues between $10 billion and $10.1 billion for the year, with full year margins between 10.7% and 11.3%. We expect segment margins to be somewhat pressured in the second quarter due to challenging weather conditions throughout the northern and western parts of North America. Regarding our Renewable segment, given the strength of the first quarter and increased project awards, we are raising our full year revenue expectations for the segment by $200 million, ranking between $4.5 billion and $4.7 billion. We continue to expect margins around 8.5% for the year, with second quarter margins in the upper single digits. The increase in renewables is being offset by a reduction in our Underground segment due to a shift in the expected portfolio mix. Our segment revenue expectations are unchanged, but we now expect full year margins to range between 7% and 7.5%. We slightly modified other aspects of our guidance, the details of which are included in our outlook summary, which can be found in the Financial Information section of our IR website at quantaservices.com. Looking ahead, our end markets continue to strengthen, led by utilities, modernizing their infrastructure to support increased load driven by electrification trends and most importantly, to support North America's transition to a reduced carbon future. We believe we are uniquely positioned to deliver comprehensive solutions to the markets we serve and to create significant shareholder value through organic growth and strategic capital investment. I'll now turn it back to the operator for Q&A. Operator? No, I have nothing more to add. That's right. I think it is opening up. We're seeing the supply chain, the panel manufacturers make -- do a better job of ensuring that they're meeting their requirements under the -- under the tariff provisions. But yes, if there is any sort of regulation, any sort of anti-China sentiment that continues to push through, that can obviously affect the supply chain again. Yes. And we are seeing better performance in the rest of our business, Jamie. When you see the impact of the Canadian project at 120 basis points. The rest of the business, we were we were pleased, as I said, the performance there margins are doing better than we expected. And as Duke said, as we move out of first quarter into second, third, you're going to have more volume, you're going to have better fixed cost absorption and you're going to just have better productivity as a result of getting into better climates. Yes. Hi, Neil, yes, we are tracking toward that $750 million to $1 billion. We still feel good about it. Our first quarter was negative, which is typical for us in the first quarter, given the working capital requirements coming back from the holidays, ramping up. We did also have a little bit of pressure in the first quarter with some retainage as well as some material procurement that impacted our DPOs. But again, well within our expectations, and moving forward, as the work increases, we've got more renewable projects coming through. You're going to see that cash flow and the revenue come in as a result. Our expectations are still within that $750 million to $1 billion. I think we're on the midpoint is where -- Neil, if you're asking me today where we are, that midpoint is right down the middle and where we would be. And so we feel good about where we are today and see no reason to change that. Good morning. And the only thing I'd add to Duke's comment is wind is starting to get some momentum. I still think -- and we're still seeing that it's more back-half weighted as projects have to get through the permitting and interconnection cues. And for all the reasons Duke mentioned about the complexities of moving that wind power to where the load is, it just -- it's harder and it takes more time. And you have the IRA coming in as well, which will allow for more wind and have wind be as competitive solar. But again, the projects have to move through the development cycle to be ready to be built. But in terms of economics, no, I think we are comfortable with both. Blattner especially has a strong history in building wind and now solar and they've proven themselves to be successful in both."

With that, I would like to now turn the call over to Duke Austin, Quanta's President and CEO. Duke?\nDuke Austin: Thanks Kip. Good morning everyone and welcome to the Quanta Services third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Before I turn to our third quarter results, I would like to comment on Quanta's response to Hurricanes Beryl and Helene. During the third quarter, we deployed significant resources to assist power restoration and related efforts in Texas for Hurricane Beryl and in the Southeast for Hurricane Helene. During these events, our employees often do more than work to get the power restored, but it's not well known are the other ways that our crews who are first responders, help people in need during these devastating events. For example, in response to Hurricane Helene, Quanta crews worked with local sheriffs, law enforcement groups and various humanitarian organizations to leverage our helicopter assets to deliver more than 200,000 pounds of cargo to impacted rural and mountain communities in North Carolina, including water, food, medical and camping supplies, pet food, hay for livestock, and more. Our pilots also aided search and rescue efforts, provided reconnaissance and roadway assessments, and performed welfare checks. These severe weather events also often impact the lives and property of Quanta employees, many of whom are away from their families for long periods, restoring power to others. Quanta Cares, our employee relief fund, provided financial support to approximately 125 employees and their families who were impacted by these damaging storms. I want to recognize and thank the thousands of Quanta employees who work tirelessly to restore power and much more for people in need during these severe weather events. Quanta delivered another quarter of double-digit growth in revenues, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share, as well as a number of other record financial metrics including total backlog of $34 billion and free cash flow of $539 million. There is momentum building across our portfolio of solutions with the increased demand for and tightening of power generation capacity and the significant power grid upgrades and enhancements required to facilitate load growth. Our collaborative solution based approach is valued by our clients more than ever. Quanta sits at the nexus of the utility, renewable energy and technology industries, and the convergence of these industries is gaining pace. Utilities across the United States are experiencing and forecasting meaningful increases in power demand for the first time in two decades, which is being driven by the adoption of new technologies and related infrastructure including artificial intelligence and data centers, as well as federal and state policies designed to accelerate the energy transition and policies intended to strategically reinforce domestic manufacturing and supply chain resources. The necessity to build and modernize infrastructure is clear, and we believe Quanta's craft, skilled labor, workforce and self-performed capabilities are critical to advancing our infrastructure solutions. To that end, the integration of Cupertino Electric is progressing well and while it is early, we have received positive customer response to our comprehensive critical path electric infrastructure solutions for the technology and data center industry that provides opportunity to improve speed to market for projects. In summary, we are executing well on our strategic plan and while there are areas for improvement, we are pleased with where we sit. We are pacing well against our multiyear financial targets including double digit EPS growth and double digit returns. We ended the quarter with record backlog. We expect adjusted EPS to grow approximately 20% at the midpoint of our guidance over last year. We expect record levels of free cash flow this year, a leverage profile below two times by year-end and over $3 billion of liquidity. Our end markets have never been better and we see opportunity for further strength in the coming years. As I hope you can tell, we are proud of our execution and even more excited about the solutions platform we have built for the future. We are positioning Quanta for decades of expected necessary infrastructure investment and believe our service line diversity creates platforms for growth that expand our total addressable market. Our portfolio approach and focus on craft skill labor is a strategic advantage that we believe provides us the ability to manage risk and shift resources across service lines and geographies which is increasingly important as the energy transition and new technologies add complexity to infrastructure programs. We believe our service offering diversity, supply chain capabilities and portfolio approach have improved our cash flow and returns profile and position us well to allocate resources to the opportunities we find most economically attractive and achieve operating efficiencies and consistent financial results. I will now turn the call over to Jayshree Desai Quanta\u2019s CFO to provide a few remarks about our about our 2024 guidance results, about 2021 results and guidance and then we will take your questions. Jayshree?\nJayshree Desai: Thanks, Duke and good morning everyone. This morning we reported third quarter revenues of $6.5 billion, net income attributable to common stock of $293.2 million or $1.95 per diluted share and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.72. Adjusted EBITDA was $682.8 million or 10.5% of revenues. Additionally, we generated healthy cash flows in the third quarter with cash flow from operations of $739.9 million and free cash flow of $539.5 million. During the quarter we also successfully recapitalized the business following our acquisition of Cupertino, allowing us to address the maturity of our senior notes that were due in October. Our earnings and cash flow performance coupled with this recapitalization allowed us to end the third quarter with ample liquidity and a balance sheet that supports both our organic growth expectations and the opportunistic investment of capital to generate incremental returns for our stockholders. This morning we also provided an update to our full year 2024 financial expectations, which calls for another year of profitable growth with record revenues and opportunity for double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDA, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow. We believe our expectations demonstrate the strength of our portfolio approach to the business, our commitment to our long-term strategy, favorable end market trends and our competitive position in the marketplace. Additional details and commentary about our 2024 financial guidance can be found in our Operational and Financial Commentary and Outlook Expectation Summary, both of which are posted on our IR website. With that, we are happy to answer your questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Atidrip Modak with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nAtidrip Modak: Hi, good morning Duke and Jayshree. You acquired some transformer manufacturing capability again. Can you talk about that a little bit? Is the supply chain still significant of a concern going ahead and how much of your internal needs can you now source and are there synergies with the PTT assets? Any color around that?\nDuke Austin: Yes, thank you. We did acquire some a small transformer manufacturing company in upstate New York in the quarter a hundred year old family business. When we were going through the markets we did some things that would allow us to make this acquisition certainly beneficial to PTII and the markets that we serve. We continue to see constraints on large transformers. The factory certainly helps us with that. Our backlog in the business has gotten longer, not shorter. We continue to see opportunities internally and find synergies with the ability to build both transformers and breakers as we move forward. So the supply chain constraints are there. They're real. We're trying to do things in the lower 48 with the load that we see and so I think we'll continue to see ourselves get in a good position to make sure that we can have self-performed capabilities both from a manufacturing standpoint as well as to build and the craft skill labor on certain critical path items. So the synergies are there. We're seeing them show up. You can support the business internally. We build probably around 150 to 170 EPC subs a year. So we can support that, but that's not what we bought them for. We really believe it's to enhance the whole market and we would not do that internally just to supplement some of our bills that provide synergies to some clients.\nAtidrip Modak: Got it. That's helpful. And then you talked about having visibility into the timing of renewable transmission projects. Can you give us a lay off the land, big picture view of how that's shaking out for the next few years here as conversations with your customers is progressing?\nDuke Austin: Yes, I mean, I think everyone's hearing the market demand from load and in order for load to work, we need the transmission infrastructure. I would say that the inbounds, the bids, the proposals that we have, things in contract, things that we're talking about record levels year-over-year, record levels in the 25, record levels in the 26, record levels in the 27. We continue to see more bid opportunities, more discussions on larger transmission capacity constraints. So yes, I mean, we said it on the call. We've never seen the business any better and we continue to believe that large transmission is the cheapest form of generation in many ways. So you can't do the things that we're trying to do and accomplish in the country without transmission and we need to expedite it.\nAtidrip Modak: Awesome. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Truist. Please proceed with your question.\nJamie Cook: Hi, good morning. I guess two questions from me. One, the renewable margins in the quarter obviously were pretty good and you've made a nice improvement in margins for that business throughout the year. And then you raise guidance, I guess. Jayshree, is it unreasonable to think that 2025, we're finally at a place, with the revenue and the performance of the business where we can expect, double-digit margins because that's where we will be exiting the year. I'm just wondering if that's a reasonable expectation. And then I guess my second question, Duke or Jayshree on Cupertino, just sort of an update on how that business is doing. Is there any change in your guidance for Cupertino, for the year and then just potential for revenue synergies there? Thank you.\nDuke Austin: Hey Jamie. I\u2019ll speak and I'll let Jayshree comment on some of the questions there in a minute. So when we see it, when we look at it, the renewables and margins, they were good. We did say that we could get them up in double-digits. I believe we can over time. We've done it and I wouldn't run it. You have seasonality in the business, so your first half will be a little bit slower and you'll pick it up in the back half. Whenever transmission business is in there today that business has always ran in double-digits. The platinum business has ran at double digits. So we consistently said we can do that. I believe that's possible going out as we move forward. The Cupertino business certainly has provided synergies to us already. We continue to get inbounds on Cupertino. I think it's from our standpoint, something that will allow us a different customer base, allows us to participate much in a much greater way in the data center business as we see it. So the electrification thereof and it really, we haven't got the synergies like baked into anything at this point, but they're there. Much like Blattner, they're there and we're seeing those show up in our business today. We'll see Cupertino show up in our business in 2025, 2026 and beyond. And we're pretty excited about next year and what we see. But it's not a next year story. We're delivering. We've delivered for the past five years. We continue to deliver. It's -- next year will just be better than this year. Jayshree?\nJayshree Desai: Yes. You covered it. Yes. Just remind you, Jamie, of the cadence of the renewable segment. So as Duke said, back half is definitely usually stronger than the first half. So going into next year, I think the right way to look at it is what we said in Investor Day, that we have the opportunity to perform that 9% to 10% range in renewable.\nJamie Cook: But Jayshree, sorry, the expectations that what's implied in the guide for 2024 for Cupertino, has that changed?\nJayshree Desai: In 2024 guide?\nJamie Cook: Yes. For Cupertino, has that changed at all?\nJayshree Desai: Yes. If you recall, we told you that Cupertino has the ability to perform in that $1 billion to $1.1 billion range in revenue. They're performing at the high end of that range.\nJamie Cook: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Fleishman: Yes. Hi, good morning. Thanks. First question, just on the. In the quarter, a lot of, good backlog and revenue growth, but a lot of it was kind of acquisition recent Acquisitions. Could you just talk to organic growth that you're seeing and kind of why was that maybe a little slower in the quarter and how do you look at that from here?\nDuke Austin: Yes, thanks Steve. I think when you, when you think about it, there was some backlog growth around 400 million or so in the, in, in the quarter. With the way the segmentation, delineation of the segmentation, the segments create some issues for us. When you think about just T&D, our traditional T&D business, it certainly if you look at where we're at, it's 5% into the third quarter of growth organically. It's double digit growth in the forecast at the midpoint of the range. So we have double-digit growth year-over-year at the traditional T&D business at the midpoint of the range. And we stated that going forward we believe we grow that upper single digits on a go forward basis organically.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay, great. And then one other question. Just on the data center opportunity, not just, not just Cupertino, but also in your utilities business, the I think you said recently that data center investment really hasn't even shown up in utility plans yet for the most part. Do you have a better sense when it'll show up there and then kind of filter through to your backlog?\nDuke Austin: Yes, I mean I think it's, you hear a lot about it. You're starting to see utilities issue equity, you're starting to see debt come in and a lot of that's the transmission growth so their RTOs are robust in the planning stages. The thing is, if it's showing up three years from now, we better start today. And so I think we are seeing those discussions today from RTOs, from developers, from all of our customers. You have to start the transmission, the transformers three years out, you're 36 months away from energization and you need some time to build the substations. So I just, I think it's a fallacy to think that you can't, you have to start building transmission now. And the worst thing that we can do as an industry is sit here. So I don't think that sitting here works. I think everyone's moving forward. It took a little while to get this going. It took a little while to make sure that the rates are not punitive to the rate payers and we have good rate structures across the country. You're starting to see those show up. So I'm pretty excited about where we're at as an industry, where we're what I would consider moving forward against a big, doubling of maybe tripling of generation over the next two decades. So all the transmission build and substation build behind that substantial and it has to get started. And I think we're in, the early, very early stages of getting that started today.\nSteve Fleishman: Great, thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Rygiel with B Riley. Please proceed with your question.\nAlex Rygiel: Thank you and good morning everyone. A couple quick questions here. First, nuclear power generation has regained significant interest in small modular reactors in particular nearing commercial deployment. Can you talk a bit about Quanta's opportunity in that generation?\nDuke Austin: Yes, thanks Alex. I think when you see it, you'll see us build a substation interconnections. I don't see us at SMRS in any capacity. I think they're a decade away to any kind of scale. So yes, nuclear will be a piece of it going forward. They'll still be back heavily renewables. Even your big reactors, you're talking about a gig and on the bigger plant. So the smaller ones are certainly less and you'll see a lot of that to from a standpoint of emergency generation, things of that nature versus diesel. But I think it's an answer, it helps. Nuclear is something that's, long-term. You're going to need it to come in if we're going to grow the generation like we say we are. So yes, but I think for us as we sit here today, the way we see it is we'll be around the edges on the substations and all the electrification thereof.\nAlex Rygiel: That's helpful. And then Duke, as the business has grown through the years, can you talk a bit about how the risk profile of projects, contracts and the business in general has changed?\nDuke Austin: Anytime you have EPC, you create risk, you have different kinds of risk. We stay to our knitting. I mean I think we have a really good EPC program here where we're engineering, procuring product and constructing the linear part or craft skill. Labor is usually where people break down and that's what we've invested in. We self-perform 85% of the business. So I think the self-perform capabilities of Quanta de risk our business and we stay to that knitting and we know the costs when we go into them and having our own supply chains and our critical path items that we've done in the vertical supply chain really de risk the project. And if there's risk in it, then there's more margin in it. And so I like the risk profiles that we have because we can create margin out of them. So we're in good shape. And I think you'll continue to see that type of environment going forward due to the fact that there's just not enough talent around and you're going to see EPC get built for certainty across the country.\nAlex Rygiel: Thank you.\nDuke Austin: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Fisher: Thanks. Good morning. It seems clear that the big picture outlook here is developing pretty well. But maybe just to start with a couple of clarifications about some of the near term dynamics. Just on the electric side of things, just curious what the kind of puts and takes on the revenue guidance that was unchanged for that segment in light of the extra 225 million of emergency work. Maybe that was just a shift in resources. I know that can happen with these storms sometime. And then the 5% organic growth that you mentioned going to 10% for the year, I think you said last quarter 9%. I'm not sure if those numbers are all apples to apples and just maybe if they are, can you just remind us what's the programs that are driving the acceleration to that nice 10% for the year there? Thank you.\nDuke Austin: Thanks, Steve. Yes, we talked about the delineations of the segments and we do have crude movement across both segments. So you do get some of those things that show up in the way that the reports come out when we look at it. Yes, the storms are about 200 million incremental. You do with any kind of storms. For one thing, the company, at six and six plus six and a half billion in revenue in a quarter. It just, it's not that big of an impact to the company and maybe to others. It's not to us. And it does pull back off our industrial business and the gas space during barrel. You have a lot of push out in our industrial business due to the fact that the storms came in. So you're seeing that show up in that margin profile in our industrial business. So you have a lot of turnarounds that pushed due to storms. So the impacts across the company and portfolio, you can't see those things show up in these storm numbers. So there is an impact. We're pulling off transmission, we're pulling off some renewable projects that are larger. We're flying people in from Canada to save human life more importantly. And I think that's the struggle is to get everyone to see it's more than just a storm. We're also pulling off major, major projects to go do this. And it's necessary for the industry for us to do this. We had well over 5,000 people and continue in the mountains to restore power. So yes, it's incremental, but it's not as big as what's being written. It's very, very small incremental gains there on the storm. So yes, and when we look at it going forward, you'll see those things show up. And I do think our renewable business is strong. The electric, like the T&D there continues to be good and that's kind of where it sits today.\nSteven Fisher: Okay, just maybe a follow up on the underground. Separate from the storm impact. Were there any new challenges arising or is this just a continuation of kind of the same issues as before and what's it going to take on the U.S. Gas operations to get those delayed projects ramping up? Is that sort of just, rate case decisions that we're waiting for?\nDuke Austin: I think when you look at it, the underground side of the business, they're building electric, they're building telecom, they're building renewables. The budgets certainly were impacted early. We talked about last quarter where if you're a utility and you could build underground electric or gas, a lot of the gas budgets went to, not a lot, but enough to cause impacts on our LDC business to move from gas to electric. And so we moved our crews along with that. We moved our crews into telecom and you can see it show up in those segments. But yes, it did impact the LDC business as well as the industrial business with the storms, the push out there, more impacts. So we had those. We run it as a portfolio as we talked about before and I think go forward. If we look at the portfolio into 2025, you get guidance in 2025, we talk about guidance in 2025, you'll see double digit guidance at the EPS level. 15% certainly is in the realm of possibility and beyond into next year and we're willing to say it, I just said it into next year. So the concern may be short term, but we see long term growth, multi, I mean a decade's worth of growth here. And that's how we're running the business in this portfolio.\nSteven Fisher: Makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin Smith with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nJulien Dumoulin Smith: Hey, good morning team. Thank you guys very much. Appreciate the opportunity. Look, how do you guys think about the emerging dearth of workforce driving a tighter backdrop here for the business? I mean it's a pretty interesting backdrop for you all, you've been persistent in enabling a pipeline of labor training as a company. How do you\u2026\nOperator: Julian, we lost you. Hello, Mr. Dumoulin. Smith, are you still there?\nDuke Austin: That's okay, I'll answer the question. Yes, okay. So the workforce, look, we have invested in it. I do think as we stand today, we made substantial investments there early eight, nine years ago with both colleges and curriculum. It's well known. The crowd skilled labor as we stand today, we went from 53, 54 to begin the year. We're at 62,000 today. So that work, that 62,000, some of it's organic, some of it's acquired through Cupertino and others. But we continue to invest in curriculum. We see opportunities to look at craft skills that are getting performed along our segments and invest. And we'll continue to do that. We need to make sure that for us that's the core of the business is that craft and 85% of that self performed craft that we're supplementing across the country and all the service lines that we perform continue to grow. We've got to invest in that. We knew it early. We were working with our partners, our unions and trade associations across the country to make sure that that investment for a trained, safe, dependable workforce is there. And we'll continue that as we go forward, Julien.\nJulien Dumoulin Smith: Excellent. Can you guys hear me now?\nDuke Austin: Yes, got you.\nJulien Dumoulin Smith: Sorry, I don't know what happened there. Just how does that impact your top line inflation when you think about the business trajectory and what you're seeing right now? I mean it seems like the overall sector is seeing this trend. How does that impact your potential for margin expansion and overall just top line inflation at the same time to run with that?\nDuke Austin: Good question. Certainly we passed through the. We believe labor goes up about between 4% to 6% as we move forward, let\u2019s 3% to 5%, probably 4% to 6% now. And those are passed through to contractually through. If it's not contractually, then we have it in our multiyear bids. But a 4 to 6 inflationary piece of labor, it's been there a long time. So that's always been a pass through or we've adjusted our portfolio and bids for those labor impacts. On the data center business, on the inside electric piece of the business, it's certainly constrained more than our outside business. So we're also putting in training, we're also doing a lot of things with Cupertino acquisition and that platform to enhance that labor force. And so I think you'll continue to see us anything we do that involves craft skill, will be curriculum, we'll have college credits with that. We'll have a lot of different things where we're trying to enhance the workforces to build for the future.\nJulien Dumoulin Smith: Thank you guys.\nDuke Austin: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gus Richard with Northland Capital. Please proceed with your question.\nGus Richard: Yes, thanks for taking the question. Electricity demand is exceeding supply growth and delivery growth. And is there some point in time where demand overwhelms supply and their shortages and what's the near term, next two or three year solution? Clearly SMR is not the answer and I was just wondering if you had any thoughts on that.\nDuke Austin: I mean you're going to have to see batteries become longer duration, more batteries for the intermittency of renewables. Solar continues to get built, it's economical, Wind will be there, but gas has got to back it. You see all the gas generation that's coming online, anticipated to come online. I think better, better said that's there as well. But we've always thought gas would be 20% of the business generation fleet and I still believe that's the case. Even at double growth you'll still keep it up there just to keep the, keep the intermittency of the grid and to make sure that you can have that. The reserve margins, if you go across the country used to have a pretty nice reserve margin across the country. I believe most of that is replenished substantially and you can't, you can't run the grid on the edge. So you've got to get the generation in and get it in quick to get those reserves back up on anticipated demand and that or you can't build. So one of the two teams, you're either going to constrain the grid, constrain the keys because you can't build generation or you build generation. So I do believe gas is probably the most immediate thing that you'll see get built along with solar and wind as you see it today. But gas will certainly supplement more so than we've seen in the past.\nGus Richard: Got it. That makes complete sense. And that feeds into the next question. Given the hurricanes and fires, whatnot, are you seeing an increase in demand for hardening services, or are the utilities starting to allocate more resources and are you seeing that benefit?\nDuke Austin: Yes, I mean I think the grid hardening programs, both fire and storms are certainly there. We see it across the board where you have multi-year type programs against fire or grid hardening per se. So yes, I mean we see it quite a bit, continue it's early stages in many areas, but in other areas, Florida being one, you're in late stages or later stages. I won't say late stages, but mid to 3/4 into something in most areas. So a lot of people started with transmission hardening, and you're starting in distribution hardening and undergrounding in certain areas. So I think your early stages of this and you'll continue to see violent weather impacts and demands from the client to have them up quicker. The only way you can get things up faster is you've got to harden the grid or underground it, one of the two. So that pressure against the grids that are 50, 70 years old, you've got to do. You've got to modernize the grid. And you're doing all this while demand is doubling. So it is something that everyone's looking at from a standpoint of what do you do first? And you've got to harden the grid while you meet demand. So it is something that is unique to the industry these days.\nGus Richard: Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nChad Dillard: Hey, good morning, guys.\nDuke Austin: Morning.\nChad Dillard: So my question's on the MSA renewal process. And I know that this is an ongoing process for you guys year in, year out, but just curious how much of the business is up for renewal over the next 12 months. And then, I think these contracts are three to four years in duration. So I'd love to get a sense for just like how those conversations and how the contracts have changed versus three to four years ago. From a terms perspective, if you can talk pricing, anything like that would be very helpful.\nDuke Austin: Yes, I mean, MSAs are really framework for unseen work in many ways, and it allows contractual terms to be done and resources to be allocated. I would say as it stands today, it's much more collaborative because you can see the business longer, so can our clients. When you can see capital out and plan and prepare, it's certainly more efficient and more prudent to get out in front of it. So, have the labor there, the labor shortages don't show up if you talk long-term. So I think they're longer in nature. They're bigger as we see it. I can't tell you how many are up. We have, I don't know, hundreds, maybe thousands of MSAs, maybe 10,000. I don't know a lot of MSAs that go around. We've worked off of them for 50 years. So it's very, very difficult for me to. I mean one client could have 50 MSAs. So it's just, it's extremely difficult for me to give you those numbers. But what I would say is the base business is 85% today and that's those MSAs typically around that for the most part. And as we see it going forward, it will be 85% as the business grows on the top line, you will still see it at 85%. So as the business has grown because the MSAs and our ability to bid or negotiate or collaborate with the client to continue that, the stickiness of that and supplement their current workforces is there and will continue to be there going forward.\nChad Dillard: That's helpful. Second question is on Cupertino and labor availability. So I'd love to get a better sense for how you plan to integrate that segment with your labor training program. Just trying to figure out just how much labor that can unlock over the next couple of years and how fast you can scale the business and if you can, just how much in terms of headcount is Cupertino.\nDuke Austin: Yes. I think Cupertino, when you look at the workforce and how it's trained, I mean they've had very good training programs, 3, 4 year training programs, I believe. So very, very good. When we look at it, can we supplement it? Yes. I think what we can do is early on, our recruiting process is the way we get people into the trade some people can't climb some people don't want to climb, so we can move people over into that segment. And it's just -- it will be synergistic for us as well. Some won't when one of down the ground, they want to client. So both sides of that continue, we're always around the edges of each other. Craft is very similar. The way they think -- the way we think the company sits on top of us nicely and so when you look at that, it just -- it bodes well for us to recruit very, very, what I consider the top talent out there. They were with premier solution provider for the data center business for a long period of time since inception, they have capabilities across the board beyond data centers that we like a lot both, solar land, it's a different labor pool, but they're exceptional in what they do. So we're excited about supplementing the curriculum, supplementing onboarding, the what I would consider pre-apprenticeship programs that we have, where people are smarter and faster and more productive when they get in. So all those things will certainly benefit both us and Cupertino going forward. The count -- it's between 4,000 and 6,000 somewhere in there. It varies depending on where they are.\nChad Dillard: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Drew Chamberlain with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nDrew Chamberlain: Yes, good morning and thank you for taking the questions. The first one on the renewable side, some positive commentary in the materials on that bidding activity and what you're hearing from your customers. But obviously, bookings throughout the first part of the year, our first three quarters been a little lighter than last year. And just kind of to hear your thoughts on maybe what's holding up some of this from converting into backlog and maybe what are some of the headwinds and stuff that you're hearing from your customers maybe on the election, IRA and when this can really convert?\nDuke Austin: I mean I expect us to -- between now and the next time we get on the call, a substantial amount of LNTP going into the contract. The negotiations are robust, and I'm not sure -- I can't put a finger on why the -- why -- the backlog is not increase over there based on what the conversations are. It's just tend to paper in many ways and from LNTP to final FID. So I'm not concerned, the inbounds are as good as they've ever been in the negotiation, verbal\u2019s all the things that we're discussing on the Renewables segment. I feel confident that going into next year, the backlog will grow and it will look different. The next time we have this discussion. So -- that piece of the business is not concerned with on the backlog side of it. So we see the market continuing to progress forward the solar business, the wind business, either the repower business, batteries are growing our fastest-growing piece. But we like it all. We see it it's coming our way. And I think the election, yes, I could have a little bit of a delay, but the feedback we're getting from the client is either a Harris or Trump when you're going to have some noise in one or the other, but the business itself and the underlying business continues forward, and I believe our customers would say the same thing.\nDrew Chamberlain: Okay. Great. And then just on the data side, you updated the updated the market forecast that you used in the deck calling for a 23% CAGR versus I think it was a 15% prior Kind of just what's changed quarter-over-quarter? Have conversations started to look materially different? And do you think that this higher growth rate is indicative of what your business is going to do and what your internal expectations are over the course of the decade.\nJayshree Desai: Yes. Just as a reminder, those are third-party reports that we're putting in there. And I think what it does is just reflects the continuing optimism of how much data center growth is out there as well as the power needs for enabling that data center growth. That's really what we were trying to show in that graph. But from our customer standpoint, I can have Duke tell about that.\nDuke Austin: Yes. I mean I think that the graphs are certainly indicative of what we see in the business. And when you think about the growth and what we've done yes, some of it is inorganic, but you also need to look at if we've done it consistently over the last 7, 8 years, we'll continue to do that going forward. And I do think the growth of the business at the midpoint staying under two of leverage, you can see it going forward. And it's basically the strategy to the company that put us in a data center business that put us in the renewable business going forward. And when you think about the nexus of it, it all comes together and the need for power at a data center is substantial, can we be a solution to all the things. Yes, are we in the middle of the discussions on all things data, yes, are we in the middle of the discussion offering power? Yes. So it allows us a unique position to help and collaborate with multi-customers. And I just think it's from east to west. And it's a lot of opportunities and the company is pretty excited about what we can do with the growth platform that we built in the TAM that's around a addressable markets are much bigger than they were yesterday. So I like where we sit, and I like our customer base.\nDrew Chamberlain: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Brophy with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Brophy: Thanks good morning, everybody. I wanted to ask one on cash flow. So implied free cash flow conversion versus EBITDA for this year is now about 60% excluding that Canadian transmission collection, which is obviously a little bit higher than some of your longer-term targets that are out there. Is there anything in free cash flow this year, is this more onetime in nature? Or is this a good way to think about core free cash flow conversion going forward? Thanks.\nJayshree Desai: Yes. I think we are very pleased with where we sit with our free cash flow. We have -- it's a reflection of several things. One, of course, is the mix of work, the renewable business and the way those contracts are structured, continue to be very working capital accretive. And so you're seeing the benefit of that in our free cash flow guide. We are doing better at our collections. Our DSO is improving. So those things are all factored into our free cash flow guide for the year. I will say going forward, we've said our expectations -- the right way to look at it is around a 45% to 55% conversion rate. With Cupertino now, we do believe we have opportunities to be on the high end of that range and even greater as we've seen this year, but it really depends on the mix of work. And so we have a big storm like we had this year -- this quarter -- last quarter, that can be a drag on free cash flow depending on the mix of the MSA work and how that comes into play, that can also be a drag on working capital. So I think the right way to look at it, Brian, is to continue to be in that 45% to 55% range with very good opportunities to be in the high end of that range.\nDuke Austin: The impact of Canada is certainly in the numbers. We don't expect to collect that this year. So that is certainly pressing on the number. That said, -- we did get some of the money in. We like the way the negotiations are going. Nothing wrong. We were highly confident in the claim. We're highly confident in what we've done from a construction statement, which has taken longer to get end of paper in Canada to receive our money. And so I do believe you'll see it in next year. We're not going to press the business to tell you exactly when because I think it's more important to get the right answer for what we deserve and what we've done. And so there's a client. So we're just working with them to get the collections. But nothing wrong with the collection, it's taken a little longer.\nBrian Brophy: Appreciate the answer. I have a follow up. I will pass it on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Good morning everyone.\nJayshree Desai: Hello.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Duke, I know one of the questions you get occasionally is that as some -- ramps down in 2026 given the size of the project that it would be tough to see. We all know there's so much more to Quanta and just large electrical transmission projects. But how do you see that environment? Do you see sort of a new wave of large projects that could come out in 2025 and 2026 or how do you think about that?\nDuke Austin: I mean we see multi projects and whether they're $1 billion or $2 billion or $500 million they're there. We're probably in a -- I will say it again, the inbound and the negotiations of variables to what you build discussions are substantial. And I was somewhere the other day and I was listening to -- I can't -- one of the bigger manufacturers seem to talk to you one of them, I can't remember which one of was, talking about transformers and they said, hey, we can get there by 2030. If we said that today on the work that we did, we'll get you by 2030. I would just tell you like it's not -- that's not in our DNA. And that demand is the same for us. The demand for larger projects that are out there has never been greater. And we see it to the west, to the east, you can look at MISO, you can look at SPP. You can look at ERCOT, you can go to 765 build. You can look at anything you want developers this pick something and pick a geography within the country and see if you don't see large transmission, there's just as big as projects. If you add them together or you take one, you take three, we're not concerned with our ability to look at large construction. I do believe you'll see the stacking effect of the business going forward. And we see it in 2026. We see it in 2027, we see it in 2028, going high. We see the same thing they see.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: So to that point, Duke, I mean, there's always going to be a little bit of noise, but at the Investor Day that you had a couple of years ago, I mean, you talked about sort of this upside case of 15% plus EPS growth that would get you with capital deployment to $11 to $12 in 2026. I'm sure you don't want to give us guidance 2026. But at the same time, does it feel like you're absolutely tracking to that upside case given what you guys have done with Cupertino and Blattner and then the markets themselves.\nDuke Austin: I mean I said just a minute ago, next year, if we grow double-digit EPS, if it's 15%, we certainly have the opportunity for 15%, and beyond. We've grown 20% this year at the midpoint deploying capital. So we see our ability to deploy capital continues. We believe will be in some part of the range will be in double digits in '25. So if it's in 25 and we're going to grow the bottom 10% that gets you to $11.26 if you just do the math. And look, that's easy to say. It comes out real quick. But we've got to get and deliver and execute on it, which I don't think we're a story about tomorrow. We're doing it today. And I think we'll do it in 2025, I think we'll do in 2026. We certainly have the opportunity in the markets are there.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Appreciate the color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Dudas: Hi, Jayshree, Duke and Kip. How are you doing?\nJayshree Desai: Hi.\nMichael Dudas: Maybe following on allocation and capital. Given the extraordinary demand and the excitement that's within vendors serving the electric utility and development industry. When you're talking to the various companies that you look to maybe bring on board in the next couple of years to solidify your long-term plans? Or the industry going to need -- if it seems like there's going to be a lot more scale and consolidation needed and our potential sellers of their businesses looking towards that to kind of get to the next level of their growth and that provides opportunities for you guys to kind of get into the areas to maybe even especially maybe on the front-end engineering kind of work because it seems like the customer base is wanting a lot more of that from you given the collaboration you've been talking about?\nDuke Austin: I mean, certainly, the front side of the business, as we call it, the engineering, the permitting, all those things are a big part of the business, and we need to look at those things to add to our strategies, and that's been known for a long time. We're disciplined about how we acquire and we'll grow it organically, we'll grow it somehow some way. If we have to partner, if we can acquire, we'll acquire we're not going to acquire any cost. We've said that before. We are disciplined to it, and we'll stay disciplined to it. So we see that -- we see long term -- if you look at the transformer business we acquired, it's a 100-year-old business, a family business. It wasn't for so. And I think when you think about it, people are -- they want these big long-term businesses, they want stability in their companies. They want to perpetuate the name. They see what we do. They see how we take care of people. They see the culture that we have here, and we're very selective. And when we look at it, I mean, Cupertino is a great example of a multi-decade relationship that generationally, we can provide great things for their people, great things for the management team, great things for the family. And they keep the culture that they've had yesterday and the name is still on the truck today and it will be in a decade from now. So I think that's the key to it is us continue to create the culture that we have here. People generationally, I'm not sure why craft and the perpetuation when you get down, a lot of people that have businesses that are large in nature that provide craft-skills, their kids want to go build -- they want to go build apartments and real estate or other things, they don't really like the businesses that their families have or they're not interested in at craft and things like that, which is fine, is great. So they want -- they're looking for stability for the people. And I think that's the key for us is to find those businesses and attract them and continue to execute on the culture that is here and protected and move forward with it, while we're creating what I would consider great returns for our investors and stakeholders.\nMichael Dudas: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sangita Jain with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nSangita Jain: Yes, thank you guys for taking my questions. So Duke, did DOE just recently signed on to become an anchor tenant on a handful of transmission projects. Can you tell us what you think that means? Does that bring them to the front of the line? And are you already talking to some of them?\nDuke Austin: Yes. I mean we talked to the DOE. We talked to the people that are anchor tenants quite a bit. You still have got permitting and you still have -- some of them have transformed, some of them don't. I do think it helps, but -- in reality, our utilities or IOUs that are sitting right there, if it's not an IOU, which some of them are, it's -- I'll just say it's -- it has inherent risk and more difficult. It's not that it won't happen. It's just harder. And I do think the projects that you see to the DOE back are good. I mean they're great projects, and we're all around them. And we like that anchor tenant. That's it's a great concept. I think when you look at Texas, with the Texas fund and the things that are happening there same thing, but a lot of the states and the permitting in the states and the PUCs and things like that, it's really about a rate payer discussion. Are we putting pressure on rates at the rate payer level? And when you look at it, T&D is not the biggest piece of the rate. And so we've got to do a better job of how we discuss that to the rate payers because gas interest, a lot of different things are way more impactful than building T&D infrastructure. Actually, T&D infrastructure makes the rates go down through congestion and things like that in those cases. So I think all those things that you have to look at, if you can prove those things out, the projects go much faster.\nSangita Jain: Got it. So that's very helpful. And on that, can I also follow up with the recent transformer acquisition that you announced? And if that is a different type of transformer versus the PTT or I honestly anything that you can tell us on that acquisition would be great.\nDuke Austin: Long discussions in the transformer acquisition on the one we just made as well as PTT. So we've been in discussion since pretty covers on the transformer business. We like the business. It's supplemental. It's a little smaller than the class, the bigger class transformer that can be made in PTT, not to say but the utilities they serve, the clients they serve in the areas are certainly there. We can cross sell. We can sell internally. We're out in the 2027, 2028 even into 2029 with these factories. And so we just -- we've got to watch it. We got to understand the market and serve our internal customers as well. And we're in a very, very small percentage of manufacturing. And I think for us, it's really a backstop against if you get tariffs in China or in other places, transformers become difficult and we have U.S. based long-term transformers here. And it will allow us to move our current workforce and projects forward. And we're really derisking the business against those things as well as collaborating with the clients on U.S. based manufacturing. And that's the key for us is to continue down the path and critical path items that we believe are risk to the supply team.\nSangita Jain: Got it. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Marc Bianchi with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nMarc Bianchi: Hi, thanks. I guess this is a little bit of a follow-up to the prior question. There's been some concern expressed by renewable developers around labor and supply chain challenges being a bottleneck to their growth. I know you just talked about the Transformer thing a little bit, talked about labor earlier, but I think that was maybe more around kind of the T&D side of the business. But could you talk about what you're seeing on the ground, like right now as it relates to some of these supply chain concerns. Is there anything that's maybe incrementally worse or better than it was last quarter?\nDuke Austin: I mean you have to get into HVDC certain kinds of HVDC, especially DC construction in your large stations to get like a real bad, but besides that, I mean, a transformer is certainly constrained. Breakers are certainly constrained. But we've been able to -- we have a good robust we see it. So I think the things that we've done in our supply chain, we can help and enhance developers certainly, our partners and the ones we collaborate with, for sure, new projects forward. It's certainly something that the company has been able to do and collaborate with on clients. So we like our positioning there. I don't think it's gotten any worse. It hasn't gotten any better though. You would think it would get better, it hasn't. And so it's just kind of stayed the same. Labor -- from our standpoint, I wish that manufacturing would get out of our capacity. I don't believe I'll see it in my lifetime. But we've been able to outpace any kind of permitting bill, any kind of constraint. So if someone says come and build thousand miles of 500 KV tomorrow, I will tell you, if they said it 3 times over 5,000 miles answer yes and yes and yes already.\nMarc Bianchi: Got it. Thanks, Duke. That\u2019s all I have.\nDuke Austin: Thank you.\nOperator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.\nDuke Austin: Yes. First of all, I'm going to thank 60,0000 [ph] men and women out in the field and the inclement weather and what they've done is natural disasters. I would tell you they are first responders, they've seen a lot the respect that they deserve is certainly something that we see every day, and I want to thank they had done and held the job and they're the best in the business. And I want to thank you all for participating in the conference call. We appreciate your questions and your ongoing interest in Quanta Services. Thank you. This concludes our call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Duke Austin",
            "content": "Thanks Kip. Good morning everyone and welcome to the Quanta Services third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Before I turn to our third quarter results, I would like to comment on Quanta's response to Hurricanes Beryl and Helene. During the third quarter, we deployed significant resources to assist power restoration and related efforts in Texas for Hurricane Beryl and in the Southeast for Hurricane Helene. During these events, our employees often do more than work to get the power restored, but it's not well known are the other ways that our crews who are first responders, help people in need during these devastating events. For example, in response to Hurricane Helene, Quanta crews worked with local sheriffs, law enforcement groups and various humanitarian organizations to leverage our helicopter assets to deliver more than 200,000 pounds of cargo to impacted rural and mountain communities in North Carolina, including water, food, medical and camping supplies, pet food, hay for livestock, and more. Our pilots also aided search and rescue efforts, provided reconnaissance and roadway assessments, and performed welfare checks. These severe weather events also often impact the lives and property of Quanta employees, many of whom are away from their families for long periods, restoring power to others. Quanta Cares, our employee relief fund, provided financial support to approximately 125 employees and their families who were impacted by these damaging storms. I want to recognize and thank the thousands of Quanta employees who work tirelessly to restore power and much more for people in need during these severe weather events. Quanta delivered another quarter of double-digit growth in revenues, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share, as well as a number of other record financial metrics including total backlog of $34 billion and free cash flow of $539 million. There is momentum building across our portfolio of solutions with the increased demand for and tightening of power generation capacity and the significant power grid upgrades and enhancements required to facilitate load growth. Our collaborative solution based approach is valued by our clients more than ever. Quanta sits at the nexus of the utility, renewable energy and technology industries, and the convergence of these industries is gaining pace. Utilities across the United States are experiencing and forecasting meaningful increases in power demand for the first time in two decades, which is being driven by the adoption of new technologies and related infrastructure including artificial intelligence and data centers, as well as federal and state policies designed to accelerate the energy transition and policies intended to strategically reinforce domestic manufacturing and supply chain resources. The necessity to build and modernize infrastructure is clear, and we believe Quanta's craft, skilled labor, workforce and self-performed capabilities are critical to advancing our infrastructure solutions. To that end, the integration of Cupertino Electric is progressing well and while it is early, we have received positive customer response to our comprehensive critical path electric infrastructure solutions for the technology and data center industry that provides opportunity to improve speed to market for projects. In summary, we are executing well on our strategic plan and while there are areas for improvement, we are pleased with where we sit. We are pacing well against our multiyear financial targets including double digit EPS growth and double digit returns. We ended the quarter with record backlog. We expect adjusted EPS to grow approximately 20% at the midpoint of our guidance over last year. We expect record levels of free cash flow this year, a leverage profile below two times by year-end and over $3 billion of liquidity. Our end markets have never been better and we see opportunity for further strength in the coming years. As I hope you can tell, we are proud of our execution and even more excited about the solutions platform we have built for the future. We are positioning Quanta for decades of expected necessary infrastructure investment and believe our service line diversity creates platforms for growth that expand our total addressable market. Our portfolio approach and focus on craft skill labor is a strategic advantage that we believe provides us the ability to manage risk and shift resources across service lines and geographies which is increasingly important as the energy transition and new technologies add complexity to infrastructure programs. We believe our service offering diversity, supply chain capabilities and portfolio approach have improved our cash flow and returns profile and position us well to allocate resources to the opportunities we find most economically attractive and achieve operating efficiencies and consistent financial results. I will now turn the call over to Jayshree Desai Quanta's CFO to provide a few remarks about our about our 2024 guidance results, about 2021 results and guidance and then we will take your questions. Jayshree? Yes, thank you. We did acquire some a small transformer manufacturing company in upstate New York in the quarter a hundred year old family business. When we were going through the markets we did some things that would allow us to make this acquisition certainly beneficial to PTII and the markets that we serve. We continue to see constraints on large transformers. The factory certainly helps us with that. Our backlog in the business has gotten longer, not shorter. We continue to see opportunities internally and find synergies with the ability to build both transformers and breakers as we move forward. So the supply chain constraints are there. They're real. We're trying to do things in the lower 48 with the load that we see and so I think we'll continue to see ourselves get in a good position to make sure that we can have self-performed capabilities both from a manufacturing standpoint as well as to build and the craft skill labor on certain critical path items. So the synergies are there. We're seeing them show up. You can support the business internally. We build probably around 150 to 170 EPC subs a year. So we can support that, but that's not what we bought them for. We really believe it's to enhance the whole market and we would not do that internally just to supplement some of our bills that provide synergies to some clients. Yes, I mean, I think everyone's hearing the market demand from load and in order for load to work, we need the transmission infrastructure. I would say that the inbounds, the bids, the proposals that we have, things in contract, things that we're talking about record levels year-over-year, record levels in the 25, record levels in the 26, record levels in the 27. We continue to see more bid opportunities, more discussions on larger transmission capacity constraints. So yes, I mean, we said it on the call. We've never seen the business any better and we continue to believe that large transmission is the cheapest form of generation in many ways. So you can't do the things that we're trying to do and accomplish in the country without transmission and we need to expedite it. Hey Jamie. I'll speak and I'll let Jayshree comment on some of the questions there in a minute. So when we see it, when we look at it, the renewables and margins, they were good. We did say that we could get them up in double-digits. I believe we can over time. We've done it and I wouldn't run it. You have seasonality in the business, so your first half will be a little bit slower and you'll pick it up in the back half. Whenever transmission business is in there today that business has always ran in double-digits. The platinum business has ran at double digits. So we consistently said we can do that. I believe that's possible going out as we move forward. The Cupertino business certainly has provided synergies to us already. We continue to get inbounds on Cupertino. I think it's from our standpoint, something that will allow us a different customer base, allows us to participate much in a much greater way in the data center business as we see it. So the electrification thereof and it really, we haven't got the synergies like baked into anything at this point, but they're there. Much like Blattner, they're there and we're seeing those show up in our business today. We'll see Cupertino show up in our business in 2025, 2026 and beyond. And we're pretty excited about next year and what we see. But it's not a next year story. We're delivering. We've delivered for the past five years. We continue to deliver. It's -- next year will just be better than this year. Jayshree? Yes, thanks Steve. I think when you, when you think about it, there was some backlog growth around 400 million or so in the, in, in the quarter. With the way the segmentation, delineation of the segmentation, the segments create some issues for us. When you think about just T&D, our traditional T&D business, it certainly if you look at where we're at, it's 5% into the third quarter of growth organically. It's double digit growth in the forecast at the midpoint of the range. So we have double-digit growth year-over-year at the traditional T&D business at the midpoint of the range. And we stated that going forward we believe we grow that upper single digits on a go forward basis organically. Yes, I mean I think it's, you hear a lot about it. You're starting to see utilities issue equity, you're starting to see debt come in and a lot of that's the transmission growth so their RTOs are robust in the planning stages. The thing is, if it's showing up three years from now, we better start today. And so I think we are seeing those discussions today from RTOs, from developers, from all of our customers. You have to start the transmission, the transformers three years out, you're 36 months away from energization and you need some time to build the substations. So I just, I think it's a fallacy to think that you can't, you have to start building transmission now. And the worst thing that we can do as an industry is sit here. So I don't think that sitting here works. I think everyone's moving forward. It took a little while to get this going. It took a little while to make sure that the rates are not punitive to the rate payers and we have good rate structures across the country. You're starting to see those show up. So I'm pretty excited about where we're at as an industry, where we're what I would consider moving forward against a big, doubling of maybe tripling of generation over the next two decades. So all the transmission build and substation build behind that substantial and it has to get started. And I think we're in, the early, very early stages of getting that started today. Yes, thanks Alex. I think when you see it, you'll see us build a substation interconnections. I don't see us at SMRS in any capacity. I think they're a decade away to any kind of scale. So yes, nuclear will be a piece of it going forward. They'll still be back heavily renewables. Even your big reactors, you're talking about a gig and on the bigger plant. So the smaller ones are certainly less and you'll see a lot of that to from a standpoint of emergency generation, things of that nature versus diesel. But I think it's an answer, it helps. Nuclear is something that's, long-term. You're going to need it to come in if we're going to grow the generation like we say we are. So yes, but I think for us as we sit here today, the way we see it is we'll be around the edges on the substations and all the electrification thereof. Anytime you have EPC, you create risk, you have different kinds of risk. We stay to our knitting. I mean I think we have a really good EPC program here where we're engineering, procuring product and constructing the linear part or craft skill. Labor is usually where people break down and that's what we've invested in. We self-perform 85% of the business. So I think the self-perform capabilities of Quanta de risk our business and we stay to that knitting and we know the costs when we go into them and having our own supply chains and our critical path items that we've done in the vertical supply chain really de risk the project. And if there's risk in it, then there's more margin in it. And so I like the risk profiles that we have because we can create margin out of them. So we're in good shape. And I think you'll continue to see that type of environment going forward due to the fact that there's just not enough talent around and you're going to see EPC get built for certainty across the country. Sure. Thanks, Steve. Yes, we talked about the delineations of the segments and we do have crude movement across both segments. So you do get some of those things that show up in the way that the reports come out when we look at it. Yes, the storms are about 200 million incremental. You do with any kind of storms. For one thing, the company, at six and six plus six and a half billion in revenue in a quarter. It just, it's not that big of an impact to the company and maybe to others. It's not to us. And it does pull back off our industrial business and the gas space during barrel. You have a lot of push out in our industrial business due to the fact that the storms came in. So you're seeing that show up in that margin profile in our industrial business. So you have a lot of turnarounds that pushed due to storms. So the impacts across the company and portfolio, you can't see those things show up in these storm numbers. So there is an impact. We're pulling off transmission, we're pulling off some renewable projects that are larger. We're flying people in from Canada to save human life more importantly. And I think that's the struggle is to get everyone to see it's more than just a storm. We're also pulling off major, major projects to go do this. And it's necessary for the industry for us to do this. We had well over 5,000 people and continue in the mountains to restore power. So yes, it's incremental, but it's not as big as what's being written. It's very, very small incremental gains there on the storm. So yes, and when we look at it going forward, you'll see those things show up. And I do think our renewable business is strong. The electric, like the T&D there continues to be good and that's kind of where it sits today. I think when you look at it, the underground side of the business, they're building electric, they're building telecom, they're building renewables. The budgets certainly were impacted early. We talked about last quarter where if you're a utility and you could build underground electric or gas, a lot of the gas budgets went to, not a lot, but enough to cause impacts on our LDC business to move from gas to electric. And so we moved our crews along with that. We moved our crews into telecom and you can see it show up in those segments. But yes, it did impact the LDC business as well as the industrial business with the storms, the push out there, more impacts. So we had those. We run it as a portfolio as we talked about before and I think go forward. If we look at the portfolio into 2025, you get guidance in 2025, we talk about guidance in 2025, you'll see double digit guidance at the EPS level. 15% certainly is in the realm of possibility and beyond into next year and we're willing to say it, I just said it into next year. So the concern may be short term, but we see long term growth, multi, I mean a decade's worth of growth here. And that's how we're running the business in this portfolio. That's okay, I'll answer the question. Yes, okay. So the workforce, look, we have invested in it. I do think as we stand today, we made substantial investments there early eight, nine years ago with both colleges and curriculum. It's well known. The crowd skilled labor as we stand today, we went from 53, 54 to begin the year. We're at 62,000 today. So that work, that 62,000, some of it's organic, some of it's acquired through Cupertino and others. But we continue to invest in curriculum. We see opportunities to look at craft skills that are getting performed along our segments and invest. And we'll continue to do that. We need to make sure that for us that's the core of the business is that craft and 85% of that self performed craft that we're supplementing across the country and all the service lines that we perform continue to grow. We've got to invest in that. We knew it early. We were working with our partners, our unions and trade associations across the country to make sure that that investment for a trained, safe, dependable workforce is there. And we'll continue that as we go forward, Julien. Yes, got you. Good question. Certainly we passed through the. We believe labor goes up about between 4% to 6% as we move forward, let's 3% to 5%, probably 4% to 6% now. And those are passed through to contractually through. If it's not contractually, then we have it in our multiyear bids. But a 4 to 6 inflationary piece of labor, it's been there a long time. So that's always been a pass through or we've adjusted our portfolio and bids for those labor impacts. On the data center business, on the inside electric piece of the business, it's certainly constrained more than our outside business. So we're also putting in training, we're also doing a lot of things with Cupertino acquisition and that platform to enhance that labor force. And so I think you'll continue to see us anything we do that involves craft skill, will be curriculum, we'll have college credits with that. We'll have a lot of different things where we're trying to enhance the workforces to build for the future. Sure. I mean you're going to have to see batteries become longer duration, more batteries for the intermittency of renewables. Solar continues to get built, it's economical, Wind will be there, but gas has got to back it. You see all the gas generation that's coming online, anticipated to come online. I think better, better said that's there as well. But we've always thought gas would be 20% of the business generation fleet and I still believe that's the case. Even at double growth you'll still keep it up there just to keep the, keep the intermittency of the grid and to make sure that you can have that. The reserve margins, if you go across the country used to have a pretty nice reserve margin across the country. I believe most of that is replenished substantially and you can't, you can't run the grid on the edge. So you've got to get the generation in and get it in quick to get those reserves back up on anticipated demand and that or you can't build. So one of the two teams, you're either going to constrain the grid, constrain the keys because you can't build generation or you build generation. So I do believe gas is probably the most immediate thing that you'll see get built along with solar and wind as you see it today. But gas will certainly supplement more so than we've seen in the past. Yes, I mean I think the grid hardening programs, both fire and storms are certainly there. We see it across the board where you have multi-year type programs against fire or grid hardening per se. So yes, I mean we see it quite a bit, continue it's early stages in many areas, but in other areas, Florida being one, you're in late stages or later stages. I won't say late stages, but mid to 3/4 into something in most areas. So a lot of people started with transmission hardening, and you're starting in distribution hardening and undergrounding in certain areas. So I think your early stages of this and you'll continue to see violent weather impacts and demands from the client to have them up quicker. The only way you can get things up faster is you've got to harden the grid or underground it, one of the two. So that pressure against the grids that are 50, 70 years old, you've got to do. You've got to modernize the grid. And you're doing all this while demand is doubling. So it is something that everyone's looking at from a standpoint of what do you do first? And you've got to harden the grid while you meet demand. So it is something that is unique to the industry these days. Morning. Yes, I mean, MSAs are really framework for unseen work in many ways, and it allows contractual terms to be done and resources to be allocated. I would say as it stands today, it's much more collaborative because you can see the business longer, so can our clients. When you can see capital out and plan and prepare, it's certainly more efficient and more prudent to get out in front of it. So, have the labor there, the labor shortages don't show up if you talk long-term. So I think they're longer in nature. They're bigger as we see it. I can't tell you how many are up. We have, I don't know, hundreds, maybe thousands of MSAs, maybe 10,000. I don't know a lot of MSAs that go around. We've worked off of them for 50 years. So it's very, very difficult for me to. I mean one client could have 50 MSAs. So it's just, it's extremely difficult for me to give you those numbers. But what I would say is the base business is 85% today and that's those MSAs typically around that for the most part. And as we see it going forward, it will be 85% as the business grows on the top line, you will still see it at 85%. So as the business has grown because the MSAs and our ability to bid or negotiate or collaborate with the client to continue that, the stickiness of that and supplement their current workforces is there and will continue to be there going forward. Yes. I think Cupertino, when you look at the workforce and how it's trained, I mean they've had very good training programs, 3, 4 year training programs, I believe. So very, very good. When we look at it, can we supplement it? Yes. I think what we can do is early on, our recruiting process is the way we get people into the trade some people can't climb some people don't want to climb, so we can move people over into that segment. And it's just -- it will be synergistic for us as well. Some won't when one of down the ground, they want to client. So both sides of that continue, we're always around the edges of each other. Craft is very similar. The way they think -- the way we think the company sits on top of us nicely and so when you look at that, it just -- it bodes well for us to recruit very, very, what I consider the top talent out there. They were with premier solution provider for the data center business for a long period of time since inception, they have capabilities across the board beyond data centers that we like a lot both, solar land, it's a different labor pool, but they're exceptional in what they do. So we're excited about supplementing the curriculum, supplementing onboarding, the what I would consider pre-apprenticeship programs that we have, where people are smarter and faster and more productive when they get in. So all those things will certainly benefit both us and Cupertino going forward. The count -- it's between 4,000 and 6,000 somewhere in there. It varies depending on where they are. I mean I expect us to -- between now and the next time we get on the call, a substantial amount of LNTP going into the contract. The negotiations are robust, and I'm not sure -- I can't put a finger on why the -- why -- the backlog is not increase over there based on what the conversations are. It's just tend to paper in many ways and from LNTP to final FID. So I'm not concerned, the inbounds are as good as they've ever been in the negotiation, verbal's all the things that we're discussing on the Renewables segment. I feel confident that going into next year, the backlog will grow and it will look different. The next time we have this discussion. So -- that piece of the business is not concerned with on the backlog side of it. So we see the market continuing to progress forward the solar business, the wind business, either the repower business, batteries are growing our fastest-growing piece. But we like it all. We see it it's coming our way. And I think the election, yes, I could have a little bit of a delay, but the feedback we're getting from the client is either a Harris or Trump when you're going to have some noise in one or the other, but the business itself and the underlying business continues forward, and I believe our customers would say the same thing. Yes. I mean I think that the graphs are certainly indicative of what we see in the business. And when you think about the growth and what we've done yes, some of it is inorganic, but you also need to look at if we've done it consistently over the last 7, 8 years, we'll continue to do that going forward. And I do think the growth of the business at the midpoint staying under two of leverage, you can see it going forward. And it's basically the strategy to the company that put us in a data center business that put us in the renewable business going forward. And when you think about the nexus of it, it all comes together and the need for power at a data center is substantial, can we be a solution to all the things. Yes, are we in the middle of the discussions on all things data, yes, are we in the middle of the discussion offering power? Yes. So it allows us a unique position to help and collaborate with multi-customers. And I just think it's from east to west. And it's a lot of opportunities and the company is pretty excited about what we can do with the growth platform that we built in the TAM that's around a addressable markets are much bigger than they were yesterday. So I like where we sit, and I like our customer base. The impact of Canada is certainly in the numbers. We don't expect to collect that this year. So that is certainly pressing on the number. That said, -- we did get some of the money in. We like the way the negotiations are going. Nothing wrong. We were highly confident in the claim. We're highly confident in what we've done from a construction statement, which has taken longer to get end of paper in Canada to receive our money. And so I do believe you'll see it in next year. We're not going to press the business to tell you exactly when because I think it's more important to get the right answer for what we deserve and what we've done. And so there's a client. So we're just working with them to get the collections. But nothing wrong with the collection, it's taken a little longer. I mean we see multi projects and whether they're $1 billion or $2 billion or $500 million they're there. We're probably in a -- I will say it again, the inbound and the negotiations of variables to what you build discussions are substantial. And I was somewhere the other day and I was listening to -- I can't -- one of the bigger manufacturers seem to talk to you one of them, I can't remember which one of was, talking about transformers and they said, hey, we can get there by 2030. If we said that today on the work that we did, we'll get you by 2030. I would just tell you like it's not -- that's not in our DNA. And that demand is the same for us. The demand for larger projects that are out there has never been greater. And we see it to the west, to the east, you can look at MISO, you can look at SPP. You can look at ERCOT, you can go to 765 build. You can look at anything you want developers this pick something and pick a geography within the country and see if you don't see large transmission, there's just as big as projects. If you add them together or you take one, you take three, we're not concerned with our ability to look at large construction. I do believe you'll see the stacking effect of the business going forward. And we see it in 2026. We see it in 2027, we see it in 2028, going high. We see the same thing they see. I mean I said just a minute ago, next year, if we grow double-digit EPS, if it's 15%, we certainly have the opportunity for 15%, and beyond. We've grown 20% this year at the midpoint deploying capital. So we see our ability to deploy capital continues. We believe will be in some part of the range will be in double digits in '25. So if it's in 25 and we're going to grow the bottom 10% that gets you to $11.26 if you just do the math. And look, that's easy to say. It comes out real quick. But we've got to get and deliver and execute on it, which I don't think we're a story about tomorrow. We're doing it today. And I think we'll do it in 2025, I think we'll do in 2026. We certainly have the opportunity in the markets are there. I mean, certainly, the front side of the business, as we call it, the engineering, the permitting, all those things are a big part of the business, and we need to look at those things to add to our strategies, and that's been known for a long time. We're disciplined about how we acquire and we'll grow it organically, we'll grow it somehow some way. If we have to partner, if we can acquire, we'll acquire we're not going to acquire any cost. We've said that before. We are disciplined to it, and we'll stay disciplined to it. So we see that -- we see long term -- if you look at the transformer business we acquired, it's a 100-year-old business, a family business. It wasn't for so. And I think when you think about it, people are -- they want these big long-term businesses, they want stability in their companies. They want to perpetuate the name. They see what we do. They see how we take care of people. They see the culture that we have here, and we're very selective. And when we look at it, I mean, Cupertino is a great example of a multi-decade relationship that generationally, we can provide great things for their people, great things for the management team, great things for the family. And they keep the culture that they've had yesterday and the name is still on the truck today and it will be in a decade from now. So I think that's the key to it is us continue to create the culture that we have here. People generationally, I'm not sure why craft and the perpetuation when you get down, a lot of people that have businesses that are large in nature that provide craft-skills, their kids want to go build -- they want to go build apartments and real estate or other things, they don't really like the businesses that their families have or they're not interested in at craft and things like that, which is fine, is great. So they want -- they're looking for stability for the people. And I think that's the key for us is to find those businesses and attract them and continue to execute on the culture that is here and protected and move forward with it, while we're creating what I would consider great returns for our investors and stakeholders. Yes. I mean we talked to the DOE. We talked to the people that are anchor tenants quite a bit. You still have got permitting and you still have -- some of them have transformed, some of them don't. I do think it helps, but -- in reality, our utilities or IOUs that are sitting right there, if it's not an IOU, which some of them are, it's -- I'll just say it's -- it has inherent risk and more difficult. It's not that it won't happen. It's just harder. And I do think the projects that you see to the DOE back are good. I mean they're great projects, and we're all around them. And we like that anchor tenant. That's it's a great concept. I think when you look at Texas, with the Texas fund and the things that are happening there same thing, but a lot of the states and the permitting in the states and the PUCs and things like that, it's really about a rate payer discussion. Are we putting pressure on rates at the rate payer level? And when you look at it, T&D is not the biggest piece of the rate. And so we've got to do a better job of how we discuss that to the rate payers because gas interest, a lot of different things are way more impactful than building T&D infrastructure. Actually, T&D infrastructure makes the rates go down through congestion and things like that in those cases. So I think all those things that you have to look at, if you can prove those things out, the projects go much faster. Long discussions in the transformer acquisition on the one we just made as well as PTT. So we've been in discussion since pretty covers on the transformer business. We like the business. It's supplemental. It's a little smaller than the class, the bigger class transformer that can be made in PTT, not to say but the utilities they serve, the clients they serve in the areas are certainly there. We can cross sell. We can sell internally. We're out in the 2027, 2028 even into 2029 with these factories. And so we just -- we've got to watch it. We got to understand the market and serve our internal customers as well. And we're in a very, very small percentage of manufacturing. And I think for us, it's really a backstop against if you get tariffs in China or in other places, transformers become difficult and we have U.S. based long-term transformers here. And it will allow us to move our current workforce and projects forward. And we're really derisking the business against those things as well as collaborating with the clients on U.S. based manufacturing. And that's the key for us is to continue down the path and critical path items that we believe are risk to the supply team. I mean you have to get into HVDC certain kinds of HVDC, especially DC construction in your large stations to get like a real bad, but besides that, I mean, a transformer is certainly constrained. Breakers are certainly constrained. But we've been able to -- we have a good robust we see it. So I think the things that we've done in our supply chain, we can help and enhance developers certainly, our partners and the ones we collaborate with, for sure, new projects forward. It's certainly something that the company has been able to do and collaborate with on clients. So we like our positioning there. I don't think it's gotten any worse. It hasn't gotten any better though. You would think it would get better, it hasn't. And so it's just kind of stayed the same. Labor -- from our standpoint, I wish that manufacturing would get out of our capacity. I don't believe I'll see it in my lifetime. But we've been able to outpace any kind of permitting bill, any kind of constraint. So if someone says come and build thousand miles of 500 KV tomorrow, I will tell you, if they said it 3 times over 5,000 miles answer yes and yes and yes already. Thank you. Yes. First of all, I'm going to thank 60,0000 [ph] men and women out in the field and the inclement weather and what they've done is natural disasters. I would tell you they are first responders, they've seen a lot the respect that they deserve is certainly something that we see every day, and I want to thank they had done and held the job and they're the best in the business. And I want to thank you all for participating in the conference call. We appreciate your questions and your ongoing interest in Quanta Services. Thank you. This concludes our call."

            "content": "Thanks, Duke and good morning everyone. This morning we reported third quarter revenues of $6.5 billion, net income attributable to common stock of $293.2 million or $1.95 per diluted share and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.72. Adjusted EBITDA was $682.8 million or 10.5% of revenues. Additionally, we generated healthy cash flows in the third quarter with cash flow from operations of $739.9 million and free cash flow of $539.5 million. During the quarter we also successfully recapitalized the business following our acquisition of Cupertino, allowing us to address the maturity of our senior notes that were due in October. Our earnings and cash flow performance coupled with this recapitalization allowed us to end the third quarter with ample liquidity and a balance sheet that supports both our organic growth expectations and the opportunistic investment of capital to generate incremental returns for our stockholders. This morning we also provided an update to our full year 2024 financial expectations, which calls for another year of profitable growth with record revenues and opportunity for double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDA, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow. We believe our expectations demonstrate the strength of our portfolio approach to the business, our commitment to our long-term strategy, favorable end market trends and our competitive position in the marketplace. Additional details and commentary about our 2024 financial guidance can be found in our Operational and Financial Commentary and Outlook Expectation Summary, both of which are posted on our IR website. With that, we are happy to answer your questions. Operator? Yes. You covered it. Yes. Just remind you, Jamie, of the cadence of the renewable segment. So as Duke said, back half is definitely usually stronger than the first half. So going into next year, I think the right way to look at it is what we said in Investor Day, that we have the opportunity to perform that 9% to 10% range in renewable. In 2024 guide? Yes. If you recall, we told you that Cupertino has the ability to perform in that $1 billion to $1.1 billion range in revenue. They're performing at the high end of that range. Yes. Just as a reminder, those are third-party reports that we're putting in there. And I think what it does is just reflects the continuing optimism of how much data center growth is out there as well as the power needs for enabling that data center growth. That's really what we were trying to show in that graph. But from our customer standpoint, I can have Duke tell about that. Yes. I think we are very pleased with where we sit with our free cash flow. We have -- it's a reflection of several things. One, of course, is the mix of work, the renewable business and the way those contracts are structured, continue to be very working capital accretive. And so you're seeing the benefit of that in our free cash flow guide. We are doing better at our collections. Our DSO is improving. So those things are all factored into our free cash flow guide for the year. I will say going forward, we've said our expectations -- the right way to look at it is around a 45% to 55% conversion rate. With Cupertino now, we do believe we have opportunities to be on the high end of that range and even greater as we've seen this year, but it really depends on the mix of work. And so we have a big storm like we had this year -- this quarter -- last quarter, that can be a drag on free cash flow depending on the mix of the MSA work and how that comes into play, that can also be a drag on working capital. So I think the right way to look at it, Brian, is to continue to be in that 45% to 55% range with very good opportunities to be in the high end of that range. Hello. Hi."

With that, I would like to now turn the call over to Duke Austin, Quanta's President and CEO. Duke?\nDuke Austin: Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Quanta's first half of the year is off to a good start. Our second quarter results highlighted by another quarter of double-digit growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted earnings per share, a record total backlog of $31.3 billion, and strong cash flow. We believe our results reflect the power of our portfolio, sound execution, and continued demand for our services, driven by our customers' multiyear programs to build the renewable generation and power grid infrastructure necessary to support North America's energy transition, load growth security, and reliability. We recently completed the acquisition of Cupertino Electric or CEI, which provides a platform of new service lines and a dynamic customer base, which includes technology companies driving load growth and demand for renewable energy. CEI brings an exceptional management team and a premier craft-skilled workforce that complements Quanta's culture and will create a comprehensive self-performed electric infrastructure solution offering for renewable developers, utilities, and large power consumers from electron generation to transmission to consumption. Utilities across the United States are experiencing and forecasting meaningful increases in power demand for the first time in many years, driven by the adoption of new technologies and related infrastructure, including artificial intelligence and data centers, as well as federal and state policies designed to accelerate the energy transition and policies intended to strategically reinforce the domestic manufacturing and supply-chain resources. There is momentum building across our portfolio of solutions with the complexities of the energy transition, its impact on the power grid, and the significant upgrades and enhancements required to facilitate load growth, our collaborative solution-based approach is valued by our clients more than ever. We continue to look forward to the realization of our multiyear strategic initiatives and the goals we expect to achieve in the coming years. We are positioning Quanta for decades of expected necessary infrastructure investment and believe our service line diversity creates platforms for growth that expand our total addressable market. Our portfolio approach and focus on craft skill labor is strategic. Advance -- is a strategic advantage that we believe provides us the ability to manage risk and shift resources across service lines and geographies, which is increasingly important as the energy transition and new technology add complexity to infrastructure programs. We believe our diversity and portfolio approach has also improved our cash-flow and returns profile and positions us well to allocate resources to the opportunities we find the most economically attractive and to achieve operational efficiencies and consistent financial results. I will now turn the call over to Jayshree Desai, Quanta's CFO, to provide a few remarks about our results and 2024 guidance and then we'll take our questions. Jayshree?\nJayshree Desai: Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported second quarter revenues of $5.6 billion, net income attributable to common stock of $188.2 million or $1.26 per diluted share, and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.90. Adjusted EBITDA was $523.2 million or 9.4% of revenues. We generated healthy cash flows in the second quarter with cash flow from operations of $391.3 million and free cash flow of $258.6 million. This earnings and cash-flow performance allowed us to end the second quarter with ample liquidity and a balance sheet that supports both our organic growth expectations and the opportunistic deployment of capital to generate incremental returns for our stockholders. To that end, and as Duke commented, subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we completed the acquisition of CEI for upfront consideration of approximately $1.5 billion, excluding cash acquired and subject to customary adjustments. We funded $1.3 billion of the transaction with a combination of cash-on-hand, borrowings under our existing commercial paper program, and a new short-term loan facility, and we are currently evaluating debt refinancing options. This morning, we also provided an update to our full-year 2024 financial expectations, which calls for another year of profitable growth with record revenues and opportunity for double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDA, adjusted earnings per share, and free cash flow. Of note, our increased guidance for revenues, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted earnings per share was attributable to the expected contribution from CEI, but otherwise, our prior guidance for these financial metrics remain unchanged. We believe our expectations demonstrate the strength of our portfolio approach to the business, our commitment to our long-term strategy, favorable end-market trends, and our competitive position in the marketplace. Additional details and commentary about our 2024 financial guidance can be found in our operational and financial commentary and outlook expectation summary, both of which are posted on our IR website. With that, we are happy to answer your questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Justin Hauke with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nJustin Hauke: Oh, great. Thank you very much. Good morning, everybody. I guess I wanted to start with just kind of a question of maybe the moving pieces, positives and negatives within kind of the organic outlook. I mean, you said you're back here to unchanged. I guess it seems like some of your peers would may say that some of the base kind of low voltage, I don't know if you want to call it more like retail market demand, maybe in your Underground business too is a little bit weaker, some pressure with the utilities offsetting and storm was pretty good here and I guess you had Hurricane Beryl obviously locally to you first couple of weeks of this month. I guess, can you just give us a little bit of the lay of the land of maybe what's moving a little bit stronger and what's a little bit weaker overall getting you back to the same place for your outlook for the year?\nDuke Austin: Yes. Thanks, Justin. I think we've said all along that we run a portfolio and we look at it as a portfolio. So the portfolio is performing as expected and I expect it to continue. When we think through just the pushes and pulls that for the most part, the business is performing well better than what we anticipated in many cases. But I do think you see some delineation between segments where you can have a segment that's a little off here or there. I would point out that our UIs, when we forecasted the outlook on it, certainly there's mix and shift of work there. Utilities, when you think about their CapEx budgets as they look at their own budgets, especially ones that have gas and electric, many of them are ahead of their leak replacements or don't have the capital there. So they need the capital over into an underground distribution, transmission, whatever it may be, and it offsets into another segment for us. So that shift of work there, there's larger projects that move back and forth. We like the Underground business. It's healthy. It will continue. We will certainly take a conservative approach to how we look at that segment, starts and stops on our large-diameter pipe, things of that nature. We've always said, we guide to $500 million, and we don't need it to make it. So I stand by that. We don't need it to make the midpoint of the range. The midpoint of the range is $860 million and it's also 15% organic growth at the midpoint of EPS. So I'll say that again, 15% organic growth at the midpoint.\nJustin Hauke: Okay, great. Thanks. And then I guess maybe the second one is for Jayshree. So on the -- the renewables margins were really strong here in the quarter, but you mentioned there was still the drag from the handful of projects that you called out in the first quarter. I think in the Q last quarter that the hit from those was about $22 million. Do you have a similar number for 2Q, just so we can kind of have an understanding of what the margins would have been kind of excluding that drag?\nJayshree Desai: Yes. We had a little bit of a drag continue from one of those projects into the second. You'll see in the Q, it's around $20 million, but the overall segment performed very well better than we expected, overcame those challenges from the projects you mentioned in the first quarter. So we're pleased at where that segment is heading.\nDuke Austin: Yes. And I'll add, we're performing really well there. There was the 95% or 99.9% of the projects that performed above what we thought as well. We just don't get to point those out.\nJustin Hauke: Yes. No, the margins were strong. So it sounds like $20 million was still kind of the same source of pressure in the segment. So, okay, great.\nDuke Austin: We've stated three projects. It's the same and there was some drag in the segment, some drag on it. But as you clear out, you can see they performed in kind of double-digit ranges on the way out.\nJayshree Desai: Yes. Going forward, that's baked into our expectations. That's what you're seeing with the back-half strength, and we feel like we've got the execution on those things under control and we're confident in our back-half expectations on renewable.\nJustin Hauke: Great. Okay. Thank you. Thank you for taking my questions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sangita Jain with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nSangita Jain: Yes, thanks. Good morning for taking my questions. So, Duke, if I can go back to the earlier question, early this year, you had talked about a shift between transmission and distribution spending. And so far, we are seeing that utility CapEx budgets are under 50% for the first half. So can you help us understand what you're seeing now for the second half if we should see a ramp back in that distribution spend or are you still seeing kind of like air pockets there?\nDuke Austin: Yes. I mean, I think when you look at our transmission distribution as a service line and not as a segment, we're up 9% for the year. So we haven't seen too much of a drag, whether it be T or D, we're able to shift from one to the other. So you get some segmentation delineation as we said last time, they were up 9% if you just look at the work itself. So that said, yes, there's movements around utilities and whether they're at T or D, we have great deal of EV penetration out West. And so you're seeing some distribution spend there come into the budgets because of the penetration. And like we've said before, 70% of EV sales are in California in the States. And so that's pushing. I will say that you can see the push on the distribution system, and it validates what we've been saying as that push, I can't tell you the pace of it. If it slows down, certainly it will slow down. But nevertheless, as it pushes through, it certainly impacts our distribution systems as you're seeing in California, where the load is substantial, there's a rebuild ongoing out there and I think that will continue as you push into EV. So it doesn't -- you have storm hardening in areas, which are coming into play. We're strengthening. Certainly, in the back half, you can see it in the numbers, and we like where we sit and we're able to -- the portfolio has allowed us to go through the transition. There is ups and downs with different utilities, regulatory impacts, things of that nature. We're ahead of those things. We know what's coming. So the company has done a really nice job of putting ourselves in great positions to take advantage of our portfolio as we move through the year.\nSangita Jain: Great. That's very helpful. Thanks. And if maybe this one is for Jayshree. On the renewables book-to-bill in the quarter, how much do you think was a result of SunZia burning at high rates? And how much was it an actual lag in booking renewables maybe?\nJayshree Desai: Yes, for sure, the SunZia burn has an impact on that burn, but we are booking work. In fact, as we pointed out, we're booking additional work past the quarter. But we are held to a higher comp because of that SunZia impact from last year, no doubt about it. But work is coming. We still feel very good about the year, and we continue to book work in that segment.\nDuke Austin: Yes.\nSangita Jain: Great. Thank you so much.\nDuke Austin: I would add that the top line is one thing, but I also think that there's margin accretion in this segment as well that will certainly look differently in next year as we operate better through and execute better through this work. And I'm not concerned at this point around the top as well, right? We see growth. We see growth in '25, right? SunZia will be there in '25, and we've always said you'll have some stacking effect along the way as you CAGR the growth and multi-year outlook, we've talked about it over and over and over again that you will stack on top of your base. Your base grows nicely. We stack some larger projects on top. That stacking effect is certainly there and will continue.\nSangita Jain: Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Brophy with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Brophy: Yes, thanks. Good morning, everybody. Just wanted to stick with renewable energy here. Obviously, there's some trade uncertainty out there, election uncertainty out there. Are you guys seeing any impact from this from customers? Are customers pulling back away at all as we await some clarity? Just curious what you're hearing and seeing there? Thanks.\nDuke Austin: A couple of things on that on the renewable side. I think you have a technology sector that is certainly backstopping most everything when you consider elections and the way the budgets are and from our standpoint, technology continues to want renewable generation and they're driving whether it be chips or data centers or hyperscalers or whatever, they're driving the renewable business behind the what you would consider policy from road switching. So that drive will continue to as far as I'm concerned, the Republican or Democratic has done well in both. We've been pretty agnostic to what parties in power. And that drive in the backstop of technology is what's driving the load growth, which continues. And whether it's renewables or gas-fired generation to back it, all those things play in certainly into where we're at and the cheapest of generation is transmission, the country still needs a significant amount of transmission to facilitate any kind of fuel switching or load growth.\nBrian Brophy: That's helpful. Thanks. And then I just want to ask about TS Conductor. Can you talk about details on that investment? What was the rationale there? And just broadly, how are you thinking about opportunities in the manufacturing space? This is now the second deal you guys have done with the manufacturer here in the last year. Thanks.\nDuke Austin: Yes, what you have is small investment there, alignment really to understand kind of where we're at. And we like the technology. We think it's helpful when you're talking about, we do a lot of energized reconductoring or reconductoring in these corridors and being a part of that solution, great customer-base in there that's invested as well. So we invested alongside our customers as well and we like the technology, we know a lot about it, we have worked many years to one conductor. So we think it's a good technology. It has some solutions across the board and is certainly something we want to be a part of.\nBrian Brophy: Appreciate it. I'll pass it on. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Truist. Please proceed with your question.\nJamie Cook: Hi, good morning. My first question just on underground and utility. I think in the quarter, you mentioned a mix issue. If you could elaborate on that. And I think you lowered your margin target. Just why? And I'm wondering how stronghold this performing given some -- you're hearing industrial weakness in other parts of the industrial landscape? And then my second question, Duke, it is for you just strategically. You've had some pretty good success recently with M&A and some of the questions I get from investors are, is it going to be harder for Quanta to continue to grow organically just because of the law large number starts to work against them. And with your success in acquisitions, I'm just wondering going forward should we expect greater balance or even potentially more growth or the portfolio driven by M&A versus organic growth if the mix shifts more to M&A versus organic growth for those reasons? Thank you.\nDuke Austin: Thanks, Jamie. I'll go to the UI segment. The industrial business performed great. I think we set records there. I continue to believe that it will going forward. So we like the business. We invested in Evergreen. We like that business as well. So early in the year, we continue to see good margins. It stabilizes a lot of the fluctuations in it. We did have some shift in business, some larger work that you can't predict when those things start, we never like to. So I would just say some of it just pushed our -- from my standpoint, I'm unwilling to put it in the forecast. It may come back in, but we're going to be prudent about how we look at it and we are facing an election year and things of that nature. So we're going to be prudent about how we guide. I didn't like the way it looked and so we made some decisions on the UI segment. And then we had some MSA movement within the distribution business, LDC business where you had some consolidated utilities move the capital from LDC into underground electric or storm hardening or whatever it may be. So we picked it up on the other side. We also moved those crews to the other side. It shows up in the renewables and electric segment. So most of the resources and things like that will move over. We're not really -- our headcount is 58,000 plus today. So we're -- our headcount is up, and it was just a segment movement as well. So some shift there, some shift and outward work on bigger projects, but the industrial business we like and it's growing nicely. And we're conservative on guidance there. So M&A, I think you can't predict M&A when we look at it. I will say organically over the past two years, you're growing at least at the EPS line 15% at the midpoint of our guide this year and what we've done last year and probably the year before wouldn't surprise me. I didn't look that far back, but we've been able to grow the business organically and I know a lot of big numbers and I look at them too. And they were big when they -- it was a $1 billion company. They're big when it's five and they're big when it's 20. So we just have to put our heads down and go to work and execute. I'm not worried about what everyone else is doing. Quanta needs to focus on solutions, and we really have a good strategy on M&A. I like what we see. We acquired a great platform that provides them with multi-verticals off of it. So I think we actually put ourselves in a position to have more M&A opportunities. Now whether we do it or not, it just depends, depends on the company. It depends on timing. We're going to be conservative with the balance sheet like we have been leveraging it. But I think you invest in Quanta for a couple of reasons. One, we're going to execute our macro markets, and lastly, how we deploy free cash. And if we deploy free cash the way we have in the past decade, I like our chances going forward.\nJamie Cook: Thank you.\nDuke Austin: Thanks, ma'am.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Dudas: Good morning, Kip, Duke, Jayshree.\nJayshree Desai: Good morning.\nDuke Austin: Good morning.\nMichael Dudas: So maybe update us on the communications business. You highlighted $900 million or so revenue this year. What's the tone of that business? It seems like you're probably targeting more value on the margin side relative to growth. And do you see some visibility as we move out the next couple of years, any trends or client discussions that could give it some improved traction going forward?\nDuke Austin: Yes, we like the business. I mean, I think it's not something that the company certainly has some nice clients, and we continue to invest with them and our resources. The business has always been fairly dynamic and moves quickly and budgets move in and out. And so we're pretty, what I would call, prudent about how we invest in the business. We can grow it or not grow it and it doesn't really impact us too much. So the growth hasn't come from the segment at this point, not to say it won't, we just haven't really pushed on it. I really look at customer bases, whether they're regulated, non-regulated, how much exposure we want to in communications, and how we invest and allocate capital. So as we see that we make adjustments here or there to support our clients. But the business is fine. The RDOF money or whatever, whatever the end clotures these days. They say it's coming, it's coming, it's coming, big spins, big spins. I haven't seen it yet. When it gets there, I'm sure we'll grow.\nMichael Dudas: Got it. That's great. Thanks, Duke.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Rygiel with B. Riley Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nAlex Rygiel: Thank you. Good morning, Duke. A lot of tailwinds here driving your business. Any chance you could rank which ones might have the greatest impact on your business over the next three years?\nDuke Austin: Yes. Alex, I think the customer base -- the technology customer base is what's driving load growth and what really gives me what I believe is something that we can point to that backstops most everything, the amount -- the demand side of that. And no matter how you think about it, if it's even half what we're talking about from a gigawatt standpoint, it's substantial. Substantially more than anyone thought. The capital budgets of our customers continue to rise, whether it be technology, whether it be utility. So that rise is certainly something that we can point to. But I would just say the backstop of technology against all things power or data center, whatever it may be, is there and then you roll it back and go over. Do they have a product to sell? And they absolutely do. I mean I think people are willing to spend money on AI, people willing to spend. So there is a product against the infrastructure that's necessary to be put in place. So I do believe the builds would have necessary to backstop generation and are really being driven by technology. So I'll just point to that at this point for the driver of growth.\nAlex Rygiel: And then with sort of this new big backdrop of technology driving your business, are you going to market and selling a broader portfolio of services in a different way today than maybe you did in the past?\nDuke Austin: Yes. I mean, I think we're more solution-based and trying to understand where the client and trying to have end-to-end solutions and whether it be front side of the business and provide the solution to the client. As clients start moving faster, if you want to go faster, you really need to be inclusive and we have to understand what the bottlenecks are from transformers all the way through it. And so our ability to really take out the bottlenecks to go faster to market is something that the company prides itself on. And I think everyone that we deal with wants to go faster today. Can we do it faster, can we do it faster? So our ability to get it to market quicker and on time and relatively in line with budget is something that people want and we're able to provide that.\nAlex Rygiel: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Fisher: Thanks. Good morning. Just a question on cash-flow related to the Canadian receivables. It sounds like you're still pretty confident in the position that you have there. Maybe if you could just give us a little more color on the timing of collection and thoughts around the guidance raise or the guidance maintaining there against the general guidance raise. And how tied is your deleveraging post CEI to the collection of that Canadian receivables?\nDuke Austin: Yes. So there is -- I'll let Jayshree to give the numbers, but still we're confident in our position. We're starting -- we said it would start to happen in the second half of the year. So part of this is just the way the settlement works and the way we're working through it with the client. I expect it to be in chunks like you've seen today, but look, we're getting closer and closer every day. If it's not by the end of the year, it's very shortly thereafter. So we're making great progress working with the client in a collaborative manner and I see no issue with that receivable. As you can see, some of it's starting to move forward now. So I like where we sit there. I'll let Jayshree comment on the rest.\nJayshree Desai: Yes. I mean, we'll be under 2 times. Our expectation is under 2 times the leverage by the end of the year. And even without for whatever reason, we weren't able to collect, which again, we don't expect that. But to answer your question, we'd still be below 2 times.\nSteven Fisher: Okay, excellent. And then, Duke, just a bigger-picture question to follow up on the M&A. I mean, you've really broadened the capabilities of the company over the last several years. What does service line diversity mean for you going forward? Is it just sort of tweaks from here? Do you think there's still a lot more you can do to kind of diversify the service lines?\nDuke Austin: I think we really understand craft skill and how they think and how we think about it and how we respect that trade. So we have a workforce development, we have training that we've invested a significant amount in across craft. And I truly believe it doesn't matter what craft it is. So if it's inside electric, it gives us a whole new craft skill workforce because the high voltage and low voltage, the transferability between the two is not bail, I mean, you have to be trained on both sides of that. And so you can't move them across a little bit you can, some can but it's not as easy as it sounds. So there is extra training required on both sides of that movement. So I do believe that the voltage workforce gives us the whole new venue there. And then the things that we can do to meet customer demand across that from a craft standpoint are there. We like the front side of our business as we've discussed before, we need to get basically more scale-out of the front side of the business. And so we'll continue to try to either organically grow that or make acquisitions in that side of the business. So we're not afraid to make acquisitions that makes sense. I think we try to be prudent about that and we're patient. We're not. There's nothing imminent ever. We talked to Cupertino probably over seven or eight years and it happens when it happens. And I think we're patient. And I want to make world-class companies and I think we have the very best in the business and graph. So we want to lead the way there and we'll be patient until we see the right kind of opportunities to add to the comprehensive solutions that we already have.\nSteven Fisher: Sounds good. Thank you.\nDuke Austin: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nNeil Mehta: Yes, good morning, Duke and Jayshree. First question is more of a big-picture --\nJayshree Desai: Good morning.\nNeil Mehta: Good morning, Jayshree. Big picture question around the regulatory environment. There is no doubt there is an enormous demand for your services and the need for utility CapEx to upgrade the grid. But as we've seen in some tough regulatory outcomes, including in places like Illinois, sometimes questions about the commitment of the regulator to push those capital increases through. And so I just love your perspective on the regulatory environment and the juxtaposition of the enormous need for the services relative to the constraints from a regulatory perspective.\nDuke Austin: Yes. I think it's a couple of things. I do believe that energy is top of everyone's mind. Affordability is on top of everyone's mind and you're in a political environment. Sitting here in Houston and watching the hurricane and with our own customer, knowing that they did a really nice job getting people in here. And the political outcry on day two of 2.7 million people out with pine trees 100 foot tall, falling across wire all throughout to expect them to have service back in two days and the outcry and what it's done politically is not even close to fair for the money that's spent. If you want that, you want certainty and you want it up in two days, spend $1 trillion, and underground it, you'll fix it. And until you do, no matter what pull you put in and when you put a 100-foot tree across the water, it's coming down. And so I just -- that outcry that we see from a regulatory standpoint, it doesn't match where the country wants to move and it's expensive, it cost money. So that affordability is something that every single customer we have, whether it doesn't matter where you're at. We all face it, we have to help them and we have to be out there and try to be prudent about how we look at cost that's why we're looking at solutions that are different. And we're certainly there to help and try to make this smoother and they depend on us to do so. So I do believe whether it's political, whether you're in a political season. So I mean, it's fun times around. Once we get through that, I think some of this will die down and we can get the country moving in the right direction towards a transition. And if it's not if we don't believe it's EV, if we don't believe it's renewables and the heat will continue and you'll have 114, 115 and we'll need another air-conditioner in every house. So either way, you're going to push load.\nNeil Mehta: Yes. Thanks, Duke. And then the follow-up is Cupertino really built on your data center platform. But as you think about what data center focused opportunities could look like five years from now, how could you envision Quanta really scaling that business and what could success look like to capture the 15% type of growth in CAGR that you alluded to in your slides?\nDuke Austin: Yes, they're a real nice renewable business as well. So I wouldn't discount what they're doing there with batteries and solar. So I do think they're doing a nice job there as well and you can see it show-up in the solar and the guidance. And we like that as well. But the data center piece and onshoring of chips and all those kind of things, factories are right down the wheelhouse where we think Cupertino can grow. They were limited by resources, bonding capacity, things of that nature. I do think our solution base a more comprehensive solution to their client base and balance sheet speed-to-market and our ability to manufacture transformers, just everything that we're trying to accomplish to speed-to-market is something that their client base values. So I like where we sit and we're early. I know there's synergies in the market and we were talking around kind of an 8%. I know it's better. I know we can do better than that. I know they know we can do better than that. So we'll continue to find synergies and I think you'll see the growth not only in the top line but also in the bottom line of the company. Our cash-flow profile looks different. If you look at our returns, they look different. So we continue to push the company in the right spot in the macro markets that we're in, they want solutions. We continue to say we're a solution provider. So here it is.\nNeil Mehta: Thank you, Duke.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nChad Dillard: Hi, good morning, everyone.\nJayshree Desai: Good morning.\nChad Dillard: So a couple of questions for you on the implied second-half guidance. So first on your Electric business. It seems like the second half, there's going to be a pretty significant ramp in revenues half-over-half or year-on-year, even if you factor out the recent acquisition. So I was hoping you could help us bridge that and get comfortable with that. And then secondly, in the renewable business, at least like based on the guide again, like excluding CEI, it looks like growth starts to flatten out as we exit the year. So I just want to get some color on how confident you feel about the reacceleration of that growth in that business.\nJayshree Desai: Yes. Hi, Chad. On the -- let me start with renewables. We -- again we are sitting in a good spot. We feel good about where our customers are headed. As Duke pointed out, we're not seeing any concerns yet from our major customers around election noise, et cetera. I do think, again, the quality of the customer base matters a lot in the renewable market. So we still feel very confident about our end-of-year expectations there. We are, of course, as you know, we tend to be conservative. We want to see the market develop over the next six months. So any sort of perceived pullback is only that. We continue to enter contracts or continue to build projects. We don't see any concern sitting here today. And on the electric side, it is a strong back half, but that is -- Duke touched on it. We're seeing our utility customers continue to want to spend capital. We believe that, that capital has come in. We've got big programs that we've entered into and that will start ramping towards the back half of the year. So all of those things give us confidence in our revenue expectations that we've laid out in our guide for both the electric and renewables segments.\nDuke Austin: Yes, try to stick a little color to you on that. I would say that as we see it, it's difficult to build big solar. But one of the reasons that we felt like we needed to lean into Blattner and give us the very best-in the business was we're concerned with building big solar projects. It's not easy. It looks easy, it's just not. And so I think that is something we have a lot of -- a great deal of confidence in. So does the client base. So the need for renewables to support the tech growth gives you what we believe is visibility for the long haul here and continue. I'm not saying they won't build gas, I'm not saying it will be a new plant there, but you're backstopping renewables and you want redundancy in their system. So if they don't build at day one, they'll build at day two. They're pushing renewables into the system eventually. So I do believe that will continue. We like what we see going forward under any administration. Yes, I think we've taken a prudent approach to guidance and Jayshree is right. I mean, we are starting programs that give us a lot of visibility into the back half on the electric segment as well as the renewable segment. So we feel confident. We just need to execute through here.\nChad Dillard: Great. That's super helpful. And I just wanted to return to a conversation earlier in the call about the shift from our distribution, both electric and gas towards transmission at your utility customers. So I understand that that's what's happening today or like at least for 2024. But like any color you can give from your conversations with your customers about whether you'll see like incremental dollars of capital flowing back to the distribution side of the CapEx equation?\nDuke Austin: I mean it's regional. You have some movements in there. I didn't say our electric business was moving one-way or the other, by the way. Just said, we have the ability to move them around as necessary. I feel like our distribution on the electric side is fine. There is some push in certain regions, but it's growing in others. So I'm not too concerned there. The gas side of the business moving some capital off-gas into electric, where you're caught up in some gas things and nothing releases, things like that. So they're moving over into electric for the year. Just it happens able to move budgets around, we're able to accommodate. So there is some movement, there are always movement though. I'll say always. We're always moving into substations or transmission distribution, it doesn't matter. We're fungible, our skill-sets are fungible, they can move them around. That's part of that solution that we provide to the client and gives it the ultimate what I consider flexibility. And our job is to provide that flexibility to the client and that solution, we can give it to them.\nChad Dillard: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Good morning, everyone.\nJayshree Desai: Hi, Andy.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Duke, you talked about a bit of a low in contracting last quarter as your customers were trying to figure out how to deal with the higher load growth, but you obviously had a nice uptick in electric power backlog this quarter. So did that lull effectively come to an end? And then can you talk about your confidence level about growing backlog from here? Are you starting to see these larger MSA renewables accelerating again?\nDuke Austin: Yes, I think what we saw when I said low, I just think it's you reset a bit in this transition, we'll continue to see that. Now I'm looking at their capital budgets and you're talking about 15 gigs of solar, wind or of the load for that matter. You're going to see some movements across the segments consistently. I do think everyone's maintaining their capital budgets. We continue to point to it. And they're going up because the load is going up. You can't deny the fact that if you're going to add 15 gigs, 10 gigs, seven gigs of generation, load is going up, capital is going up. How you do it, whether it's gas fire, whether it's renewables, it's still moving up. If we build gas fire across the systems, it stabilizes renewables and it actually makes renewables faster and better. So I wouldn't get to -- I mean, you'll see some of those movements across these capital spends move. We just got to be flexible with how we look at it. So I think transmission is something that's extremely important. We saw PGM yesterday on Go Out and you can see the pricing at the capacity market. I just and you can say, okay, it's one-time, but the fact is demand is far outseeing supply. It's 101 economics. And it just is there, it's been there, it's been coming. We need transmission in this country and we got to build it.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Very helpful. And then could you give us a little more color into how your Canadian business deal is doing? I think it's been a drag on you guys for quite a while. I know you expected some improvement in the second-half of this year. I think you had some positive commentary regarding still expecting improvement in Canada in your release, but could you update us on where you are in that geography?\nDuke Austin: I mean, it's certainly getting better. The macro market is getting better. We expect the second half to be increasingly better quarter-over-quarter and into '25 because the market is getting better. Canada is always a particular market it has higher highs and low lows. And so you move along with it, but we were able to move a lot of the resources into the States, still are in the States, helping in supporting some of the growth in the States. And as we see Canada come back, we'll push into Canada more and Australia is a nice business as well. It's been very, very nicely. So we like the business long-term. It's -- we just got to -- we right sized kind of the backside of it and we'll grow off that again and just be cautious about how we look at that on a go-forward basis. But I do think in the next year, we see, we book the work and see where that will allow us and bring the margins up very close to parity with the rest of the segment throughout the year. It's incremental though. It's not all at once.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Appreciate all the color.\nDuke Austin: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. We have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.\nDuke Austin: Yes. So we appreciate the 58,000 plus employees and their dedication to the clients and what they go through every day with the heat and rain and they work 16 hour days, 20 days in a row. And it doesn't go unnoticed, it doesn't go unnoticed from management team and clients will appreciate you. And we'd like to thank all you for participating in the conference call. We appreciate your questions, your ongoing interest in Quanta Services. Thank you. This concludes our call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Duke Austin",
            "content": "Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Quanta's first half of the year is off to a good start. Our second quarter results highlighted by another quarter of double-digit growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted earnings per share, a record total backlog of $31.3 billion, and strong cash flow. We believe our results reflect the power of our portfolio, sound execution, and continued demand for our services, driven by our customers' multiyear programs to build the renewable generation and power grid infrastructure necessary to support North America's energy transition, load growth security, and reliability. We recently completed the acquisition of Cupertino Electric or CEI, which provides a platform of new service lines and a dynamic customer base, which includes technology companies driving load growth and demand for renewable energy. CEI brings an exceptional management team and a premier craft-skilled workforce that complements Quanta's culture and will create a comprehensive self-performed electric infrastructure solution offering for renewable developers, utilities, and large power consumers from electron generation to transmission to consumption. Utilities across the United States are experiencing and forecasting meaningful increases in power demand for the first time in many years, driven by the adoption of new technologies and related infrastructure, including artificial intelligence and data centers, as well as federal and state policies designed to accelerate the energy transition and policies intended to strategically reinforce the domestic manufacturing and supply-chain resources. There is momentum building across our portfolio of solutions with the complexities of the energy transition, its impact on the power grid, and the significant upgrades and enhancements required to facilitate load growth, our collaborative solution-based approach is valued by our clients more than ever. We continue to look forward to the realization of our multiyear strategic initiatives and the goals we expect to achieve in the coming years. We are positioning Quanta for decades of expected necessary infrastructure investment and believe our service line diversity creates platforms for growth that expand our total addressable market. Our portfolio approach and focus on craft skill labor is strategic. Advance -- is a strategic advantage that we believe provides us the ability to manage risk and shift resources across service lines and geographies, which is increasingly important as the energy transition and new technology add complexity to infrastructure programs. We believe our diversity and portfolio approach has also improved our cash-flow and returns profile and positions us well to allocate resources to the opportunities we find the most economically attractive and to achieve operational efficiencies and consistent financial results. I will now turn the call over to Jayshree Desai, Quanta's CFO, to provide a few remarks about our results and 2024 guidance and then we'll take our questions. Jayshree? Yes. Thanks, Justin. I think we've said all along that we run a portfolio and we look at it as a portfolio. So the portfolio is performing as expected and I expect it to continue. When we think through just the pushes and pulls that for the most part, the business is performing well better than what we anticipated in many cases. But I do think you see some delineation between segments where you can have a segment that's a little off here or there. I would point out that our UIs, when we forecasted the outlook on it, certainly there's mix and shift of work there. Utilities, when you think about their CapEx budgets as they look at their own budgets, especially ones that have gas and electric, many of them are ahead of their leak replacements or don't have the capital there. So they need the capital over into an underground distribution, transmission, whatever it may be, and it offsets into another segment for us. So that shift of work there, there's larger projects that move back and forth. We like the Underground business. It's healthy. It will continue. We will certainly take a conservative approach to how we look at that segment, starts and stops on our large-diameter pipe, things of that nature. We've always said, we guide to $500 million, and we don't need it to make it. So I stand by that. We don't need it to make the midpoint of the range. The midpoint of the range is $860 million and it's also 15% organic growth at the midpoint of EPS. So I'll say that again, 15% organic growth at the midpoint. Yes. And I'll add, we're performing really well there. There was the 95% or 99.9% of the projects that performed above what we thought as well. We just don't get to point those out. We've stated three projects. It's the same and there was some drag in the segment, some drag on it. But as you clear out, you can see they performed in kind of double-digit ranges on the way out. Yes. I mean, I think when you look at our transmission distribution as a service line and not as a segment, we're up 9% for the year. So we haven't seen too much of a drag, whether it be T or D, we're able to shift from one to the other. So you get some segmentation delineation as we said last time, they were up 9% if you just look at the work itself. So that said, yes, there's movements around utilities and whether they're at T or D, we have great deal of EV penetration out West. And so you're seeing some distribution spend there come into the budgets because of the penetration. And like we've said before, 70% of EV sales are in California in the States. And so that's pushing. I will say that you can see the push on the distribution system, and it validates what we've been saying as that push, I can't tell you the pace of it. If it slows down, certainly it will slow down. But nevertheless, as it pushes through, it certainly impacts our distribution systems as you're seeing in California, where the load is substantial, there's a rebuild ongoing out there and I think that will continue as you push into EV. So it doesn't -- you have storm hardening in areas, which are coming into play. We're strengthening. Certainly, in the back half, you can see it in the numbers, and we like where we sit and we're able to -- the portfolio has allowed us to go through the transition. There is ups and downs with different utilities, regulatory impacts, things of that nature. We're ahead of those things. We know what's coming. So the company has done a really nice job of putting ourselves in great positions to take advantage of our portfolio as we move through the year. Yes. I would add that the top line is one thing, but I also think that there's margin accretion in this segment as well that will certainly look differently in next year as we operate better through and execute better through this work. And I'm not concerned at this point around the top as well, right? We see growth. We see growth in '25, right? SunZia will be there in '25, and we've always said you'll have some stacking effect along the way as you CAGR the growth and multi-year outlook, we've talked about it over and over and over again that you will stack on top of your base. Your base grows nicely. We stack some larger projects on top. That stacking effect is certainly there and will continue. A couple of things on that on the renewable side. I think you have a technology sector that is certainly backstopping most everything when you consider elections and the way the budgets are and from our standpoint, technology continues to want renewable generation and they're driving whether it be chips or data centers or hyperscalers or whatever, they're driving the renewable business behind the what you would consider policy from road switching. So that drive will continue to as far as I'm concerned, the Republican or Democratic has done well in both. We've been pretty agnostic to what parties in power. And that drive in the backstop of technology is what's driving the load growth, which continues. And whether it's renewables or gas-fired generation to back it, all those things play in certainly into where we're at and the cheapest of generation is transmission, the country still needs a significant amount of transmission to facilitate any kind of fuel switching or load growth. Yes, what you have is small investment there, alignment really to understand kind of where we're at. And we like the technology. We think it's helpful when you're talking about, we do a lot of energized reconductoring or reconductoring in these corridors and being a part of that solution, great customer-base in there that's invested as well. So we invested alongside our customers as well and we like the technology, we know a lot about it, we have worked many years to one conductor. So we think it's a good technology. It has some solutions across the board and is certainly something we want to be a part of. Thanks, Jamie. I'll go to the UI segment. The industrial business performed great. I think we set records there. I continue to believe that it will going forward. So we like the business. We invested in Evergreen. We like that business as well. So early in the year, we continue to see good margins. It stabilizes a lot of the fluctuations in it. We did have some shift in business, some larger work that you can't predict when those things start, we never like to. So I would just say some of it just pushed our -- from my standpoint, I'm unwilling to put it in the forecast. It may come back in, but we're going to be prudent about how we look at it and we are facing an election year and things of that nature. So we're going to be prudent about how we guide. I didn't like the way it looked and so we made some decisions on the UI segment. And then we had some MSA movement within the distribution business, LDC business where you had some consolidated utilities move the capital from LDC into underground electric or storm hardening or whatever it may be. So we picked it up on the other side. We also moved those crews to the other side. It shows up in the renewables and electric segment. So most of the resources and things like that will move over. We're not really -- our headcount is 58,000 plus today. So we're -- our headcount is up, and it was just a segment movement as well. So some shift there, some shift and outward work on bigger projects, but the industrial business we like and it's growing nicely. And we're conservative on guidance there. So M&A, I think you can't predict M&A when we look at it. I will say organically over the past two years, you're growing at least at the EPS line 15% at the midpoint of our guide this year and what we've done last year and probably the year before wouldn't surprise me. I didn't look that far back, but we've been able to grow the business organically and I know a lot of big numbers and I look at them too. And they were big when they -- it was a $1 billion company. They're big when it's five and they're big when it's 20. So we just have to put our heads down and go to work and execute. I'm not worried about what everyone else is doing. Quanta needs to focus on solutions, and we really have a good strategy on M&A. I like what we see. We acquired a great platform that provides them with multi-verticals off of it. So I think we actually put ourselves in a position to have more M&A opportunities. Now whether we do it or not, it just depends, depends on the company. It depends on timing. We're going to be conservative with the balance sheet like we have been leveraging it. But I think you invest in Quanta for a couple of reasons. One, we're going to execute our macro markets, and lastly, how we deploy free cash. And if we deploy free cash the way we have in the past decade, I like our chances going forward. Thanks, ma'am. Good morning. Yes, we like the business. I mean, I think it's not something that the company certainly has some nice clients, and we continue to invest with them and our resources. The business has always been fairly dynamic and moves quickly and budgets move in and out. And so we're pretty, what I would call, prudent about how we invest in the business. We can grow it or not grow it and it doesn't really impact us too much. So the growth hasn't come from the segment at this point, not to say it won't, we just haven't really pushed on it. I really look at customer bases, whether they're regulated, non-regulated, how much exposure we want to in communications, and how we invest and allocate capital. So as we see that we make adjustments here or there to support our clients. But the business is fine. The RDOF money or whatever, whatever the end clotures these days. They say it's coming, it's coming, it's coming, big spins, big spins. I haven't seen it yet. When it gets there, I'm sure we'll grow. Yes. Alex, I think the customer base -- the technology customer base is what's driving load growth and what really gives me what I believe is something that we can point to that backstops most everything, the amount -- the demand side of that. And no matter how you think about it, if it's even half what we're talking about from a gigawatt standpoint, it's substantial. Substantially more than anyone thought. The capital budgets of our customers continue to rise, whether it be technology, whether it be utility. So that rise is certainly something that we can point to. But I would just say the backstop of technology against all things power or data center, whatever it may be, is there and then you roll it back and go over. Do they have a product to sell? And they absolutely do. I mean I think people are willing to spend money on AI, people willing to spend. So there is a product against the infrastructure that's necessary to be put in place. So I do believe the builds would have necessary to backstop generation and are really being driven by technology. So I'll just point to that at this point for the driver of growth. Yes. I mean, I think we're more solution-based and trying to understand where the client and trying to have end-to-end solutions and whether it be front side of the business and provide the solution to the client. As clients start moving faster, if you want to go faster, you really need to be inclusive and we have to understand what the bottlenecks are from transformers all the way through it. And so our ability to really take out the bottlenecks to go faster to market is something that the company prides itself on. And I think everyone that we deal with wants to go faster today. Can we do it faster, can we do it faster? So our ability to get it to market quicker and on time and relatively in line with budget is something that people want and we're able to provide that. Yes. So there is -- I'll let Jayshree to give the numbers, but still we're confident in our position. We're starting -- we said it would start to happen in the second half of the year. So part of this is just the way the settlement works and the way we're working through it with the client. I expect it to be in chunks like you've seen today, but look, we're getting closer and closer every day. If it's not by the end of the year, it's very shortly thereafter. So we're making great progress working with the client in a collaborative manner and I see no issue with that receivable. As you can see, some of it's starting to move forward now. So I like where we sit there. I'll let Jayshree comment on the rest. I think we really understand craft skill and how they think and how we think about it and how we respect that trade. So we have a workforce development, we have training that we've invested a significant amount in across craft. And I truly believe it doesn't matter what craft it is. So if it's inside electric, it gives us a whole new craft skill workforce because the high voltage and low voltage, the transferability between the two is not bail, I mean, you have to be trained on both sides of that. And so you can't move them across a little bit you can, some can but it's not as easy as it sounds. So there is extra training required on both sides of that movement. So I do believe that the voltage workforce gives us the whole new venue there. And then the things that we can do to meet customer demand across that from a craft standpoint are there. We like the front side of our business as we've discussed before, we need to get basically more scale-out of the front side of the business. And so we'll continue to try to either organically grow that or make acquisitions in that side of the business. So we're not afraid to make acquisitions that makes sense. I think we try to be prudent about that and we're patient. We're not. There's nothing imminent ever. We talked to Cupertino probably over seven or eight years and it happens when it happens. And I think we're patient. And I want to make world-class companies and I think we have the very best in the business and graph. So we want to lead the way there and we'll be patient until we see the right kind of opportunities to add to the comprehensive solutions that we already have. Sure. Yes. I think it's a couple of things. I do believe that energy is top of everyone's mind. Affordability is on top of everyone's mind and you're in a political environment. Sitting here in Houston and watching the hurricane and with our own customer, knowing that they did a really nice job getting people in here. And the political outcry on day two of 2.7 million people out with pine trees 100 foot tall, falling across wire all throughout to expect them to have service back in two days and the outcry and what it's done politically is not even close to fair for the money that's spent. If you want that, you want certainty and you want it up in two days, spend $1 trillion, and underground it, you'll fix it. And until you do, no matter what pull you put in and when you put a 100-foot tree across the water, it's coming down. And so I just -- that outcry that we see from a regulatory standpoint, it doesn't match where the country wants to move and it's expensive, it cost money. So that affordability is something that every single customer we have, whether it doesn't matter where you're at. We all face it, we have to help them and we have to be out there and try to be prudent about how we look at cost that's why we're looking at solutions that are different. And we're certainly there to help and try to make this smoother and they depend on us to do so. So I do believe whether it's political, whether you're in a political season. So I mean, it's fun times around. Once we get through that, I think some of this will die down and we can get the country moving in the right direction towards a transition. And if it's not if we don't believe it's EV, if we don't believe it's renewables and the heat will continue and you'll have 114, 115 and we'll need another air-conditioner in every house. So either way, you're going to push load. Yes, they're a real nice renewable business as well. So I wouldn't discount what they're doing there with batteries and solar. So I do think they're doing a nice job there as well and you can see it show-up in the solar and the guidance. And we like that as well. But the data center piece and onshoring of chips and all those kind of things, factories are right down the wheelhouse where we think Cupertino can grow. They were limited by resources, bonding capacity, things of that nature. I do think our solution base a more comprehensive solution to their client base and balance sheet speed-to-market and our ability to manufacture transformers, just everything that we're trying to accomplish to speed-to-market is something that their client base values. So I like where we sit and we're early. I know there's synergies in the market and we were talking around kind of an 8%. I know it's better. I know we can do better than that. I know they know we can do better than that. So we'll continue to find synergies and I think you'll see the growth not only in the top line but also in the bottom line of the company. Our cash-flow profile looks different. If you look at our returns, they look different. So we continue to push the company in the right spot in the macro markets that we're in, they want solutions. We continue to say we're a solution provider. So here it is. Yes, try to stick a little color to you on that. I would say that as we see it, it's difficult to build big solar. But one of the reasons that we felt like we needed to lean into Blattner and give us the very best-in the business was we're concerned with building big solar projects. It's not easy. It looks easy, it's just not. And so I think that is something we have a lot of -- a great deal of confidence in. So does the client base. So the need for renewables to support the tech growth gives you what we believe is visibility for the long haul here and continue. I'm not saying they won't build gas, I'm not saying it will be a new plant there, but you're backstopping renewables and you want redundancy in their system. So if they don't build at day one, they'll build at day two. They're pushing renewables into the system eventually. So I do believe that will continue. We like what we see going forward under any administration. Yes, I think we've taken a prudent approach to guidance and Jayshree is right. I mean, we are starting programs that give us a lot of visibility into the back half on the electric segment as well as the renewable segment. So we feel confident. We just need to execute through here. I mean it's regional. You have some movements in there. I didn't say our electric business was moving one-way or the other, by the way. Just said, we have the ability to move them around as necessary. I feel like our distribution on the electric side is fine. There is some push in certain regions, but it's growing in others. So I'm not too concerned there. The gas side of the business moving some capital off-gas into electric, where you're caught up in some gas things and nothing releases, things like that. So they're moving over into electric for the year. Just it happens able to move budgets around, we're able to accommodate. So there is some movement, there are always movement though. I'll say always. We're always moving into substations or transmission distribution, it doesn't matter. We're fungible, our skill-sets are fungible, they can move them around. That's part of that solution that we provide to the client and gives it the ultimate what I consider flexibility. And our job is to provide that flexibility to the client and that solution, we can give it to them. Yes, I think what we saw when I said low, I just think it's you reset a bit in this transition, we'll continue to see that. Now I'm looking at their capital budgets and you're talking about 15 gigs of solar, wind or of the load for that matter. You're going to see some movements across the segments consistently. I do think everyone's maintaining their capital budgets. We continue to point to it. And they're going up because the load is going up. You can't deny the fact that if you're going to add 15 gigs, 10 gigs, seven gigs of generation, load is going up, capital is going up. How you do it, whether it's gas fire, whether it's renewables, it's still moving up. If we build gas fire across the systems, it stabilizes renewables and it actually makes renewables faster and better. So I wouldn't get to -- I mean, you'll see some of those movements across these capital spends move. We just got to be flexible with how we look at it. So I think transmission is something that's extremely important. We saw PGM yesterday on Go Out and you can see the pricing at the capacity market. I just and you can say, okay, it's one-time, but the fact is demand is far outseeing supply. It's 101 economics. And it just is there, it's been there, it's been coming. We need transmission in this country and we got to build it. I mean, it's certainly getting better. The macro market is getting better. We expect the second half to be increasingly better quarter-over-quarter and into '25 because the market is getting better. Canada is always a particular market it has higher highs and low lows. And so you move along with it, but we were able to move a lot of the resources into the States, still are in the States, helping in supporting some of the growth in the States. And as we see Canada come back, we'll push into Canada more and Australia is a nice business as well. It's been very, very nicely. So we like the business long-term. It's -- we just got to -- we right sized kind of the backside of it and we'll grow off that again and just be cautious about how we look at that on a go-forward basis. But I do think in the next year, we see, we book the work and see where that will allow us and bring the margins up very close to parity with the rest of the segment throughout the year. It's incremental though. It's not all at once. Sure. Yes. So we appreciate the 58,000 plus employees and their dedication to the clients and what they go through every day with the heat and rain and they work 16 hour days, 20 days in a row. And it doesn't go unnoticed, it doesn't go unnoticed from management team and clients will appreciate you. And we'd like to thank all you for participating in the conference call. We appreciate your questions, your ongoing interest in Quanta Services. Thank you. This concludes our call."

            "content": "Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported second quarter revenues of $5.6 billion, net income attributable to common stock of $188.2 million or $1.26 per diluted share, and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.90. Adjusted EBITDA was $523.2 million or 9.4% of revenues. We generated healthy cash flows in the second quarter with cash flow from operations of $391.3 million and free cash flow of $258.6 million. This earnings and cash-flow performance allowed us to end the second quarter with ample liquidity and a balance sheet that supports both our organic growth expectations and the opportunistic deployment of capital to generate incremental returns for our stockholders. To that end, and as Duke commented, subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we completed the acquisition of CEI for upfront consideration of approximately $1.5 billion, excluding cash acquired and subject to customary adjustments. We funded $1.3 billion of the transaction with a combination of cash-on-hand, borrowings under our existing commercial paper program, and a new short-term loan facility, and we are currently evaluating debt refinancing options. This morning, we also provided an update to our full-year 2024 financial expectations, which calls for another year of profitable growth with record revenues and opportunity for double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDA, adjusted earnings per share, and free cash flow. Of note, our increased guidance for revenues, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted earnings per share was attributable to the expected contribution from CEI, but otherwise, our prior guidance for these financial metrics remain unchanged. We believe our expectations demonstrate the strength of our portfolio approach to the business, our commitment to our long-term strategy, favorable end-market trends, and our competitive position in the marketplace. Additional details and commentary about our 2024 financial guidance can be found in our operational and financial commentary and outlook expectation summary, both of which are posted on our IR website. With that, we are happy to answer your questions. Operator? Yes. We had a little bit of a drag continue from one of those projects into the second. You'll see in the Q, it's around $20 million, but the overall segment performed very well better than we expected, overcame those challenges from the projects you mentioned in the first quarter. So we're pleased at where that segment is heading. Yes. Going forward, that's baked into our expectations. That's what you're seeing with the back-half strength, and we feel like we've got the execution on those things under control and we're confident in our back-half expectations on renewable. Yes, for sure, the SunZia burn has an impact on that burn, but we are booking work. In fact, as we pointed out, we're booking additional work past the quarter. But we are held to a higher comp because of that SunZia impact from last year, no doubt about it. But work is coming. We still feel very good about the year, and we continue to book work in that segment. Good morning. Yes. I mean, we'll be under 2 times. Our expectation is under 2 times the leverage by the end of the year. And even without for whatever reason, we weren't able to collect, which again, we don't expect that. But to answer your question, we'd still be below 2 times. Good morning. Good morning. Yes. Hi, Chad. On the -- let me start with renewables. We -- again we are sitting in a good spot. We feel good about where our customers are headed. As Duke pointed out, we're not seeing any concerns yet from our major customers around election noise, et cetera. I do think, again, the quality of the customer base matters a lot in the renewable market. So we still feel very confident about our end-of-year expectations there. We are, of course, as you know, we tend to be conservative. We want to see the market develop over the next six months. So any sort of perceived pullback is only that. We continue to enter contracts or continue to build projects. We don't see any concern sitting here today. And on the electric side, it is a strong back half, but that is -- Duke touched on it. We're seeing our utility customers continue to want to spend capital. We believe that, that capital has come in. We've got big programs that we've entered into and that will start ramping towards the back half of the year. So all of those things give us confidence in our revenue expectations that we've laid out in our guide for both the electric and renewables segments. Hi, Andy."

        "content": "Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Quanta Services First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. \n It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Kip Rupp, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. \nKip Rupp: Thank you and welcome, everyone, to the Quanta Services First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. This morning, we issued a press release announcing our first quarter 2024 results, which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at quantaservices.com. \n As highlighted in our earnings release this morning, we've recently updated our earnings call format and supplemental materials. Shortly after the release of our financial results this morning, we posted our first quarter 2024 operational and financial commentary and our 2024 outlook expectation summary on Quanta's Investor Relations website. While management will make brief introductory remarks during this morning's call, the operational and financial commentary is intended to largely replace management's prepared remarks, allowing additional time for questions from the institutional investment community. \n Additionally, we no longer have a slide presentation to accompany this call as the information that has historically been included in the presentation can now be found in our operational and financial commentary. \n Please remember that information reported on this call speaks only as of today, May 2, 2024. And therefore, you're advised that any time-sensitive information may no longer be accurate as of any replay of this call. \n This call will include forward-looking statements intended to qualify under the safe harbor from liability, established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including all statements reflecting expectations, intentions, assumptions or beliefs about future events or performance or that do not solely relate to historical or current facts. You should not place undue reliance on these statements as they involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or beyond Quanta's control, and actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied. \n We will also present certain historical and forecasted non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and operational and financial commentary. Please refer to these documents for additional information regarding our forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. \n Lastly, if you would like to be notified when Quanta publishes news releases and other information, please sign up for e-mail alerts through the Investor Relations section of quantaservices.com. We also encourage investors and others interested in our company to follow Quanta IR and Quanta Services on the social media channels listed on our website. \n With that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Mr. Duke Austin, Quanta's President and CEO. Duke? \nEarl Austin: Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Quanta Services First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. This morning, we reported our first quarter 2024 results, which included double-digit growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted earnings per share and strong cash flow, demonstrating an overall good start to the year. \n Total backlog at quarter end was $29.9 billion, which we believe reflects the value of our collaborative client relationships and evidences the momentum we see for 2024. Utilities across the United States are experiencing and forecasting meaningful increases in power demand for the first time in many years driven by the adoption of new technologies and related infrastructure, including artificial intelligence and data centers as well as federal and state policies designed to accelerate the energy transition and policies intended to strategically reinforce domestic manufacturing and supply chain resources. \n With the complexities of the power grid and the significant upgrades and enhancements required to facilitate load growth, our collaborative solution-based approach is valued by our clients more than ever. We continue to look forward to the realization of our multiyear strategic initiatives and the goals we expect to achieve in this and the coming years. \n We are positioning Quanta for decades of expected necessary infrastructure investment and believe our service line diversity creates platforms for growth that expand our total addressable market. Our portfolio approach and focus on craft skilled labor is strategic -- a strategic advantage that we believe provides us the ability to manage risk and shift resources across service lines and geographies, which is increasingly important as the energy transition accelerates. \n We believe our diversity and portfolio approach has also improved our cash flow profile and positions us well to allocate resources to the opportunities we find most economically attractive and to achieve operating efficiencies and consistent financial results. \n I will now turn the call over to Jayshree Desai, Quanta's CFO, to provide a few remarks about our results and 2024 guidance. And then we will take your questions. Thanks. Jayshree? \nJayshree Desai: Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported first quarter revenues of $5 billion, net income attributable to common stock of $118.4 million or $0.79 per diluted share and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.41. Adjusted EBITDA was $387.3 million or 7.7% of revenue. Of note, we generated healthy cash flows in the first quarter with cash flow from operations of $238 million and free cash flow of $181.2 million, both setting first quarter records. \n This earnings and cash flow performance allowed us to end the first quarter with ample liquidity and a balance sheet that supports both our organic growth expectations and the opportunistic deployment of capital to generate incremental returns for our stockholders. To that end, year-to-date, we've acquired 4 companies for aggregate consideration of approximately $500 million. \n This morning, we also provided an update to our full year 2024 financial expectations, which calls for another year of profitable growth with record revenues and opportunity for double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDA, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow. We believe our expectation demonstrates the strength of our portfolio approach to the business, our commitment to our long-term strategy, favorable end-market trends and our competitive position in the marketplace. \n Additional details and commentary about our 2024 financial guidance can be found in our operational and financial commentary and outlook expectation summary, both of which are posted on our IR website. \n With that, we are happy to answer your questions. Operator? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. \nJamie Cook: Congrats on the quarter. I guess just 2 questions, one shorter term, one longer term. Jayshree, could you just talk a little bit about the renewable margins? I think they fell a little short relative to expectations. And how -- any color, I guess, behind that? \n And then I guess the second question would be for Duke, just a longer-term question. Obviously, lots of talk throughout the past couple of months on AI, data centers, et cetera. If you could just talk to just because you're so close with -- and how that impacts, I guess, grid load growth. If you could just talk to what you're hearing from your customers in terms of how they're going to approach this, how you think about CapEx trends accelerating. Just any color around how Quanta would be positioned there? \nEarl Austin: Thanks, Jamie. Welcome back. I'll take the margin question. I think from our standpoint, when we look at the segment -- renewables segment, we had some series of projects there that -- a series of work, call it, 5% of the portfolio on the solar/wind side. They just didn't perform, didn't execute to where we should have executed that and what we expect from ourselves and what our customers expect. So yes -- look, it's a small piece. We grew the business, I can make tons of excuses, I am not. We own it. We didn't execute like we should. And the rest of the portfolio really is -- the majority -- the vast majority of the jobs, of the projects, of everything we're doing there is exceeding our expectations. We expect that to continue. \n Growth creates some inefficiencies, and we've showed up. So we got to fix it. And it's not something that -- it's later stage in the projects. And so I'm not concerned. It's just part of it in the first quarter, seasonality and everything else, a little bit of noise shows up. But all in all, I think the segment is performing nicely. \n What we see in the future looks great. The backlog is certainly accelerating in the renewables segment. So we're excited about what we see going forward. We are executing for how many people we put in the field and what we've added to this segment. I feel real good about it. We do invest in growth. It has some inefficiencies as you move forward and showed up. So I think all in all, we like what we see. \n As far as data centers I think the macro demand of electricity is obviously moving up. At any time you have demand, it's great for the business, it's great for our customers. It -- if you go back, you roll it back, call it, 9 months ago, we needed some data center demand, but nothing like we saw show up in January, February, March. It caught me off guard a little bit to see the amount. You're talking one customer is talking 100 gigs. So when you start talking about one customer with 100 gigs, it's just -- it's mind-blowing, in my mind, to think about the amount of electricity necessary and primarily winning renewables. \n So both sides of the business, both T&D and our renewable business, stand to gain quite a bit and our customers as well. But it's not easy from a rate base. It's not easy to deal with those kind of things showing up at your doorstep when you're trying to plan for 30 years and you build out a huge power plant, and it's gone in one day. \n So I think from our -- the planning piece of the business is difficult. It is certainly showing up, it's certainly pressing us, our customers, everyone to plan better and to think longer term. We're trying to put a 4-decade, 3-decade-type build in 90-day windows. It doesn't work. It's a very long-term build here. I think the company is set right in the middle of it. I like where we sit from the ancillary piece of data centers. I like -- we're talking to hyperscalers. We're talking to all of them about how we can help benefit and collaborate with our clients and then to get power sources. And certainly in demand, it's a unique time. It's exciting. We're excited about it. We're excited to work with our clients, and they expect a lot of us. We just -- we need to deliver and execute. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citi. \nAndrew Kaplowitz: Duke or Jayshree, can you give us a little more color into electric power? What happened in the quarter going forward? Revenue was, as you know, down just a little bit, but margin was quite a bit higher than you forecast and I think quite good for a seasonally weak Q1. You didn't change your expectation for the segment for the year, but maybe you could talk about your confidence that distribution-focused revenue does improve in the second half. And does the higher margin Q1 signal potential for margin upside in the segment? \nEarl Austin: Sure. So a little bit, I think this is something we've talked about the portfolio and combining electric power and renewables together, and so I want to go through that a little bit. \n If you look at the electric business, which is transmission, substation and distribution and you look across the segments, so the segments are delineated today, which is causing some -- when you print the numbers, it doesn't look like what the business is from those 3 things. So an electric work type, it's up over 5% in the quarter. That's because pieces of the business is over in renewable segment, and pieces of it are in the electric segment. \n But the business itself together is up 5.3%. So it's just the way the segments look. You've got to combine them. It's got to look like a portfolio. The delineations are causing some number print. It doesn't look like with where the business is at. So I wanted to explain work type, which is electric, substation, distribution and transmission are up 5.3% in the quarter. And our backlog is almost flat. \n Yes, I think the backlog of the business and what we see is timing, there's MSA timing. It's early. It's the first quarter. We fully expect to be at record levels. The bigger projects, the renewal prices are complicated. It takes a long time to negotiate. We're not going to press negotiations against a 90-day print. It just doesn't make sense for us. \n So we'll be patient. We're not concerned. We see an outstanding -- we were just talking about load growth. Any time you got more load, you got more business. It's simple when you think about it. So more demand, more business. We see more demand than we've ever seen. And so I just -- I feel good about it. \n As far as margins, the electric print, we operated great, even a little down. So we've always said that you can operate in double digits. It doesn't matter what the revenue is. That's what we're really trying to drive is the EPS and those margins. So in that -- in the segment, I thought we had a nice -- performed well in this segment. And liked where we're going. I think there is opportunity. We -- it's early. We're not going to change guidance in 90 days. So it looks good. We have lots of opportunity. I would say we have more upside than we do downside on a go-forward basis in the segment. \nAndrew Kaplowitz: Very helpful. And maybe just to follow up on your commentary, last quarter, you mentioned sort of the better visibility around large transmission projects. You just talked about MSAs in answering my question. So just the conviction level in sort of the backlog increase again, I know it doesn't happen in the quarters over the year. But is it more base business you think that grows or larger project business that grows in '24? Is it both? \nEarl Austin: I think the back half of '24, your distribution business starts to become increasingly -- I would say, you'd start booking more work, you start to see your MSAs, your crude counts move up again. There is some shift in the transmission versus distribution in certain areas, the Southeast and places where -- what's happening is you're seeing the data centers show up, you're seeing the demand show up on the transmission side. And you've already got your capital out if your utility customers -- so you have to build the transmission and you're going to pull capital off the distribution systems a bit and move it into the transmission systems. \n It's fine that was -- that's why we're diversified. That's why the company sits where it sits. We're able to be nimble and move. It's not an issue, but it does show up. And your MSA work on the distribution side is softer than normal. And that's -- we talked about that in the fourth quarter where we're working 40, 50 hours versus 70. I think that's still the case. I do believe as you move into the later part of the year, you're going to start seeing us work more -- I'm not inclined to say more 60-, 70-hour weeks. \n And our head count is still almost 54,000, which is up 4,000 year-over-year. I feel highly confident that as EV starts to penetrate to the West, that's moving up already. And the EV kind of moves across, there's -- we've got to build infrastructure. And certainly, we see it showing up in certain areas. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. \nNeil Mehta: I wanted to take a few moments to talk about some of the M&A activity in the quarter, both as an active quarter from bolt-on acquisitions and also some divestitures. So talk to us a little bit about what excites you about what you added to your portfolio. And how does this all fit into the strategy? \nEarl Austin: We acquired Sherman+Reilly, which was blocks and pullers. If you're in the business, you're in the craft, you grew up with Sherman+Reilly as part of the ecosystem, it's been in business since 1927. It's something that I think from our standpoint, our people in the field, they deserve the product that's safe, the training that they have, what they do with the pullers and tensioners and the things that they have, the R&Ds they put into it, coupled with what we're trying to accomplish. It was compelling for us. There's a lot of wire talk about being pulled. There's new conductors out. There's lots of technology that we believe we can bring to market here. \n And lastly, concerned with the capacity. We're always concerned with supply chain capacity. It was -- it's something that I believe is very specialized, it needs to be safe. We need to protect our people a bit, make sure it's in good hands and a lot of our clients use the pullers as well and our internal resources. It's certainly something that we value and really proud to have that piece of business. \n As far as the divestiture, the divestiture is basically an oil and gas legacy business we've had since 2015 or before, and certainly something that we've looked at for a long time to say this is not something that we're going to invest in. It's better off in other people's hands. It's international. The company has made the decision not to go into international -- not to go international at this point. So it's something that need to be divested and someone it will do great. The management team is fantastic. The new owners will be happy with the business. \nNeil Mehta: And then the follow-up is just on the SunZia project. Obviously, it's a very important project for the company. Just give us the latest temperature or latest progress report there. And anything we should be watching out for, whether it's some of the litigation stuff or just in terms of managing through execution challenges that inevitably happen with big projects? \nEarl Austin: No, SunZia is doing great. We're doing well. I think the team had a great plan. We put it together. All I see is good things coming out of that. We're progressing nicely. No issues on [ permanent ]. I don't think there would be, but there's no issues there. \n Did the long line. It could be noisy here or there, but I've not seen anything on that but really good production. Safety is great. Working hand in hand with the client. So I continue to like that project. We're early in opportunities to release contingencies as we go through it. So I really believe that it's going to be a nice one, actually, wish I was running it. So it's a [ long one ]. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Brian Brophy with Stifel. \nBrian Brophy: Just continuing the conversation on the low growth discussion around data centers. We've seen some pretty eye-popping estimates in terms of what that may mean. You alluded to some of that earlier in your comments. Just curious how you're thinking about the industry's capacity to meet some of these demands and what that might mean ultimately for your pricing and margins? \nEarl Austin: Yes. Again, it's more utilization and returns for us when you start looking at pricing. When we think about it, we need to execute. We need to execute double-digit platforms that we've talked about over time. And I think it's more of that than it is some kind of pricing pressure. But I do think what we see it's so unique and tech really, really wants it now, they got money, they want to pay for it. It's just regulatory, the -- how do you set rates that are fair for everyone else. And it's starting to get -- you can see, it's starting to get figured out across the country of how to accommodate loads that we're seeing. But it's not going to happen overnight.\n If you want renewable resources as well, it's another complication when you start to talk about it. We were already fuel switching. Now we're fuel switching and doubling loads in 90 days, it seems like. But in general, I would say that load is real. It's coming and people are paying for it. It creates demand across renewables and our electric segment. We need a robust grid, the cheapest one in generation is transmission, it always will be. So I like where we sit in. We can help.\n We -- certainly, we talk about a solution-based approach. If there's ever been a solution-based approach that it's going to work, it will be within this because it's complicated on how to get renewables to load sources. And you're seeing power plants, nuclear power plants get bought really with the whole power plant going towards data centers.\n So I never thought we would see that in my lifetime, and now we're seeing it show up. And I just -- it's creating some unique circumstances across the country. And it's not only in Virginia. It's across every single customer we have that 3 megs, 4 megs show up. And it's tomorrow. They want tomorrow and they want it in a renewable state.\n So I like where we sit. We can certainly help. We can certainly sit on both sides of that. And I like what we can accomplish. Just got to plan more, plan better both on distribution and on transmission and collaborate with the client. The better we serve the customer, the better the company will do. \nBrian Brophy: That's great. And I guess one other one. I think the DOE announced some permitting reform to some grid capacity transmission lines, streamlining some of the environmental reviews here a few days ago. Curious how impactful you think that might be? \nEarl Austin: It's incrementally helpful, especially out west. But still state policies, state regulations, PUCs, commissions, we've got to get around the fact that load is significantly higher. And we've got an investment grid. It's -- we're late already, we're behind, I believe. And so we need to catch up and we need to make sure that this transition doesn't -- it's like sitting on a track and the train come at you.\n You've got to invest in infrastructure. The more modern your infrastructure is, rates go down on an NPV basis when you look on a go-forward. So investment now pays off for the next generation. So you just have to invest in it. And I think that's the case today, and we need to keep going. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Marc Bianchi with TD Cowen. \nMarc Bianchi: The first one I wanted to ask was on -- related to this load growth outlook with the data center stuff that everybody has been talking about. What role do you see for gas-fired generation? And how is your business exposed to that, if perhaps some of that occurs behind the meter at the customer site? \nEarl Austin: I mean I do think gas generation is going to play a role in that and to some degree here in this transition. They still want renewables. Data centers want renewables. You're going to have to balance the load. Values aren't coming fast enough -- so you're going to have to balance a little of natural gas.\n The problem I see is a lot of gas-fired is coming into play. If you talk about 1 gig, 2 gigs, 3 gigs, 4 gigs of gas-fired generation, you're still off 96 gigs. So you can't build enough generation -- enough renewable generation for what we see coming. So I do believe that you need to balance the load and it will help. Batteries are coming along.\n But I still -- if you try to build a piece of pipe in this country to feed the natural gas systems, therein lies the problem. I hear it -- I mean I see it, I see 10 12 gas-fired generation plants being proposed. I still don't know how we're going to get the piece of pipe to it to feed them. \nMarc Bianchi: Yes, yes. Sorry, Duke, go ahead. \nEarl Austin: That's it. \nMarc Bianchi: Okay. The other question I had was on the renewable margin progression. So if I look at where -- for the second quarter is discussed to be maybe just below 8%, and then you're going to be double digits in the back half. Can you talk about what's driving the conviction in that improvement? And then also, I think in the past, you talked about some contingency release that would come later on in the project time line. I'm curious where you are with that in the back half of this year? \nJayshree Desai: Yes. Thanks for the question. Yes, we are seeing that progression. We do believe that as these projects progress across some various risks and contingencies, we'll be able to release some of that in the back half. You got to -- the segment is more than just solar/wind. There's a lot of transmission substation work. All of that is going to see a big acceleration, we believe, in the back half. And so that will fall in the margins as better cost absorption, and contingency releases can be obtained. \nEarl Austin: And I do think the conviction is history. And the history of both companies, both segments, we've operated in double digits, we're well below that. Growth is pressing a bit. We went through the jobs. Most of -- when we talk about what we had -- some degradation of margins, the degradation, it's new people and new roles, and so some of that shows up. And we've got to do a better job making sure that we educate and train our field leadership at times.\n And so that said, we went through the projects. We feel good we're 50, 60 type -- renewable-type jobs that are out there today and they're bread-and-butter. So for us, we're looking at it, we're looking at backlog. We see a nice runway, decade runway here. So I really feel comfortable that we've invested in the right spots and that years intact, in fact, with opportunities still in it.\n And yes, we're not pleased with the quarter by any measures. And I can promise you the leadership in the field is not pleased. So we expect a lot out of ourselves. Our customers expect a lot out of us. And even in the good times, we're running it pretty hard. So we've made the necessary changes to make sure that not only that we perform at the double-digit-type level but also that we don't let it drag on or we don't -- it doesn't catch us by surprise or anything like that. We see it. And we saw this early. And we made some adjustments. We won't be able to operate [ contingencies ] on a few projects. And we're talking about 5% out of the whole thing and probably like, I don't know, I think it was like $15 million or something like that as maybe within the operations. So -- and have opportunities to do -- operate through at a very, very high level on the rest of them. So I feel really good about it. I feel good about the year and next year and the next and on and on. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Justin Hauke with Baird. \nJustin Hauke: So that -- the renewables margin progression is what I was going to ask about, too, and I think we've covered some of the thematic questions here. So I had a couple of numeric ones. I guess, first, just on the M&A, given that there's a lot of moving pieces here, both new additions and divestitures, can you give us some context of what the net kind of revenue contribution from that is for the year in terms of your guidance? And then also is the $500 million that you talked about, is that inclusive of the proceeds from the divestitures you announced? \nJayshree Desai: Yes. Justin, so I would say the revenue -- inorganic revenue contribution from the deals we did in the second half of last year as well as the announcements this year contributes around $500 million to $600 million. I'd tell you the 2 recent acquisitions, the revenue contribution there pretty much is offset by the divestiture of the oil and gas business. So we're still around $500 million to $600 million and EPS contribution around $0.15 to $0.20. \nJustin Hauke: Okay. Great. So that's not changed in net versus what you had before. Okay. And I guess the second question, again, sorry, it's a numeric one, but we've covered some of the other grounds. Just on the other income line, it was $25 million seemed a little high. What was that? \nJayshree Desai: Well, that is, we had the sale of an investment in a pipeline, the gain on that. So which we did adjust out of EBITDA and adjusted EPS. So that's the biggest factor in that $25 million. We also had some gains on our deferred comp, but that gets offset in SG&A. So the real impact is around that gain around the pipeline investment, which we backed out in adjusted EPS and EBITDA. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gus Richard with Northland Capital. \nAuguste Richard: When I think about the data centers, typically, chip companies run their road map until they hit wall. Typically, the scale of the infrastructure or a power constraint in the chip. And AI is about to have a huge shift from training, which is very power-intensive to inference, which basically reduces the power consumption by 10%. I've seen this over the last 30 years where these guys changed their minds like they change their stocks. And I'm just kind of wondering, maybe I'm wrong, but if all of a sudden, the load demand from AI drops significantly and these guys change their plans, what happens? \nEarl Austin: I mean we had a great business prior to the AI coming in that we see fuel switching, we see EV penetration, we see renewables, fuel switching from coal. This is additive. And look, I -- you can't -- you're 24 months out, 36 months out today, if you say go. So no one is going to go, and that's why you're seeing exactly what you're seeing. Everyone is saying, why are we going to build this infrastructure, why are we going to build a generation unless someone guarantees the load.\n So yes, I agree with you. That's why every utility -- every customer we have is making sure that the other side -- the party on the other side is signing up for load growth that's sustainable to pay the investment or if not, the rate payer pays. I mean that's your dilemma. And I agree with you. That's why you're stalling again instead of going forward as fast as you can because everyone's got to get that right, including tech. \nAuguste Richard: Okay. Got it. I appreciate it. And then the second question I've got, I've been reading about reconduction of transmission lines, particularly in Europe. And I was wondering, is that a way to at least mitigate some of the construction on the grid and reduce the need for new routes? Is that something people are considering? And sort of how would that impact your business? \nEarl Austin: Yes. I mean look, we've reconductored my career. And the new high-density wires, they run hot. They work in certain areas. It's helpful. But what I would say is -- what makes it easier, better, you're still -- it's still a rebuild, basically. You're just in the corridors that exists today. So yes, we can. We can even do it in energized state. We're doing 250 miles now energized while the line is hot and reconducting, which is -- we're specializing in it, we're training in it. So it's certainly an advantage to the company. We've spent tons of R&D here. We like the conductor. We certainly have installed plenty of the other high-density conductor, and we like it.\n So I think in general, yes, it makes sense. Technology will be a piece of this. It will -- and I -- when you look at [ learning ] machines and you look at everything we see from a power demand, AI is a piece of it. But the onshoring, the chips, the Amazon centers that are fully electric, you can imagine all the things that are drawing load right now. And it's, in my mind -- we talked about data centers, I don't know, 4 years ago, and said it would be a big push. We had no idea that AI would come in as well. And I just think as you move forward, if you haven't used [ Autopilot ] or ChatGPT, try it, that ain't going anywhere. That's fantastic. I love it. It's great.\n I think the country is moving in that direction, and it's certainly demand there and the chips and everything else we do on any given day, even if you reduce power. It's kind of like appliances. We're going to get great things out of appliances what we did for about 3, 4, 5 years, and it helped us with load growth. You had negative load growth for a long time. You got positive load growth throughout the country for the most part, just in general. And so now when data shows up, it's more significant than anyone thought, myself included. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Rygiel with B. Riley Securities. \nAlexander Rygiel: Very nice quarter. First question here, cash flow in the quarter was very strong, yet I don't believe you changed your full year guide. Are you incrementally more confident with the high end of your range now? And has your view on uses of free cash flow changed at all? And I have a follow-up. \nJayshree Desai: Yes. So free cash flow, I think just sitting here in the quarter, we did have a good free cash flow quarter. Pleased with that. But it's early. We think it's prudent given that our typical profile as of the first half of the year tends to be cash flow-neutral or slightly negative with most of the free cash flow coming in, in the fourth quarter. We still think that's where we need to sit right now. There is opportunity to be at the high end of that range. But I think the range where we are today is where we should be. \nEarl Austin: Alex, too, I would say the business itself we set out to change some of the cash flow profiles of the business. I think we've done a nice job from an internal-invested capital. When you look at the returns, the way we calculate them, certainly moving up in the business. Even when the margins are a little softer, the returns are fantastic.\n It's certainly generating -- in the first quarter, typically, what we've been talking about was free cash was bad. And we had growth in the business, we had growth in head count and free cash generation. So I really like where we sit. I know everyone is hesitant to say that the business has fundamentally changed, DSO has fundamentally changed. I think they have. I think it gives us more flexibility.\n We've always talked about the free cash and how we deploy it is something that we, as the team, have to make sure that we continue to deploy capital in the proper way that we have in the past to create the outcomes that we have in the past. So I think our ability to look at M&A, to look at buybacks, to look at everything that we do and be opportunistic, certainly, the free cash generation gives us more opportunity. \nAlexander Rygiel: And then secondly, I don't think we've touched on telecom or industrial on the call here. Any notable movements there either in the quarter or for the remainder of the year? \nEarl Austin: We even bought the environmental solutions, it's sitting in really nicely. We really like the synergies we're picking up there on the industrial side. In fact the business is performing well. Telecom had a nice quarter. We got parity to the electric segment a little better. I mean we also added some backlog there. I like the business long term.\n Certainly, data centers -- the other part of the data centers is you're still going to have to put fiber into -- when I say fiber, data center to data center. And they can't really say, I want to go to this hub or that hub at this point because they're everywhere. So you're going to start building on all fiber to feed it at some point. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sangita Jain with KeyBanc Capital Markets. \nSangita Jain: I know we've discussed data center dynamics a lot on this call, but I was just wondering, Duke, if there is a way for you to engage directly with data center companies, whether it's for substation build-out or some behind-the-meter solutions, something aside from your leverage to the grid. \nEarl Austin: Yes. I mean we talk to them all the time. I do think there's opportunities to help and collaborate with them. Look, our job, we support our clients and our clients are talking to them as well. So it's just a -- it's something that we balance between the grid, what their demands are, try to help on both sides of that.\n I do believe that as we move forward, as you see the company move forward, the demand of tech on the grid and how they deploy -- where they deploy it, where they build, what they build certainly want to be right in the middle of it. And we want to sit with them and understand what they're trying to accomplish. It allows us to facilitate it.\n So I -- look, it's something that the company -- we've talked to them a lot. Our PTT business, the transformer business is certainly something that they value a lot. They want the transformers. They want them now. So I think those things are -- bode well for us. And our ability to communicate and talk about power consumption with tech is something that we can help our clients with and ourselves. \nSangita Jain: Great. And if I can follow up with one on MSAs. Is there anything particularly different this time around on MSA timing than in past years that's causing the exceptionally slow start to the year? \nEarl Austin: I don't feel like it's slow. I feel like we're doing great. It's a little bouncy on the distribution system, as we said in the past. Like I said, we're up 5.3% on transmission, distribution and substations, if you look at still look at the delineations of the segments as a whole. So I feel like we're starting nicely.\n Our backlog is down in the UI on big pipe, which  is fine with me. If you take out big pipe and you add renewables and you add electric, you're up, your backlog is up. So yes, there's a lot of opportunities. The negotiations are taking longer in some cases.\n MSAs, you're looking at, you're trying to see how many people you have on the system today and the way we calculate it. But I continue to see our MSAs get renewed. There is some timing, there always will be. They're 5 years, 3 years, 2 years, and they cycle in and out. And you could be in year 4 of $2 billion MSA, that's going to renew for 5 years. When it renews, you [ got ] $2 billion in the backlog. So it just takes -- it gets a little lumpy in some of the MSA work, and it's going to continue that way.\n But the overarching business and the way that we stack on the larger projects, programs, build, when that stack starts, it just continues to move on. But the industry stalled a bit trying to make sure that the demand for data centers and the demand for what we're talking about is real. And that -- so it did stall a bit on some of these larger projects because they're not big enough. So what you're doing is go, uh-oh, I was going to build this. Now we've got to double the size of what we're trying to accomplish. And so yes, it's taken a little bit longer. And I do think the industry is going to have to think a little bigger and a little faster. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research Partners. \nMichael Dudas: So you mentioned in your comments during the call in your prepared remarks the importance of investing into the business. I just want to get a check on relative to the growth you're seeing, we've been talking about so much demand growth here in this call but over the next 3 to 5 years and where you are today on staffing. Are there -- what are the challenges to kind of meet -- get the bodies and get the capacity to meet the, it seems like a sustainable and extraordinary growth, over the next several years? Where do you -- are you in fairly good shape? Or is there a lot more work to do? \nEarl Austin: Yes. Mike, I think the company has done a nice job investing in craft certainly, which is what we're known for and core to us. I do think when you -- we saw some of it show up in the solar business in the quarter, where we had some growth and significant growth. And so it does, at times, that growth, you're investing in growth, you want to make sure that you can maintain the productivities and if you move geographies that you can maintain the type of productivities that we expect. And we expect high levels, and we've got to make sure we're looking back in the operations and helping make the young ones and the young people that are in the business go forward as far as -- and we are, and we have great programs and we get them to the field.\n And there's not -- replacing your footprints in the field with something on a piece of paper is a fallacy. It doesn't work. So that footprint in the field, the people that mentor our management teams are paramount. And so we work hard on that. We work hard on that execution, and it continues to get better and better.\n So as far as getting people in the business, look, we haven't had the problem yet from a standpoint of craft, and we've done a good job. I think the down -- kind of the slowdown in distribution allows us to take a breath and actually gain market share. So I like it. I like where we sit.\n And sometimes what I call hard 12 months, it makes -- you hone your skills. And I like it a little tough. It separates us. And I think we've done -- whatever is showing up today, we did 12 months ago. Whatever shows up next year, we did 12 months ago. So I think in general, our ability to look forward and see the business allows us to really invest in craft long term, in our people long term. And we're doing that, we're hiring people for the future now. We're skating where the puck is going. I like it. And so I think we have no issues in craft at this point, being able to hire, train, maintain. We just got to do it at the production levels we expect. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard with Bernstein. \nCharles Albert Dillard: So Duke, you were talking about how utilities are shifting CapEx from distribution to transmission. Just trying to get a better sense for how that impacts Quanta's business. I think you have talked about better market share on transmission, but any sense on just like how to think about it from a margin standpoint, from a utilization standpoint?\n And then secondly, based on your conversations with utilities, is the case like some of the work that was pushed out to '24, is that actually going to expect on the '25 because you'll be a little bit more able to change your CapEx plan a little bit further out? \nEarl Austin: Yes. I mean, I think we've heard most of our customers -- I'll go backwards on that. Most of our customers maintain their capital guides and some increase. I still -- you got a backdrop of anything we're saying. You can look at the capital spend and what the customer is saying.\n I think honestly, you'll start to see them raise capital again, I don't see any way around it. I think capital is going up, not down over the next -- whenever they talk about their next 5 years, you can see capital plans go up, has to, to meet the demand. And so we're talking about getting more usage out of the grid. Even if you get more usage out grid, capital is going up. So I do think there's some things you can do from technology, but it's incidental compared to what you see from the demand side. So both of those things are going to happen.\n As far as distribution, I think it's just we kind of -- it's status quo, which we expected more growth out of it. And not all customers, I want to be clear on this, not all customers are going down on distribution. Some in the Southeast, a few here or there, to shift capital over into transmission. So in some areas, that's the case. Some areas, distributions the same or moving up. You got storm hardening, you got fire hardening, you got a hundred different things also going on. And the everyday grid depreciates every given day. Poles rot, things -- it's always been that way, and that's still ongoing with everything else that's going on. So the maintenance of the grid stays in place.\n And so that -- but the capital is required to maintain the capital required, the necessary infrastructure, electric vehicles. I mean, I think the pause and -- somewhat pause and delay a bit in the electric vehicle penetration, although it's penetrating nicely, it's certainly something that we're watching. And I think that -- we've always said that would be a 3, 4 decade-type penetration versus overnight. I mean it was not going to happen by 2030. We thought 2050, 2040. I mean, I think that's the case. And the distribution just a longer build, but it's much, much bigger even in transmission, just longer.\n And so I like them both. It's going to show up over time. It just because the company time -- it's technical. It gives the company time to rethink about those resources and how do we resource these things as they come about. \nCharles Albert Dillard: Got it. That's helpful. And I want to go back to the 2 comments you made. So earlier in the Q&A, you talked about it seems to have a really strong uptick on the data center side in January through March. And then you just talked about what you do today began 12 months ago. So just trying to think through like when we start seeing a lot of the work tied to data centers, to kind of work through -- do you think you can provide us with like an expected cadence on that? \nEarl Austin: I mean, I think we see a lot of plans today on large-scale, hyperscale basis. And that loads got to go to them. And that planning process -- we do a lot of system planning. And that system planning process is probably robust today as it's ever been on the transmission load side of the business. We've got to get the distribution business a little better. And we've got to talk to the regulators and talk to them about what we're seeing and making sure that the consumer is not paying for the data center demand. So I think that's the bigger thing, the affordability.\n Natural gas is down, and it just kind of flat, so it's helping the consumer at the bill level.  And so that's a good thing. If natural gas stays down and we get some interest kind of where it's at or even less, it bodes well. And I think you'll see the capital plans and everyone get their head around. I'm looking at the calls as well. I mean everyone's got equity plans now. And if we didn't see that show up until this quarter, where you're starting to see people issue equity and debt against the bills that are coming. It's necessary, and we start to see that show up.\n And I think the business -- you can see where the planning is coming into place and how quickly things move against equity and data at the utility level. So we see a lot. We're excited about it. And I do believe it's not just something that -- you can't go, \"oh, we're going to build this.\" And they're going to not  pay for it. I think this is real. I do. I think the demand is real.\n Even If it's half what everyone is saying, it's more than we're talking about now. So that's the bet of it. You hedge it down, and it's still huge. So I like it. And I think we're sitting in a really good spot here, and we're starting to see those investments show up. It will be like what we see today, a little better. But the 24-month planning cycle is ongoing. And utilities today are planning for the future. So I think every single quarter, you'll see the progression, and it just stacks. And we always thought that these bigger programs, these bigger things would stack on the business long term, and your base would continue to move up on kind of double digits, and that's what we see. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from the line of Brett Castelli with Morningstar. \nBrett Castelli: I just wanted to ask within renewables. Can you parse out your expectations for new orders between wind and solar for the full year 2024? And any thoughts relative to 2023 between the technologies there? \nEarl Austin: I mean I would just say like we've talked about growing double digits, and we're growing double digits plus EV and wind and solar as well beyond that. But obviously, we're comfortable with double-digit growth in those businesses. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Avi Jaroslawicz with UBS. \nAvinatan Jaroslawicz: I'm on for Steve Fisher. So recently, we've seen some more federal support coming out for permitting but also some lower capital intensity type of opportunities within transmission. Just how are you guys thinking about which is going to be the bigger driver for that over the next 1 to 2 years? And also, what kind of visibility to bookings you have within those transmission projects? \nEarl Austin: I want to make sure I understand the question, and it's a little spotty on my side here. As far as permitting, I mean, I think state permitting, in general, is fine. It's more about the regulatory process is a permit, in my mind. I don't think I caught the rest of the question here. Did you hear it? \nJayshree Desai: He was asking about the innovation around... \nAvinatan Jaroslawicz: Yes, I was just asking like... \nEarl Austin: We've seen some innovation -- sorry about that. Yes. My apologies. We've seen some innovation throughout the year. I think you'll continue to see it. There's things going on. But it's incidental really. I mean it's good, it will help, but the demand is such that we'll continue to see do that. We always go back and look at Europe and what's going on there, a lot of innovation in Europe.\n It's 3x [ cooler ] what we have here. And the cheapest form of moving generation is transmission. You still need -- still the cheapest form today, and it will be tomorrow and the next day. So I do think that the builds -- the multiyear builds are there. You have to balance the load, so you're seeing some equipment come in, synchrophasor, things like that, that are coming into the business that allows some balance. You're starting to see that show up from an equipment standpoint. We'll install it.\n There's software out there that's helping some on a distribution level, transmission level. But it's -- I still think even with innovation, we got a long way to go on infrastructure. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Gainey with Thompson Davis & Company. \nKevin Gainey: I just wanted to maybe touch on the equity income at electric power and the guidance raise there. How should we think about that? What's driving that? And then maybe the cadence as we go throughout the year? \nJayshree Desai: Yes. The increase there was primarily driven by our Puerto Rican entity, our JV with LUMA. There was a favorable tax ruling that allowed for us to be able to -- the tax rate has dropped significantly. And so you're seeing around a $6 million improvement over the year as a result of that ruling. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Jean Ramirez with D.A. Davidson. \nJean Paul Ramirez: This is Jean for Brent Thielman. I wanted to ask a question about the underground gas utility portion of the segment. Are you guys seeing any utilities pull back at all on network investments and reliability upgrades? \nEarl Austin: No. I think to the contrary, the investments necessary there in methane releases, things of that nature. When you start looking at natural gas systems, they're more valuable today because we're not building as much new system. I mean there's a considerable amount of new systems being built, but in certain areas where you're replacing [ caster ] and other lines with polyethylene and more, you're building a modern network. That's certainly there and will continue to be there. We see an uptick in the business, not a downtick. \nOperator: We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing comments. \nEarl Austin: Yes. I want to thank the 52,800 people out in the field that pay our paychecks and do what they do everyday in inclement weather. We can't say enough about their performance and the safety and the things that they do on a daily basis. Our field leadership is the best in the world. The management team that we have here is certainly something that we're extremely proud of. We're proud of where the company is going, and thank you for participating in the call today. \nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported first quarter revenues of $5 billion, net income attributable to common stock of $118.4 million or $0.79 per diluted share and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.41. Adjusted EBITDA was $387.3 million or 7.7% of revenue. Of note, we generated healthy cash flows in the first quarter with cash flow from operations of $238 million and free cash flow of $181.2 million, both setting first quarter records. \n This earnings and cash flow performance allowed us to end the first quarter with ample liquidity and a balance sheet that supports both our organic growth expectations and the opportunistic deployment of capital to generate incremental returns for our stockholders. To that end, year-to-date, we've acquired 4 companies for aggregate consideration of approximately $500 million. \n This morning, we also provided an update to our full year 2024 financial expectations, which calls for another year of profitable growth with record revenues and opportunity for double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDA, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow. We believe our expectation demonstrates the strength of our portfolio approach to the business, our commitment to our long-term strategy, favorable end-market trends and our competitive position in the marketplace. \n Additional details and commentary about our 2024 financial guidance can be found in our operational and financial commentary and outlook expectation summary, both of which are posted on our IR website. \n With that, we are happy to answer your questions. Operator? Yes. Thanks for the question. Yes, we are seeing that progression. We do believe that as these projects progress across some various risks and contingencies, we'll be able to release some of that in the back half. You got to -- the segment is more than just solar/wind. There's a lot of transmission substation work. All of that is going to see a big acceleration, we believe, in the back half. And so that will fall in the margins as better cost absorption, and contingency releases can be obtained. Yes. Justin, so I would say the revenue -- inorganic revenue contribution from the deals we did in the second half of last year as well as the announcements this year contributes around $500 million to $600 million. I'd tell you the 2 recent acquisitions, the revenue contribution there pretty much is offset by the divestiture of the oil and gas business. So we're still around $500 million to $600 million and EPS contribution around $0.15 to $0.20. Well, that is, we had the sale of an investment in a pipeline, the gain on that. So which we did adjust out of EBITDA and adjusted EPS. So that's the biggest factor in that $25 million. We also had some gains on our deferred comp, but that gets offset in SG&A. So the real impact is around that gain around the pipeline investment, which we backed out in adjusted EPS and EBITDA. Yes. So free cash flow, I think just sitting here in the quarter, we did have a good free cash flow quarter. Pleased with that. But it's early. We think it's prudent given that our typical profile as of the first half of the year tends to be cash flow-neutral or slightly negative with most of the free cash flow coming in, in the fourth quarter. We still think that's where we need to sit right now. There is opportunity to be at the high end of that range. But I think the range where we are today is where we should be. He was asking about the innovation around... Yes. The increase there was primarily driven by our Puerto Rican entity, our JV with LUMA. There was a favorable tax ruling that allowed for us to be able to -- the tax rate has dropped significantly. And so you're seeing around a $6 million improvement over the year as a result of that ruling."

            "name": "Earl Austin",
            "content": "Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Quanta Services First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. This morning, we reported our first quarter 2024 results, which included double-digit growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted earnings per share and strong cash flow, demonstrating an overall good start to the year. \n Total backlog at quarter end was $29.9 billion, which we believe reflects the value of our collaborative client relationships and evidences the momentum we see for 2024. Utilities across the United States are experiencing and forecasting meaningful increases in power demand for the first time in many years driven by the adoption of new technologies and related infrastructure, including artificial intelligence and data centers as well as federal and state policies designed to accelerate the energy transition and policies intended to strategically reinforce domestic manufacturing and supply chain resources. \n With the complexities of the power grid and the significant upgrades and enhancements required to facilitate load growth, our collaborative solution-based approach is valued by our clients more than ever. We continue to look forward to the realization of our multiyear strategic initiatives and the goals we expect to achieve in this and the coming years. \n We are positioning Quanta for decades of expected necessary infrastructure investment and believe our service line diversity creates platforms for growth that expand our total addressable market. Our portfolio approach and focus on craft skilled labor is strategic -- a strategic advantage that we believe provides us the ability to manage risk and shift resources across service lines and geographies, which is increasingly important as the energy transition accelerates. \n We believe our diversity and portfolio approach has also improved our cash flow profile and positions us well to allocate resources to the opportunities we find most economically attractive and to achieve operating efficiencies and consistent financial results. \n I will now turn the call over to Jayshree Desai, Quanta's CFO, to provide a few remarks about our results and 2024 guidance. And then we will take your questions. Thanks. Jayshree? Thanks, Jamie. Welcome back. I'll take the margin question. I think from our standpoint, when we look at the segment -- renewables segment, we had some series of projects there that -- a series of work, call it, 5% of the portfolio on the solar/wind side. They just didn't perform, didn't execute to where we should have executed that and what we expect from ourselves and what our customers expect. So yes -- look, it's a small piece. We grew the business, I can make tons of excuses, I am not. We own it. We didn't execute like we should. And the rest of the portfolio really is -- the majority -- the vast majority of the jobs, of the projects, of everything we're doing there is exceeding our expectations. We expect that to continue. \n Growth creates some inefficiencies, and we've showed up. So we got to fix it. And it's not something that -- it's later stage in the projects. And so I'm not concerned. It's just part of it in the first quarter, seasonality and everything else, a little bit of noise shows up. But all in all, I think the segment is performing nicely. \n What we see in the future looks great. The backlog is certainly accelerating in the renewables segment. So we're excited about what we see going forward. We are executing for how many people we put in the field and what we've added to this segment. I feel real good about it. We do invest in growth. It has some inefficiencies as you move forward and showed up. So I think all in all, we like what we see. \n As far as data centers I think the macro demand of electricity is obviously moving up. At any time you have demand, it's great for the business, it's great for our customers. It -- if you go back, you roll it back, call it, 9 months ago, we needed some data center demand, but nothing like we saw show up in January, February, March. It caught me off guard a little bit to see the amount. You're talking one customer is talking 100 gigs. So when you start talking about one customer with 100 gigs, it's just -- it's mind-blowing, in my mind, to think about the amount of electricity necessary and primarily winning renewables. \n So both sides of the business, both T&D and our renewable business, stand to gain quite a bit and our customers as well. But it's not easy from a rate base. It's not easy to deal with those kind of things showing up at your doorstep when you're trying to plan for 30 years and you build out a huge power plant, and it's gone in one day. \n So I think from our -- the planning piece of the business is difficult. It is certainly showing up, it's certainly pressing us, our customers, everyone to plan better and to think longer term. We're trying to put a 4-decade, 3-decade-type build in 90-day windows. It doesn't work. It's a very long-term build here. I think the company is set right in the middle of it. I like where we sit from the ancillary piece of data centers. I like -- we're talking to hyperscalers. We're talking to all of them about how we can help benefit and collaborate with our clients and then to get power sources. And certainly in demand, it's a unique time. It's exciting. We're excited about it. We're excited to work with our clients, and they expect a lot of us. We just -- we need to deliver and execute. Sure. So a little bit, I think this is something we've talked about the portfolio and combining electric power and renewables together, and so I want to go through that a little bit. \n If you look at the electric business, which is transmission, substation and distribution and you look across the segments, so the segments are delineated today, which is causing some -- when you print the numbers, it doesn't look like what the business is from those 3 things. So an electric work type, it's up over 5% in the quarter. That's because pieces of the business is over in renewable segment, and pieces of it are in the electric segment. \n But the business itself together is up 5.3%. So it's just the way the segments look. You've got to combine them. It's got to look like a portfolio. The delineations are causing some number print. It doesn't look like with where the business is at. So I wanted to explain work type, which is electric, substation, distribution and transmission are up 5.3% in the quarter. And our backlog is almost flat. \n Yes, I think the backlog of the business and what we see is timing, there's MSA timing. It's early. It's the first quarter. We fully expect to be at record levels. The bigger projects, the renewal prices are complicated. It takes a long time to negotiate. We're not going to press negotiations against a 90-day print. It just doesn't make sense for us. \n So we'll be patient. We're not concerned. We see an outstanding -- we were just talking about load growth. Any time you got more load, you got more business. It's simple when you think about it. So more demand, more business. We see more demand than we've ever seen. And so I just -- I feel good about it. \n As far as margins, the electric print, we operated great, even a little down. So we've always said that you can operate in double digits. It doesn't matter what the revenue is. That's what we're really trying to drive is the EPS and those margins. So in that -- in the segment, I thought we had a nice -- performed well in this segment. And liked where we're going. I think there is opportunity. We -- it's early. We're not going to change guidance in 90 days. So it looks good. We have lots of opportunity. I would say we have more upside than we do downside on a go-forward basis in the segment. I think the back half of '24, your distribution business starts to become increasingly -- I would say, you'd start booking more work, you start to see your MSAs, your crude counts move up again. There is some shift in the transmission versus distribution in certain areas, the Southeast and places where -- what's happening is you're seeing the data centers show up, you're seeing the demand show up on the transmission side. And you've already got your capital out if your utility customers -- so you have to build the transmission and you're going to pull capital off the distribution systems a bit and move it into the transmission systems. \n It's fine that was -- that's why we're diversified. That's why the company sits where it sits. We're able to be nimble and move. It's not an issue, but it does show up. And your MSA work on the distribution side is softer than normal. And that's -- we talked about that in the fourth quarter where we're working 40, 50 hours versus 70. I think that's still the case. I do believe as you move into the later part of the year, you're going to start seeing us work more -- I'm not inclined to say more 60-, 70-hour weeks. \n And our head count is still almost 54,000, which is up 4,000 year-over-year. I feel highly confident that as EV starts to penetrate to the West, that's moving up already. And the EV kind of moves across, there's -- we've got to build infrastructure. And certainly, we see it showing up in certain areas. We acquired Sherman+Reilly, which was blocks and pullers. If you're in the business, you're in the craft, you grew up with Sherman+Reilly as part of the ecosystem, it's been in business since 1927. It's something that I think from our standpoint, our people in the field, they deserve the product that's safe, the training that they have, what they do with the pullers and tensioners and the things that they have, the R&Ds they put into it, coupled with what we're trying to accomplish. It was compelling for us. There's a lot of wire talk about being pulled. There's new conductors out. There's lots of technology that we believe we can bring to market here. \n And lastly, concerned with the capacity. We're always concerned with supply chain capacity. It was -- it's something that I believe is very specialized, it needs to be safe. We need to protect our people a bit, make sure it's in good hands and a lot of our clients use the pullers as well and our internal resources. It's certainly something that we value and really proud to have that piece of business. \n As far as the divestiture, the divestiture is basically an oil and gas legacy business we've had since 2015 or before, and certainly something that we've looked at for a long time to say this is not something that we're going to invest in. It's better off in other people's hands. It's international. The company has made the decision not to go into international -- not to go international at this point. So it's something that need to be divested and someone it will do great. The management team is fantastic. The new owners will be happy with the business. No, SunZia is doing great. We're doing well. I think the team had a great plan. We put it together. All I see is good things coming out of that. We're progressing nicely. No issues on [ permanent ]. I don't think there would be, but there's no issues there. \n Did the long line. It could be noisy here or there, but I've not seen anything on that but really good production. Safety is great. Working hand in hand with the client. So I continue to like that project. We're early in opportunities to release contingencies as we go through it. So I really believe that it's going to be a nice one, actually, wish I was running it. So it's a [ long one ]. Yes. Again, it's more utilization and returns for us when you start looking at pricing. When we think about it, we need to execute. We need to execute double-digit platforms that we've talked about over time. And I think it's more of that than it is some kind of pricing pressure. But I do think what we see it's so unique and tech really, really wants it now, they got money, they want to pay for it. It's just regulatory, the -- how do you set rates that are fair for everyone else. And it's starting to get -- you can see, it's starting to get figured out across the country of how to accommodate loads that we're seeing. But it's not going to happen overnight.\n If you want renewable resources as well, it's another complication when you start to talk about it. We were already fuel switching. Now we're fuel switching and doubling loads in 90 days, it seems like. But in general, I would say that load is real. It's coming and people are paying for it. It creates demand across renewables and our electric segment. We need a robust grid, the cheapest one in generation is transmission, it always will be. So I like where we sit in. We can help.\n We -- certainly, we talk about a solution-based approach. If there's ever been a solution-based approach that it's going to work, it will be within this because it's complicated on how to get renewables to load sources. And you're seeing power plants, nuclear power plants get bought really with the whole power plant going towards data centers.\n So I never thought we would see that in my lifetime, and now we're seeing it show up. And I just -- it's creating some unique circumstances across the country. And it's not only in Virginia. It's across every single customer we have that 3 megs, 4 megs show up. And it's tomorrow. They want tomorrow and they want it in a renewable state.\n So I like where we sit. We can certainly help. We can certainly sit on both sides of that. And I like what we can accomplish. Just got to plan more, plan better both on distribution and on transmission and collaborate with the client. The better we serve the customer, the better the company will do. It's incrementally helpful, especially out west. But still state policies, state regulations, PUCs, commissions, we've got to get around the fact that load is significantly higher. And we've got an investment grid. It's -- we're late already, we're behind, I believe. And so we need to catch up and we need to make sure that this transition doesn't -- it's like sitting on a track and the train come at you.\n You've got to invest in infrastructure. The more modern your infrastructure is, rates go down on an NPV basis when you look on a go-forward. So investment now pays off for the next generation. So you just have to invest in it. And I think that's the case today, and we need to keep going. I mean I do think gas generation is going to play a role in that and to some degree here in this transition. They still want renewables. Data centers want renewables. You're going to have to balance the load. Values aren't coming fast enough -- so you're going to have to balance a little of natural gas.\n The problem I see is a lot of gas-fired is coming into play. If you talk about 1 gig, 2 gigs, 3 gigs, 4 gigs of gas-fired generation, you're still off 96 gigs. So you can't build enough generation -- enough renewable generation for what we see coming. So I do believe that you need to balance the load and it will help. Batteries are coming along.\n But I still -- if you try to build a piece of pipe in this country to feed the natural gas systems, therein lies the problem. I hear it -- I mean I see it, I see 10 12 gas-fired generation plants being proposed. I still don't know how we're going to get the piece of pipe to it to feed them. That's it. And I do think the conviction is history. And the history of both companies, both segments, we've operated in double digits, we're well below that. Growth is pressing a bit. We went through the jobs. Most of -- when we talk about what we had -- some degradation of margins, the degradation, it's new people and new roles, and so some of that shows up. And we've got to do a better job making sure that we educate and train our field leadership at times.\n And so that said, we went through the projects. We feel good we're 50, 60 type -- renewable-type jobs that are out there today and they're bread-and-butter. So for us, we're looking at it, we're looking at backlog. We see a nice runway, decade runway here. So I really feel comfortable that we've invested in the right spots and that years intact, in fact, with opportunities still in it.\n And yes, we're not pleased with the quarter by any measures. And I can promise you the leadership in the field is not pleased. So we expect a lot out of ourselves. Our customers expect a lot out of us. And even in the good times, we're running it pretty hard. So we've made the necessary changes to make sure that not only that we perform at the double-digit-type level but also that we don't let it drag on or we don't -- it doesn't catch us by surprise or anything like that. We see it. And we saw this early. And we made some adjustments. We won't be able to operate [ contingencies ] on a few projects. And we're talking about 5% out of the whole thing and probably like, I don't know, I think it was like $15 million or something like that as maybe within the operations. So -- and have opportunities to do -- operate through at a very, very high level on the rest of them. So I feel really good about it. I feel good about the year and next year and the next and on and on. I mean we had a great business prior to the AI coming in that we see fuel switching, we see EV penetration, we see renewables, fuel switching from coal. This is additive. And look, I -- you can't -- you're 24 months out, 36 months out today, if you say go. So no one is going to go, and that's why you're seeing exactly what you're seeing. Everyone is saying, why are we going to build this infrastructure, why are we going to build a generation unless someone guarantees the load.\n So yes, I agree with you. That's why every utility -- every customer we have is making sure that the other side -- the party on the other side is signing up for load growth that's sustainable to pay the investment or if not, the rate payer pays. I mean that's your dilemma. And I agree with you. That's why you're stalling again instead of going forward as fast as you can because everyone's got to get that right, including tech. Yes. I mean look, we've reconductored my career. And the new high-density wires, they run hot. They work in certain areas. It's helpful. But what I would say is -- what makes it easier, better, you're still -- it's still a rebuild, basically. You're just in the corridors that exists today. So yes, we can. We can even do it in energized state. We're doing 250 miles now energized while the line is hot and reconducting, which is -- we're specializing in it, we're training in it. So it's certainly an advantage to the company. We've spent tons of R&D here. We like the conductor. We certainly have installed plenty of the other high-density conductor, and we like it.\n So I think in general, yes, it makes sense. Technology will be a piece of this. It will -- and I -- when you look at [ learning ] machines and you look at everything we see from a power demand, AI is a piece of it. But the onshoring, the chips, the Amazon centers that are fully electric, you can imagine all the things that are drawing load right now. And it's, in my mind -- we talked about data centers, I don't know, 4 years ago, and said it would be a big push. We had no idea that AI would come in as well. And I just think as you move forward, if you haven't used [ Autopilot ] or ChatGPT, try it, that ain't going anywhere. That's fantastic. I love it. It's great.\n I think the country is moving in that direction, and it's certainly demand there and the chips and everything else we do on any given day, even if you reduce power. It's kind of like appliances. We're going to get great things out of appliances what we did for about 3, 4, 5 years, and it helped us with load growth. You had negative load growth for a long time. You got positive load growth throughout the country for the most part, just in general. And so now when data shows up, it's more significant than anyone thought, myself included. Alex, too, I would say the business itself we set out to change some of the cash flow profiles of the business. I think we've done a nice job from an internal-invested capital. When you look at the returns, the way we calculate them, certainly moving up in the business. Even when the margins are a little softer, the returns are fantastic.\n It's certainly generating -- in the first quarter, typically, what we've been talking about was free cash was bad. And we had growth in the business, we had growth in head count and free cash generation. So I really like where we sit. I know everyone is hesitant to say that the business has fundamentally changed, DSO has fundamentally changed. I think they have. I think it gives us more flexibility.\n We've always talked about the free cash and how we deploy it is something that we, as the team, have to make sure that we continue to deploy capital in the proper way that we have in the past to create the outcomes that we have in the past. So I think our ability to look at M&A, to look at buybacks, to look at everything that we do and be opportunistic, certainly, the free cash generation gives us more opportunity. We even bought the environmental solutions, it's sitting in really nicely. We really like the synergies we're picking up there on the industrial side. In fact the business is performing well. Telecom had a nice quarter. We got parity to the electric segment a little better. I mean we also added some backlog there. I like the business long term.\n Certainly, data centers -- the other part of the data centers is you're still going to have to put fiber into -- when I say fiber, data center to data center. And they can't really say, I want to go to this hub or that hub at this point because they're everywhere. So you're going to start building on all fiber to feed it at some point. Yes. I mean we talk to them all the time. I do think there's opportunities to help and collaborate with them. Look, our job, we support our clients and our clients are talking to them as well. So it's just a -- it's something that we balance between the grid, what their demands are, try to help on both sides of that.\n I do believe that as we move forward, as you see the company move forward, the demand of tech on the grid and how they deploy -- where they deploy it, where they build, what they build certainly want to be right in the middle of it. And we want to sit with them and understand what they're trying to accomplish. It allows us to facilitate it.\n So I -- look, it's something that the company -- we've talked to them a lot. Our PTT business, the transformer business is certainly something that they value a lot. They want the transformers. They want them now. So I think those things are -- bode well for us. And our ability to communicate and talk about power consumption with tech is something that we can help our clients with and ourselves. I don't feel like it's slow. I feel like we're doing great. It's a little bouncy on the distribution system, as we said in the past. Like I said, we're up 5.3% on transmission, distribution and substations, if you look at still look at the delineations of the segments as a whole. So I feel like we're starting nicely.\n Our backlog is down in the UI on big pipe, which  is fine with me. If you take out big pipe and you add renewables and you add electric, you're up, your backlog is up. So yes, there's a lot of opportunities. The negotiations are taking longer in some cases.\n MSAs, you're looking at, you're trying to see how many people you have on the system today and the way we calculate it. But I continue to see our MSAs get renewed. There is some timing, there always will be. They're 5 years, 3 years, 2 years, and they cycle in and out. And you could be in year 4 of $2 billion MSA, that's going to renew for 5 years. When it renews, you [ got ] $2 billion in the backlog. So it just takes -- it gets a little lumpy in some of the MSA work, and it's going to continue that way.\n But the overarching business and the way that we stack on the larger projects, programs, build, when that stack starts, it just continues to move on. But the industry stalled a bit trying to make sure that the demand for data centers and the demand for what we're talking about is real. And that -- so it did stall a bit on some of these larger projects because they're not big enough. So what you're doing is go, uh-oh, I was going to build this. Now we've got to double the size of what we're trying to accomplish. And so yes, it's taken a little bit longer. And I do think the industry is going to have to think a little bigger and a little faster. Yes. Mike, I think the company has done a nice job investing in craft certainly, which is what we're known for and core to us. I do think when you -- we saw some of it show up in the solar business in the quarter, where we had some growth and significant growth. And so it does, at times, that growth, you're investing in growth, you want to make sure that you can maintain the productivities and if you move geographies that you can maintain the type of productivities that we expect. And we expect high levels, and we've got to make sure we're looking back in the operations and helping make the young ones and the young people that are in the business go forward as far as -- and we are, and we have great programs and we get them to the field.\n And there's not -- replacing your footprints in the field with something on a piece of paper is a fallacy. It doesn't work. So that footprint in the field, the people that mentor our management teams are paramount. And so we work hard on that. We work hard on that execution, and it continues to get better and better.\n So as far as getting people in the business, look, we haven't had the problem yet from a standpoint of craft, and we've done a good job. I think the down -- kind of the slowdown in distribution allows us to take a breath and actually gain market share. So I like it. I like where we sit.\n And sometimes what I call hard 12 months, it makes -- you hone your skills. And I like it a little tough. It separates us. And I think we've done -- whatever is showing up today, we did 12 months ago. Whatever shows up next year, we did 12 months ago. So I think in general, our ability to look forward and see the business allows us to really invest in craft long term, in our people long term. And we're doing that, we're hiring people for the future now. We're skating where the puck is going. I like it. And so I think we have no issues in craft at this point, being able to hire, train, maintain. We just got to do it at the production levels we expect. Yes. I mean, I think we've heard most of our customers -- I'll go backwards on that. Most of our customers maintain their capital guides and some increase. I still -- you got a backdrop of anything we're saying. You can look at the capital spend and what the customer is saying.\n I think honestly, you'll start to see them raise capital again, I don't see any way around it. I think capital is going up, not down over the next -- whenever they talk about their next 5 years, you can see capital plans go up, has to, to meet the demand. And so we're talking about getting more usage out of the grid. Even if you get more usage out grid, capital is going up. So I do think there's some things you can do from technology, but it's incidental compared to what you see from the demand side. So both of those things are going to happen.\n As far as distribution, I think it's just we kind of -- it's status quo, which we expected more growth out of it. And not all customers, I want to be clear on this, not all customers are going down on distribution. Some in the Southeast, a few here or there, to shift capital over into transmission. So in some areas, that's the case. Some areas, distributions the same or moving up. You got storm hardening, you got fire hardening, you got a hundred different things also going on. And the everyday grid depreciates every given day. Poles rot, things -- it's always been that way, and that's still ongoing with everything else that's going on. So the maintenance of the grid stays in place.\n And so that -- but the capital is required to maintain the capital required, the necessary infrastructure, electric vehicles. I mean, I think the pause and -- somewhat pause and delay a bit in the electric vehicle penetration, although it's penetrating nicely, it's certainly something that we're watching. And I think that -- we've always said that would be a 3, 4 decade-type penetration versus overnight. I mean it was not going to happen by 2030. We thought 2050, 2040. I mean, I think that's the case. And the distribution just a longer build, but it's much, much bigger even in transmission, just longer.\n And so I like them both. It's going to show up over time. It just because the company time -- it's technical. It gives the company time to rethink about those resources and how do we resource these things as they come about. I mean, I think we see a lot of plans today on large-scale, hyperscale basis. And that loads got to go to them. And that planning process -- we do a lot of system planning. And that system planning process is probably robust today as it's ever been on the transmission load side of the business. We've got to get the distribution business a little better. And we've got to talk to the regulators and talk to them about what we're seeing and making sure that the consumer is not paying for the data center demand. So I think that's the bigger thing, the affordability.\n Natural gas is down, and it just kind of flat, so it's helping the consumer at the bill level.  And so that's a good thing. If natural gas stays down and we get some interest kind of where it's at or even less, it bodes well. And I think you'll see the capital plans and everyone get their head around. I'm looking at the calls as well. I mean everyone's got equity plans now. And if we didn't see that show up until this quarter, where you're starting to see people issue equity and debt against the bills that are coming. It's necessary, and we start to see that show up.\n And I think the business -- you can see where the planning is coming into place and how quickly things move against equity and data at the utility level. So we see a lot. We're excited about it. And I do believe it's not just something that -- you can't go, \"oh, we're going to build this.\" And they're going to not  pay for it. I think this is real. I do. I think the demand is real.\n Even If it's half what everyone is saying, it's more than we're talking about now. So that's the bet of it. You hedge it down, and it's still huge. So I like it. And I think we're sitting in a really good spot here, and we're starting to see those investments show up. It will be like what we see today, a little better. But the 24-month planning cycle is ongoing. And utilities today are planning for the future. So I think every single quarter, you'll see the progression, and it just stacks. And we always thought that these bigger programs, these bigger things would stack on the business long term, and your base would continue to move up on kind of double digits, and that's what we see. I mean I would just say like we've talked about growing double digits, and we're growing double digits plus EV and wind and solar as well beyond that. But obviously, we're comfortable with double-digit growth in those businesses. I want to make sure I understand the question, and it's a little spotty on my side here. As far as permitting, I mean, I think state permitting, in general, is fine. It's more about the regulatory process is a permit, in my mind. I don't think I caught the rest of the question here. Did you hear it? We've seen some innovation -- sorry about that. Yes. My apologies. We've seen some innovation throughout the year. I think you'll continue to see it. There's things going on. But it's incidental really. I mean it's good, it will help, but the demand is such that we'll continue to see do that. We always go back and look at Europe and what's going on there, a lot of innovation in Europe.\n It's 3x [ cooler ] what we have here. And the cheapest form of moving generation is transmission. You still need -- still the cheapest form today, and it will be tomorrow and the next day. So I do think that the builds -- the multiyear builds are there. You have to balance the load, so you're seeing some equipment come in, synchrophasor, things like that, that are coming into the business that allows some balance. You're starting to see that show up from an equipment standpoint. We'll install it.\n There's software out there that's helping some on a distribution level, transmission level. But it's -- I still think even with innovation, we got a long way to go on infrastructure. No. I think to the contrary, the investments necessary there in methane releases, things of that nature. When you start looking at natural gas systems, they're more valuable today because we're not building as much new system. I mean there's a considerable amount of new systems being built, but in certain areas where you're replacing [ caster ] and other lines with polyethylene and more, you're building a modern network. That's certainly there and will continue to be there. We see an uptick in the business, not a downtick. Yes. I want to thank the 52,800 people out in the field that pay our paychecks and do what they do everyday in inclement weather. We can't say enough about their performance and the safety and the things that they do on a daily basis. Our field leadership is the best in the world. The management team that we have here is certainly something that we're extremely proud of. We're proud of where the company is going, and thank you for participating in the call today."
