At this time, I would now like to turn the call over to RPM's, Chairman and CEO, Mr. Frank Sullivan, for opening remarks. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you, Sarah. Good morning, and welcome to the RPM International Inc. investor call for our fiscal 2020 fourth quarter and year ended May 31, 2020. On the call with me today are, Rusty Gordon, RPM's Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Matt Ratajczak, our Vice President of Global Tax and Treasury, who has also taken on the responsibilities for our Investor Relations activities. On the call today, I'll provide an overview of our performance for the quarter and an update on our MAP to Growth operating improvement program; Matt will follow me with a review of our fourth quarter financial results; and then Rusty will wrap up our formal remarks with our outlook for fiscal '21. After that we'll be pleased to take your questions. Leading up to the coronavirus pandemic, our business was trending towards a quarter and year of record sales and record adjusted earnings. However, as expected, our fourth quarter consolidated results were impacted by the economic fallout created by the pandemic, which, to various degrees interrupted our manufacturing and distribution operations, as well as the maintenance, repair and construction activities of many of our customers around the world. At various times during the quarter, we had more than 10 manufacturing facilities closed, along with multiple other sales offices and distribution centers, due to government mandated closures mostly outside of the United States, and for disinfecting and cleaning facilities related to health and safety protocols. During the pandemic, we have taken decisive action to restrict travel, limit access to our facilities and establish safety protocols and allow those who could effectively perform their jobs remotely to do so. Through it all, we have remained focused on protecting the health and well-being of our associates and their families, and are playing a role in inhibiting the spread of the coronavirus in the communities in which we operate. Thanks to our associates' efforts to follow our comprehensive health and safety protocols, nearly all of our manufacturing facilities and distribution centers have been open and operational since our fiscal year end. The COVID-19 generated challenges during the quarter resulted in an 8.9 decline in our consolidated sales, which was better than the decline of 10% to 15% we anticipated and discussed on our April call. On a geographic basis, our sales were essentially flat in the U.S., where construction and hardware channels were generally deemed essential, but were down 25% in international markets, where many of our businesses were ordered closed by government mandates. The primary driver of our better than expected top line results was the growing demand throughout the quarter in the U.S. for our Consumer Group's small project paints, caulks, sealants, repair products, wood stains and specialty cleaners. Consumer had additional time for home improvement, maintenance and repair projects because of the stay at home orders across our country. They were able to purchase the products they needed through e-commerce portals, which grew dramatically during the quarter, as well as our retail partners and our broad distribution base of DIY stores, which were among the businesses that were considered essential to the economy, and we're able to remain open and operational. The performance of our Consumer segment relative to our other segments highlights the long - highlighted value of RPM's diverse operating company portfolio, where weakness in one segment is often offset by strength in another. Our fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.13 while below last year's all-time high results still represent our second best fourth quarter on record. The decline in adjusted diluted EPS was equivalent to the drop in sales illustrating our quick response to reduce costs during the economic downturn, as well as the ongoing success of our MAP to Growth operating improvement program. Coronavirus safety protocols such as limits on travel and facility access slowed some of the planned activities that were part of our Phase III of the MAP to Growth program, particularly manufacturing improvement initiatives, which were nearing their end particularly including plant closures and ERP consolidations. However, in response to the economic downturn created by the pandemic, we quickly took proactive measures to accelerate the MAP to Growth cost reduction initiatives, with a focus on delayering management and other areas of administration. As a result, we remain on track to achieving or exceeding our original annual cost savings of $290 million. During the fourth quarter, we announced the closure of three plants, which brings our total to 22 out of the 31 plants were originally targeted for closure and consolidation at the beginning of the MAP to Growth program. As we mentioned last quarter, due to the pandemic induced delays in executing some of our restructuring initiatives, we will be extending the timeline to achieving our original MAP to Growth objectives. This includes our goal of repurchasing $1 billion of our stock, which was more than halfway completed, but suspended in mid-March, as a response to the pandemic and its economic impact. There is still too much uncertainty at this point to set a new target date for completion, as the global economy stabilizes, and we gain more visibility in the business conditions, we will communicate our new MAP initiatives and growth timeline in the coming quarters. Expenses were dramatically down in our non-operating segment due to the coronavirus pandemic. Medical costs were lower due to lower volumes, management incentives and long term programs were reversed, travel was banned, and use of outside consultants was curtailed. We will continue to be aggressive in managing all cost expenses in areas of the business within our control to drive performance and continue to navigate through this unprecedented environment. As a result of the economic uncertainty created by the pandemic, we are focused on generating strong cash flow and maintaining liquidity. At year end, we reported record operating cash flow of $550 million, as a result of good working capital management and margin improvement initiatives from our MAP to Growth program. Our procurement team formed as part of the MAP program has recently done an incredible job of improving payables by negotiating better terms with our suppliers, which will continue to benefit cash flow in the coming quarters. At May 31, 2020, our total liquidity, including cash and committed revolving credit facilities stood at $1.280 billion. I'll now turn the call over to Matt Ratajczak, who will review our financial results for fiscal 2020 fourth quarter on an adjusted basis.\nMatt Ratajczak: Thanks Frank, and good morning, everyone. Please note that my comments will be on an adjusted basis as Frank noted. During the fourth quarter, we generated consolidated net sales of 1.46 billion, a decrease of 8.9% compared to the 1.6 billion reported during the same period of fiscal 2019. Organic sales declined 7.9% or 126.6 million. Acquisitions contributed 0.7% of sales or 10.7 million. Foreign exchange was a headwind that reduced sales by 1.7% or 26.5 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.13, a decrease of 8.9% compared to the record $1.24 in last year's fourth quarter. Our consolidated adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, EBIT decreased 11.5% to 213.6 million compared to 241.4 million reported in the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter. Turning now to our segments. Sales at our Construction Products Group were down 15.6% to 472.4 million compared to 559.6 million a year ago. Organic sales declined 13.9% or 77.9 million. Acquisitions contributed 0.7% or 4.1 million to sales. Foreign currency translation reduced sales by 2.4% or 13.4 million. Adjusted EBIT in the segment was down 12.1% to 77.3 million compared to adjusted EBIT of 87.9 million during last year's fourth quarter. The segment's strength was its U.S. roofing business, which experienced limited interruption from the pandemic as most roofing projects, which are completed outdoors and do not require entry into customers' facilities, were able to proceed. The season for roofing applications was broadened when schools closed early allowing us to meet demand from this customer base. The segment performed better in the U.S. However, in certain international markets, where construction was not considered essential, the segment experienced significant sales declines. International results were further challenged by currency headwinds. While the segment sales declined during the quarter, earnings declined in a lesser rate, due largely to the success of the MAP to Growth program, which included the closure of two manufacturing plants and proactive measures taken to cut expenses. Sales in our Performance Coatings Group were down 20.2% to 235.1 million compared to the 294.5 million we reported during last year's fourth quarter. Organic sales declined 18.3% or 54 million. Acquisitions added 0.2% of sales or $0.5 million. While foreign exchange was a headwind of 2% or 5.9 million. Segment adjusted EBIT was down 31.9% to 23.7 million compared to 34.7 million reported during last year's fourth quarter. The segment quickly responded to the economic downturn, created by COVID-19 by delayering management and aggressively reducing fixed costs, particularly in areas of the business that serve the energy industry, as well as other affected sectors. Similar to our Construction Products segment, the Performance Coatings Group also performed better in the U.S. and internationally. Although segment sales declined, earnings did not decrease as much as would be expected on a detrimental basis due to operating improvements from our MAP to Growth program. In the Consumer Group sales were strong increasing 6.7% to 616.2 million from 577.5 million during last year's fourth quarter. Organic sales increased 7.7% or 44.6 million. Foreign currency translation reduced sales by 1% or 5.9 million. Adjusted EBIT in the segment was down 4% to 104.5 million compared to 108.8 million in the prior year period. While U.S. sales were up 12%, international markets struggled due to more stringent lockdown orders on manufacturing and retail. Overall, the Consumer Group sales results for the quarter were excellent, given they are in comparison to a very strong fourth quarter last year, when we made large market share gains. Our associates went to extraordinary lengths to deliver products to our customers in spite of supply chain challenges. The bottom line was impacted by higher operating expenses for safety measures and equipment, as well as distribution cost due to increased e-commerce orders all that were required to function during the pandemic. These costs are expected to be temporary, and were not passed along to our customers. As part of our MAP to Growth initiatives, we closed a Australian manufacturing facility, which will benefit our bottom line in the coming quarters. Specialty Products Group sales were 135.2 million during the fiscal 2020 fourth quarter compared to sales of 169.7 million in the prior year period, which was a decline of 20.3%. Organic sales decreased 23.1% or 39.3 million. Acquisitions contributed 3.6% or 6.1 million to sales. Foreign currency translation reduced sales by 0.8% or 1.4 million. Adjusted EBIT in the segment was down 72% to 7.3 million in the fiscal 2020 fourth quarter compared to 26.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Overall, the segment accounted for 9% of the quarter's consolidated sales. The number of the segment\u2019s businesses serves OEM markets that have struggled during the pandemic, such as furniture and marine distributors that were closed for an extended period of time in the U.S. because they were not classified as being essential industries. I'll now turn the call over to Rusty, who will walk through our outlook for fiscal 2021.\nRusty Gordon: Thanks Matt. After lockdown restrictions caused our sales to decline in April and May, we expect to resume our growth in our fiscal 2021 first quarter since our sales have begun to trend better. As a result, our outlook for the first quarter is to resume the growth and earnings leverage more typical of the results seen in recent quarters, with sales to be up in the low single digits and adjusted EBIT growth of 20% or more compared to the prior year. For the full year of fiscal 2021, we anticipate our Construction Products Group and Performance Coatings Group could experience sales declines for the first three quarters and then turn positive in the fourth quarter. Our Consumer Group should continue its sales momentum into fiscal 2021. The Specialty Products Group is expected to face negative sales comparison during the first two quarters, which should turn positive in the back half of the year. These projections assume that we do not experience a second round of lockdowns related to COVID-19. Due to the continued economic uncertainty around the length and severity of the pandemic, we are not providing earnings guidance for the full year of fiscal 2021 at this time. While the pandemic continues, we remain focused on our core, well-being of our employees and their families and growing the business, where we can. While RPM's growth was temporarily interrupted by COVID-19 lockdowns in the last quarter, we are keeping our foot on the gas and executing our MAP to Growth program. In a world of uncertainty and unknowns, we are focused on managing the areas of the business that we can control. Our operations and management teams have bought into this program, which has proven very beneficial in driving efficiency, increasing our cash flow and making us more competitive. We have just started to make progress on inventory reduction and the benefits from ERP consolidation and associated administrative savings are in our final wave of our MAP to Growth program. So there is still a plentiful to do list for future operational efficiencies, continuous improvement and cost savings. With so much change going on at RPM, let me spend a moment on things that are not changing. We will maintain our entrepreneurial culture, which is one of our core strength. Through it, we remain nimble to adjust to market conditions, which is especially important in this uncertain and volatile environment. We will continue to invest in innovation to maintain industry leading organic growth. We will continue to deliver maintenance and repair solutions, which are relatively recession resistant and have served us well during past economic downturns. We will be focused on cash flow and selective in acquisition activity, while maintaining a preference for debt reduction in lieu of share repurchases. We look forward to continuing our track record of increasing our cash dividend for 47th consecutive year. This concludes our formal comments. We will now be pleased to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nMike Sison: Nice quarter there. In terms of your first quarter outlook, I'm having a little bit of hard time visualizing low single digit growth. Can you may - can maybe walk through how much improvement you see in some of the segments, and is it really just another strong quarter for Consumer Products to - to really get there?\nFrank Sullivan: So that's a great question, particularly in light of all the volatility that everybody is seeing. And, so we'll make some comments like we did in April by providing some insight into our months. I look forward to getting back to not doing that. I'm just talking about quarters and years. But because of the volatility, I think it's appropriate. So our June results grew double digit and that was across most of our businesses, and it's a combination of continuing good consumer takeaway at - in our Consumer segment and businesses, I think solid performance in our industrial, particularly construction related businesses, some of which clearly was a pent-up work from April and May that was interrupted. Our July results seem to be flat year-over-year and that's a mix between our segments and our geographies, as Rusty indicated earlier or Matt indicated. We've had either flat or solid results in the U.S. and different results in different parts of the world. I think what's obvious in our results in the fourth quarter and in our forecast for Q1 is the MAP to Growth program is working. We are still building momentum. We have more work to do. And in an environment, where we're able to put up solid, low to mid single digit revenue growth, you'll see really solid EBIT leverage to our bottom line. So I think the biggest concern we have is volatility around - like everybody around what might happen in coming months relative to reactions to the coronavirus health pandemic. But other than that we're in pretty good shape and the MAP to Growth program is delivering, when we have solid revenue growth.\nMike Sison: And a quick follow-up. Just how much MAP to Growth did contributed in the fourth quarter. And I mean, I think if you look at the growth in the first quarters and really think about how that's strong EBIT growth, is that really the primary driver there? Or are there other maybe factors coming in lower raw materials, pricing and such to get that impressive growth in the first quarter?\nRusty Gordon: Sure. Yes. The MAP program continues to build momentum. Mike, this is Rusty here. In the third quarter, we said, we had MAP savings year-over-year incremental in the low $20 million range, and we're probably closer in the mid $20 million range in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nJohn McNulty: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe a little bit deeper on the MAP to Growth side. It sounds like you got more progress done maybe this past quarter than maybe you had originally hope for. I guess, how should we be thinking about the savings rate, as we run into 2021. How much incrementally, do you think you can pull out given, there still are some COVID-related restrictions, but it does look like you've - you may be pulled some levers in other areas?\nFrank Sullivan: So the November of 2018, we laid out a three-pronged wave and roughly each wave on a ongoing sustained basis was generating about $100 million. And we have that as a goal for our third wave, which starts on June 1 - which started on June 1. And I think when we are completed with this, we will exceed the original $290 million forecast by a few tens of millions of dollars. But some of the progress in the third wave will be delayed because of getting into plants has been a challenge, particularly with outside consultants, some of the ERP stuff has been delayed. The third wave especially the back end of it really will impact fiscal '22 and really solid performance in fiscal '20, should provide us with pretty strong leverage to the bottom line in fiscal '21, as we highlighted. Obviously it is revenue dependent because a big slug of our savings that's working really well and better than originally anticipated, is in the manufacturing and continuous improvement efforts, as well as broadly our procurement activities, and they're working really well. But from an accounting perspective, we had this conversation with a different analyst on a prior call, those savings get capitalized into inventory, and they flow through our P&L when we sell that inventory. So any amount of sales will bode well for our bottom line. Obviously if we bump into some future reduced revenues because of this pandemic, then the impact of our savings, particularly in the gross margin will be delayed.\nJohn McNulty: And then, I guess the second thing would be, it sounds like Europe or certainly the international markets really took a tough time in your fiscal fourth quarter. Now that it looks like some of the European economies have kind of reopened and actually it seems like maybe they're making up for lost time. I guess, can you give us some color as to how those markets are playing out for you and kind of what your expectations are there?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. The European market is slowly recovering. It was very difficult in Q4, as you mentioned because we had government mandated shutdowns in the U.K., in different parts of Europe and throughout Latin America, also in the couple of plants we have in India. With the reopenings in the U.K., we're seeing the same type of strong DIY demand that we're in the U.S.. That is true to a lesser extent, but still positive in continental Europe in the consumer side. We're seeing sequential improvement in our industrial businesses, our Construction Products Group and Performance Coatings Group specialty products. So we're seeing sequential improvement certainly from April and May, into June, in the summer, not necessarily year-over-year strength because of the strong performance we had last year. Our year - while we're not providing guidance. Will really be a good one or a great one based upon our performance in these coming quarters, as the fourth quarter for us and everybody, but particularly given our May 31 year-end. We'll have some pretty extraordinary year-over-year growth given the impact of the coronavirus and global shutdowns in the fourth quarter we just reported.\nJohn McNulty: And maybe if I can ask one, just a quick last question. I know in the last 12 months to 18 months or so, you've gained a lot of share, you've won a bunch of new accounts, I guess can you speak to kind of the progression of that, and if you're still continuing to see wins or if the COVID issues have maybe kind of put some of that on hold and that may be more of a future dynamic to be thinking about?\nFrank Sullivan: I think we're holding our own. The supply chain issues are challenging for everybody. Our fill rates into our customers are at lower levels than they have ever been. I think we're equal to or similar to our peer competitors, but there have been some disruptions in packaging and can supplies that are going to continue and some rising costs there. There have been some distribution disruptions. And so that's a challenge. But what is happening at RPM is continuing and it's very exciting, and it's nascent in a couple of areas. So for instance, the partnership from a market facing perspective between our Construction Products Group and our Consumer Group is having some exciting wins. You can find the Tremco, Vulkem, Urethane sealants in Menards. You can find Tremco branded five gallon pails of unique Tremco roof coating materials in Home Depot in Texas. And these are fledgling opportunities for us to take some of our industrial construction chemical brands and construction sealants and products and coatings and waterproofing products into some of our stronger home center channels. And so the opportunity for market share gains and growth there is pretty exciting for us. We're in the early stages there, but it's exciting. We just got into Walmart with a grab-and-go house paint program, which is a first for us through Rust Oleum. And so that is nascent, but also exciting. So the opportunities for us to continue to grow in those areas continue to receive our focus, and we're working hard to make them successful.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Your line is now open.\nFrank Mitsch: Listen if you talk about the fiscal first quarter, which is off to a terrific start, you're guiding sales up low single digits, June up double digits, July flat that implies August will be down upper single digits. You alluded to strong performance last year, but what else are you seeing that at this point you're calling for August to be down upper single digits in terms of sales?\nMatt Ratajczak: Yes. I'm not sure that's exactly accurate, but it's just volatile Frank. It's - we've never seen volatility like this from one geography to another. And I think there is some nervousness not only by us - by others about some of these rising COVID cases and what government responses might be. So it's hard to predict. This was the most difficult planning year we've ever experienced. And so it behooved us to plan conservatively and focus on the things as Rusty said that we can control in terms of executing our MAP initiatives, controlling costs and focusing on cash flow. And so I - that's - my reference to the difference between a good year and a great year is in light of the things that we can control, and we're doing well. If revenues are better than we anticipate, we'll have a really solid year. If revenues are where we - are concerned about, we'll still do relatively well because of the things, part of it, it's just luck. I think we're fortunate to be in the midst of a operating improvement program is delivering good result, while the whole world is dealing with the consequences of the health pandemic.\nFrank Mitsch: If I understand your answer correctly, you're taking a bit of a swag at August. It is not a fait accompli at this point that it's going to be down upper single digits, you're just - you've got - obviously got a lot of uncertainty? Or as you look at your order book, you pretty much can dial it in that - that's what it's going to turn out to be because obviously June is very solid, July slowed down, and so you're just projecting that trend or I mean, I'm just trying to get your level of certainty around August being as difficult, as your guidance suggests?\nRusty Gordon: We don't have a level of certainty about future months. And not to be negative, I think, our trends right now are good. But like everybody, I think our visibility, our trust and our ability to forecast forward, which for us is usually two quarters, so you're looking at anywhere from four months to six months is low as it's ever been. And so that's the best answer I can give you.\nFrank Mitsch: That's fair. That's very fair. And then just one last question here. You obviously mentioned how e-commerce played a much bigger role in the fiscal fourth quarter given that the future maybe quite a bit different than past practices. Is that impacting your thinking longer term on how you distribute your materials and shift resources around. And are there any kind of guiding lessons that post pandemic will change the way RPM operates?\nFrank Sullivan: I don't think it changes the way we operate. It will continue to allow us to partner with our big customers in ways that will continue to expand e-commerce. Many of our products aren't the most naturally purchased online because of shipping issues, or flammability issues or weight to value issues. But our volume with Home Depot.com doubled, our volume on Amazon doubled. Now that the U.K. is picking back up, we have an MRO business over there called Watco that was a catalog kind of business that went to online, and consumers are finding that and that business is increasing dramatically. And so I think the big takeaway for us here that we're excited about, but time will tell, and this is unique to RPM, the stay at home orders in the United States and it seems true in the U.K. as well has created a greater number of confident DIYers. This isn't just about paint, but wood stains and finishes that tend to be more craft work and require more skill. Those volumes are up pretty dramatically. And so across a number of DIY categories, I think one of the interesting outcomes is understanding is there a larger, more confident DIY base, than there would have been otherwise. And we hope that's true and we'll find out.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with G Research. Your line is now open.\nRosemarie Morbelli: Following up on the e-commerce part, Frank. If I understand probably it is mostly on the retail side, on the consumer side. And could you share with us the size of that e-commerce?\nFrank Sullivan: I wouldn't do it specifically, but it's collectively across RPM tens of millions of dollars. And so the percent year-over-year growth is very impressive. The percent of our consolidated sales is not a lot.\nRosemarie Morbelli: And is that particular business does it have a similar margin to your other businesses or does it have a higher level - higher margin level?\nFrank Sullivan: It's hard to know. In the fourth quarter, it had lower margins because distribution cost were greater, and we had some ramp-up costs there. And so long term, the pricing model, and the gross margins aren't a lot different, but the distribution costs were higher. And so there is a lot to learn there in terms of efficiency. It also is higher because again, the volume on a relative basis is relatively low.\nRosemarie Morbelli: So you're focusing on innovations. Could you talk about new products are still coming out this year or maybe coming out next year. And you mentioned the Walmart grab-and-go paint program. Does that mean that you're getting into architectural program or is it something else?\nFrank Sullivan: It means that we have a nascent program of wall paint at Walmart and are certainly learning.\nRosemarie Morbelli: And what are the type of innovations or new products are coming through the pipeline?\nRusty Gordon: Sure. This is Rusty. One product, which we're excited about is Rust-Oleum home. This is a flooring transformation product. It's a two-step coating process, where you could put this coating overall laminate floors or wood floors and create a brand new look, and we're very excited about that. Another one on our Construction Products side is our PM our PUMA range of product for Tremco used in both roofing and deck coatings. We have AlphaGuard PUMA and Vulkem EWS for protection of concrete. This is a waterproof coating that can be applied as low as negative 20 degrees Fahrenheit. It uses polyurethane-methacrylate technology. It has great adhesion characteristics, elongation characteristics and is very durable. So those are a couple of examples.\nFrank Sullivan: And I'll add one thing for fiscal '21, we actually manufactured some of those resins in a factory in Germany, and we export those to the U.S., where some of the more unique Tremco roofing coating products. And in fiscal '21, we have cut back, where appropriate on our CapEx. But one of the major capital spends that we'll go forward is a $20 million to $30 million spend on a new roof coatings factory relative to the growth there, and also bringing our capability to produce those unique resins to the U.S.\nRosemarie Morbelli: And if I may sneak in one more. You're expecting difficult quarters for the first nine months for Construction and Performance Coatings. I can see Performance Coatings. I can see the seasonality for Construction in Q2 and Q3, but could you give us more details on the first quarter because it's based on how you phrased it, it sounds as though Q1 will also be a difficult quarter for Construction, and yet, we're still in the midst of things?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I'll just repeat the comments I made, and hope to get to a point, where we're not providing monthly comments. But our June month was double digit in consolidated sales and not every business was up, but most all of our businesses were up year-over-year including in our Construction Products Group. We think some of the strong growth is literally the carryover of April and May projects that were delayed or halted, and July revenues on a consolidated basis, are generally flat. And so, there'll be some variability, we think for month-to-month in the coming months and quarters, and that's the best we have right now. Obviously, we'll provide good detail on our first quarter when we report those results in October.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nSteve Byrne: Frank, what fraction of your revenue would you say is coming from DIYers now and the strength that you saw in June, do you think that's pulling demand from forward or do you think it's just an expansion of this DIYer base that you're referring to is a more confident DIYers. Do you think that those DIYers remain customers down the road or that business flips back to the way it used to get done?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. And so our Consumer business is, call it roughly $2 billion our Consumer segment and probably 25% of that is caulks, sealants, patch and repair products. Those product lines are probably 50% to 60% consumer and 40% to 50% pro. Our Specialty Coatings, our small project paints, the cleaning products, those tend to be more 75%, 80% consumer, and let's say 20%, 25% pro. So hopefully that gives you a break out there. The hardware store channel, home center store channel, major retailers were not interrupted by the shutdown orders in the United States. All of them to various degrees continued to operate. And so the strength we're seeing in the summer is a continuation of what we saw in the fourth quarter. And it is higher demand for DIY products, and we believe a growing base of confident DIYers and certainly will help us, and help - I think, the whole DIY segment in the future to what degree we'll find out.\nSteve Byrne: And I wanted to ask you a little bit about just operating in this pandemic environment, whether learnings that you took away from this over the last few months that are now impacting your outlook for MAP to Growth, are there new opportunities that you're seeing to drive cost cut. And what provoked the question was the comment about delayered management and performance coatings, it sounds like some headcount reductions can - and can you quantify that?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I'll make a few comments. Number one, everybody's learned a lot of lessons. We have a significant chunk of our employees working from home. And I would bet, we're learning that maybe 25% to 30% of our functions, and our individuals are capable of working remotely on a more permanent basis. And so that has a lot of consequences for, in some cases cost and other cases, travel. And so our T&E costs were down dramatically in Q4 that wasn't unique to RPM. So there's a lot of learning there about going forward, what level of travel and entertainment expense do you return to. And I don't know the answer to that question, but I'm pretty certain it's not 100% of what it used to be. So those are just some broad comment. On the MAP to Growth program, we're continuing to gain momentum. My guess is when we're done, the 31 consolidated plants will be a few more. How much of that was - would have happened in MAP to Growth versus how much of that is a combination of MAP to Growth and what we've learned in that process in a reaction to the COVID-19 impact on the economies, it's hard to tell. Same thing in SG&A. Our SG&A cost will continue to come down, and we're learning some lessons there. But it will be, as we go quarter-by-quarter, a combination of MAP to Growth savings and just outright responses to the economic circumstances we're operating in.\nSteve Byrne: And the headcount reduction in Performance Coatings?\nFrank Sullivan: So yeah, there is a - there are - across RPM, there are levels of temporary expense reductions. So T&E is a good example. We had various levels of salary reductions, the highest of which was mine at 30% that started in - on May 1. Those salary reductions as the year goes on, and we meet or exceed our goals will be rescinded. So those expenses will come back to the P&L. We've had some furloughs and plans, but we have also had a larger than MAP to Growth anticipated permanent headcount reduction in a number of businesses. In our Performance Coatings Group, they are the most economically sensitive. Out of $1 billion roughly in revenues, 250 million roughly is tied directly or indirectly to oil and gas. And so they will continue to be - of all of our groups, they will continue to be the most challenged on the top line for fiscal '21.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nArun Viswanathan: Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the great results here. So I guess, yeah, just first on MAP point and consumer you've described a pretty robust environment on the DIY side. I guess maybe, could you just reiterate, I guess, how long you think this will last, and why. And if so, if you still see continued growth there, is there any investments you're going to have to make in the supply chain? I'm just kind of recalling the troubles you had a couple of years ago on the DAP side, do you foresee anything like that happening? Is there any kind of increased capacity you'd have to consider putting in, in any of the product lines? Thanks.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So it's been very challenging again, not just unique to us, but across DIY product lines. Demand is up. I think that's new DIYers. Demand are up year-over-year because people will recall last year it was somewhat of a wet start to the first quarter, and we've had pretty spectacular weather across the United States. So that's driving demand. Supply chain challenges from some of our own distribution issues, freight problems, some of our customers pick up freight and that's been - we've had challenges there. Some of our suppliers, most recently in metal cans have had their own COVID related shutdowns that have impacted supply. So when your supply chain spend a decade or more in RPM, got on board maybe later than we should have, but we've been pursuing it very aggressively for two years efficiency, and you get hit with big spikes in demand. And then also temporary shutdowns in distribution centers and/or manufacturing facilities of some of your suppliers, it poses a problem. So everybody's managing through all those things. We're 90% done with a capacity expansion, for instance, in spray paint, and the European company that has been the principal supplier of that equipment is refusing to send any of their technicians to the United States. So we've got some really good big investments and some capacity increases that are on the verge of hitting the marketplace, and we're excited about that. But it's just one more example of how the COVID pandemic has disrupted plants.\nArun Viswanathan: And I guess, is there any kind of raw material outlook that we should be aware of? Have you seen any kind of deflation that would be beneficial to your margins?\nFrank Sullivan: We've seen some deflation in oil-based solvents and different raw materials there. We've seen particularly starting in the fourth quarter, some inflation, little pickup in TiO2 costs, pickup in packaging cost. We are - have heightened alert to some of the packaging particularly metal can situations relative to some shutdowns and some announced capacity constraints there. So even that continues to be volatile. It's one of the reasons that we had a - there were two issues in our Consumer Group in the fourth quarter, one was some higher raw material cost; and the other was higher distribution cost related to the e-commerce growth, as well as disruptions in the supply chain around distribution and freight. All of those things should settle down over time, unless we end up with another round of shutdowns or government directed actions related to coronavirus.\nArun Viswanathan: And then just lastly, I just want to go back to your comments around uses of cash. Again, you've made some improvement there, I guess, as part of MAP to Growth, reducing working capital and harvesting a little bit more cash. And I understand the environment is very uncertain right now and that's likely lead to your decision to kind of put some of the buybacks on hold. But when do you see kind of getting back to that program, and I guess, if it's not too soon, what would you be doing, I guess with the cash that you're going to generate this year?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. We - as you saw we had a record cash from operations generation for fiscal '20, and while some of that was a result of declines in revenues in Q4, a huge chunk of it, which is the benefits of our MAP to Growth program and focus on that. There is more to come. We're making improvements in working capital. But we're still a laggard versus our peers, and there's a lot of attention on that. Preference for capital allocation will be funding our operations. For instance, I mentioned the capacity expansion that we're close to completing in our Consumer Group, and the new capacity expansion that we're just starting in our Construction Products Group. We'll continue to look at acquisitions on a selective basis. I think where we could find the right fit that are at a good value, we'll continue to execute on those and there are opportunities there. That could pick up towards the end of the calendar year depending on private owner perceptions of political outlook and what that might mean for capital gains taxes or a state planning issues. So that's something we're paying attention to. But again, we intend to be very selective there. And then we'll have a preference for the time being over debt reduction for the share repurchase program until there is, I think a little more stability in our outlook, and a little more confidence that the disruptions of the coronavirus pandemic are mostly behind us. And so that, I suspect we'll look at that very closely with our Board throughout fiscal '21.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research. Your line is now open.\nKevin McCarthy: I'm curious to hear your thoughts regarding the margin outlook in Consumer, and in particular, we've obviously seen a lot of DIY strength, but you noted some elevated costs related to safety measures and supply chain expenses. What is the magnitude of those costs? And how do you see that flowing through in the fiscal first quarter and beyond?\nFrank Sullivan: So I think, across all of RPM, and this is hard to gauge the added costs of the response to coronavirus would be mid to high single digit millions. So somewhere in the $5 million to $10 million range. But the bigger impact was on revenues obviously, and that won't be forever. That was just such disruptions particularly in April and May, and particularly in international markets. We're focused on improving the margins of all of our businesses, in particular our Consumer business, our margins haven't fully recovered from where they were back in 2016, and there has been a lot of focus on operating efficiency at the plant level. We closed a number of plants across RPM, but I believe three of those have been in our Consumer segment. And so our efforts to really focus on being more efficient at the operating level on introducing lean manufacturing disciplines on different items, SIOP disciplines in our plants. These are things that were lost on me, five years ago, but are not lost on me or organization today. And they're having a benefit, and we're continuing to focus there. We've also reduced our supplier base, and it's helped us both improve terms and negotiate better pricing in a lot of places and become better strategic suppliers. So we're having discussions with a number of major suppliers at the RPM level that we hadn't had in the past. And so that's helping us as well. So we're keenly focused on all of those issues, and we'll continue to benefit from that in fiscal '21, as we continue to execute the rest of the MAP to Growth program.\nKevin McCarthy: Appreciate the color there. Secondly, how would you characterize your capital expenditure budget in fiscal 2021 relative to the 148 million in 2020?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes. Our current spend budget is about 130 million, which is down. But again, that was in a forecasting process that was pretty conservative. We do have a one major capital spend that for expansion in our Construction Products Group. Obviously, the Consumer capital spend, I referenced, most of that's behind us. We just got to get it through the finish line. That could change, as we get into the second half of the year and if our performance and the underlying economic dynamics are better than we anticipate. So because we cut back pretty aggressively. So 130 is what our current budget is. I hope we end up spending 150 because the world ends up being better than everybody anticipates.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nVincent Andrews: Just a couple of follow-ups on the Consumer Group. Frank, I just want to clarify, first you said July, I heard you said consolidated sales for the total company were flat in July. Can you clarify what Consumer was in July?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes. We'll provide the details on the quarter in October because I don't want to - as I said, I am - we were hesitant in April to get into monthly details, but given the volatility, felt the investor community deserve that. That's why we're providing some details now in our quarter, but it's not over, and we'll report our results there. Other than I would refer you to the comments that Rusty made and the direction we provided in our earnings release this morning. We anticipate solid kind of low to mid single digit growth in our Consumer segment across the year.\nVincent Andrews: And then if I could just ask on - I'm just trying to bridge the sales in Consumer down to the EBIT line, you subsequently called out that you had $5 million to $10 million of COVID cost across the company. It sounds like a lot of those were probably in Consumer just because of the e-commerce issue, you also referenced higher raw material costs. So I'm just trying to think about sequentially from F4Q into F1Q, whether we should see a material improvement assuming there is some sales growth, whether EBIT should actually - I assume EBIT should be growing in the fiscal first quarter in Consumer rather than in the fourth quarter declined despite 7.7% organic sales growth. Is that - anything you can do to help us there?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes, probably not what you're looking for. But just to repeat that, as we sit here today, it looks like the first quarter will drive on a consolidated basis, low single digit revenue growth and a EBIT growth of 20% or better year-over-year.\nVincent Andrews: And then maybe just lastly, I appreciate your comments on sort of the new confident DIYers, and I'd also just like to get your perspective on because it seems to me this isn't just a shift of pro to DIY obviously that's happening to a certain extent, it also seems like the home improvement, the size of that pie is probably increasing in COVID despite the fact that overall consumer discretionary spending is going to - is going to decline. So would you agree with that idea that we're kind of in a new home improvement renovation cycle? And yeah, maybe DIY is going to have more share of that than it would have in the past for any number of reasons, but just the idea that the overall pie might be expanding?\nFrank Sullivan: Absolutely. I mean, I think there are new gardeners that weren't gardeners before this spring. I think there are new users of our wood stains and finishes product, and I reference that one in particular because it tends to be more craft or more project. It's not a simple paint this or - and - again, our small project paints are more project driven and more craft and more unique. But all the things that we see suggest whether it's gardening or the use of small project paints or confidence in being able to do repairs themselves that the base of home improvement in DIY has expanded in the spring. And that's continuing nicely throughout the summer months.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Your line is now open.\nMike Harrison: Just looking at the margin performance that you had in the Construction segment, I was wondering, you mentioned the strength that you were seeing in the roofing business, was wondering if that was maybe driving some mix benefits as well. Just trying to get a sense of whether we can expect the margin strength to continue as we get into '21 even if there are still some challenges from a demand standpoint in Construction?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes. That's a great question. And I'll tell you, if you look at our Construction Products Group through nine months, they had really benefited from good execution on MAP to Growth; they've really benefited from being very strategic and where they were investing for growth in terms of new products. They are leading the roof restoration coating market significantly, and that whole thing is growing. And they've got competitors that are coming on, but they are still the leader there. And even in the fourth quarter again, great question. When you look at a revenue base that was down 14% or 15% and an EBIT that was down concurrently 12, it tells you that there was good mix, but it also tells you the benefits of the MAP to Growth program in our Construction Products Group. That Group has been really leading in a lot of areas for us. And I referenced earlier, we're excited about the future cooperation or synergy, if you'll between our Construction Products Group technology and some of the brands and our Consumer Group strength in some of the home centers. So there - hopefully will be more to come there. We've got some good introductory products in a couple of tests. And if they prove out to be successful that's a whole new area of growth for us in the home center channel with Construction Products Group technology.\nMike Harrison: I don't think we talked at all about the Specialty business. You mentioned that they were impacted by their exposure to some of the OEMs that it - that are closed during the quarter, areas like wood coatings for furniture or powder coatings. Have those OEMs gotten back up and running at this point. Maybe just a little more color on what you're seeing there?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes. They have. And so if you're in marine coatings like our marine business, if you're in the treatment for furniture, as well as the furniture protection insurance business, with our - which our Guardian business is in. Furniture stores were closed. For a period of time, most of our outlets for our marine coatings were closed. And while it wasn't true-up of a month, from one week to the next, we have revenues that were down 70% or 80% because their customers were closed. So it's pretty shocking. And it gives you a sense of what's happening to a lot of small businesses because their product lines or businesses that are part of RPM or other big companies that have survived this because they are part of a bigger group. And so those order shows bad weeks are behind us. All of our customers are up and running. And we're starting to pick back up. And so that was a particularly hard hit portion of RPM's business, but it was the business that got particularly most impacted by shutdown orders of their customer base.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Silke Kueck with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nSilke Kueck: I was wondering if you could tell me what your MAP savings are cumulative since you started the program. And whether you could just like roughly stick it in three buckets that you measure like manufacturing, procurement, general administrative?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes. I don't have that off the top of my head. I know that we laid out pretty good detail of three waves. First wave was 101 million, I think and we exceeded that by about 10 million. Second wave, which we just finished was about the same and we're slightly ahead of that. The third wave, we think will be delayed a little bit. You'll recall that our - the area that I think is doing the best is manufacturing. I think we had $70 million or $75 million of total benefit split roughly between plant consolidation and continuous improvement. And when we finish fiscal '21, we'll have come close to $100 million of benefit in the manufacturing area between the benefit of plant closures. But the continuous improvement aspect has really been a home run for us. And there's more to come there incrementally obviously less, but that's a process. It becomes a permanent part of RPM, we call it MS-168. And so there is some elements of the MAP to Growth program that will be permanently part of our culture and that's one of them. Our procurement activities have done particularly well. We were able to work with a major financial institution on some vendor financing, which has helped us with terms. And we've had some pretty, pretty good success in some areas we didn't anticipate, like distribution of all kinds of small stuff. And so that's going pretty well. And we're continuing to look for some new alternatives or new opportunities to continue to expand the benefits of the MAP to Growth program beyond the original communicated goals back in November of 18.\nSilke Kueck: In your slides, you sort of like layout, all of the non-recurrent items. And I think you're restructuring expenses like, last year were like 42 million and like this year 34 million, just restructuring, part of it. Is that 75 million has that been spent already? Or there's still costs that you - there's still cash related items what cash outflows that you expect from those charges you took?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. Silke, you'll see that in Note B of our 10-K, when we release that at the end of the day, and it will give you the outlook for future costs and restructuring.\nSilke Kueck: I just was wondering whether the - like those are like reserves that you take. I was wondering whether you've already paid those out?\nFrank Sullivan: Well, yes, there is a lot of severance in our restructuring cost, as you'll see in Note B, and we have paid out a lot. But we continue to have severance costs, as we continue to close facilities.\nMatt Ratajczak: But yes, I don't believe on the severance piece or the expense piece, there is anything that is a reserve that hasn't been paid out in cash. There are - to a much lesser extent than we had particularly in year one, some consulting contracts that were tied into in terms of completing different work. But there, I don't think, there are any big - to your question, there are no big slugs of cash that are not already spent. To the extent we have reactions to an economic challenge continuing with COVID-19, then we would highlight those and incur the expense at the time.\nSilke Kueck: Your corporate costs like you used to run like something like 80 million a year, and like I think this year was like 63 million and maybe it's not like nothing in the fourth quarter because of the curtailments that you took. What do you target for fiscal '21?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. Yes Silke, in a typical quarter, our non-operating segment costs are a little over 20 million usually, and they were a way down in the fourth quarter as you saw. The year-over-year variance about half of it was related to medical. And those costs, we basically allocate those at the beginning of the year on a per employee basis to our operating companies. And as you probably know, 99% of our employees do not work at corporate. But as the year unfolds, and we get actual experience for the good or bad, in medical, that experience hits our non-operating segment. And in the fourth quarter, as medical claims went down, as people avoided doctor visits, we had a favorable variance in medical. So we would expect some of that to continue in the first quarter, and we'll see beyond that. So our first quarter probably should be a little better than the usual low 20s of millions of expense in the non-op segment.\nMatt Ratajczak: Yeah. So in general, you're correct. I would assume about 20 million or 20 million or 22 million of non-op expense. Obviously, we didn't have that in Q4. We'll do better than that in Q1. And how the year unfolds, we'll certainly let people know. That Q4 experience by the way wasn't unique to us. The reduction in medical expense and medical visits was pretty universal across all businesses, at least in the United States.\nSilke Kueck: Yes. I was just like curious of like what the trends were. And then last, I was wondering, if I can just touch upon the - like again the sort of expenses you incurred in the Consumer business. Was that order - can you quantify that in some way, was it like a 10 million headwind in the quarter, was that figure was at lower sort of have some fear for what happened?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes. We haven't provided a lot of detail there. We had some raw material inflation in Consumer again, mostly around packaging that we expect to continue. You've all seen some of the announcements of some of the - and particular, can and metal packaging suppliers. We had higher expense for DIY. And I think somebody rightly assumed, if we had $5 million to $10 million of COVID expense in terms of safety issues and other issues across the whole corporation, it was disproportionately in Consumer. But I think that's all the detail that we provided on that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Your line is now open.\nJosh Spector: Thanks for squeezing in my question. Just a question on the strength in U.S. roofing activities. I was wondering if you could comment on any risk of pull forward in some of those projects either from later this year or maybe even from next year. I don't know if you could share anything that you're hearing from any customers or contractors on that front?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I think our Consumer - I'm sorry, our roofing business in our Construction Products Group, they're continuing to perform very well. There is no doubt that the June results that we had sales wise, when you follow pretty negative months in April and May, and your June is up double digit in revenues that some of that June business was the result of projects that were delayed or halted in April and May. So there is certainly some of that. But beyond that, I think somebody earlier had asked about mix and we expect to continue to see good mix in our Construction Products Group. The roofing business generally is less economically impacted than the construction sealants business, which has an element of DIY, but - not DIY, an element of maintenance and repair, but also an element of new construction. So that's more impacting the construction sealants business than the roofing and waterproofing business.\nJosh Spector: And I guess, similarly in Performance, you talked about some negative impact from contractors not being able to get into customer sites to perhaps supply the - the flooring materials. Are you seeing any change in that behavior currently?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes, slowly. And so there is more opportunity again, in the early part of the first quarter, for instance in our Stonhard roofing business for our crews and/or independent contractors to get into facilities and do the work. Certainly, sequentially, it's much better than April and May. Although, it's still an issue in certain industries and certain facilities. And we anticipate that continuing to improve, unless, of course, we're hit with another negative response from a business perspective on the COVID health pandemic.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Your line is now open.\nGhansham Panjabi: So on Consumer, I'm sorry if I missed this, but can you break out for us how the segment performed by the various geographies during the fourth quarter. And then, Frank, on your comment on the spike in costs related to e-commerce, is that just because of the abruptness of the change during the quarter. I just trying to get a better sense as to what you're referring to, just because obviously there's going to be some consumer behavioral shifts going forward, e-commerce is a massive winner, and I would assume there, it's only going to grow from here for you?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So in response to the e-commerce question, we mostly ship truckloads to distribution, whether it's major home centers sending their own trucks to pick up our goods or us sending truckloads either direct or through two step distribution. And in e-commerce, in some cases, we're shipping to a customer, and in other cases, we're shipping, direct to the consumer in small quantities. And so that brings with it a higher cost. Does that answer your question?\nGhansham Panjabi: It does. And on the international piece?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes. On the international piece, our growth organically in the U.S. in our Consumer segment in Q4 was 12%, and we were negative everywhere else.\nGhansham Panjabi: And just one final question on the guidance for the first quarter of 20% plus increase in adjusted EBIT. That's just rounding up a little bit about 40 million on an absolute basis year-over-year. How much of this is - of this increases from MAP to Growth? And then how should we think about the raw material cost dynamics as well?\nFrank Sullivan: We'll give you the details on that when we report the first quarter in October.\nGhansham Panjabi: But you ended the fourth quarter in the mid 20s right, in terms of MAP to Growth. Is that correct?\nFrank Sullivan: Correct.\nMatt Ratajczak: That's correct.\nOperator: This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Frank Sullivan for closing remarks.\nFrank Sullivan: Thanks, Sarah. In the coming weeks, we'll release our first formal Environmental Social and Governance Report. Well, this will be our first official report. ESG considerations have always been an important part of how we operate at RPM. In my opening letter, I'll discuss the fundamental values that have driven RPM sustain growth over the decades. We have long believed that responsibly serving the needs of our associates, customers and communities results in long term generation of stockholder value. While societies asking more of companies than ever before in ensuring safe ethical and sustainable business practices and creating environments that promote inclusion and social justice. Our ESG report will demonstrate how these values have always been a priority at RPM. At the same time, we recognize there is more work to do. We look forward to further advancing this work. It's continuing to play an integral role in the communities we serve. And once you've had a chance to review this document, we would welcome your feedback and your input. I'd like to close by expressing my gratitude to our associates' around the world for their hard work and resilience during these uncertain times. They've adapted to challenging conditions created by the health pandemic, and are finding unique and innovative ways to safely continue operating our businesses and serving our customers, while maintaining health protocols to their benefit, their families and the communities in which we operate. Many thanks to our shareholders for your continued investment in RPM. We remain focused on completing our MAP to Growth program, and also generating long term value for your investment. And everyone on the call, I wish you and your family's good health. Thank you for joining us on our call today. And we look forward to reporting to you our first quarter results in early October. Thanks, and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Matt Ratajczak",
            "content": "Thanks Frank, and good morning, everyone. Please note that my comments will be on an adjusted basis as Frank noted. During the fourth quarter, we generated consolidated net sales of 1.46 billion, a decrease of 8.9% compared to the 1.6 billion reported during the same period of fiscal 2019. Organic sales declined 7.9% or 126.6 million. Acquisitions contributed 0.7% of sales or 10.7 million. Foreign exchange was a headwind that reduced sales by 1.7% or 26.5 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.13, a decrease of 8.9% compared to the record $1.24 in last year's fourth quarter. Our consolidated adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, EBIT decreased 11.5% to 213.6 million compared to 241.4 million reported in the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter. Turning now to our segments. Sales at our Construction Products Group were down 15.6% to 472.4 million compared to 559.6 million a year ago. Organic sales declined 13.9% or 77.9 million. Acquisitions contributed 0.7% or 4.1 million to sales. Foreign currency translation reduced sales by 2.4% or 13.4 million. Adjusted EBIT in the segment was down 12.1% to 77.3 million compared to adjusted EBIT of 87.9 million during last year's fourth quarter. The segment's strength was its U.S. roofing business, which experienced limited interruption from the pandemic as most roofing projects, which are completed outdoors and do not require entry into customers' facilities, were able to proceed. The season for roofing applications was broadened when schools closed early allowing us to meet demand from this customer base. The segment performed better in the U.S. However, in certain international markets, where construction was not considered essential, the segment experienced significant sales declines. International results were further challenged by currency headwinds. While the segment sales declined during the quarter, earnings declined in a lesser rate, due largely to the success of the MAP to Growth program, which included the closure of two manufacturing plants and proactive measures taken to cut expenses. Sales in our Performance Coatings Group were down 20.2% to 235.1 million compared to the 294.5 million we reported during last year's fourth quarter. Organic sales declined 18.3% or 54 million. Acquisitions added 0.2% of sales or $0.5 million. While foreign exchange was a headwind of 2% or 5.9 million. Segment adjusted EBIT was down 31.9% to 23.7 million compared to 34.7 million reported during last year's fourth quarter. The segment quickly responded to the economic downturn, created by COVID-19 by delayering management and aggressively reducing fixed costs, particularly in areas of the business that serve the energy industry, as well as other affected sectors. Similar to our Construction Products segment, the Performance Coatings Group also performed better in the U.S. and internationally. Although segment sales declined, earnings did not decrease as much as would be expected on a detrimental basis due to operating improvements from our MAP to Growth program. In the Consumer Group sales were strong increasing 6.7% to 616.2 million from 577.5 million during last year's fourth quarter. Organic sales increased 7.7% or 44.6 million. Foreign currency translation reduced sales by 1% or 5.9 million. Adjusted EBIT in the segment was down 4% to 104.5 million compared to 108.8 million in the prior year period. While U.S. sales were up 12%, international markets struggled due to more stringent lockdown orders on manufacturing and retail. Overall, the Consumer Group sales results for the quarter were excellent, given they are in comparison to a very strong fourth quarter last year, when we made large market share gains. Our associates went to extraordinary lengths to deliver products to our customers in spite of supply chain challenges. The bottom line was impacted by higher operating expenses for safety measures and equipment, as well as distribution cost due to increased e-commerce orders all that were required to function during the pandemic. These costs are expected to be temporary, and were not passed along to our customers. As part of our MAP to Growth initiatives, we closed a Australian manufacturing facility, which will benefit our bottom line in the coming quarters. Specialty Products Group sales were 135.2 million during the fiscal 2020 fourth quarter compared to sales of 169.7 million in the prior year period, which was a decline of 20.3%. Organic sales decreased 23.1% or 39.3 million. Acquisitions contributed 3.6% or 6.1 million to sales. Foreign currency translation reduced sales by 0.8% or 1.4 million. Adjusted EBIT in the segment was down 72% to 7.3 million in the fiscal 2020 fourth quarter compared to 26.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Overall, the segment accounted for 9% of the quarter's consolidated sales. The number of the segment's businesses serves OEM markets that have struggled during the pandemic, such as furniture and marine distributors that were closed for an extended period of time in the U.S. because they were not classified as being essential industries. I'll now turn the call over to Rusty, who will walk through our outlook for fiscal 2021. Yes. I'm not sure that's exactly accurate, but it's just volatile Frank. It's - we've never seen volatility like this from one geography to another. And I think there is some nervousness not only by us - by others about some of these rising COVID cases and what government responses might be. So it's hard to predict. This was the most difficult planning year we've ever experienced. And so it behooved us to plan conservatively and focus on the things as Rusty said that we can control in terms of executing our MAP initiatives, controlling costs and focusing on cash flow. And so I - that's - my reference to the difference between a good year and a great year is in light of the things that we can control, and we're doing well. If revenues are better than we anticipate, we'll have a really solid year. If revenues are where we - are concerned about, we'll still do relatively well because of the things, part of it, it's just luck. I think we're fortunate to be in the midst of a operating improvement program is delivering good result, while the whole world is dealing with the consequences of the health pandemic. But yes, I don't believe on the severance piece or the expense piece, there is anything that is a reserve that hasn't been paid out in cash. There are - to a much lesser extent than we had particularly in year one, some consulting contracts that were tied into in terms of completing different work. But there, I don't think, there are any big - to your question, there are no big slugs of cash that are not already spent. To the extent we have reactions to an economic challenge continuing with COVID-19, then we would highlight those and incur the expense at the time. Yeah. So in general, you're correct. I would assume about 20 million or 20 million or 22 million of non-op expense. Obviously, we didn't have that in Q4. We'll do better than that in Q1. And how the year unfolds, we'll certainly let people know. That Q4 experience by the way wasn't unique to us. The reduction in medical expense and medical visits was pretty universal across all businesses, at least in the United States. That's correct."

            "content": "Thanks Matt. After lockdown restrictions caused our sales to decline in April and May, we expect to resume our growth in our fiscal 2021 first quarter since our sales have begun to trend better. As a result, our outlook for the first quarter is to resume the growth and earnings leverage more typical of the results seen in recent quarters, with sales to be up in the low single digits and adjusted EBIT growth of 20% or more compared to the prior year. For the full year of fiscal 2021, we anticipate our Construction Products Group and Performance Coatings Group could experience sales declines for the first three quarters and then turn positive in the fourth quarter. Our Consumer Group should continue its sales momentum into fiscal 2021. The Specialty Products Group is expected to face negative sales comparison during the first two quarters, which should turn positive in the back half of the year. These projections assume that we do not experience a second round of lockdowns related to COVID-19. Due to the continued economic uncertainty around the length and severity of the pandemic, we are not providing earnings guidance for the full year of fiscal 2021 at this time. While the pandemic continues, we remain focused on our core, well-being of our employees and their families and growing the business, where we can. While RPM's growth was temporarily interrupted by COVID-19 lockdowns in the last quarter, we are keeping our foot on the gas and executing our MAP to Growth program. In a world of uncertainty and unknowns, we are focused on managing the areas of the business that we can control. Our operations and management teams have bought into this program, which has proven very beneficial in driving efficiency, increasing our cash flow and making us more competitive. We have just started to make progress on inventory reduction and the benefits from ERP consolidation and associated administrative savings are in our final wave of our MAP to Growth program. So there is still a plentiful to do list for future operational efficiencies, continuous improvement and cost savings. With so much change going on at RPM, let me spend a moment on things that are not changing. We will maintain our entrepreneurial culture, which is one of our core strength. Through it, we remain nimble to adjust to market conditions, which is especially important in this uncertain and volatile environment. We will continue to invest in innovation to maintain industry leading organic growth. We will continue to deliver maintenance and repair solutions, which are relatively recession resistant and have served us well during past economic downturns. We will be focused on cash flow and selective in acquisition activity, while maintaining a preference for debt reduction in lieu of share repurchases. We look forward to continuing our track record of increasing our cash dividend for 47th consecutive year. This concludes our formal comments. We will now be pleased to take your questions. Sure. Yes. The MAP program continues to build momentum. Mike, this is Rusty here. In the third quarter, we said, we had MAP savings year-over-year incremental in the low $20 million range, and we're probably closer in the mid $20 million range in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. We don't have a level of certainty about future months. And not to be negative, I think, our trends right now are good. But like everybody, I think our visibility, our trust and our ability to forecast forward, which for us is usually two quarters, so you're looking at anywhere from four months to six months is low as it's ever been. And so that's the best answer I can give you. Sure. This is Rusty. One product, which we're excited about is Rust-Oleum home. This is a flooring transformation product. It's a two-step coating process, where you could put this coating overall laminate floors or wood floors and create a brand new look, and we're very excited about that. Another one on our Construction Products side is our PM our PUMA range of product for Tremco used in both roofing and deck coatings. We have AlphaGuard PUMA and Vulkem EWS for protection of concrete. This is a waterproof coating that can be applied as low as negative 20 degrees Fahrenheit. It uses polyurethane-methacrylate technology. It has great adhesion characteristics, elongation characteristics and is very durable. So those are a couple of examples."

            "content": "Thank you, Sarah. Good morning, and welcome to the RPM International Inc. investor call for our fiscal 2020 fourth quarter and year ended May 31, 2020. On the call with me today are, Rusty Gordon, RPM's Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Matt Ratajczak, our Vice President of Global Tax and Treasury, who has also taken on the responsibilities for our Investor Relations activities. On the call today, I'll provide an overview of our performance for the quarter and an update on our MAP to Growth operating improvement program; Matt will follow me with a review of our fourth quarter financial results; and then Rusty will wrap up our formal remarks with our outlook for fiscal '21. After that we'll be pleased to take your questions. Leading up to the coronavirus pandemic, our business was trending towards a quarter and year of record sales and record adjusted earnings. However, as expected, our fourth quarter consolidated results were impacted by the economic fallout created by the pandemic, which, to various degrees interrupted our manufacturing and distribution operations, as well as the maintenance, repair and construction activities of many of our customers around the world. At various times during the quarter, we had more than 10 manufacturing facilities closed, along with multiple other sales offices and distribution centers, due to government mandated closures mostly outside of the United States, and for disinfecting and cleaning facilities related to health and safety protocols. During the pandemic, we have taken decisive action to restrict travel, limit access to our facilities and establish safety protocols and allow those who could effectively perform their jobs remotely to do so. Through it all, we have remained focused on protecting the health and well-being of our associates and their families, and are playing a role in inhibiting the spread of the coronavirus in the communities in which we operate. Thanks to our associates' efforts to follow our comprehensive health and safety protocols, nearly all of our manufacturing facilities and distribution centers have been open and operational since our fiscal year end. The COVID-19 generated challenges during the quarter resulted in an 8.9 decline in our consolidated sales, which was better than the decline of 10% to 15% we anticipated and discussed on our April call. On a geographic basis, our sales were essentially flat in the U.S., where construction and hardware channels were generally deemed essential, but were down 25% in international markets, where many of our businesses were ordered closed by government mandates. The primary driver of our better than expected top line results was the growing demand throughout the quarter in the U.S. for our Consumer Group's small project paints, caulks, sealants, repair products, wood stains and specialty cleaners. Consumer had additional time for home improvement, maintenance and repair projects because of the stay at home orders across our country. They were able to purchase the products they needed through e-commerce portals, which grew dramatically during the quarter, as well as our retail partners and our broad distribution base of DIY stores, which were among the businesses that were considered essential to the economy, and we're able to remain open and operational. The performance of our Consumer segment relative to our other segments highlights the long - highlighted value of RPM's diverse operating company portfolio, where weakness in one segment is often offset by strength in another. Our fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.13 while below last year's all-time high results still represent our second best fourth quarter on record. The decline in adjusted diluted EPS was equivalent to the drop in sales illustrating our quick response to reduce costs during the economic downturn, as well as the ongoing success of our MAP to Growth operating improvement program. Coronavirus safety protocols such as limits on travel and facility access slowed some of the planned activities that were part of our Phase III of the MAP to Growth program, particularly manufacturing improvement initiatives, which were nearing their end particularly including plant closures and ERP consolidations. However, in response to the economic downturn created by the pandemic, we quickly took proactive measures to accelerate the MAP to Growth cost reduction initiatives, with a focus on delayering management and other areas of administration. As a result, we remain on track to achieving or exceeding our original annual cost savings of $290 million. During the fourth quarter, we announced the closure of three plants, which brings our total to 22 out of the 31 plants were originally targeted for closure and consolidation at the beginning of the MAP to Growth program. As we mentioned last quarter, due to the pandemic induced delays in executing some of our restructuring initiatives, we will be extending the timeline to achieving our original MAP to Growth objectives. This includes our goal of repurchasing $1 billion of our stock, which was more than halfway completed, but suspended in mid-March, as a response to the pandemic and its economic impact. There is still too much uncertainty at this point to set a new target date for completion, as the global economy stabilizes, and we gain more visibility in the business conditions, we will communicate our new MAP initiatives and growth timeline in the coming quarters. Expenses were dramatically down in our non-operating segment due to the coronavirus pandemic. Medical costs were lower due to lower volumes, management incentives and long term programs were reversed, travel was banned, and use of outside consultants was curtailed. We will continue to be aggressive in managing all cost expenses in areas of the business within our control to drive performance and continue to navigate through this unprecedented environment. As a result of the economic uncertainty created by the pandemic, we are focused on generating strong cash flow and maintaining liquidity. At year end, we reported record operating cash flow of $550 million, as a result of good working capital management and margin improvement initiatives from our MAP to Growth program. Our procurement team formed as part of the MAP program has recently done an incredible job of improving payables by negotiating better terms with our suppliers, which will continue to benefit cash flow in the coming quarters. At May 31, 2020, our total liquidity, including cash and committed revolving credit facilities stood at $1.280 billion. I'll now turn the call over to Matt Ratajczak, who will review our financial results for fiscal 2020 fourth quarter on an adjusted basis. So that's a great question, particularly in light of all the volatility that everybody is seeing. And, so we'll make some comments like we did in April by providing some insight into our months. I look forward to getting back to not doing that. I'm just talking about quarters and years. But because of the volatility, I think it's appropriate. So our June results grew double digit and that was across most of our businesses, and it's a combination of continuing good consumer takeaway at - in our Consumer segment and businesses, I think solid performance in our industrial, particularly construction related businesses, some of which clearly was a pent-up work from April and May that was interrupted. Our July results seem to be flat year-over-year and that's a mix between our segments and our geographies, as Rusty indicated earlier or Matt indicated. We've had either flat or solid results in the U.S. and different results in different parts of the world. I think what's obvious in our results in the fourth quarter and in our forecast for Q1 is the MAP to Growth program is working. We are still building momentum. We have more work to do. And in an environment, where we're able to put up solid, low to mid single digit revenue growth, you'll see really solid EBIT leverage to our bottom line. So I think the biggest concern we have is volatility around - like everybody around what might happen in coming months relative to reactions to the coronavirus health pandemic. But other than that we're in pretty good shape and the MAP to Growth program is delivering, when we have solid revenue growth. So the November of 2018, we laid out a three-pronged wave and roughly each wave on a ongoing sustained basis was generating about $100 million. And we have that as a goal for our third wave, which starts on June 1 - which started on June 1. And I think when we are completed with this, we will exceed the original $290 million forecast by a few tens of millions of dollars. But some of the progress in the third wave will be delayed because of getting into plants has been a challenge, particularly with outside consultants, some of the ERP stuff has been delayed. The third wave especially the back end of it really will impact fiscal '22 and really solid performance in fiscal '20, should provide us with pretty strong leverage to the bottom line in fiscal '21, as we highlighted. Obviously it is revenue dependent because a big slug of our savings that's working really well and better than originally anticipated, is in the manufacturing and continuous improvement efforts, as well as broadly our procurement activities, and they're working really well. But from an accounting perspective, we had this conversation with a different analyst on a prior call, those savings get capitalized into inventory, and they flow through our P&L when we sell that inventory. So any amount of sales will bode well for our bottom line. Obviously if we bump into some future reduced revenues because of this pandemic, then the impact of our savings, particularly in the gross margin will be delayed. Sure. The European market is slowly recovering. It was very difficult in Q4, as you mentioned because we had government mandated shutdowns in the U.K., in different parts of Europe and throughout Latin America, also in the couple of plants we have in India. With the reopenings in the U.K., we're seeing the same type of strong DIY demand that we're in the U.S.. That is true to a lesser extent, but still positive in continental Europe in the consumer side. We're seeing sequential improvement in our industrial businesses, our Construction Products Group and Performance Coatings Group specialty products. So we're seeing sequential improvement certainly from April and May, into June, in the summer, not necessarily year-over-year strength because of the strong performance we had last year. Our year - while we're not providing guidance. Will really be a good one or a great one based upon our performance in these coming quarters, as the fourth quarter for us and everybody, but particularly given our May 31 year-end. We'll have some pretty extraordinary year-over-year growth given the impact of the coronavirus and global shutdowns in the fourth quarter we just reported. I think we're holding our own. The supply chain issues are challenging for everybody. Our fill rates into our customers are at lower levels than they have ever been. I think we're equal to or similar to our peer competitors, but there have been some disruptions in packaging and can supplies that are going to continue and some rising costs there. There have been some distribution disruptions. And so that's a challenge. But what is happening at RPM is continuing and it's very exciting, and it's nascent in a couple of areas. So for instance, the partnership from a market facing perspective between our Construction Products Group and our Consumer Group is having some exciting wins. You can find the Tremco, Vulkem, Urethane sealants in Menards. You can find Tremco branded five gallon pails of unique Tremco roof coating materials in Home Depot in Texas. And these are fledgling opportunities for us to take some of our industrial construction chemical brands and construction sealants and products and coatings and waterproofing products into some of our stronger home center channels. And so the opportunity for market share gains and growth there is pretty exciting for us. We're in the early stages there, but it's exciting. We just got into Walmart with a grab-and-go house paint program, which is a first for us through Rust Oleum. And so that is nascent, but also exciting. So the opportunities for us to continue to grow in those areas continue to receive our focus, and we're working hard to make them successful. I don't think it changes the way we operate. It will continue to allow us to partner with our big customers in ways that will continue to expand e-commerce. Many of our products aren't the most naturally purchased online because of shipping issues, or flammability issues or weight to value issues. But our volume with Home Depot.com doubled, our volume on Amazon doubled. Now that the U.K. is picking back up, we have an MRO business over there called Watco that was a catalog kind of business that went to online, and consumers are finding that and that business is increasing dramatically. And so I think the big takeaway for us here that we're excited about, but time will tell, and this is unique to RPM, the stay at home orders in the United States and it seems true in the U.K. as well has created a greater number of confident DIYers. This isn't just about paint, but wood stains and finishes that tend to be more craft work and require more skill. Those volumes are up pretty dramatically. And so across a number of DIY categories, I think one of the interesting outcomes is understanding is there a larger, more confident DIY base, than there would have been otherwise. And we hope that's true and we'll find out. I wouldn't do it specifically, but it's collectively across RPM tens of millions of dollars. And so the percent year-over-year growth is very impressive. The percent of our consolidated sales is not a lot. It's hard to know. In the fourth quarter, it had lower margins because distribution cost were greater, and we had some ramp-up costs there. And so long term, the pricing model, and the gross margins aren't a lot different, but the distribution costs were higher. And so there is a lot to learn there in terms of efficiency. It also is higher because again, the volume on a relative basis is relatively low. It means that we have a nascent program of wall paint at Walmart and are certainly learning. And I'll add one thing for fiscal '21, we actually manufactured some of those resins in a factory in Germany, and we export those to the U.S., where some of the more unique Tremco roofing coating products. And in fiscal '21, we have cut back, where appropriate on our CapEx. But one of the major capital spends that we'll go forward is a $20 million to $30 million spend on a new roof coatings factory relative to the growth there, and also bringing our capability to produce those unique resins to the U.S. Sure. I'll just repeat the comments I made, and hope to get to a point, where we're not providing monthly comments. But our June month was double digit in consolidated sales and not every business was up, but most all of our businesses were up year-over-year including in our Construction Products Group. We think some of the strong growth is literally the carryover of April and May projects that were delayed or halted, and July revenues on a consolidated basis, are generally flat. And so, there'll be some variability, we think for month-to-month in the coming months and quarters, and that's the best we have right now. Obviously, we'll provide good detail on our first quarter when we report those results in October. Sure. And so our Consumer business is, call it roughly $2 billion our Consumer segment and probably 25% of that is caulks, sealants, patch and repair products. Those product lines are probably 50% to 60% consumer and 40% to 50% pro. Our Specialty Coatings, our small project paints, the cleaning products, those tend to be more 75%, 80% consumer, and let's say 20%, 25% pro. So hopefully that gives you a break out there. The hardware store channel, home center store channel, major retailers were not interrupted by the shutdown orders in the United States. All of them to various degrees continued to operate. And so the strength we're seeing in the summer is a continuation of what we saw in the fourth quarter. And it is higher demand for DIY products, and we believe a growing base of confident DIYers and certainly will help us, and help - I think, the whole DIY segment in the future to what degree we'll find out. Sure. I'll make a few comments. Number one, everybody's learned a lot of lessons. We have a significant chunk of our employees working from home. And I would bet, we're learning that maybe 25% to 30% of our functions, and our individuals are capable of working remotely on a more permanent basis. And so that has a lot of consequences for, in some cases cost and other cases, travel. And so our T&E costs were down dramatically in Q4 that wasn't unique to RPM. So there's a lot of learning there about going forward, what level of travel and entertainment expense do you return to. And I don't know the answer to that question, but I'm pretty certain it's not 100% of what it used to be. So those are just some broad comment. On the MAP to Growth program, we're continuing to gain momentum. My guess is when we're done, the 31 consolidated plants will be a few more. How much of that was - would have happened in MAP to Growth versus how much of that is a combination of MAP to Growth and what we've learned in that process in a reaction to the COVID-19 impact on the economies, it's hard to tell. Same thing in SG&A. Our SG&A cost will continue to come down, and we're learning some lessons there. But it will be, as we go quarter-by-quarter, a combination of MAP to Growth savings and just outright responses to the economic circumstances we're operating in. So yeah, there is a - there are - across RPM, there are levels of temporary expense reductions. So T&E is a good example. We had various levels of salary reductions, the highest of which was mine at 30% that started in - on May 1. Those salary reductions as the year goes on, and we meet or exceed our goals will be rescinded. So those expenses will come back to the P&L. We've had some furloughs and plans, but we have also had a larger than MAP to Growth anticipated permanent headcount reduction in a number of businesses. In our Performance Coatings Group, they are the most economically sensitive. Out of $1 billion roughly in revenues, 250 million roughly is tied directly or indirectly to oil and gas. And so they will continue to be - of all of our groups, they will continue to be the most challenged on the top line for fiscal '21. Sure. So it's been very challenging again, not just unique to us, but across DIY product lines. Demand is up. I think that's new DIYers. Demand are up year-over-year because people will recall last year it was somewhat of a wet start to the first quarter, and we've had pretty spectacular weather across the United States. So that's driving demand. Supply chain challenges from some of our own distribution issues, freight problems, some of our customers pick up freight and that's been - we've had challenges there. Some of our suppliers, most recently in metal cans have had their own COVID related shutdowns that have impacted supply. So when your supply chain spend a decade or more in RPM, got on board maybe later than we should have, but we've been pursuing it very aggressively for two years efficiency, and you get hit with big spikes in demand. And then also temporary shutdowns in distribution centers and/or manufacturing facilities of some of your suppliers, it poses a problem. So everybody's managing through all those things. We're 90% done with a capacity expansion, for instance, in spray paint, and the European company that has been the principal supplier of that equipment is refusing to send any of their technicians to the United States. So we've got some really good big investments and some capacity increases that are on the verge of hitting the marketplace, and we're excited about that. But it's just one more example of how the COVID pandemic has disrupted plants. We've seen some deflation in oil-based solvents and different raw materials there. We've seen particularly starting in the fourth quarter, some inflation, little pickup in TiO2 costs, pickup in packaging cost. We are - have heightened alert to some of the packaging particularly metal can situations relative to some shutdowns and some announced capacity constraints there. So even that continues to be volatile. It's one of the reasons that we had a - there were two issues in our Consumer Group in the fourth quarter, one was some higher raw material cost; and the other was higher distribution cost related to the e-commerce growth, as well as disruptions in the supply chain around distribution and freight. All of those things should settle down over time, unless we end up with another round of shutdowns or government directed actions related to coronavirus. Sure. We - as you saw we had a record cash from operations generation for fiscal '20, and while some of that was a result of declines in revenues in Q4, a huge chunk of it, which is the benefits of our MAP to Growth program and focus on that. There is more to come. We're making improvements in working capital. But we're still a laggard versus our peers, and there's a lot of attention on that. Preference for capital allocation will be funding our operations. For instance, I mentioned the capacity expansion that we're close to completing in our Consumer Group, and the new capacity expansion that we're just starting in our Construction Products Group. We'll continue to look at acquisitions on a selective basis. I think where we could find the right fit that are at a good value, we'll continue to execute on those and there are opportunities there. That could pick up towards the end of the calendar year depending on private owner perceptions of political outlook and what that might mean for capital gains taxes or a state planning issues. So that's something we're paying attention to. But again, we intend to be very selective there. And then we'll have a preference for the time being over debt reduction for the share repurchase program until there is, I think a little more stability in our outlook, and a little more confidence that the disruptions of the coronavirus pandemic are mostly behind us. And so that, I suspect we'll look at that very closely with our Board throughout fiscal '21. So I think, across all of RPM, and this is hard to gauge the added costs of the response to coronavirus would be mid to high single digit millions. So somewhere in the $5 million to $10 million range. But the bigger impact was on revenues obviously, and that won't be forever. That was just such disruptions particularly in April and May, and particularly in international markets. We're focused on improving the margins of all of our businesses, in particular our Consumer business, our margins haven't fully recovered from where they were back in 2016, and there has been a lot of focus on operating efficiency at the plant level. We closed a number of plants across RPM, but I believe three of those have been in our Consumer segment. And so our efforts to really focus on being more efficient at the operating level on introducing lean manufacturing disciplines on different items, SIOP disciplines in our plants. These are things that were lost on me, five years ago, but are not lost on me or organization today. And they're having a benefit, and we're continuing to focus there. We've also reduced our supplier base, and it's helped us both improve terms and negotiate better pricing in a lot of places and become better strategic suppliers. So we're having discussions with a number of major suppliers at the RPM level that we hadn't had in the past. And so that's helping us as well. So we're keenly focused on all of those issues, and we'll continue to benefit from that in fiscal '21, as we continue to execute the rest of the MAP to Growth program. Yes. Our current spend budget is about 130 million, which is down. But again, that was in a forecasting process that was pretty conservative. We do have a one major capital spend that for expansion in our Construction Products Group. Obviously, the Consumer capital spend, I referenced, most of that's behind us. We just got to get it through the finish line. That could change, as we get into the second half of the year and if our performance and the underlying economic dynamics are better than we anticipate. So because we cut back pretty aggressively. So 130 is what our current budget is. I hope we end up spending 150 because the world ends up being better than everybody anticipates. Yes. We'll provide the details on the quarter in October because I don't want to - as I said, I am - we were hesitant in April to get into monthly details, but given the volatility, felt the investor community deserve that. That's why we're providing some details now in our quarter, but it's not over, and we'll report our results there. Other than I would refer you to the comments that Rusty made and the direction we provided in our earnings release this morning. We anticipate solid kind of low to mid single digit growth in our Consumer segment across the year. Yes, probably not what you're looking for. But just to repeat that, as we sit here today, it looks like the first quarter will drive on a consolidated basis, low single digit revenue growth and a EBIT growth of 20% or better year-over-year. Absolutely. I mean, I think there are new gardeners that weren't gardeners before this spring. I think there are new users of our wood stains and finishes product, and I reference that one in particular because it tends to be more craft or more project. It's not a simple paint this or - and - again, our small project paints are more project driven and more craft and more unique. But all the things that we see suggest whether it's gardening or the use of small project paints or confidence in being able to do repairs themselves that the base of home improvement in DIY has expanded in the spring. And that's continuing nicely throughout the summer months. Yes. That's a great question. And I'll tell you, if you look at our Construction Products Group through nine months, they had really benefited from good execution on MAP to Growth; they've really benefited from being very strategic and where they were investing for growth in terms of new products. They are leading the roof restoration coating market significantly, and that whole thing is growing. And they've got competitors that are coming on, but they are still the leader there. And even in the fourth quarter again, great question. When you look at a revenue base that was down 14% or 15% and an EBIT that was down concurrently 12, it tells you that there was good mix, but it also tells you the benefits of the MAP to Growth program in our Construction Products Group. That Group has been really leading in a lot of areas for us. And I referenced earlier, we're excited about the future cooperation or synergy, if you'll between our Construction Products Group technology and some of the brands and our Consumer Group strength in some of the home centers. So there - hopefully will be more to come there. We've got some good introductory products in a couple of tests. And if they prove out to be successful that's a whole new area of growth for us in the home center channel with Construction Products Group technology. Yes. They have. And so if you're in marine coatings like our marine business, if you're in the treatment for furniture, as well as the furniture protection insurance business, with our - which our Guardian business is in. Furniture stores were closed. For a period of time, most of our outlets for our marine coatings were closed. And while it wasn't true-up of a month, from one week to the next, we have revenues that were down 70% or 80% because their customers were closed. So it's pretty shocking. And it gives you a sense of what's happening to a lot of small businesses because their product lines or businesses that are part of RPM or other big companies that have survived this because they are part of a bigger group. And so those order shows bad weeks are behind us. All of our customers are up and running. And we're starting to pick back up. And so that was a particularly hard hit portion of RPM's business, but it was the business that got particularly most impacted by shutdown orders of their customer base. Yes. I don't have that off the top of my head. I know that we laid out pretty good detail of three waves. First wave was 101 million, I think and we exceeded that by about 10 million. Second wave, which we just finished was about the same and we're slightly ahead of that. The third wave, we think will be delayed a little bit. You'll recall that our - the area that I think is doing the best is manufacturing. I think we had $70 million or $75 million of total benefit split roughly between plant consolidation and continuous improvement. And when we finish fiscal '21, we'll have come close to $100 million of benefit in the manufacturing area between the benefit of plant closures. But the continuous improvement aspect has really been a home run for us. And there's more to come there incrementally obviously less, but that's a process. It becomes a permanent part of RPM, we call it MS-168. And so there is some elements of the MAP to Growth program that will be permanently part of our culture and that's one of them. Our procurement activities have done particularly well. We were able to work with a major financial institution on some vendor financing, which has helped us with terms. And we've had some pretty, pretty good success in some areas we didn't anticipate, like distribution of all kinds of small stuff. And so that's going pretty well. And we're continuing to look for some new alternatives or new opportunities to continue to expand the benefits of the MAP to Growth program beyond the original communicated goals back in November of 18. Sure. Silke, you'll see that in Note B of our 10-K, when we release that at the end of the day, and it will give you the outlook for future costs and restructuring. Well, yes, there is a lot of severance in our restructuring cost, as you'll see in Note B, and we have paid out a lot. But we continue to have severance costs, as we continue to close facilities. Sure. Yes Silke, in a typical quarter, our non-operating segment costs are a little over 20 million usually, and they were a way down in the fourth quarter as you saw. The year-over-year variance about half of it was related to medical. And those costs, we basically allocate those at the beginning of the year on a per employee basis to our operating companies. And as you probably know, 99% of our employees do not work at corporate. But as the year unfolds, and we get actual experience for the good or bad, in medical, that experience hits our non-operating segment. And in the fourth quarter, as medical claims went down, as people avoided doctor visits, we had a favorable variance in medical. So we would expect some of that to continue in the first quarter, and we'll see beyond that. So our first quarter probably should be a little better than the usual low 20s of millions of expense in the non-op segment. Yes. We haven't provided a lot of detail there. We had some raw material inflation in Consumer again, mostly around packaging that we expect to continue. You've all seen some of the announcements of some of the - and particular, can and metal packaging suppliers. We had higher expense for DIY. And I think somebody rightly assumed, if we had $5 million to $10 million of COVID expense in terms of safety issues and other issues across the whole corporation, it was disproportionately in Consumer. But I think that's all the detail that we provided on that. Sure. I think our Consumer - I'm sorry, our roofing business in our Construction Products Group, they're continuing to perform very well. There is no doubt that the June results that we had sales wise, when you follow pretty negative months in April and May, and your June is up double digit in revenues that some of that June business was the result of projects that were delayed or halted in April and May. So there is certainly some of that. But beyond that, I think somebody earlier had asked about mix and we expect to continue to see good mix in our Construction Products Group. The roofing business generally is less economically impacted than the construction sealants business, which has an element of DIY, but - not DIY, an element of maintenance and repair, but also an element of new construction. So that's more impacting the construction sealants business than the roofing and waterproofing business. Yes, slowly. And so there is more opportunity again, in the early part of the first quarter, for instance in our Stonhard roofing business for our crews and/or independent contractors to get into facilities and do the work. Certainly, sequentially, it's much better than April and May. Although, it's still an issue in certain industries and certain facilities. And we anticipate that continuing to improve, unless, of course, we're hit with another negative response from a business perspective on the COVID health pandemic. Sure. So in response to the e-commerce question, we mostly ship truckloads to distribution, whether it's major home centers sending their own trucks to pick up our goods or us sending truckloads either direct or through two step distribution. And in e-commerce, in some cases, we're shipping to a customer, and in other cases, we're shipping, direct to the consumer in small quantities. And so that brings with it a higher cost. Does that answer your question? Yes. On the international piece, our growth organically in the U.S. in our Consumer segment in Q4 was 12%, and we were negative everywhere else. We'll give you the details on that when we report the first quarter in October. Correct. Thanks, Sarah. In the coming weeks, we'll release our first formal Environmental Social and Governance Report. Well, this will be our first official report. ESG considerations have always been an important part of how we operate at RPM. In my opening letter, I'll discuss the fundamental values that have driven RPM sustain growth over the decades. We have long believed that responsibly serving the needs of our associates, customers and communities results in long term generation of stockholder value. While societies asking more of companies than ever before in ensuring safe ethical and sustainable business practices and creating environments that promote inclusion and social justice. Our ESG report will demonstrate how these values have always been a priority at RPM. At the same time, we recognize there is more work to do. We look forward to further advancing this work. It's continuing to play an integral role in the communities we serve. And once you've had a chance to review this document, we would welcome your feedback and your input. I'd like to close by expressing my gratitude to our associates' around the world for their hard work and resilience during these uncertain times. They've adapted to challenging conditions created by the health pandemic, and are finding unique and innovative ways to safely continue operating our businesses and serving our customers, while maintaining health protocols to their benefit, their families and the communities in which we operate. Many thanks to our shareholders for your continued investment in RPM. We remain focused on completing our MAP to Growth program, and also generating long term value for your investment. And everyone on the call, I wish you and your family's good health. Thank you for joining us on our call today. And we look forward to reporting to you our first quarter results in early October. Thanks, and have a great day."

To assist you in understanding these non-GAAP terms, RPM has posted reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures on the RPM website. Following today\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Please note that only financial analysts will be permitted to ask questions. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to RPM's Chairman and CEO, Mr. Frank Sullivan, for opening remarks. Please go ahead, sir.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you, Vanessa. Good morning and welcome to the RPM International Inc. investor call for our fiscal 2020 third quarter ended February 29, 2020. On the call with me today are Rusty Gordon, RPM's Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Matt Ratajczak, our Vice President of Global Tax and Treasury, who is also heading our Investor Relations functions. I'll start the call by discussing how we are managing our business through the COVID-19 pandemic, then I'll provide an update on our 2020 MAP to Growth operating improvement program. After that, I'll turn the call over to Matt, who will walk through our third quarter results in detail and he'll be followed by Rusty, who will discuss the outlook for the fourth quarter and year end. First, we know that all of you are dealing with disruptions in your professional and personal lives resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, especially our analysts and investors from the New York City area. I'd like to thank you for being on our call today and for your continuing interest in RPM and wish you and your families\u2019 good health during this challenging time. At RPM, our priorities have been to protect the health and wellbeing of our associates and their family members, to support our local communities to control the spread of the virus and to serve our customers by maintaining the continuity and success of our business operations. Our 15,000 associates around the world have really embraced these priorities and I'd like to commend them for the incredible work they've done to continue each and every day. When it comes to protecting their own health and that of their families, we've established many protocols across our operations. We're taking precautions in our facilities to keep our people safe by aggressively cleaning and disinfecting high touch areas, practicing social distancing and good hygiene, and have been screening for COVID-19 symptoms prior to entry in all of our facilities for more than three weeks. As of April 7th, we have been informed by 14 of our 15,000 employees that they have had at various times confirmed cases of coronavirus. In these cases, we enacted our protocols to shut down the affected locations, have them thoroughly cleaned and disinfected, quarantined all appropriate affected people, and then reopen the facilities following an appropriate shutdown period. In terms of our communities, we are working from home, monitoring the hygiene and health of our manufacturing and distribution associates and reporting any infection or disruption.  We're also donating time and materials to help stem the spread of the virus. In one case, our wood finishes group supplied thousands of plastic bottles to a local distillery, that has been converting products to hand sanitizer and it's providing it for free in the community, especially to healthcare-first responders. In another case, our Rust-Oleum operation sourced its Concrobium fogger product and donated it to first responders so that their air ambulance helicopters could be disinfected and return to service quickly. These are just a few examples of how our operations are responding to local needs. As one of the world's largest suppliers of specialty coatings and building materials, RPM is in a strong position to weather the toll that the COVID-19 pandemic is having on the global economy. We are taking action to adjust our business activities during this period of uncertainty and are well-positioned with strong cash flow, a solid capital structure and $1.1 billion in liquidity. Many of our products are used for construction, maintenance and repair projects, which are deemed essential in many cases and are relatively recession resistant.  RPM companies around the world, with a few exceptions, have been able to continue to operate their plants and distribution centers. In fact, today nearly all of our North American plants are operational, with a few exceptions, while a number of our international plants have been closed due to government mandates.  A large number of our North American customers, such as those in construction, infrastructure, and DIY home and hardware retail, are also considered essential and currently remain open for business. With people spending more time in their homes, there is potential for increased DIY activity projects. Raw material cost inflation seems to be moderating in a number of our key product categories. Our global supply chain remains strong and our distribution and operations associates continue to work diligently to meet customer demand.  We continue to be proactive in taking actions around the globe in our operations as the situation evolves.  Now, I'd like to discuss our MAP to Growth restructuring program. It has steadily been gaining momentum each quarter. This quarter is no different as demonstrated by our excellent bottom-line results, strong organic growth, strong earnings leverage and record levels of cash generation. Restructuring activities include enacting operational improvements at our production facilities, consolidating manufacturing plants, de-layering management and rationalizing product lines.  During the third quarter and early in the fourth quarter, we announced the closure of two additional plants which brings our total to 20 out of the 31 plants that were originally targeted for closure at the beginning of the MAP to Growth program. Versus last year on a consolidated basis, we realized incremental MAP to Growth savings in the third quarter totaling $21 million, of which $5 million came from manufacturing, $12 million from procurement and $4 million from SG&A.  Looking ahead, as the COVID-19 pandemic slows economic and business activity, it is also impacting our MAP to Growth program. While there are some initiatives that can be carried out virtually, many, particularly those dealing with additional manufacturing improvements and the completion of our ERP implementations require a physical presence at some of our plants and offices. Limits on travel and access to facilities have required us to temporarily halt some of our operating improvement activities. As such, we will be extending out the timeline from our original MAP to Growth goals in terms of their ultimate achievement.  At this point, there is too much uncertainty to set a new date for reaching our objectives. As our markets stabilize and we gain more clarity into the business conditions, we will communicate our new MAP to Growth timeline. But as you can see, once again, in our third quarter results, our people are executing on our MAP to Growth initiatives very effectively.  I'll now turn the call over to Matt Ratajczak for a detailed review of our results for the third quarter. \nMatt Ratajczak: Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. Note that my comments will be on an as adjusted basis. During the third quarter, we generated consolidated net sales of $1.17 billion, an increase of 2.9% compared to the $1.14 billion reported during the same quarter of fiscal 2019. Organic sales growth was 3% or $34.0 million. Acquisitions contributed 0.7% of sales or $9.0 million, while foreign exchange was a headwind that reduced sales by 0.8% or $9.6 million. This was solid top-line growth during the third quarter, which typically generates our most modest results each year because it falls during the winter months when painting and construction activity is slow.  Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.23, an increase of 76.9% compared to the $0.13 in the year ago quarter. Our consolidated adjusted earnings before interest in taxes, EBIT, were up 30.4% to $60.5 million, compared to $46.4 million reported in the fiscal 2019 third quarter. These excellent bottom-line results were largely due to initiatives under our MAP to Growth restructuring program. Our earnings also benefited from pricing and moderating raw material costs. Turning now to our segments. Sales in our Construction Products Group were strong and increased 4.7% to $372.1 million. Growth was primarily organic at 5.1% or $18.5 million. Acquisitions contributed 1% or $3.4 million. Foreign currency translation reduced sales by 1.4% or $5.1 million. Sales growth was driven by market share gains and the introduction of innovative new products with the fastest growth being generated in our roofing below-grade waterproofing and concrete admixtures businesses.  Adjusted EBIT in the Construction Products segment increased $6.0 million from adjusted EBIT loss of $0.3 million during last year's third quarter. This improvement was largely attributed to pricing, moderating raw material costs, Map to Growth savings, and a favorable leverage impact of higher sales volume.  Sales in our Performance Coatings Group were $255.7 million, up 1% from the $253.2 million we reported during last year's third quarter. Organic growth was 1.6% or $3.9 million. Sales growth in the segment was mixed. Its highway and bridge maintenance businesses were slowed by government budget constraints, particularly in the UK. However, its protective and marine coatings business unit increased market share and its Continental European operations grew sharply, driven by a new global management structure.  Acquisitions added 0.2% of sales or a $0.5 million, while foreign exchange was a headwind of 0.8% or $1.9 million. Segment adjusted EBIT increased 33.2% to $24.2 million from $18.2 million during last year's third quarter. Our focus on higher margin products and service offerings as well as Map to Growth business rationalization initiatives drove a significant adjusted EBIT margin improvement of 230 basis points in the segment. In the Consumer Group, sales were robust, increasing 5.4% to $398.7 million. Organic sales increased 6% or $22.6 million, driven by market share gains and unseasonably warm winter weather in North America that enabled consumers to complete more DIY home improvement projects. The fastest growth was achieved in our caulks, sealants, and patch and repair product lines. There was no impact from acquisitions during the quarter.  Foreign currency translation reduced sales by 0.6% or $2.2 million. Adjusted EBIT in the Consumer Group was $32.1 million, an increase of 19.2% over the prior year. This bottom-line performance was driven by savings from our Map to Growth operating improvement plan and were partially offset by inflation in certain raw materials and channel mix. On the top-line, the Specialty Products Group\u2019s wood coatings business successfully outperformed its peers in a challenging market. However, sales of the segment\u2019s water damage restoration products faced a difficult comparison to the prior year when demand was exceptionally high due to significant weather events in North America.  Sales were also down in our OEM fluorescent pigments, nail polish and edible coatings businesses. Segment sales were $147.5 million. Organic sales decreased 7.1% and foreign currency translation reduced sales by 0.3%. The segment benefited 3.3% or $5.1 million from acquisitions.  Adjusted EBIT was $17.5 million during the quarter, which was lower than the $20.2 million of adjusted EBIT reported in the same period last year. Savings from our operating improvement program helped to mitigate the impact declining sales volume had on earnings. In addition, we have new management in place and are implementing cost cutting measures and new processes to reignite growth.  Now, I'll provide some comments on our cash flow and liquidity. For the first nine months of fiscal 2020, cash from operations grew by 162% to $381.2 million, compared to $145.5 million a year ago. This increase of $235.7 million was due to improved working capital management and operating improvement initiatives. Free cash flow improved to a source of cash of $137 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2020, as compared to a use of cash of $74.5 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2019. This $211.5 million increase is a result of higher earnings, coupled with overall improved working capital metrics.  Next, a few comments on our liquidity profile. The maturities of our long-term debt portfolio are nicely staggered with the next scheduled maturity out in November of 2022, and we have multiple options for access to short-term liquidity under both our revolving credit and accounts receivables facilities. Further, in the month of February, we improved our financial flexibility and increased our liquidity by $400 million by securing two three-year term loans. We borrowed $400 million immediately after closing and swapped to a euro fixed interest rate of approximately 0.6%. The proceeds were used to pay down the balance on our revolving credit facility.  Finally, as Frank stated, at February 29, 2020, our total liquidity including cash and committed revolving credit facilities was $1.1 billion.  I'll now turn the call over to Rusty for details on our share repurchase program and the outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2020.\nRusty Gordon: Thanks, Matt. As part of our MAP to Growth program, we established the goal of repurchasing $1 billion of our stock. In March subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we exceeded the halfway point of that goal when we repurchased approximately $25 million of our common shares. This is in addition to the $300 million we repurchased during fiscal 2019 and the first three quarters of fiscal 2020, coupled with $200 million cash redemption of our convertible notes in November of 2018. While we were making good progress on this goal, given recent macroeconomic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we have suspended our share buyback program.  Looking ahead, the fourth quarter is seasonally our strongest and was off to a good start in March. Consolidated sales for the month increased 5% over the prior year, led by the Specialty segment which was up 9%, Consumer was up 7%, Construction Products Group sales increased 7% and Performance Coatings Group declined 3%. However, like most companies, we expect our financial results to be impacted by the disruption and uncertainty COVID-19 is having on the global economy. Today, nearly all of our plants are open in North America, where we generate 74% of our sales. Some of our international plants have been shut down due to government mandates around the world. These facilities generate approximately 6% of RPM sales. While these shutdowns are at various durations, ranging from days to weeks, they are likely to impact our fourth quarter sales in April and May. In our Construction Products Group, demand for our innovative products and solutions has been robust and the segment has very strong momentum behind it. Construction is on the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Essential Critical Infrastructure Workforce Advisory list. The segment has a large number of hospital and healthcare system clients that will continue to require its offerings. During a good sales month in March, Tremco was able to support schools during this unexpected shutdown by moving up planned roofing and other facility restoration work.  At our Performance Coatings Group, results will be mixed. We anticipate seeing a boost in sales for our hygienic seamless flooring systems. However, the portion of our corrosion control and fireproofing coatings that are tied directly or indirectly to oil and gas markets, a little more than $200 million in sales annually, maybe at risk should there be a prolonged drop in pricing in those markets. So, we are closely monitoring investment in this area. POS takeaway at our Consumer Group has been strong with unit growth in the mid to high single-digits, particularly for our professional and consumer cleaning and disinfecting brands, some of which are effective against the coronavirus. The majority of the segment sales are in North America where DIY home and hardware retailers remain open for business. As consumer shelter in place, they are spending more time in their homes and have more time and interest in home repair, maintenance, improving and cleaning projects, which should continue to benefit the segment. In our Specialty Products Group, the outlook is mixed. Some of our companies such as our marine coatings business will be slowed by the closures of their distributor and retail networks. On the other hand, Legend Brands which manufactures cleaning products and equipment is seeing spiking demand as its restoration contractor base is shifting to disinfecting services and this trend should continue over the coming months. According to current government projections, it appears that the COVID-19 crisis may reach its peak in April or May. This is obviously a fluid situation and the information available to us is rapidly changing.  As we sit here today, we anticipate that our consolidated fourth quarter revenue will be down 10% to 15% year-over-year. This assumes our strong March results are counterbalanced by sales drops in April and May of 15% to 20%.  With that being said, given the uncertainties around this crisis, we are withdrawing our prior earnings guidance for the fourth quarter and full-year of fiscal 2020. We will continue to assess the situation and the short and long-term impacts of COVID-19. We are taking aggressive actions to manage cash flow by reducing working capital, capital expenditures and discretionary spending. The MAP to Growth program timing has been fortunate for us in this regard, since we have improved margins and are starting to see the benefits of our working capital reduction program, resulting in improved cash flow this year. Additionally, as Frank and Matt mentioned, we have significant liquidity and a strong balance sheet, which we anticipate will keep us in a solid financial position. This concludes our formal comments. We will now be pleased to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions]. And we have our first question from John McNulty with BMO Capital. \nJohn McNulty : So, I guess the first one would just be on the revenue outlook. So, the commentary around April and May looking down 15% to 20%, look, it's a tough market to try to forecast now. But like looking at some of Rusty's commentary on each of the divisions, it doesn't sound like it's kind of trending quite as bad as maybe that guidance would necessarily indicate. So, I guess, where are the puts and takes there? And I guess when you think about the four segments, where you see kind of the biggest pressures when you're looking at that 15% to 20% down versus maybe where there may be some bright spots. How should we be thinking about that? \nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So, first of all, it doesn't behoove anybody to do forecasting with an optimistic outlook. And so I think our assumptions of April and May being down 15% to 20% had been done appropriately with a negative conservative cast, but it's literally hard to tell from day-to-day. We will have spikes in some of our construction products businesses over a couple day period because of order flow that looks really good, and then you'll see some slowdowns. The things that are pretty certain will be the negative impact of multi-week shutdowns. Most of this is outside of the United States. Probably a little less than half of our manufacturing facilities in Europe are closed and I won't get into all the details, but it's an interesting mix. We had a plant in Norway closed that\u2019s now reopened. Interestingly, our primary plant in Italy is now reopened. But we have plants in UK, in various parts of the continent that are closed by government mandate for a period of weeks.  We are also closed in our two major plants in India, and almost every manufacturing facility in Latin and South America and in South Africa. There's a few other locations but they're so small as to be inconsequential. As Rusty said, when you add that all up on an annualized basis, it's about 6% of our revenues. So it's not big. And the impact of reopening will determine whether we're at the bottom end of that range and the top end of that range.  I think the good news for us is we're not yet seeing the underlying demand disruption that exists in some industries. Obviously, the hospitality industry has challenges, but even the auto assembly industry has got some challenges now that around the demand side that will be challenging. We're not seeing that yet. We are very aware of the possibility for that in one primary market, which is oil and gas, and across our Performance Coatings Group that's a little more than $200 million of annualized revenue. And so, our expectation is in the coming quarters and year, that's an area that will be under pressure. Hopefully that's responsive to your question.\nJohn McNulty: Yes. No, that's definitely helpful. And then I guess maybe shifting gears a little bit to the Map to Growth cost cutting programs, I guess can you give us some clarity, you had wave 1 that was -- you were going to get the full year benefit this year kind of coming in. Wave 2 you were going to get a decent chunk and then there was going to be wave 3 for next year, as it would roll in. I guess can you give us an update as to where you are in those buckets and what things are kind of already in the bag and what percent may be actually kind of pushed off at this point? Is there a way to think about that?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. And so I can tell you from my perspective, and I don't mean this to be trite, obviously this coronavirus pandemic is horribly impactful to everybody. But as it relates to Map to Growth, there's a plus and a minus. The minus is as you can see in this quarter and in subsequent quarters before this, the things that we have planned, the things that we are executing are working.  We had talked about working capital improvements and then quickly realized that they would come later in the cycle. You're seeing those now. And so, it's a little bit disappointing that a Map to Growth program that in its execution a positive impact is being disrupted. On the other hand, there are a number of instances where I think the timing of certain things were lucky and this is one of those. Our cash conversion cycle is stronger than it's ever been, and we have affected close to two-thirds of what we've wanted to do in Map to Growth across every -- certainly across manufacturing and the procurement process by centralizing our purchasing globally, probably less than two-thirds in the G&A area because the last bigger piece of that will come once the ERP implementations are completed. So, the areas that are most disrupted is getting the continuous improvement disciplines into our medium and smaller plants. And also completing the ERP implementations that we had set to complete over the next 12 to 15 months, and those will be put off because they require in some instances a physical presence. But the gains that we have made have been solidified and will continue to benefit us, and it's been a really good program that was accelerating.  Rusty provided details of March. March is a repeat of what we've been showing quarter-after-quarter, but obviously that will be -- our anticipation that, that will be meaningfully disruptive in April and May. The last comment that I will make is, if you believe what you read and you believe what you see on the ground, it does appear as if April and May will be the most negatively impacted period, 60-day period as it relates to government mandated shutdown and business disruptions. And it'll be interesting to see as we get into the summer months, both globally and in the United States, state-by-state, how the reopening of the economy happens both in terms of sectors and speed.\nOperator: We have our next question from Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research.\nFrank Mitsch : I appreciate the color on expected the declines in April and May and obviously your year was off to a really good start. What is underpinning -- what are your assumptions in terms of housing starts and commercial construction activity in April and May that is underpinning that, that 15% to 20% sales decline?\nFrank Sullivan: So, I can't answer that question. We haven't gone from a macro perspective into that. What we have done is talk to each of our businesses. We've looked at the affected plants globally. We have had some affected plants in the United States. Not surprisingly, they\u2019ve principally been manufacturing facilities in the New Jersey -- North Jersey area of kind of Metro New York and we had shutdowns. We've quarantined people. We\u2019ve closed the plant. We\u2019ve disinfected and cleaned it and brought people back. So, we've been through that cycle, and it's not a good cycle to go through. But when you've done it once or twice, you begin to develop a rhythm of understanding the quarantine time, the cleaning process and getting people back to work. What we really have done is a bottom-up company-by-company and an assessment of their sales force. And so in the consumer DIY areas, there's not only been more people at home, but at least temporarily there seems to be a shift from contractor do-it-for-me to DIY and that will benefit our consumer DIY businesses for instance.  The only element of our consumer DIY business that's impacted by residential new construction would be the caulks and sealant segment of our DAP business. We haven\u2019t done an analysis of what that means, but that's the area in consumer that would be impacted. The Construction Products Group continues to see spotty cycles of big order flow and roofing projects and then stops in our Performance Coatings Group. We're building a solid, with good customer bases in tech, in food and beverage, in areas that will, I think, perform well through this but some of that's being put off. And so I'm not answering your questions specifically other than to say that we have done this bottom-up business unit by business unit and trying to understand the order flow and the impact. And as I said earlier, I think the only big market that we're very concerned about as a real challenge coming is oil and gas.\nFrank Mitsch : Understood. I understand difficulties there. Let me shift in, you did mention that you are seeing a market share gain in the Consumer business. I was wondering if you could expand upon that. And then speaking of consumers, I'm wondering if you're getting any kind of instantaneous data or what have you in terms of the social distancing, impact on the home centers and hardware stores, and is that having -- even though DIY should be a very positive trend. I mean I know that the time to get what you want at a Home Depot has gone exponentially higher, are you seeing any negative impact there in terms of your business?\nFrank Sullivan: I'm sure, the answer to that is yes. We wouldn't talk about individual customers, but some customers have instituted more rigorous regiments of how many people they'll let into their stores. Interestingly enough our online orders are through the roof. And so, in certain product categories, where we might get 40 or 50 online orders a week, it could be hundreds or 1,000. And so, we're fulfilling that and that is through our major retailers to a lesser extent. We actually do more online business through a number of our major retail customers than we do through Amazon. Our Amazon business is growing. And then in Europe, as part of our consumer DIY business, which has been more negatively impacted, particularly in the UK than in the U.S. because of some temporary business shutdowns, we have a business called Watco which is kind of an MRO. It was a catalog. Now it's an MRO online catalog business. And their business literally over the last month is up almost a 100%. It's a smaller piece of that, but you're seeing a shift to online as well. All-in-all through March, we had a high single-digit, low double-digit POS across the entirety of our Consumer segment customer base.\nOperator: And we have our next question from Rosemarie Morbelli with G. Research.\nRosemarie Morbelli: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I was just wondering Frank, whether you could touch on the lower CapEx which -- what do you think the amount will be by year end and which are the projects that you are eliminating?\nFrank Sullivan: So, our goal this year was to spend about $180 million in CapEx. I think when we finished the year, we'll be closer to $150 million. Notably, with a really strong cash flow through 9 months, that included a year-over-year higher level of CapEx of about $20 million. So, that gives you a sense of the strong cash flow that we're generating. For next year, our preliminary budgeting was about $150 million in CapEx. And at this point in time, I think we compare that back by $25 million or $30 million, without negatively interrupting our Map to Growth the program or the areas that we're growing. And if need be, depending on circumstances, we compare that back further, but that's our current plan.\nRosemarie Morbelli: Okay. Thanks. And when -- you are talking about most of your facilities operating in the U.S. or in North America altogether. What is the capacity utilization? Yes, they are open, but how much business is coming out of there?\nFrank Sullivan: It's very hard to say, Rosemarie. I think we highlighted either in Rusty's comments or in our press release, it's circumstantial to each business. So, if you're in the -- a small project, paint, patch, repair, particularly our cleaner categories there is -- and I don't have them exactly, one of them is Krud Kutter industrial, another is a Mean Green anti-bacterial product. We have three cleaning products through Rust-Oleum that are certified as approved for cleaning surfaces relative to COVID-19. Those are through the roof and the constraints there is raw materials, but we're continuing to do that.  The flip side is our marine coatings business, which is a smaller business as part of our Specialty Products Group. In total, that's maybe a $25 million in revenue business and we normally wouldn't talk about SBU sizes, but to put that in perspective, and many of their large marine product retailers and/or shipyards that do repair maintenance and recoating for yachts and boats are closed. And so that's a business where revenues might be at this point be impacted as much as 50%. But that's a temporary period and whether that lasts for another few weeks or another few months, time will tell.\nRosemarie Morbelli: And if I may sneak another one in. With Q4 revenues down 15%, what could be the impact on your bottom-line and that is linked to the marine business being down 50% and I think if I am not wrong, that it has a very high margin? \nFrank Sullivan: Sure. We don't -- as Rusty said, we're suspending guidance. And at this point, we're looking at expense reductions, expense deferrals, cutbacks and capital spending, taking advantage of a few of the things that are in the CARES Act that apply two larger businesses. One example is a deferral of FICA taxes. We're looking at things like that to really drive cash flow generation and that's very much our focus. I think the MAP to Growth program will allow us to generate better bottom-line income than we otherwise would have in the face of revenue declines. But beyond that, we're not in a position really to talk about earnings, or earnings per share or any projections around that for the quarter.\nOperator: And we have our next question from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. \nSteve Byrne : What's the time lag and frequency by which you receive sales data from the big box home centers on your consumer products and let me just see how you answer that one first?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I'm pretty certain that in most categories our consumer businesses get that information on a weekly basis. \nSteve Byrne : And can you tell whether or not the home centers are placing orders for inventory restocking that's commensurate with that or do you sense any change in stock levels as they look forward into these next couple of months?\nFrank Sullivan: It literally is week-by-week. So, your question is spot on in terms of things that we're paying to -- paying attention to. There'll be some interesting new dynamics for all of us, relative to learning how to work from home. And I say that because we have a senior leader meeting every other day, at the end of the day, and we talk about COVID infections, if there are any. Fortunately, as our statistics show, they're not many and they have been sporadic. And they've actually mostly been in the New Jersey area for us. And we talk about impacting our operations. But we also talk about every other day what's going on, order flow impact. So, we have some good insight into that. It's very circumstantial. Some of our retail customers are showing a solid POS in the early part of April or what we would forecast for the early part of April here. Some of them are showing levels that are below where we were in March, and we think that has more to do with deliberate decisions to limit the traffic flow into their stores than it does with actually demand.  And then lastly, as I indicated earlier, it's very spotty. We are selling all the cleaning and disinfecting products that we can make. That's true with our Legend Brands business as well. And so, that's an area that maybe by July we'll have a better sense of what we can say in some detail about the different DIY product categories, and what's really moving the needle.\nSteve Byrne: And on that 6% organic growth that you\u2019ve posted in the fiscal third quarter in the Consumer segment, is that mostly volume? And can you comment on the outlook for price given moderating raws?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. It's mostly volume. As you saw, given the strong volume there and in our Consumer -- I'm sorry in our Construction Products Group and Performance Coatings Group, the leverage to the bottom-line has been a little less in our Consumer business in part because we've been facing some unique raw material challenges there, some of which are now abating. The biggest one was packaging in certain areas. And so, in all three of those segments, Construction Products and Consumer Products, the unit volume growth has been really solid.  In the Performance Coatings Group, actual unit volume growth through nine months has been better than the numbers show, because they've been very deliberate in pairing back lower margin product categories and in closing some lower margin or breakeven international businesses. So, as we indicated, we've shed close to $60 million or $70 million on an annualized basis deliberately in this reorganization. And that's been disproportionately in our Performance Coatings Group and our Construction Products Group not in Consumer. Although, there is some coming in consumer with some overseas businesses that don't meet our margin criteria. And so, it's been very solid organic growth.\nOperator: We have our next question from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird.\nGhansham Panjabi: Hey Frank, can you make some comments about -- obviously employee mobility impacting some of your Map to Growth initiatives. Clearly your customers are going to be impacted by the same dynamic, and presumably will be even as the economy starts to gradually open up. I'm just curious from a segment standpoint, how should we think about this dynamic as it relates to customer qualification of your products for future capital projects, et cetera? How are you sort of adapting towards this new normal, if you want to call it that?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. And so in our Construction Products business, I think we're fortunate both in every segment of RPM, because of the benefits of Map to Growth. But if you think about where we've been strong, so while our -- in general and to your question, I do think that there will be a reduction for a period of time in industrial capital spending, and certainly outside of oil and gas, which is part of that, a little more than $200 million, where there\u2019s probably $0.5 billion of our revenues that are driven by industrial capital spending, or major projects. But again, it's circumstantial.  Our Stonhard business has been a leading provider globally, including the application portion of it, of polymer flooring with a real strong presence in food, beverage hospitals, fab plants, and so areas of the economy that we think are going to do pretty well. Interesting anecdote was our Stonhard business that was cast by a major contractor to put together the hygienic flooring in the hospital, temporary hospital facilities that were going to be set up in Central Park in New York. And we got that order. It was under strict requirements relative to timing. We got the material and the applicators there and then good news relatively quickly, that order got cut in half. Because it seems as if the anticipated need of the number of bed spaces for this temporary hospital spot in New York City is not going to be needed. I hope that's true. But that gives you a sense of why we think over time that segment will do well.  Our Tremco roofing business has been the leader in North America, in these long-term high performing restoration roofing projects, and what they've been very good at is being able to dry out an old roof as opposed to tear it off, and then apply a roof restoration coating and extend the life of a 30 or 40 year old roof for another 10 to 20 years, that's at a third of the cost of ripping off and replacing with new materials a old roof. Surely, we will be seeing enhanced competition there. But we're the leader there and I say that because I think that the negative impact in that sector for us will be more on the rip off and OEM replacement. We don't play in that space. 95% of our Tremco roofing business has been reroofing. And so without filibustering the call here, we've looked at oil and gas, that will be a problem. We've looked at a $0.5 billion driven by industrial capital spending, because clearly we're going to be cutting ours and others will do the same and it's circumstantial. But in a lot of cases, I think we're in a pretty good position.\nGhansham Panjabi: And Frank, I know you don't want to give guidance, completely understandable. But as you kind of think back to the financial crisis, what was the initial decremental margin that the business saw before it started to be dampened to some extent by lower raw material costs. Obviously, you're in a position of strength with MAP to Growth and the momentum there. So, just curious as to what transpired back then? And then second, as you kind of think about disruption risk yourselves given the fluid operating environment, how should we think about working capital. Will that be -- will you build up a little bit more inventory as part of your safety stock or supplying your customers or do you still expect working capital to be a benefit this year to the extent that it has been?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So, when you go back to \u201808 and \u201809, our fiscal year could not have modeled the great recession any better. We started our \u201809 fiscal year in June of \u201808 and we finished our \u201809 fiscal year on May 31 of \u201809. So, we pretty much modeled the beginning of the financial crisis and then when people started to feel okay. In that period of time, our sales were down 7% and our adjusted net income was off a little more than 35%. We had our best cash flow year ever.  In fiscal 2010, sales on a consolidated basis recovered by about 1% and earnings -- net income and EPS was up 25% on an adjusted basis. And so, we had a strong recovery and that was not inconsistent with kind of the V recovery that many people had. I think our cash conversion cycle is better now, thanks to the timing of Map to Growth. I do think, while we will build up some safety stock in a few areas, I do think through a combination of Map to Growth and in some cases reduced volume, you will see working capital as a contributor to cash generation in the coming quarters.  As I've commented, our -- we look bottom-up, the entrepreneurial nature of RPM in terms of how we serve our customers is still alive and well and will suit us well in terms of flexibility, and this is a big picture perspective. But contrary to what some people expect, I do not see a V for global economies here. I see a U and I think the U will be shorter for some and longer for others depending on -- and all of you know this better than we do, on the impact of this pandemic, which has been devastating to certain industries and hospitality for instance, and has been helpful to some unique businesses relative to cleaning products. But for us, I see a improved performance, as we get into our new fiscal year relative to our conservatively a negative expectations for Q4. But I think for everybody, we're looking at a U recovery not a V.\nOperator: And we have our next question from Silke Kueck with JPMorgan.\nSilke Kueck: I was wondering, if I could do like a similar exercise, like look at like what happened in '09. And what sort of like happened is that in the February and May quarters the organic growth was sort of like down 10% or 15%, which is why your guidance really makes sense. And if you look at it by divisions, one of the things that happened is, is that both of the industrial business, which is now your construction, your Performance Coatings business, they were down maybe in terms of volumes like 12% in the February quarter and then 19% in the May quarter. But the Consumer business had similar results. The Consumer business in February was down 14% in volumes and maybe 19% in the May quarter. And in part it had to do that, there was a financial crisis and people couldn't spend money. And like some of it feels like something similar is going on now where a lot of people will be unemployed and like a third of the people didn't pay a rent for April. And so, one of the questions is, when we model down this like 10% to 15%, should that really be stuck into all the segments rather than saying well Consumer is down 5% and everything else is down 20%?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I am -- I think this is different from the financial crisis. And so, I don't have in front of me the details by segment. We had three segments back then. And so, can't be specific to that. But I can tell you in the third quarter, our Consumer segment tanked. And we literally anecdotally were talking about shooting cannons down the aisle of our big customers, including home centers like Walmart and not hitting anybody. And so for a very short period of time during the financial crisis, consumers stopped buying everything. And I think the fear there was that at some point they're going to go to their ATM and nothing is going to come out. That eased up very quickly. I think what we're seeing now is very different. We're seeing pretty steady on a segment basis, but spiky based on different product categories, business activity but it does speak Silke to the comment I made earlier, we do not anticipate a V recovery for us and for anybody. I do think that there will be even as economies recover, even as these mandated government restrictions are eased, I do think that there will be a period of time in which economic activity from where we were a year ago will be somewhat subdued.\nSilke Kueck: So, you're more of a believer that if you looked at this -- and then I don't mean to criticize, but just trying to understand. So, like your view as you said there's probably a lot more -- from your point of view, there would be like a lot more headwind on construction, performance group businesses in terms of negative volumes and May quarter and a lot less than consumer side?\nFrank Sullivan: So, I think in the May quarter, it is our expectation that there will be less negative impacts in our Consumer segment than in our other segments. That is correct. The one that's the spikiest for us right now is Construction Products Group because we're seeing days of year-over-year record overflow, and then days of crickets. And so it's very spiky, so it's hard to know. \nSilke Kueck: And then just a question of clarification on the MAP Growth product -- program. If you realize $21 million in savings year-over-year in the third quarter, does one analyze and say the run rate savings are like $85 million or $84 million for the year. Is that the way to look at it?\nRusty Gordon: Yes, the savings we're talking to are the incremental year-over-year savings of $21 million and those change each quarter. Our cumulative savings we used to report in the past, we found it would be more helpful for analysts to discuss the quarter and the increments. \nFrank Sullivan: Yes. And so, back to our original goal of $290 million in savings. In terms of the manufacturing fees, the procurement fees and the G&A fees, we are on track for the G&A fees. But that slowed down. We are ahead of both of the manufacturing and procurement piece relative to our original 200 million -- $290 million goals. There have been some offsets to that. FX has hurt us in ways we didn't anticipate. Slower growth has hurt us. But we're through 20 plant closures out of the plant 31. We\u2019re through $60 million to $70 million of either business or product line rationalizations. The continuous improvement activity in our plants by the time we're done this with this, will exceed our original goals meaningfully. So, if you recall, we have $75 million of targeted MAP to Growth goals in the manufacturing area split roughly between the impact of footprint consolidation and continuous improvement. We'll achieve the half from footprint consolidation and we will have tens of millions of dollars of more out of the continuous improvement efforts by the time we're done, and that will be incrementally continuing.  So all of those have been going quite well for us and they're pretty well embedded. The momentum, as you guys pointed out, year one in a three year restructuring program was the easiest with the lowest hanging fruit. But year two has gone exceedingly well and our momentum was continuing to build. My biggest disappointment -- and again, it's a trite statement in light of what's happening in the world is, that momentum now has been a little bit disruptive.\nOperator: And we have our next question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. \nVincent Andrews: So, just want to ask, in the fourth quarter sales guidance, what was the impact you have in there for foreign exchange and for M&A just so that we can kind of get to the true organic range that you're looking for?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes, that's a great question. And, we are trying to take into account FX, and again, I mentioned that we talked to the senior leadership team every other day and the FX swings in developing country currencies are nuts. So, in Latin America you're seeing 30%, 40% plus negative impacts. I would remind folks that that's about $300 million of revenues in total.\nRusty Gordon: Yes.\nFrank Sullivan: And so, it's not huge, but -- and then you can see the strength of the dollar versus the euro and the Canadian dollar and the pound, which are other bigger currencies. So, we are anticipating that in this guidance for the fourth quarter, the acquisition activity will be very modest as you saw in the third quarter, so -- but we don't anticipate -- in some prior quarters acquisition activity at a 1% or 2% has been offset by FX. We think FX will be decidedly more negative and certainly will not be offset by 1% acquisition positive impact.\nVincent Andrews: So, if we think like 3% to 5% for FX, is that in the ballpark, keeping in mind that it\u2019s a moving target?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes, that would be our best guess right now. I think that's good math. But who knows.\nVincent Andrews: Okay. And then I'd like to just want to clarify one other thing. You called out the $200 million of oil and gas exposed revenue and the $500 million tied to industrial customer CapEx that you're obviously quite concerned about for easy to understand reason. Is there another subset of revenue at all that you've same concerns about or slightly less concerns about? Or I'm just trying to -- clearly Consumer, we can tell there's a good DIY opportunity there and the sustainability of it. We can all debate or is a pull forward or whatever. But just trying to -- as I think through the broader buckets, just want to make sure that there aren't some other areas of revenue where you as concerned as industrial CapEx spend in oil and gas?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes. Those are the two biggest ones that I think is appropriate to point out to our investors to say, look, these are the two big pots that we're paying attention to. And we've provided some color as to why we think we'll ride through for instance an industrial capital spending or big maintenance spending better than most. Then it's anecdotal. I mentioned the marine coatings business that's mostly pleasure marines and yachts, and it's a smaller business, but because of the shutdown of their customer base at boatyards, we anticipate their revenues could be half in the fourth quarter of what they were a year ago. It's anybody's guess as to when those retailers and those boatyards open up, as to whether we have a modest recovery or depending on the health circumstances, if everybody is happy to put their boats back in the water and there is a little bit of a spike in order flow from what's been a very economic impact of coronavirus related shutdowns on that business. So we're just -- we're monitoring business unit by business unit to try and assess those same questions. But we've highlighted in the call today the big areas that we're paying attention to and we think investors should as well.\nOperator: We have our next question from Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities.\nMike Harrison : You mentioned, I think, primarily in Performance the $60 million or $70 million worth of product lines where you've been shedding some lower margin business. Can you just give a little bit of a sense on kind of where you are in those actions and when you start to lap those actions? And I think you referenced some similar actions in other segments including Consumer. Have you started on those already or are those actions yet to come in other segments?\nFrank Sullivan: So, yes, the answer to that is we started on those, but their impact will be in the future and I would anticipate by the time we're done with our MAP to Growth program, that on the $60 million to $70 million of product lines or businesses that we have either closed or eliminated, there's probably another $30 million to come and maybe a little bit more. And that would come mostly outside of our Performance Coatings Group and our Construction Products Group. So it would be a little bit in Specialty and some -- principally some far away overseas operations in our Consumer segment.\nMike Harrison : And then just in terms of the MAP to Growth, the areas that are being disrupted or delayed, what are some of the things that you can still move forward on and what are you stock waiting until people can travel more freely? And then I guess the second issue behind that is, should we think of that delay as just, once the stay-at-home orders are lifted, you'll get back to work, or will it take time to ramp those activities back up and so it could be longer after the stay-at-home order is lifted?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. And so I'll highlight that from a cash flow perspective first. In the first year of our MAP to Growth program, we were probably spending upwards of $30 million in outside consulting fees and related MAP to Growth fees. That's down or was down to about $4 million or $5 million bucks on an annualized basis. And very quickly about three or four weeks ago, we hired in dollar, manufacturing facilities in all our locations. And so if you are a non-essential employee, that includes me, you don't belong in our plants and that includes outside contractors. And so the idea of having smaller consultants that were helping us with continuous improvement who go from our plant to plant to plant and who come from other plants wasn't a good idea. So the people that have been working with our team and were now getting down to the kind of mid-to-smaller sized manufacturing facilities to institute, what we call, fit events and these continuous improvement disciplines have been halted. I can assure you, they're all eager to get back going. I have no idea when the world will be ready and we will be ready to turn the green light on that. But I can assure you the second we are, those consultants are going to be eager to get back to work because when we halted their activity, we halted their payments. The same thing is true on some accounting consolidation and ERP consolidation activities to the extent that we have fees that would be generated with paybacks that are, let's say, over a three-year period. All that activities halted. And so if we don't see a payback on some of the activity, even that we can do remotely, that is in inside of a year, those programs have been stopped both practically because we can't put people into our facilities personally and financially, because some of the activities that were going to have a payout, which is a good IRR, but still a payout longer than two or three years has been halted. And I would tell you, the things that all good companies are thinking about is capital structure, cash flow and liquidity and cash generation. So in things large like reducing planned CapEx by $25 million or $30 million with the belief that we could do more and things small like every $50,000 or $500,000 contract with an outside consultant. They're all being canceled or delayed.\nOperator: We have our next question from Josh Spector with UBS.\nJosh Spector : Just on the raw material front, you guys talked about more moderating raw material inflation, not necessarily declines. I was wondering if you could provide some more color on where you're seeing increases? And related to that, if oil kind of stays where it is, which I know is a big if, what point would you start to expect to see some of those savings flow through the P&L?\nFrank Sullivan : It\u2019s a great question. And so initially we were seeing some tightening in certain raw material categories and some -- because of that, some pricing pressure. One category was silicones, that pricing pressure and availability has seemed to ease off. The flip side is, over the last year or so, one of the categories that was defying raw material deflation was metal packaging and I would anticipate, with what's happening globally, in certain categories, that maybe we'll finally see some relief in that category. So it's been circumstantial around different categories. There is no doubt that with oil prices being where they are, if they settle into a sustained area, that there will be some solvent and resin categories that will see some decreases in cost versus where we sit today.\nJosh Spector : And I guess related to that, as we look across the different segments, if raw materials were to decline meaningfully, how quickly would you expect prices to react in the industrial and construction segments and maybe converse to that, how slow would pricing react in the Consumer segment?\nFrank Sullivan : It's really hard to say at this point in time. We are holding on to the pricing that we've been able to effect over the last year and a half. We needed that because of a 2.5 year cyclical raw material increase. We're not back to where we were in terms of that mix 2.5 years ago. But at this point, most of our customers are focused on supply, fill rates, availability and really working with them to make sure that we have product when they need it, and where they need it, and it's been a -- supply chains across industries have had to be more nimble because of the spikiness of order flows. So that's where we are today. We don't have a good -- I don't have a good answer to that question, and I don't think that, that will really unfold for another quarter or two.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets.\nArun Viswanathan : I just wanted to understand, I guess, when you look at your commentary that some of your international locations are closed. So should we expect I guess the greatest decline in your Q4 sales in both Construction Products and industrial? Is that the right way to think about it?\nFrank Sullivan : Yes. So our Performance Coatings Group and our Construction Products Group, what was formerly our Industrial segment has our greatest exposure to markets outside of North America and Europe is seeing -- has been seeing weak demand as we've been communicating for a year. We've had some spots of brightness there in the last couple of quarters but not quite half of our European operations were -- have been closed at one time or another. So there has been more aggressive government mandated closures in various countries in Europe than we've seen in North America. And so, as I commented earlier, it's true throughout Latin America and India. And those are predominantly Performance Coatings and Construction Products Group businesses.\nArun Viswanathan : And so I guess just trying to understand how this works, I mean when you guys do take a plant down, I think you noted that was about 6% of your sales potentially that are affected by closed plants. Is it effectively that, that whole 6% is lost, or is it -- are you kind of thinking that maybe 50% of that amount is lost? And how does that relate to the inventory? I guess do you guys already have inventory on hand to potentially service some customers or is it just kind of stops for the time the plant is down?\nFrank Sullivan : No, no, that's correct. I mean we have inventory on hand and depending on the nature of the different business, we can cover closedowns without much disruption for as long as 20 or 30 days. After that, your inventory depletion based on certain product categories can be problematic in one particular formula or color versus others. But it's very circumstantial to plants. As I said, we had a plant in Norway that was closed. It's part of our Performance Coatings Group, that's been reopened. We split a single -- a marine coating single shift plant into two shifts. We had an infection in a shift. We closed the plant for two days, aggressively disinfected it and quarantined the shift of the people that were working with the individual that was infected and brought back the other shift that was not. And so I could give you a plant by plant circumstance. I think all companies who are operating are becoming much more nimble as to how to segregate shifts, how to do cleaning between shifts, how to understand -- we had a plant where a contractor who is into repair equipment was diagnosed with coronavirus and he had been in that plant 10 days prior, and we didn't know it for 10 days. We closed the plant. It's actually a plant currently closed and we're closing it for six days. We're cleaning that plant and that's six days plus the 10 days when the last time the contractor was in there is a 16-day period. Interestingly, the plants that have been affected in the United States are all Metropolitan New York, New Jersey area and from what we can tell they've been all at-home infections, because we have not had any hotspots and our efforts to close a plant, clean it and then bring people back in the appropriate time has been affected or effective. So that's probably more than you need to know, but it's very circumstantial. Inventory plays a big part. Having a protocol by which you understand how quickly you can get back in business and then understanding what the government mandates hour. So for instance, we're closed in our two major plants in India and they're set to reopen in another couple of weeks. That closure could be extended and we don't know yet. There have been closures in other countries that have occurred and then we've had reopenings.\nArun Viswanathan : Okay. So I guess it all depends on how long the plants are down for. So I guess, just to follow up. So typically, I guess, the inventory levels that you do keep at various plants, that also varies or should we assume it's kind of maybe at least maybe 30 days or so? So if there is a 30 day shutdown maybe you can manage through that or is that the right way to think about it?\nFrank Sullivan : It varies business by business, but I do think that in almost all of our businesses, we could get by for a period of 20 to 30 days. But after that, you begin to negatively impact your ability to supply customers, particularly in more unique product categories.\nArun Viswanathan : Okay, thanks. Sorry to take up so much time.\nFrank Sullivan : Yes, we have not seen at this point, nor do we anticipate, any closures anywhere of 30 days or more, but circumstances could be different in different parts of the world.\nArun Viswanathan : Great. And just lastly, similarly on the supply chain. So I know a couple of years back, you had some issues with sourcing MMA maybe out of Asia and some other raws. Has any of that transpired? Do you expect any of that? Is that kind of factored into your statement about maybe not expecting as much of a tailwind from the raws side or how are you thinking about the supply chain for your input costs?\nFrank Sullivan : Yes. We try and pay attention to that every day. I commented earlier on silicone, which was an issue a few weeks back, seems to be okay today. Cleaning product -- and this should not be a surprise, cleaning product raw materials are an issue and we get what we need relative to past allocations. In some cases we cannot get what we need to meet an explosive demand. And so that is a product category that we pay attention to a lot. That impacts some of our consumer businesses. So those categories are significantly ahead of prior years, but in certain circumstances, may not be meeting demand because of raw material supply. The same is true in our Legend Brands business that makes HEPA filter equipment and filters and industrial disinfecting and cleaning products including products that are sold in the hospitals, that was before all this happened, and we could sell more of those products if we could get more raw materials.\nOperator: We have our next question from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research.\nKevin McCarthy : I just wanted to probe a little bit more on the subject of decremental margins. As you look across the portfolio, are there businesses that would stand out to you as having unusual ratios of fixed versus variable costs on either end of the spectrum? Trying to get a handle on how we might take some of these larger than normal sales variances and then take that down to the bottom-line during this period of dislocation.\nFrank Sullivan : Sure. I don't know that that's particularly true in general across RPM. Obviously every business has its own breakeven point. If it's truer in certain segments than others, that would be in our Specialty segment. And so you had businesses like our Day-Glo or fluorescent color business or other Specialty segment businesses that have lower than average gross margins, but higher than average EBIT margins. And so they do have a fixed point there. You're already seeing that in the revenue challenges that we've been having in the last couple of quarters in our Specialty Products Group. Those numbers would have been somewhat worse were it not for the MAP to Growth programs. But in general, when you look across our Construction Products Group, you look across our Performance Coatings Group, there is a high level of variability between raw material costs which obviously are variable to sales and probably represent 40% of our P&L and selling costs which, depending on the business, are split may be 50-50 between fixed and variable or two-thirds fixed and one-third variable but a pretty high level of variability in a lot of our businesses.\nKevin McCarthy : And then, Frank, I wanted to ask, you know, having suspended the share repurchases that I expect a lot of companies will do, what is your current view on M&A? Have you hit the pause button there as well or do you see some opportunities with lower multiples for example?\nFrank Sullivan : Sure, well, we have hit the pause button on that. We are looking at a couple of smaller sized transactions that were all but done and I think we're working with those businesses on what to do in terms of timing and other items. But in terms of new transactions, I think our cash flow that had been devoted to looking at acquisitions and/or repurchasing our stock, and as you can see, our cash flow generation is better than it's ever been, will be devoted to continuing operations, maintaining our dividend and everything else to repaying debt.\nOperator: And thank you. We have our last question from Kevin Hocevar with Northcoast Research.\nKevin Hocevar : Thanks for squeezing me in. As you -- obviously the coronavirus has impacted the U.S. and different places at different times and in different degrees and the states have responded differently in terms of how they're prohibiting construction activity. So as we look at -- do you have any visibility in terms of the states that are most prohibitive in terms of construction like New York, Michigan places like that? How your construction end markets are doing versus other parts of the country where there is less prohibitive restrictions in place? Just curious if you have any visibility and can separate between the different regions there.\nFrank Sullivan : Sure. For the most part, construction activity in general and particularly as it relates to infrastructure is up and running throughout North America. The most states are following the Department of Homeland Security guidelines which qualify construction activity as essential. The state that I'm aware of, and this could be different than other places, the state that I'm aware of that had the harshest focus on construction was Pennsylvania. And the construction industry worked with the Governor's office to talk about PPE protocols and social distancing and what was happening in other states. And within a week or 10 days, the original halting of construction activity in Pennsylvania was eased. And I believe now Pennsylvania is following the Department of Homeland Security guidelines on construction. We saw a similar order in Quebec Province of Canada and that has also been eased somewhat. The rest of North America, as far as I know, sitting here today is allowing construction activity as long as there is a maintenance of certain PPE and social distancing protocols. In a number of our areas, it's truer than most. When you're doing roofing activity or you're in the USL business and your activity is outside or outdoors, I think there is less concern. If you're doing flooring work and you can maintain all those protocols, again, I mentioned it's a spiky business. One of the reasons we're seeing spiky business in that business activity is it requires the shutdown of a manufacturing operation to get in and do rehab and/or replacement of floors. Whether it's manufacturing facilities, institutional facilities and in particular for roofing, schools and universities, those all have closure areas that are allowing for some of the construction activity that we do. And so, we'll see whether that's been beneficial for us or perhaps is pulling some summer work into the fourth quarter. But it's very spiky and we'll report the results in July when we have our fourth quarter results final.\nKevin Hocevar : And then on the DIY side, the strength that you're seeing there, what's your sense -- I mean is this something you believe is more of a near term phenomenon as people are -- have stay-at-home orders in place, that they're looking for things to do, going to Home Depot and doing a small project themselves or/and when those orders are lifted that maybe we get back to normal or is this a trend that you think could last for a while as maybe people don't want contractors coming in the home and look to do things themselves? Just give us your thoughts there.\nFrank Sullivan : Sure. It really depends. I think that this will be somewhat spiky now because people are at home and they -- when they're tired of watching Netflix, they can get at the small project paint or home decorating and repair activity that they want. There is a decided shift to people doing it themselves as opposed to having outside contractors come in and do it for them. It would be nice to think that things would revert back to normal, so a slower level of POS perhaps when the world gets back to more normal. This goes without saying, I think, some of it depends on how quickly medical advances save the day, if you will. And if that doesn't happen, and for instance in the United States, we're seeing a meaningful and sustained unemployment rate that's 10%, 12%, which some people believe for a period of time that will negatively impact our DIY business over time. But all of that's circumstantial to what's coming this summer and this fall related to the impact of the coronavirus and how quickly people can get back to work and what the medical outcomes relative to vaccines or treatments are.\nOperator: Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to Frank Sullivan for closing remarks.\nFrank Sullivan : Thank you very much, Vanessa. I'd like to thank our associates around the world for their efforts. They have continued to grow the business while carrying out our MAP to Growth restructuring program very effectively. Now they're demonstrating incredible resilience by also finding ways to protect their health, support their communities and maintain our business operations. In particular, I'd like to thank the men and women who courageously show up to work every day in our manufacturing facilities and distribution centers. These frontline associates are keeping RPM running to the benefit of all of our associates, our customers and our shareholders. We look forward to updating you on our fiscal 2020 fourth quarter and year-end results in July. In the meantime, we'd like to thank you very much for being on today's call and we wish you and your families happiness and good health as we all manage through this extraordinary time. Thank you for participating in our call today and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes our conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Matt Ratajczak",
            "content": "Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. Note that my comments will be on an as adjusted basis. During the third quarter, we generated consolidated net sales of $1.17 billion, an increase of 2.9% compared to the $1.14 billion reported during the same quarter of fiscal 2019. Organic sales growth was 3% or $34.0 million. Acquisitions contributed 0.7% of sales or $9.0 million, while foreign exchange was a headwind that reduced sales by 0.8% or $9.6 million. This was solid top-line growth during the third quarter, which typically generates our most modest results each year because it falls during the winter months when painting and construction activity is slow.  Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.23, an increase of 76.9% compared to the $0.13 in the year ago quarter. Our consolidated adjusted earnings before interest in taxes, EBIT, were up 30.4% to $60.5 million, compared to $46.4 million reported in the fiscal 2019 third quarter. These excellent bottom-line results were largely due to initiatives under our MAP to Growth restructuring program. Our earnings also benefited from pricing and moderating raw material costs. Turning now to our segments. Sales in our Construction Products Group were strong and increased 4.7% to $372.1 million. Growth was primarily organic at 5.1% or $18.5 million. Acquisitions contributed 1% or $3.4 million. Foreign currency translation reduced sales by 1.4% or $5.1 million. Sales growth was driven by market share gains and the introduction of innovative new products with the fastest growth being generated in our roofing below-grade waterproofing and concrete admixtures businesses.  Adjusted EBIT in the Construction Products segment increased $6.0 million from adjusted EBIT loss of $0.3 million during last year's third quarter. This improvement was largely attributed to pricing, moderating raw material costs, Map to Growth savings, and a favorable leverage impact of higher sales volume.  Sales in our Performance Coatings Group were $255.7 million, up 1% from the $253.2 million we reported during last year's third quarter. Organic growth was 1.6% or $3.9 million. Sales growth in the segment was mixed. Its highway and bridge maintenance businesses were slowed by government budget constraints, particularly in the UK. However, its protective and marine coatings business unit increased market share and its Continental European operations grew sharply, driven by a new global management structure.  Acquisitions added 0.2% of sales or a $0.5 million, while foreign exchange was a headwind of 0.8% or $1.9 million. Segment adjusted EBIT increased 33.2% to $24.2 million from $18.2 million during last year's third quarter. Our focus on higher margin products and service offerings as well as Map to Growth business rationalization initiatives drove a significant adjusted EBIT margin improvement of 230 basis points in the segment. In the Consumer Group, sales were robust, increasing 5.4% to $398.7 million. Organic sales increased 6% or $22.6 million, driven by market share gains and unseasonably warm winter weather in North America that enabled consumers to complete more DIY home improvement projects. The fastest growth was achieved in our caulks, sealants, and patch and repair product lines. There was no impact from acquisitions during the quarter.  Foreign currency translation reduced sales by 0.6% or $2.2 million. Adjusted EBIT in the Consumer Group was $32.1 million, an increase of 19.2% over the prior year. This bottom-line performance was driven by savings from our Map to Growth operating improvement plan and were partially offset by inflation in certain raw materials and channel mix. On the top-line, the Specialty Products Group's wood coatings business successfully outperformed its peers in a challenging market. However, sales of the segment's water damage restoration products faced a difficult comparison to the prior year when demand was exceptionally high due to significant weather events in North America.  Sales were also down in our OEM fluorescent pigments, nail polish and edible coatings businesses. Segment sales were $147.5 million. Organic sales decreased 7.1% and foreign currency translation reduced sales by 0.3%. The segment benefited 3.3% or $5.1 million from acquisitions.  Adjusted EBIT was $17.5 million during the quarter, which was lower than the $20.2 million of adjusted EBIT reported in the same period last year. Savings from our operating improvement program helped to mitigate the impact declining sales volume had on earnings. In addition, we have new management in place and are implementing cost cutting measures and new processes to reignite growth.  Now, I'll provide some comments on our cash flow and liquidity. For the first nine months of fiscal 2020, cash from operations grew by 162% to $381.2 million, compared to $145.5 million a year ago. This increase of $235.7 million was due to improved working capital management and operating improvement initiatives. Free cash flow improved to a source of cash of $137 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2020, as compared to a use of cash of $74.5 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2019. This $211.5 million increase is a result of higher earnings, coupled with overall improved working capital metrics.  Next, a few comments on our liquidity profile. The maturities of our long-term debt portfolio are nicely staggered with the next scheduled maturity out in November of 2022, and we have multiple options for access to short-term liquidity under both our revolving credit and accounts receivables facilities. Further, in the month of February, we improved our financial flexibility and increased our liquidity by $400 million by securing two three-year term loans. We borrowed $400 million immediately after closing and swapped to a euro fixed interest rate of approximately 0.6%. The proceeds were used to pay down the balance on our revolving credit facility.  Finally, as Frank stated, at February 29, 2020, our total liquidity including cash and committed revolving credit facilities was $1.1 billion.  I'll now turn the call over to Rusty for details on our share repurchase program and the outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2020."

            "name": "Rusty Gordon",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt. As part of our MAP to Growth program, we established the goal of repurchasing $1 billion of our stock. In March subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we exceeded the halfway point of that goal when we repurchased approximately $25 million of our common shares. This is in addition to the $300 million we repurchased during fiscal 2019 and the first three quarters of fiscal 2020, coupled with $200 million cash redemption of our convertible notes in November of 2018. While we were making good progress on this goal, given recent macroeconomic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we have suspended our share buyback program.  Looking ahead, the fourth quarter is seasonally our strongest and was off to a good start in March. Consolidated sales for the month increased 5% over the prior year, led by the Specialty segment which was up 9%, Consumer was up 7%, Construction Products Group sales increased 7% and Performance Coatings Group declined 3%. However, like most companies, we expect our financial results to be impacted by the disruption and uncertainty COVID-19 is having on the global economy. Today, nearly all of our plants are open in North America, where we generate 74% of our sales. Some of our international plants have been shut down due to government mandates around the world. These facilities generate approximately 6% of RPM sales. While these shutdowns are at various durations, ranging from days to weeks, they are likely to impact our fourth quarter sales in April and May. In our Construction Products Group, demand for our innovative products and solutions has been robust and the segment has very strong momentum behind it. Construction is on the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Essential Critical Infrastructure Workforce Advisory list. The segment has a large number of hospital and healthcare system clients that will continue to require its offerings. During a good sales month in March, Tremco was able to support schools during this unexpected shutdown by moving up planned roofing and other facility restoration work.  At our Performance Coatings Group, results will be mixed. We anticipate seeing a boost in sales for our hygienic seamless flooring systems. However, the portion of our corrosion control and fireproofing coatings that are tied directly or indirectly to oil and gas markets, a little more than $200 million in sales annually, maybe at risk should there be a prolonged drop in pricing in those markets. So, we are closely monitoring investment in this area. POS takeaway at our Consumer Group has been strong with unit growth in the mid to high single-digits, particularly for our professional and consumer cleaning and disinfecting brands, some of which are effective against the coronavirus. The majority of the segment sales are in North America where DIY home and hardware retailers remain open for business. As consumer shelter in place, they are spending more time in their homes and have more time and interest in home repair, maintenance, improving and cleaning projects, which should continue to benefit the segment. In our Specialty Products Group, the outlook is mixed. Some of our companies such as our marine coatings business will be slowed by the closures of their distributor and retail networks. On the other hand, Legend Brands which manufactures cleaning products and equipment is seeing spiking demand as its restoration contractor base is shifting to disinfecting services and this trend should continue over the coming months. According to current government projections, it appears that the COVID-19 crisis may reach its peak in April or May. This is obviously a fluid situation and the information available to us is rapidly changing.  As we sit here today, we anticipate that our consolidated fourth quarter revenue will be down 10% to 15% year-over-year. This assumes our strong March results are counterbalanced by sales drops in April and May of 15% to 20%.  With that being said, given the uncertainties around this crisis, we are withdrawing our prior earnings guidance for the fourth quarter and full-year of fiscal 2020. We will continue to assess the situation and the short and long-term impacts of COVID-19. We are taking aggressive actions to manage cash flow by reducing working capital, capital expenditures and discretionary spending. The MAP to Growth program timing has been fortunate for us in this regard, since we have improved margins and are starting to see the benefits of our working capital reduction program, resulting in improved cash flow this year. Additionally, as Frank and Matt mentioned, we have significant liquidity and a strong balance sheet, which we anticipate will keep us in a solid financial position. This concludes our formal comments. We will now be pleased to take your questions. Yes, the savings we're talking to are the incremental year-over-year savings of $21 million and those change each quarter. Our cumulative savings we used to report in the past, we found it would be more helpful for analysts to discuss the quarter and the increments. Yes."

            "name": "Frank Sullivan",
            "content": "Thank you, Vanessa. Good morning and welcome to the RPM International Inc. investor call for our fiscal 2020 third quarter ended February 29, 2020. On the call with me today are Rusty Gordon, RPM's Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Matt Ratajczak, our Vice President of Global Tax and Treasury, who is also heading our Investor Relations functions. I'll start the call by discussing how we are managing our business through the COVID-19 pandemic, then I'll provide an update on our 2020 MAP to Growth operating improvement program. After that, I'll turn the call over to Matt, who will walk through our third quarter results in detail and he'll be followed by Rusty, who will discuss the outlook for the fourth quarter and year end. First, we know that all of you are dealing with disruptions in your professional and personal lives resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, especially our analysts and investors from the New York City area. I'd like to thank you for being on our call today and for your continuing interest in RPM and wish you and your families' good health during this challenging time. At RPM, our priorities have been to protect the health and wellbeing of our associates and their family members, to support our local communities to control the spread of the virus and to serve our customers by maintaining the continuity and success of our business operations. Our 15,000 associates around the world have really embraced these priorities and I'd like to commend them for the incredible work they've done to continue each and every day. When it comes to protecting their own health and that of their families, we've established many protocols across our operations. We're taking precautions in our facilities to keep our people safe by aggressively cleaning and disinfecting high touch areas, practicing social distancing and good hygiene, and have been screening for COVID-19 symptoms prior to entry in all of our facilities for more than three weeks. As of April 7th, we have been informed by 14 of our 15,000 employees that they have had at various times confirmed cases of coronavirus. In these cases, we enacted our protocols to shut down the affected locations, have them thoroughly cleaned and disinfected, quarantined all appropriate affected people, and then reopen the facilities following an appropriate shutdown period. In terms of our communities, we are working from home, monitoring the hygiene and health of our manufacturing and distribution associates and reporting any infection or disruption.  We're also donating time and materials to help stem the spread of the virus. In one case, our wood finishes group supplied thousands of plastic bottles to a local distillery, that has been converting products to hand sanitizer and it's providing it for free in the community, especially to healthcare-first responders. In another case, our Rust-Oleum operation sourced its Concrobium fogger product and donated it to first responders so that their air ambulance helicopters could be disinfected and return to service quickly. These are just a few examples of how our operations are responding to local needs. As one of the world's largest suppliers of specialty coatings and building materials, RPM is in a strong position to weather the toll that the COVID-19 pandemic is having on the global economy. We are taking action to adjust our business activities during this period of uncertainty and are well-positioned with strong cash flow, a solid capital structure and $1.1 billion in liquidity. Many of our products are used for construction, maintenance and repair projects, which are deemed essential in many cases and are relatively recession resistant.  RPM companies around the world, with a few exceptions, have been able to continue to operate their plants and distribution centers. In fact, today nearly all of our North American plants are operational, with a few exceptions, while a number of our international plants have been closed due to government mandates.  A large number of our North American customers, such as those in construction, infrastructure, and DIY home and hardware retail, are also considered essential and currently remain open for business. With people spending more time in their homes, there is potential for increased DIY activity projects. Raw material cost inflation seems to be moderating in a number of our key product categories. Our global supply chain remains strong and our distribution and operations associates continue to work diligently to meet customer demand.  We continue to be proactive in taking actions around the globe in our operations as the situation evolves.  Now, I'd like to discuss our MAP to Growth restructuring program. It has steadily been gaining momentum each quarter. This quarter is no different as demonstrated by our excellent bottom-line results, strong organic growth, strong earnings leverage and record levels of cash generation. Restructuring activities include enacting operational improvements at our production facilities, consolidating manufacturing plants, de-layering management and rationalizing product lines.  During the third quarter and early in the fourth quarter, we announced the closure of two additional plants which brings our total to 20 out of the 31 plants that were originally targeted for closure at the beginning of the MAP to Growth program. Versus last year on a consolidated basis, we realized incremental MAP to Growth savings in the third quarter totaling $21 million, of which $5 million came from manufacturing, $12 million from procurement and $4 million from SG&A.  Looking ahead, as the COVID-19 pandemic slows economic and business activity, it is also impacting our MAP to Growth program. While there are some initiatives that can be carried out virtually, many, particularly those dealing with additional manufacturing improvements and the completion of our ERP implementations require a physical presence at some of our plants and offices. Limits on travel and access to facilities have required us to temporarily halt some of our operating improvement activities. As such, we will be extending out the timeline from our original MAP to Growth goals in terms of their ultimate achievement.  At this point, there is too much uncertainty to set a new date for reaching our objectives. As our markets stabilize and we gain more clarity into the business conditions, we will communicate our new MAP to Growth timeline. But as you can see, once again, in our third quarter results, our people are executing on our MAP to Growth initiatives very effectively.  I'll now turn the call over to Matt Ratajczak for a detailed review of our results for the third quarter. Sure. So, first of all, it doesn't behoove anybody to do forecasting with an optimistic outlook. And so I think our assumptions of April and May being down 15% to 20% had been done appropriately with a negative conservative cast, but it's literally hard to tell from day-to-day. We will have spikes in some of our construction products businesses over a couple day period because of order flow that looks really good, and then you'll see some slowdowns. The things that are pretty certain will be the negative impact of multi-week shutdowns. Most of this is outside of the United States. Probably a little less than half of our manufacturing facilities in Europe are closed and I won't get into all the details, but it's an interesting mix. We had a plant in Norway closed that's now reopened. Interestingly, our primary plant in Italy is now reopened. But we have plants in UK, in various parts of the continent that are closed by government mandate for a period of weeks.  We are also closed in our two major plants in India, and almost every manufacturing facility in Latin and South America and in South Africa. There's a few other locations but they're so small as to be inconsequential. As Rusty said, when you add that all up on an annualized basis, it's about 6% of our revenues. So it's not big. And the impact of reopening will determine whether we're at the bottom end of that range and the top end of that range.  I think the good news for us is we're not yet seeing the underlying demand disruption that exists in some industries. Obviously, the hospitality industry has challenges, but even the auto assembly industry has got some challenges now that around the demand side that will be challenging. We're not seeing that yet. We are very aware of the possibility for that in one primary market, which is oil and gas, and across our Performance Coatings Group that's a little more than $200 million of annualized revenue. And so, our expectation is in the coming quarters and year, that's an area that will be under pressure. Hopefully that's responsive to your question. Sure. And so I can tell you from my perspective, and I don't mean this to be trite, obviously this coronavirus pandemic is horribly impactful to everybody. But as it relates to Map to Growth, there's a plus and a minus. The minus is as you can see in this quarter and in subsequent quarters before this, the things that we have planned, the things that we are executing are working.  We had talked about working capital improvements and then quickly realized that they would come later in the cycle. You're seeing those now. And so, it's a little bit disappointing that a Map to Growth program that in its execution a positive impact is being disrupted. On the other hand, there are a number of instances where I think the timing of certain things were lucky and this is one of those. Our cash conversion cycle is stronger than it's ever been, and we have affected close to two-thirds of what we've wanted to do in Map to Growth across every -- certainly across manufacturing and the procurement process by centralizing our purchasing globally, probably less than two-thirds in the G&A area because the last bigger piece of that will come once the ERP implementations are completed. So, the areas that are most disrupted is getting the continuous improvement disciplines into our medium and smaller plants. And also completing the ERP implementations that we had set to complete over the next 12 to 15 months, and those will be put off because they require in some instances a physical presence. But the gains that we have made have been solidified and will continue to benefit us, and it's been a really good program that was accelerating.  Rusty provided details of March. March is a repeat of what we've been showing quarter-after-quarter, but obviously that will be -- our anticipation that, that will be meaningfully disruptive in April and May. The last comment that I will make is, if you believe what you read and you believe what you see on the ground, it does appear as if April and May will be the most negatively impacted period, 60-day period as it relates to government mandated shutdown and business disruptions. And it'll be interesting to see as we get into the summer months, both globally and in the United States, state-by-state, how the reopening of the economy happens both in terms of sectors and speed. So, I can't answer that question. We haven't gone from a macro perspective into that. What we have done is talk to each of our businesses. We've looked at the affected plants globally. We have had some affected plants in the United States. Not surprisingly, they've principally been manufacturing facilities in the New Jersey -- North Jersey area of kind of Metro New York and we had shutdowns. We've quarantined people. We've closed the plant. We've disinfected and cleaned it and brought people back. So, we've been through that cycle, and it's not a good cycle to go through. But when you've done it once or twice, you begin to develop a rhythm of understanding the quarantine time, the cleaning process and getting people back to work. What we really have done is a bottom-up company-by-company and an assessment of their sales force. And so in the consumer DIY areas, there's not only been more people at home, but at least temporarily there seems to be a shift from contractor do-it-for-me to DIY and that will benefit our consumer DIY businesses for instance.  The only element of our consumer DIY business that's impacted by residential new construction would be the caulks and sealant segment of our DAP business. We haven't done an analysis of what that means, but that's the area in consumer that would be impacted. The Construction Products Group continues to see spotty cycles of big order flow and roofing projects and then stops in our Performance Coatings Group. We're building a solid, with good customer bases in tech, in food and beverage, in areas that will, I think, perform well through this but some of that's being put off. And so I'm not answering your questions specifically other than to say that we have done this bottom-up business unit by business unit and trying to understand the order flow and the impact. And as I said earlier, I think the only big market that we're very concerned about as a real challenge coming is oil and gas. I'm sure, the answer to that is yes. We wouldn't talk about individual customers, but some customers have instituted more rigorous regiments of how many people they'll let into their stores. Interestingly enough our online orders are through the roof. And so, in certain product categories, where we might get 40 or 50 online orders a week, it could be hundreds or 1,000. And so, we're fulfilling that and that is through our major retailers to a lesser extent. We actually do more online business through a number of our major retail customers than we do through Amazon. Our Amazon business is growing. And then in Europe, as part of our consumer DIY business, which has been more negatively impacted, particularly in the UK than in the U.S. because of some temporary business shutdowns, we have a business called Watco which is kind of an MRO. It was a catalog. Now it's an MRO online catalog business. And their business literally over the last month is up almost a 100%. It's a smaller piece of that, but you're seeing a shift to online as well. All-in-all through March, we had a high single-digit, low double-digit POS across the entirety of our Consumer segment customer base. So, our goal this year was to spend about $180 million in CapEx. I think when we finished the year, we'll be closer to $150 million. Notably, with a really strong cash flow through 9 months, that included a year-over-year higher level of CapEx of about $20 million. So, that gives you a sense of the strong cash flow that we're generating. For next year, our preliminary budgeting was about $150 million in CapEx. And at this point in time, I think we compare that back by $25 million or $30 million, without negatively interrupting our Map to Growth the program or the areas that we're growing. And if need be, depending on circumstances, we compare that back further, but that's our current plan. It's very hard to say, Rosemarie. I think we highlighted either in Rusty's comments or in our press release, it's circumstantial to each business. So, if you're in the -- a small project, paint, patch, repair, particularly our cleaner categories there is -- and I don't have them exactly, one of them is Krud Kutter industrial, another is a Mean Green anti-bacterial product. We have three cleaning products through Rust-Oleum that are certified as approved for cleaning surfaces relative to COVID-19. Those are through the roof and the constraints there is raw materials, but we're continuing to do that.  The flip side is our marine coatings business, which is a smaller business as part of our Specialty Products Group. In total, that's maybe a $25 million in revenue business and we normally wouldn't talk about SBU sizes, but to put that in perspective, and many of their large marine product retailers and/or shipyards that do repair maintenance and recoating for yachts and boats are closed. And so that's a business where revenues might be at this point be impacted as much as 50%. But that's a temporary period and whether that lasts for another few weeks or another few months, time will tell. Sure. We don't -- as Rusty said, we're suspending guidance. And at this point, we're looking at expense reductions, expense deferrals, cutbacks and capital spending, taking advantage of a few of the things that are in the CARES Act that apply two larger businesses. One example is a deferral of FICA taxes. We're looking at things like that to really drive cash flow generation and that's very much our focus. I think the MAP to Growth program will allow us to generate better bottom-line income than we otherwise would have in the face of revenue declines. But beyond that, we're not in a position really to talk about earnings, or earnings per share or any projections around that for the quarter. Sure. I'm pretty certain that in most categories our consumer businesses get that information on a weekly basis. It literally is week-by-week. So, your question is spot on in terms of things that we're paying to -- paying attention to. There'll be some interesting new dynamics for all of us, relative to learning how to work from home. And I say that because we have a senior leader meeting every other day, at the end of the day, and we talk about COVID infections, if there are any. Fortunately, as our statistics show, they're not many and they have been sporadic. And they've actually mostly been in the New Jersey area for us. And we talk about impacting our operations. But we also talk about every other day what's going on, order flow impact. So, we have some good insight into that. It's very circumstantial. Some of our retail customers are showing a solid POS in the early part of April or what we would forecast for the early part of April here. Some of them are showing levels that are below where we were in March, and we think that has more to do with deliberate decisions to limit the traffic flow into their stores than it does with actually demand.  And then lastly, as I indicated earlier, it's very spotty. We are selling all the cleaning and disinfecting products that we can make. That's true with our Legend Brands business as well. And so, that's an area that maybe by July we'll have a better sense of what we can say in some detail about the different DIY product categories, and what's really moving the needle. Sure. It's mostly volume. As you saw, given the strong volume there and in our Consumer -- I'm sorry in our Construction Products Group and Performance Coatings Group, the leverage to the bottom-line has been a little less in our Consumer business in part because we've been facing some unique raw material challenges there, some of which are now abating. The biggest one was packaging in certain areas. And so, in all three of those segments, Construction Products and Consumer Products, the unit volume growth has been really solid.  In the Performance Coatings Group, actual unit volume growth through nine months has been better than the numbers show, because they've been very deliberate in pairing back lower margin product categories and in closing some lower margin or breakeven international businesses. So, as we indicated, we've shed close to $60 million or $70 million on an annualized basis deliberately in this reorganization. And that's been disproportionately in our Performance Coatings Group and our Construction Products Group not in Consumer. Although, there is some coming in consumer with some overseas businesses that don't meet our margin criteria. And so, it's been very solid organic growth. Sure. And so in our Construction Products business, I think we're fortunate both in every segment of RPM, because of the benefits of Map to Growth. But if you think about where we've been strong, so while our -- in general and to your question, I do think that there will be a reduction for a period of time in industrial capital spending, and certainly outside of oil and gas, which is part of that, a little more than $200 million, where there's probably $0.5 billion of our revenues that are driven by industrial capital spending, or major projects. But again, it's circumstantial.  Our Stonhard business has been a leading provider globally, including the application portion of it, of polymer flooring with a real strong presence in food, beverage hospitals, fab plants, and so areas of the economy that we think are going to do pretty well. Interesting anecdote was our Stonhard business that was cast by a major contractor to put together the hygienic flooring in the hospital, temporary hospital facilities that were going to be set up in Central Park in New York. And we got that order. It was under strict requirements relative to timing. We got the material and the applicators there and then good news relatively quickly, that order got cut in half. Because it seems as if the anticipated need of the number of bed spaces for this temporary hospital spot in New York City is not going to be needed. I hope that's true. But that gives you a sense of why we think over time that segment will do well.  Our Tremco roofing business has been the leader in North America, in these long-term high performing restoration roofing projects, and what they've been very good at is being able to dry out an old roof as opposed to tear it off, and then apply a roof restoration coating and extend the life of a 30 or 40 year old roof for another 10 to 20 years, that's at a third of the cost of ripping off and replacing with new materials a old roof. Surely, we will be seeing enhanced competition there. But we're the leader there and I say that because I think that the negative impact in that sector for us will be more on the rip off and OEM replacement. We don't play in that space. 95% of our Tremco roofing business has been reroofing. And so without filibustering the call here, we've looked at oil and gas, that will be a problem. We've looked at a $0.5 billion driven by industrial capital spending, because clearly we're going to be cutting ours and others will do the same and it's circumstantial. But in a lot of cases, I think we're in a pretty good position. Sure. So, when you go back to \u201808 and \u201809, our fiscal year could not have modeled the great recession any better. We started our \u201809 fiscal year in June of \u201808 and we finished our \u201809 fiscal year on May 31 of \u201809. So, we pretty much modeled the beginning of the financial crisis and then when people started to feel okay. In that period of time, our sales were down 7% and our adjusted net income was off a little more than 35%. We had our best cash flow year ever.  In fiscal 2010, sales on a consolidated basis recovered by about 1% and earnings -- net income and EPS was up 25% on an adjusted basis. And so, we had a strong recovery and that was not inconsistent with kind of the V recovery that many people had. I think our cash conversion cycle is better now, thanks to the timing of Map to Growth. I do think, while we will build up some safety stock in a few areas, I do think through a combination of Map to Growth and in some cases reduced volume, you will see working capital as a contributor to cash generation in the coming quarters.  As I've commented, our -- we look bottom-up, the entrepreneurial nature of RPM in terms of how we serve our customers is still alive and well and will suit us well in terms of flexibility, and this is a big picture perspective. But contrary to what some people expect, I do not see a V for global economies here. I see a U and I think the U will be shorter for some and longer for others depending on -- and all of you know this better than we do, on the impact of this pandemic, which has been devastating to certain industries and hospitality for instance, and has been helpful to some unique businesses relative to cleaning products. But for us, I see a improved performance, as we get into our new fiscal year relative to our conservatively a negative expectations for Q4. But I think for everybody, we're looking at a U recovery not a V. Sure. I am -- I think this is different from the financial crisis. And so, I don't have in front of me the details by segment. We had three segments back then. And so, can't be specific to that. But I can tell you in the third quarter, our Consumer segment tanked. And we literally anecdotally were talking about shooting cannons down the aisle of our big customers, including home centers like Walmart and not hitting anybody. And so for a very short period of time during the financial crisis, consumers stopped buying everything. And I think the fear there was that at some point they're going to go to their ATM and nothing is going to come out. That eased up very quickly. I think what we're seeing now is very different. We're seeing pretty steady on a segment basis, but spiky based on different product categories, business activity but it does speak Silke to the comment I made earlier, we do not anticipate a V recovery for us and for anybody. I do think that there will be even as economies recover, even as these mandated government restrictions are eased, I do think that there will be a period of time in which economic activity from where we were a year ago will be somewhat subdued. So, I think in the May quarter, it is our expectation that there will be less negative impacts in our Consumer segment than in our other segments. That is correct. The one that's the spikiest for us right now is Construction Products Group because we're seeing days of year-over-year record overflow, and then days of crickets. And so it's very spiky, so it's hard to know. Yes. And so, back to our original goal of $290 million in savings. In terms of the manufacturing fees, the procurement fees and the G&A fees, we are on track for the G&A fees. But that slowed down. We are ahead of both of the manufacturing and procurement piece relative to our original 200 million -- $290 million goals. There have been some offsets to that. FX has hurt us in ways we didn't anticipate. Slower growth has hurt us. But we're through 20 plant closures out of the plant 31. We're through $60 million to $70 million of either business or product line rationalizations. The continuous improvement activity in our plants by the time we're done this with this, will exceed our original goals meaningfully. So, if you recall, we have $75 million of targeted MAP to Growth goals in the manufacturing area split roughly between the impact of footprint consolidation and continuous improvement. We'll achieve the half from footprint consolidation and we will have tens of millions of dollars of more out of the continuous improvement efforts by the time we're done, and that will be incrementally continuing.  So all of those have been going quite well for us and they're pretty well embedded. The momentum, as you guys pointed out, year one in a three year restructuring program was the easiest with the lowest hanging fruit. But year two has gone exceedingly well and our momentum was continuing to build. My biggest disappointment -- and again, it's a trite statement in light of what's happening in the world is, that momentum now has been a little bit disruptive. Yes, that's a great question. And, we are trying to take into account FX, and again, I mentioned that we talked to the senior leadership team every other day and the FX swings in developing country currencies are nuts. So, in Latin America you're seeing 30%, 40% plus negative impacts. I would remind folks that that's about $300 million of revenues in total. And so, it's not huge, but -- and then you can see the strength of the dollar versus the euro and the Canadian dollar and the pound, which are other bigger currencies. So, we are anticipating that in this guidance for the fourth quarter, the acquisition activity will be very modest as you saw in the third quarter, so -- but we don't anticipate -- in some prior quarters acquisition activity at a 1% or 2% has been offset by FX. We think FX will be decidedly more negative and certainly will not be offset by 1% acquisition positive impact. Yes, that would be our best guess right now. I think that's good math. But who knows. Yes. Those are the two biggest ones that I think is appropriate to point out to our investors to say, look, these are the two big pots that we're paying attention to. And we've provided some color as to why we think we'll ride through for instance an industrial capital spending or big maintenance spending better than most. Then it's anecdotal. I mentioned the marine coatings business that's mostly pleasure marines and yachts, and it's a smaller business, but because of the shutdown of their customer base at boatyards, we anticipate their revenues could be half in the fourth quarter of what they were a year ago. It's anybody's guess as to when those retailers and those boatyards open up, as to whether we have a modest recovery or depending on the health circumstances, if everybody is happy to put their boats back in the water and there is a little bit of a spike in order flow from what's been a very economic impact of coronavirus related shutdowns on that business. So we're just -- we're monitoring business unit by business unit to try and assess those same questions. But we've highlighted in the call today the big areas that we're paying attention to and we think investors should as well. So, yes, the answer to that is we started on those, but their impact will be in the future and I would anticipate by the time we're done with our MAP to Growth program, that on the $60 million to $70 million of product lines or businesses that we have either closed or eliminated, there's probably another $30 million to come and maybe a little bit more. And that would come mostly outside of our Performance Coatings Group and our Construction Products Group. So it would be a little bit in Specialty and some -- principally some far away overseas operations in our Consumer segment. Sure. And so I'll highlight that from a cash flow perspective first. In the first year of our MAP to Growth program, we were probably spending upwards of $30 million in outside consulting fees and related MAP to Growth fees. That's down or was down to about $4 million or $5 million bucks on an annualized basis. And very quickly about three or four weeks ago, we hired in dollar, manufacturing facilities in all our locations. And so if you are a non-essential employee, that includes me, you don't belong in our plants and that includes outside contractors. And so the idea of having smaller consultants that were helping us with continuous improvement who go from our plant to plant to plant and who come from other plants wasn't a good idea. So the people that have been working with our team and were now getting down to the kind of mid-to-smaller sized manufacturing facilities to institute, what we call, fit events and these continuous improvement disciplines have been halted. I can assure you, they're all eager to get back going. I have no idea when the world will be ready and we will be ready to turn the green light on that. But I can assure you the second we are, those consultants are going to be eager to get back to work because when we halted their activity, we halted their payments. The same thing is true on some accounting consolidation and ERP consolidation activities to the extent that we have fees that would be generated with paybacks that are, let's say, over a three-year period. All that activities halted. And so if we don't see a payback on some of the activity, even that we can do remotely, that is in inside of a year, those programs have been stopped both practically because we can't put people into our facilities personally and financially, because some of the activities that were going to have a payout, which is a good IRR, but still a payout longer than two or three years has been halted. And I would tell you, the things that all good companies are thinking about is capital structure, cash flow and liquidity and cash generation. So in things large like reducing planned CapEx by $25 million or $30 million with the belief that we could do more and things small like every $50,000 or $500,000 contract with an outside consultant. They're all being canceled or delayed. It's a great question. And so initially we were seeing some tightening in certain raw material categories and some -- because of that, some pricing pressure. One category was silicones, that pricing pressure and availability has seemed to ease off. The flip side is, over the last year or so, one of the categories that was defying raw material deflation was metal packaging and I would anticipate, with what's happening globally, in certain categories, that maybe we'll finally see some relief in that category. So it's been circumstantial around different categories. There is no doubt that with oil prices being where they are, if they settle into a sustained area, that there will be some solvent and resin categories that will see some decreases in cost versus where we sit today. It's really hard to say at this point in time. We are holding on to the pricing that we've been able to effect over the last year and a half. We needed that because of a 2.5 year cyclical raw material increase. We're not back to where we were in terms of that mix 2.5 years ago. But at this point, most of our customers are focused on supply, fill rates, availability and really working with them to make sure that we have product when they need it, and where they need it, and it's been a -- supply chains across industries have had to be more nimble because of the spikiness of order flows. So that's where we are today. We don't have a good -- I don't have a good answer to that question, and I don't think that, that will really unfold for another quarter or two. Yes. So our Performance Coatings Group and our Construction Products Group, what was formerly our Industrial segment has our greatest exposure to markets outside of North America and Europe is seeing -- has been seeing weak demand as we've been communicating for a year. We've had some spots of brightness there in the last couple of quarters but not quite half of our European operations were -- have been closed at one time or another. So there has been more aggressive government mandated closures in various countries in Europe than we've seen in North America. And so, as I commented earlier, it's true throughout Latin America and India. And those are predominantly Performance Coatings and Construction Products Group businesses. No, no, that's correct. I mean we have inventory on hand and depending on the nature of the different business, we can cover closedowns without much disruption for as long as 20 or 30 days. After that, your inventory depletion based on certain product categories can be problematic in one particular formula or color versus others. But it's very circumstantial to plants. As I said, we had a plant in Norway that was closed. It's part of our Performance Coatings Group, that's been reopened. We split a single -- a marine coating single shift plant into two shifts. We had an infection in a shift. We closed the plant for two days, aggressively disinfected it and quarantined the shift of the people that were working with the individual that was infected and brought back the other shift that was not. And so I could give you a plant by plant circumstance. I think all companies who are operating are becoming much more nimble as to how to segregate shifts, how to do cleaning between shifts, how to understand -- we had a plant where a contractor who is into repair equipment was diagnosed with coronavirus and he had been in that plant 10 days prior, and we didn't know it for 10 days. We closed the plant. It's actually a plant currently closed and we're closing it for six days. We're cleaning that plant and that's six days plus the 10 days when the last time the contractor was in there is a 16-day period. Interestingly, the plants that have been affected in the United States are all Metropolitan New York, New Jersey area and from what we can tell they've been all at-home infections, because we have not had any hotspots and our efforts to close a plant, clean it and then bring people back in the appropriate time has been affected or effective. So that's probably more than you need to know, but it's very circumstantial. Inventory plays a big part. Having a protocol by which you understand how quickly you can get back in business and then understanding what the government mandates hour. So for instance, we're closed in our two major plants in India and they're set to reopen in another couple of weeks. That closure could be extended and we don't know yet. There have been closures in other countries that have occurred and then we've had reopenings. It varies business by business, but I do think that in almost all of our businesses, we could get by for a period of 20 to 30 days. But after that, you begin to negatively impact your ability to supply customers, particularly in more unique product categories. Yes, we have not seen at this point, nor do we anticipate, any closures anywhere of 30 days or more, but circumstances could be different in different parts of the world. Yes. We try and pay attention to that every day. I commented earlier on silicone, which was an issue a few weeks back, seems to be okay today. Cleaning product -- and this should not be a surprise, cleaning product raw materials are an issue and we get what we need relative to past allocations. In some cases we cannot get what we need to meet an explosive demand. And so that is a product category that we pay attention to a lot. That impacts some of our consumer businesses. So those categories are significantly ahead of prior years, but in certain circumstances, may not be meeting demand because of raw material supply. The same is true in our Legend Brands business that makes HEPA filter equipment and filters and industrial disinfecting and cleaning products including products that are sold in the hospitals, that was before all this happened, and we could sell more of those products if we could get more raw materials. Sure. I don't know that that's particularly true in general across RPM. Obviously every business has its own breakeven point. If it's truer in certain segments than others, that would be in our Specialty segment. And so you had businesses like our Day-Glo or fluorescent color business or other Specialty segment businesses that have lower than average gross margins, but higher than average EBIT margins. And so they do have a fixed point there. You're already seeing that in the revenue challenges that we've been having in the last couple of quarters in our Specialty Products Group. Those numbers would have been somewhat worse were it not for the MAP to Growth programs. But in general, when you look across our Construction Products Group, you look across our Performance Coatings Group, there is a high level of variability between raw material costs which obviously are variable to sales and probably represent 40% of our P&L and selling costs which, depending on the business, are split may be 50-50 between fixed and variable or two-thirds fixed and one-third variable but a pretty high level of variability in a lot of our businesses. Sure, well, we have hit the pause button on that. We are looking at a couple of smaller sized transactions that were all but done and I think we're working with those businesses on what to do in terms of timing and other items. But in terms of new transactions, I think our cash flow that had been devoted to looking at acquisitions and/or repurchasing our stock, and as you can see, our cash flow generation is better than it's ever been, will be devoted to continuing operations, maintaining our dividend and everything else to repaying debt. Sure. For the most part, construction activity in general and particularly as it relates to infrastructure is up and running throughout North America. The most states are following the Department of Homeland Security guidelines which qualify construction activity as essential. The state that I'm aware of, and this could be different than other places, the state that I'm aware of that had the harshest focus on construction was Pennsylvania. And the construction industry worked with the Governor's office to talk about PPE protocols and social distancing and what was happening in other states. And within a week or 10 days, the original halting of construction activity in Pennsylvania was eased. And I believe now Pennsylvania is following the Department of Homeland Security guidelines on construction. We saw a similar order in Quebec Province of Canada and that has also been eased somewhat. The rest of North America, as far as I know, sitting here today is allowing construction activity as long as there is a maintenance of certain PPE and social distancing protocols. In a number of our areas, it's truer than most. When you're doing roofing activity or you're in the USL business and your activity is outside or outdoors, I think there is less concern. If you're doing flooring work and you can maintain all those protocols, again, I mentioned it's a spiky business. One of the reasons we're seeing spiky business in that business activity is it requires the shutdown of a manufacturing operation to get in and do rehab and/or replacement of floors. Whether it's manufacturing facilities, institutional facilities and in particular for roofing, schools and universities, those all have closure areas that are allowing for some of the construction activity that we do. And so, we'll see whether that's been beneficial for us or perhaps is pulling some summer work into the fourth quarter. But it's very spiky and we'll report the results in July when we have our fourth quarter results final. Sure. It really depends. I think that this will be somewhat spiky now because people are at home and they -- when they're tired of watching Netflix, they can get at the small project paint or home decorating and repair activity that they want. There is a decided shift to people doing it themselves as opposed to having outside contractors come in and do it for them. It would be nice to think that things would revert back to normal, so a slower level of POS perhaps when the world gets back to more normal. This goes without saying, I think, some of it depends on how quickly medical advances save the day, if you will. And if that doesn't happen, and for instance in the United States, we're seeing a meaningful and sustained unemployment rate that's 10%, 12%, which some people believe for a period of time that will negatively impact our DIY business over time. But all of that's circumstantial to what's coming this summer and this fall related to the impact of the coronavirus and how quickly people can get back to work and what the medical outcomes relative to vaccines or treatments are. Thank you very much, Vanessa. I'd like to thank our associates around the world for their efforts. They have continued to grow the business while carrying out our MAP to Growth restructuring program very effectively. Now they're demonstrating incredible resilience by also finding ways to protect their health, support their communities and maintain our business operations. In particular, I'd like to thank the men and women who courageously show up to work every day in our manufacturing facilities and distribution centers. These frontline associates are keeping RPM running to the benefit of all of our associates, our customers and our shareholders. We look forward to updating you on our fiscal 2020 fourth quarter and year-end results in July. In the meantime, we'd like to thank you very much for being on today's call and we wish you and your families happiness and good health as we all manage through this extraordinary time. Thank you for participating in our call today and have a great day."

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to RPM's Chairman and CEO, Mr. Frank Sullivan, for opening remarks. You may begin, sir.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you, Brandon. Happy New Year, and welcome to the RPM International Inc. investor call for our fiscal 2020 second quarter ended November 30, 2019. On today's call with me today are Rusty Gordon, RPM's Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Matt Ratajczak, our Vice President of Global Tax, Treasury, and also in charge of our Investor Relations.  I'll kick off the call with some comments on our second quarter results and an update on our 2020 MAP to Growth operating improvement plan. Then Matt will review the second quarter numbers in more detail. Rusty will conclude our formal comments with our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2020, and then we'll take your questions.  For the third consecutive quarter, our earnings were up significantly over the prior year and ahead of expectations. Our strong bottom line growth in the quarter was primarily driven by our 2020 MAP to Growth program, which is enabling us to grow earnings at a faster rate than our peers. Last year, selling price increases coupled with moderating raw material inflation has also positively impacted results. Revenue was up 2.8% during the quarter. Organic sales growth were up 3.5% due to market share gains and some pricing activity. We are pleased with this organic growth given the aggressive product line rationalization taking place at RPM along with the current macro environment in which we are operating.  In regard to our 2020 MAP to Growth operating improvement plan, the specific actions we have taken during the quarter included continuing to delayer management at different groups, consolidating manufacturing and shedding low-margin product lines to free up resources for more value-added EBIT-accretive volume.  So far through 2020 MAP to Growth program, we have discontinued product lines on an annualized basis with revenues of approximately $60 million to $70 million. We also announced the closure of 3 plants in the second quarter along with 1 more plant completed so far in the early part of the third quarter. This brings our total to 19 out of a planned MAP to Growth program 31 plant consolidations.  On a consolidated basis, we realized 2020 MAP to Growth savings in the second quarter totaling about $31 million, $9 million of which came from manufacturing, $10 million from procurement, and $12 million from G&A.  As you may recall, we realized savings during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and the first quarter of fiscal 2020 of $21 million and $26 million, respectively. I point this out because these successive quarterly increases in 2020 MAP to Growth operating improvement plan total savings demonstrate the strong momentum of earnings improvement that the program is generating.  In terms of our operating improvement plan, we continue to make progress in our central-led procurement function as we better leverage our spending through a consolidation of material spending across operating companies. Our strategic suppliers are finding opportunities as well so they can grow their business with RPM by capitalizing on this recent change in our approach.  Also on the procurement side, we continue to negotiate improved payment terms with the supplier base and have added some significant supplier financing programs that provide advantages for both RPM and our suppliers.  In manufacturing, we are increasing productivity by closing underutilized plants while improving efficiency in the plants that we continue to operate, allowing us to reduce costs and improve service to our customers.  We continue to invest in training our workforce and continuous improvement disciplines, and we are seeing good progress in our plants through our focused improvement team efforts. We are in the early innings of our accounting consolidation and expect to see the additional savings that it generates as well as savings from ERP consolidations in Wave 3 of our 2020 MAP to Growth program.  I'll now turn the call over to Matt Ratajczak to review our results for the quarter.\nMatthew Ratajczak: Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. Please note that my comments will be about our financial results for this year's second quarter and will be on an as-adjusted basis. We achieved record consolidated net sales of $1.4 billion, up 2.8% compared to the $1.36 billion reported during the second quarter of fiscal 2019. As Frank stated, organic sales growth was 3.5% or $47.7 million. Acquisitions contributed 0.6% to sales or $8.5 million, while foreign exchange continued to be a headwind that reduced sales by 1.3% or $17.5 million.  As Frank also mentioned, our 2020 MAP to Growth program generated significant earnings leverage to the bottom line. Also contributing to the bottom line was the margin improvement resulting from pricing and some moderating raw material costs. EBIT increased 22% to $153.7 million for an EBIT margin of 11% versus last year's EBIT margin of 9.2%. Diluted EPS increased 31% to $0.76 per diluted share from $0.58 per diluted share a year ago. Share repurchases in the prior year's convertible bond retirement resulted in $0.02 per diluted share accretion for the quarter.  Now looking at our performance on a segment basis. Sales in our Construction Products Group was very strong and increased 6.9% to $499.5 million. Growth was largely organic at 7.4% or $34.5 million, aided by a backlog from last quarter that resulted from exceptionally rainy weather that had slowed construction activity. In addition, we picked up market share in a somewhat lukewarm North American commercial construction market. Acquisitions contributed 1.2% or $5.8 million, primarily from the recent Nudura and Schul transactions. Organic growth was offset by foreign currency translation, which reduced sales by 1.7% or $8.1 million, and also by product rationalization, through which we are discontinuing product offerings that did not meet our more stringent margin or working capital standards.  From a geographic perspective, European markets remained soft. We're combating this by reducing overhead and proactively managing our product mix to simultaneously improve earnings and margins.  Our Latin American businesses generated good growth in constant currencies. Segment EBIT increased 43.3% or $18.7 million to $61.9 million. This improvement was largely attributed to volume growth, 2020 MAP to Growth savings, pricing, and the contribution from acquisitions. Sales in our Performance Coatings Group were $292.7 million, up a modest 0.3% from last year. Organic growth was $1.7 million or $4.8 million, driven by our businesses providing corrosion control and fireproofing coatings. As we noted last quarter, the segment was reorganized under a global brand management structure, which is beginning to bear fruit. It's enabling us to pick up market share in Europe and we experienced continued growth in North America, particularly in our Carboline product line. Impacting organic sales were strategic actions to exit soft international markets and low-margin product lines. Acquisitions added 0.1% to sales, while foreign exchange was $4.3 million or a 1.5% headwind. Segment EBIT increased 12.6% to $37 million. Much like last quarter, 2020 MAP to Growth savings provided this segment with strong earnings leverage despite essentially flat sales growth. Operating improvement initiatives included workforce reductions and the exit from 2 margin-dilutive businesses. Also contributing to the bottom line was pricing and improved product mix.  In the Consumer Group, sales were strong, increasing 6% to $450.9 million. Organic sales increased 6.4% or $27.1 million, driven by new sealant and adhesive products that generated new accounts and market share gains. This segment also benefited from pent-up North American demand for exterior, small-project paints and coatings that was caused by the exceptionally wet weather during the spring and early summer. Sales in Europe, a large percentage of which are in the U.K., were soft due to the weak macroeconomic conditions in Europe and also uncertainty surrounding Brexit. Acquisitions contributed 0.6% or $2.5 million to sales, while foreign currency translation reduced sales by 1%.  EBIT in the Consumer Group was $54.7 million, an increase of 26.8% over the prior year. This improvement was a result of actions taken, including the 2020 MAP to Growth initiatives, such as enhanced manufacturing disciplines and 2 plant closures, plus the price increases from last year. These programs are helping margins recover and trend higher towards historical levels. The Specialty Products Group top line was impacted by a difficult comparison to the prior year when demand was elevated due to natural disasters. These included hurricane activity that boosted demand for our restoration equipment and more rampant wildfires that drove demand for our fluorescent pigments, which are used in fire retardant tracer dies.  In order to accelerate growth in the segment's top line, we have made recent management changes. Segment sales were $158.2 million. Organic sales decreased 10.5%, and foreign currency translation reduced sales by 0.6%. There was no impact from acquisitions. EBIT was $23.2 million during the quarter, which was lower than the $28.8 million of EBIT in the prior year. We continue to implement operational improvements to reduce costs in this segment, including the consolidation of the ERP system to 1 platform, and we also continue to invest in selective initiatives to revive growth going into fiscal 2021. We expect that the segment will see the benefits of these actions in the coming quarters.  Lastly, a comment on cash flow. For the first half of fiscal 2020, cash from operations grew by 102.4% to $300.2 million compared to $148.3 million a year ago. This increase of $151.9 million was due to initiatives to reduce working capital and improve margins.  I'll now turn the call over to Rusty for details on our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2020.\nRussell Gordon: Thanks, Matt. Looking forward to our 2020 third quarter, we expect to generate consolidated sales growth of 2.5% to 4%. We anticipate leveraging this sales growth to the bottom line for an estimated 25% to 30% adjusted EBIT growth, resulting in adjusted diluted EPS in the high teens to low $0.20 range. Historically, our third quarter generates our most modest results each year because it falls during the winter months of December through February, when painting and construction activity is slow due to cold and snowy weather. Additionally, I should point out that based on history, we expect roughly 20% of our annual consolidated sales to be generated during the third quarter, and a proportionate amount of this fiscal year's 2020 MAP to Growth savings will result during the period as well. Our fourth quarter results are typically the strongest as weather improves and work begins to accelerate on painting and construction projects.  Based on our results for the first half and our expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year, we are reaffirming the full year fiscal 2020 guidance we provided on July 22, 2019, and maintained in our last earnings release in October.  Our full year sales growth is anticipated to be on the low end of our previously disclosed range of 2.5% to 4%. As previously disclosed, we expect to leverage the positive momentum of the 2020 MAP to Growth operating improvement plan to our bottom line and are maintaining our projected adjusted EBIT growth in the 20% to 24% range. We expect this will result in adjusted diluted EPS between $3.30 and $3.42 for our full 2020 fiscal year.  This concludes our formal comments, and we will now be pleased to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And from BMO Capital Markets, we have John McNulty.\nJohn McNulty: Congratulations. With regard to the construction business and the pickup that you saw there and the strong volumes, I guess when you look at the backlog of projects, I guess, how should we think about how much of that pent-up demand from the wet weather has already worked itself through and how much may still remain for kind of the -- especially, I guess, the fourth quarter levels as they roll through the rest of the year?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. In our roofing and waterproofing businesses, our backlog remains pretty robust. In the construction sealant business, we have seen some slowing, mostly around major projects. Our real strength is in broad distribution so that continues to be pretty good there. And the last comment I'll make is whether it's admixtures or roofing or waterproofing, we seem to be taking some market share because I think the growth that we're experiencing in North America is somewhat larger than what the market is delivering.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. And then in the Consumer business, is there a way to figure out how much of the growth was tied to some of the channel filling that you may be doing at Lowe's and Ace where it is just normal demand and some of that, again, weather-related pent-up demand? Or is it tough to figure that one out?\nFrank Sullivan: No. John, it's the latter. It was really good, solid performance, and good growth. No channel filling in this quarter. Clearly, we were the beneficiary of, and the flip side has hurt in the first quarter of what was a really rainy and kind of bad weather start to the summer, which not only impacted us but impacted others. So some of the strength in the second quarter in Consumer, I think, was projects that were delayed from the early part of the summer because of the weather into the back end of the summer and into the fall, which impacted positively our first -- or our second quarter.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. And then maybe just one last question. Just with regard to cash flow, you're running at a pretty high level this year given some of the work that you've done on the working capital front. I guess, as we think about the back half of the year and the uses for that cash going forward, I guess, how should we be thinking about that? It looks like you took down the $450 million note. I guess, I'm wondering how much may go toward buybacks as you're looking toward the back half.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. As we communicated in the last couple of quarters, we expected to execute our share repurchase program a little more slowly and deliberately than the fast start we got out. As you'll recall, on our $1 billion repurchase commitment, we completed half of that inside of 9 months. And so, I think the balance of it will play out over the next couple of years. You should expect to see a balance of free cash flow between share repurchases and debt repayment.\nOperator: From G. Research, we have Rosemarie Morbelli.\nRosemarie Morbelli: Could you -- Frank, could you talk about what Matt Sullivan has found since he joined the firm in terms of new opportunities and potentially any change in the focus from MAP and the expectation -- early expectation of $290 million of savings? \nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I think Mike Sullivan has been instrumental in helping to take over and really run the manufacturing and procurement side of our MAP to Growth program in partnership with Tim Kinser and Gordy Hyde, who are both part of RPM for a long time and really part of the team that architected the MAP to Growth program with Steve Knoop. We have exited the AlixPartners relationship entirely and are utilizing some regional consultants such did our annualized spend in the early parts of the MAP to Growth program. We\u2019re in the $25 million range, and now we're in the $5 million or $6 million range. So, I mentioned that as that gives you some sense of how we are internalizing some of the learnings that have come out of MAP to Growth. The work on the factory floor by our people is going really well, and it's a real tribute to them.  And I think that the challenge that we face at the Board level even, is in the next 12 months figuring out what elements of MAP to Growth are completed such that we wave the victory flag on plant consolidation and other elements, and then when elements of our MAP to Growth operating improvement initiative become permanent parts of how we operate.\nRosemarie Morbelli: And no change in the $290 million worth of savings over the period?\nFrank Sullivan: No. I think that as I've commented before, there are 2 assumptions we made upfront that in hindsight were a little bit incorrect. We assumed SG&A savings equally across the 3 waves. In fact, our biggest part of SG&A savings were in Wave 1, and as we get into the third and fourth quarter, we'll be annualizing those. And then the second part of SG&A savings, for all practical purposes, has been or will be deferred to the point that we complete the ERP implementations and some of the accounting consolidation that we're working on.  The other piece of it is the working capital. There's more to come there. Again, our original assumptions that we would get some of that early proved to be incorrect because, by necessity, we needed to get the plant consolidation and the continuous improvement elements initiated and completed such that we will really start to benefit. So you'll see, I think, more in the next fiscal year and beyond in terms of working capital conversion to cash, which we're excited about.  And as it relates to $290 million, we are on target. And I think post the original date of December 31, 2020, we will see ultimately more than $290 million as we benefit from some of these new initiatives in subsequent years.\nRosemarie Morbelli: And if I may ask one more question about -- you mentioned that acquisitions were doing well. Could you give us little more details on Nudura, Schul, and whoever else is doing better maybe than expected?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. Without getting into too much in the way of specifics, in each case, these were product lines, particularly the Nudura and Schul acquisitions, that we could integrate into our Construction Products Group and bring the marketing and sales and distribution resources of our Construction Products Group to bear on those good businesses. And so the organic growth rates in those businesses are teens, mid- to high teens, and it's pretty exciting. I will tell you, historically, it was our 50% of revenue industrial segment that was the laggard at RPM in terms of margin performance and improvement. Having separated that into the Construction Products Group and the Performance Coatings Group, we've got 2 exceptional leadership teams. They're very strategic about the reorganization that we've affected, and we are seeing that in our results, and that's going to continue.\nOperator: From Bank of America, we have Steve Byrne.\nSteve Byrne: It sounds like you see some potential upside to that $290 million cost target -- cost savings target. When you rolled out that MAP to Growth program, you had also targeted an EBIT margin of 16% or something around 500 basis points higher than where you were at the end of this quarter. Is that still seem realistic to you? And do you see -- this 200 basis point year-over-year increases that you've had these last couple of quarters, is that likely to continue based on projects you have underway?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. As we've communicated the last couple of quarters, principally related to growth, the achievement of our absolute goals are probably 12 to 18 months further out than we had originally planned. And the principal reason there is that, as you'll recall, in our November 2018 investor communication and based on our historic growth rates over the prior 5 and 20 years, we assume the combination of organic growth and acquisition growth of about 5.6% compounded over that 3-year period.  The first half of this year consolidated results are up 1.8%. And so it's that growth element that's not unique to us that has caused us to communicate in the last couple of quarters that our achievement of absolute goals both in terms of $1 billion of EBIT and the margin goals are going to be pushed out a little bit. But we are still making great progress, and I think when you look at our results versus the prior year and what we hope will continue to be outperformance to many of our peers. The MAP to Growth program is working well and on track.\nSteve Byrne: And Frank, you indicated you're pulling in a lot of the resources internally to run this program. Has this -- have you revisited the scope of this restructuring program to determine whether there's any other levers to pull that you hadn't previously developed?\nFrank Sullivan: We are continuing to look to add elements to our pipeline. And I don't know that I would add much more to that, but it's an ongoing process. Obviously, the bigger opportunities get done first. But there continue to be opportunities in plant improvement areas that we continue to add, and it's why we're very comfortable in the years following the December 31, 2020, end date that we originally communicated, we would expect to see MAP to Growth savings that exceed the $290 million in total.\nSteve Byrne: And then just one quick one. Wanted to ask whether your fireproof coatings and/or your fire retardant tracer dies are fluorinated compounds. And if so, do you see any potential human exposure pathways where you could get sucked into the PFAS issues?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes. No, that's a great question, and the answer to that is no. We did pursue an acquisition for many years of a private company that would have been a good part of RPM, but they had some exposure there, and that was the principal reason that we did not acquire that business. It was subsequently acquired by a competitor. And so as you might imagine, given our past toward experience, we're highly sensitive to those issues.\nOperator: From Fermium Research, we have Frank Mitsch.\nFrank Mitsch: Looking at the 180 bps of margin improvement, I imagine most of that is MAP to Growth, but can you expand upon the pricing versus raw materials interplay in terms of margin improvement? And what your expectations are in the back half of your fiscal 2020.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. Of that organic growth, I think, on a consolidated basis, the way to think about it is an even split between unit volume and price. Obviously, that varies differently between our segments and our business units. We have greater challenges in our Consumer segment relative to some of their unique raw materials, metal cans and packaging, seedlac, a few other items. And so there's been some more challenges there than there have been in our industrial businesses, for instance. And we begin to annualize the largest effect of our price increases at the end of the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. And so you'll see the benefits of pure MAP to Growth savings and what volume we can generate hit our bottom line as we annualize that price activity in the spring.\nFrank Mitsch: All right. So that will start to moderate in the fiscal fourth quarter. And you talked a little bit about some of the market share gains in admixtures, et cetera. How do we think about that into the back half of the year and in '21?\nFrank Sullivan: It's hard to say. I -- the economic activity is -- has been weak for a couple of years in Europe, and that continues. I think there's been some slowing in certain areas in North America. The good news is it seems like there is a decision on Brexit. And in our opinion, almost regardless of the near-term impact on the U.K., eliminating that uncertainty will be helpful. It appears as if the USMCA NAFTA revisited is going to get passed, that will be helpful. And so I think that we've got really good momentum in terms of growth and market share gains in our Construction Products Group in general. We continue to have some real strong performance in our Performance Coatings Group, specifically our Carboline corrosion control and fire Proofing coatings and our Stonhard flooring businesses.  We have the manufacturing challenges in Consumer that we believe will be overcome by the fourth quarter or into the summer. And then the biggest challenge that we have and we're tackling pretty hard is in our Specialty Products Group where the, I think, underinvestment in some of these higher-margin businesses has been a problem. We've had some leadership changes, as Matt alluded to, and are investing selectively in some new initiatives. And we would expect to see them return to positive sales and earnings growth in the new fiscal year.\nFrank Mitsch: That's very helpful. Can you just expand upon the manufacturing challenges in Consumer?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. We picked up a bunch of market share, I think, as folks know in certain areas, interior wood stains and finishes. We picked up some share gains in our primary small-project paint area. We had lost some share at one of our major home center customers, and we've regained all that back. And we had some manufacturing issues that were of our own making. We had some environmental equipment that shut us down in 1 plant for a couple of weeks, that was a problem. We are investing in a significant new aerosol capacity, the installation of which caused some disruption in another major plant. And so it's a cacophony of those types of items, including capacity issues that we're now addressing, that caused some disruptions for us. And I wouldn't -- that's probably more information than you need to know, but we worked hard to make sure that we could service our customers in light of those issues. And now we're working hard to make sure that we get those efficiencies that will hit our bottom line.\nOperator: From Baird, we have Ghansham Panjabi.\nGhansham Panjabi: I guess, just going back to the 3.5% core sales growth for the second quarter. Can you just give us a sense, Frank, as to how it played out on a monthly basis? You touched on some of the pent-up demand, et cetera. How did that actually play out through the course of the quarter? And then just give us an early read on what you saw in December as well, if you don't mind?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I would tell you that we had a big September, which was a -- and that was both in our Construction Products Group and our Consumer Group, and we feel that, that was a little bit outsized in relationship to some of the weather impact in the first quarter. And while not wanting to get into details month-by-month in the future, when you look at things, they're choppy. We didn't have a particularly great October, and we had a really strong November. December looks good. And I think we're on track for the forecast for the third quarter, which is going to be another strong quarter with great leverage to the bottom line. As I say that, I'm looking out my window and it's snowing in Cleveland, Ohio. And so our third quarter is always subject to weather impacts and other items given its relatively low seasonality.\nGhansham Panjabi: Okay. That's helpful. And then Matt made a comment on, I think, a Lukewarm North American commercial construction market. Can you just expand on that? What do you see going into this year on a calendar year basis specific to North American commercial construction?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I think we see more of the same, and I think we're hopeful that maybe some of the uncertainty around trade will revive industrial production activity in construction markets. The biggest area of softness that we see are in big projects, things like the Apple headquarters. We had a lot of success in Canada around a very rapid build-out on cannabis -- in the cannabis industry in terms of warehousing and production. We had significant specification in the Mexico, the New Mexico City Airport, which was canceled. And so the -- if there's any disappointment or weakness, it's in that area. Our broad distribution, which really serves kind of the maintenance and repair and/or low commercial construction, continues to be pretty solid.\nGhansham Panjabi: Okay. Just one final one. I mean you gave us some of the cadence of MAP to Growth. 4Q, I think, was $21 million; 1Q, $26 million; and $31 million for 2Q. How should we think about that same -- those -- that same element for the back half of the year on a quarterly basis?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. Well, yes, there are two elements there. Number one, we've annualized most of our SG&A savings, and the next bank for SG&A savings will come in Wave 3. I commented on that earlier. And so the manufacturing improvements, the plant consolidation, those flow through our P&L with sales. And so you'll see a lower impact in Q3 because we have lower sales. That's -- the flip side is you'll see the same or more leverage to the EBIT line than we've done in the past, but it will be in relationship to the sales in the quarter. And then you'll see that pick back up again in Q4 because we have a higher sales volume typically in our fourth quarter. And so it will follow that. And we still have pretty good momentum, and we'll be in a position to talk more about what we see for fiscal '21 in April and certainly in July. But the next couple of quarters look solid and the MAP to Growth program is on track. And on the margin, we're continuing to add items to it.\nOperator: From RBC. We have Arun Viswanathan.\nArun Viswanathan: Congratulations on the results and the continued progress on MAP. I guess, the first question is just on the top line. When you think about the Consumer business, you mentioned some of the manufacturing issues. Would you be able to kind of size what that maybe costs to you? And if you see that coming back in the coming quarters?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes. I don't know that we would get into the detail on the manufacturing issues there, it was -- beyond the detail I provided on an earlier question. It was a number of challenges around capacity and our efforts to address that with a few hiccups in the process, and we would expect to begin to see that. You'll see the better impact of that in Q4 and then into the next fiscal year, as Q3, again, given the seasonal low nature of it, isn't going to show up very well there.\nArun Viswanathan: And just to, I guess, dig a little deeper, when you think about the Consumer business, I know that in the past, you've mentioned that there's been some headwind from low unemployment and weakness in the small project category. Is that continuing? And how would you expect that to play out if we do see continued improvement on some of the building products and homebuilding numbers that we're seeing right now?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. The last four months for us, I guess, kind of August through this quarter, have been pretty solid in terms of consumer takeaway and project work. And we don't see any particular weakness there. A lot of the weakness that we had over the last 12 months, we believe, is weather related, going back to last spring and the early parts of the summer. And our -- for instance, our performance in the wood stains and finishes category that we picked up at a major home center customers met or exceeded expectations in terms of what that would do. So the performance there is very solid. The manufacturing issues that you had asked about were part self-inflicted, and we've addressed those.\nArun Viswanathan: And then on Construction Products and Performance Coatings, you had mentioned some weakness in Europe. Last quarter, I think that there was -- that was definitely called out. I think you're continuing to see that. I guess, I just wanted to get your thoughts, and you mentioned Brexit as well. Is it your sense that Europe, I guess, deteriorated incrementally through fiscal second quarter? And would you expect that to continue in the next couple of months? I'm just curious, just given maybe an easier comp at this part of the year.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I think the results that we've been seeing from a market perspective in Europe in the primary markets we serve there have been weak for 2 years. And in particular, as it relates to MAP to Growth, we have taken a very deliberate approach to looking to exit lower-margin business and, in some cases, discontinue lower-margin or, in a few instances, no-margin product lines. And so we've had a better earnings performance in the European market for our Construction Products and Performance Coatings business than we've had sales performance. And it's very deliberate process of strategically engineering a higher-margin business profile. I'd like to think with the Brexit decision and a focus on Europe that we'll see some activity in Europe improving, but we don't see that as we sit here today.\nArun Viswanathan: And then just lastly, if I may, on price cost. Looks like your price gains have been in the kind of 100 to 200 basis point range for a little while. Assuming that continues for the next couple of quarters. Or do you expect that to continue, I guess, just given raw materials or potentially entering a period maybe over the next 2 quarters of raw material deflation? Are we thinking about that the right way that is raw material rise should continue to kind of trend lower over the next couple of quarters, but you still hold on to price? Is that a fair characterization?\nFrank Sullivan: I think that's a fair characterization. In a lot of categories, the deflation that's happened in the last 12 or 18 months is ending. We annualize our price increases depending on the business unit and the segment, starting in February and through the spring. So we won't have as much year-over-year price impact in Q3, and we will have a little or no in Q4. In a number of our businesses, our margins are still not where they were 5 or 6 years ago, so we've got work to do.\nOperator: From Vertical Research, we have Kevin McCarthy.\nKevin McCarthy: Frank, you spoke to market share gains at some length, but I wanted to ask you to elaborate there in terms of where you're gaining share, why that's happening and how sustainable you think that will be. Do you think, for example, you could grow at 1% to 2% above market over the next year, or perhaps longer? What sort of framework might we apply to that dynamic?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. Particularly in our Construction Products Group, I think that is about the right way to think of it, and I think that's sustainable. We have been the leader in roof restoration coatings and continue to pursue both better-performing and, from a raw material perspective, more environmentally friendly bio-based resin products. And so that's going really well. We've had some significant market share gains in our Carboline product lines, our DAP product lines. And I think this spring, we'll see a couple of other market share moves in our Consumer segment that we can talk about once they've happened. So there's -- I think the thing that we're most pleased with, and again, it's a great credit to the associates of RPM, is the ability to keep our sales and marketing and businesses focused on their customers. At the same time, we're going through a significant change on the factory floor and across organizations. That was our goal. And so far, knock wood, that's working, and we're excited about it.  I also think we've been the beneficiary in the Construction Products Group of some major competitors who have been for sale, reorganizing, and we've been very focused on growth, and that's helped us.\nKevin McCarthy: Okay. And then with regard to raw materials, obviously, the energy complex has become more volatile and uncertain in recent weeks. But maybe you could talk a little bit about how you see the basket trending? And also what you're doing on a company-specific basis? In your prepared remarks, I think your -- you mentioned your procurement folks are negotiating some improved terms. So would you expect to benefit beyond what is transpiring at the market level in terms of raw material costs?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes. And I think our gross margin improvement have demonstrated that. We have had gross margin expansion in excess of many of our peers. And we've had a combination of some impact of cost/price mix between price and raw material costs, but a significant portion of it has come through centralizing our procurement activities. And we have gone in a number of categories where we've not been very well-organized to 2 or 3 suppliers from 8 or 10. And with some outside consulting help, which is still involved, we've taken categories that are $50 million annual spend all the way down to $0.5 million annual spend, and we're starting to see the benefits of that consolidation. I think about half of our gross margin improvement, if we were to disclose a prime margin -- and I say prime margin, a big chunk of our gross margin improvement is on the factory floor in terms of plant consolidation and continuous improvement. At the prime margin level, I would think the rough way to think about it is 50% is from a cost/price mix benefit that the whole industry is experiencing and 50% is from the benefits of centralizing our procurement activity and consolidating our supplier base.\nOperator: From UBS, we have Josh Spector.\nJoshua Spector: Just on the EBIT bridge year-over-year, I mean, you highlighted earlier $31 million in cost savings from the MAP to Growth plan. I mean if I exclude Specialty and then look at the organic growth maybe in the low mid-single digits, it seems like there was a little bit less leverage to the bottom line than expected on that basis. Can you help maybe bridge what some of the factors would be to drive that year-over-year?\nFrank Sullivan: I'm not sure I understand the question. I mean if you exclude Specialty relative to our consolidated results, then I think you would come to the conclusion that we have higher leverage in some of the other businesses. But I'm not -- maybe you could repeat that?\nJoshua Spector: Sure. So I guess what I'm looking at is your adjusted EBIT for the quarter was $154 million. It was $126 million a year ago. The cost savings was $31 million. So that bridges to around $159 million. You've lost $6 million in Specialty. So I'm looking at kind of that bridge as being roughly flat despite organic growth being 3.5% plus. And I understand some of the manufacturing issues, which might have been a factor. Just wondering if there's any other things that you would call out that might have led to like a lower year-over-year growth as a result of that?\nRussell Gordon: Sure. Josh, it's Rusty here. In terms of the MAP savings we disclosed of $31 million, that's really total savings. That is not an incremental year-over-year savings. So that's maybe part of the confusion. And when I look at Specialty, just to focus on that, I see the sales were down $20 million, and the EBIT in Specialty was down about a little more than $5 million. So I think that's the normal drop down we'd see from a revenue loss. So did that help? Or can I answer some...\nJoshua Spector: Yes. No, that helps. Yes, I didn't realize it was cumulative versus just what was realized in the quarter. So that's helpful.\nRussell Gordon: Yes. That would be the Wave 1 and the small portion of Wave 2 savings, which we talked about last summer in our year-end earnings release. And as we discussed, much of Wave 2 is deferred to the back half of this fiscal year.\nFrank Sullivan: And you would have to net that $31 million against the disclosed MAP savings this time last year in the quarter.\nRussell Gordon: Yes. And what we disclosed last year with that in year-end. First 3 quarters, we disclosed $32 million savings.\nJoshua Spector: Okay. Great. No, that's helpful. And then secondly, just on the Performance Coatings business, I was wondering if you can give some color on perhaps the backlog within the different parts of that business. So you noted strength in energy. Curious how you're seeing that kind of pan out with some lower CapEx potential for next year. And then maybe on the flooring side as well?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. We don't see any change in the market outlook for either of those. The deferment or cutting of kind of the capital spending budgets in the energy markets of a couple of years ago when oil prices plunged, have stabilized, and those -- that spend seems to be back to a normal level. Our energy activity is pretty broad as well. It's everything from pipelines to windmill blades to transmission to different refineries. One of the areas that used to be strong for us and it's been overcome by other parts of the market was offshore oil, not a lot of activity there. But it's been a real strong area of growth for us. And quite candidly, it's been like the one exception in the European marketplace where those product lines, both through the normal spends and some market share gains, have actually shown year-over-year solid growth in the European marketplace, about the only business unit or product lines that we've seen some solid growth in Europe.\nOperator: From Morgan Stanley, we have Vincent Andrews.\nSteven Haynes: This is actually Steve on for Vincent. I guess, just two kind of quick ones. On the third quarter EBIT growth, it was a bit lower maybe than expectations. So considering that it is a smaller quarter for you guys, but is there anything in there that is like notable to call out that could be maybe bridging that gap?\nRussell Gordon: Yes. In terms of some confusion, I think you're talking, Steve, about the third quarter and not the second quarter, right?\nSteven Haynes: Correct. Yes, the 3Q guidance.\nRussell Gordon: Yes. As we tried to convey through our outlook, it's a seasonally low quarter. So we typically do roughly 20% of our sales in the third quarter. And if you're looking at MAP savings, and I'll make this up, let's say, there's $100 million of MAP savings, we would expect evenly throughout the year, you would not get 25% of those savings in the third quarter because sales volume is down, our cost of sales is down as a percent of the total year. So that might be some of the confusion in terms of the third quarter outlook.\nFrank Sullivan: Yes. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the SG&A savings have been annualized, so there's no year-over-year MAP savings in SG&A. The next wave for us will be Wave 3. What has been continuing to grow is the plant consolidation and continuous improvement activity and the procurement activity. All of that gets capitalized into inventory, and then it gets realized as we sell products. And on a lower-revenue month, you're going to have lower income and a lower impact.  Having said that, a 25% to 30% EBIT growth year-over-year is actually an improvement over the EBIT growth that we just experienced in 2Q. And so we're well on track in terms of where we are. And we're on track in terms of our internal forecast relative to what we expect in the third quarter. And it continues to be solid EBIT growth on what appears to be continuing relative modest sales growth somewhere in the 2% to 4% range.\nSteven Haynes: Okay. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up on Specialty. I think maybe last quarter, you mentioned that you'd kind of see some of the initiatives underway starting to kind of work its way through by the fourth quarter and kind of starting in the beginning of fiscal 2021. Is that still the time line? Or are things maybe a bit pushed out? Like how long should we expect weakness to kind of last?\nFrank Sullivan: No. That's the time line. I think that's correct, and that's what we see. You'll see them being a positive contributor to sales and earnings growth towards the back half of this fiscal year and into fiscal '21. So I think that's exactly the time line that we see.\nOperator: From Seaport Research, we have Mike Harrison.\nMichael Harrison: I also had a quick one on the Specialty segment. You had guided last quarter that the full year fiscal '20 would be -- see sales flat to down slightly, and now this quarter is coming in down 10.5% organically. Can you just help us frame up whether that was worse or better than you had expected? And should we still be using flat to down slightly number for the full year sales assumption?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes. I think that the performance in the second quarter was slightly below our expectations in the Specialty segment, and it's principally around some major product categories. The Legend brands business had -- and the impact of weather-related events for that business was very modest. And then with our Day-Glo business, I think Rusty commented on this, a major product category for them in the past has been dyes and pigments used in fire spotting chemicals, retardants, and it was a very moderate fire season compared to the past seasons, notwithstanding the publicity of the fires around Los Angeles. And so that was a slower area. Both of those are high-margin businesses that had lower-than-expected revenues, and that negatively impacted the segment. For the balance of the year, I think they'll be back on track, but they will not recover the somewhat lower-than-expected sales results in Q2.\nMichael Harrison: The fluorescent tracer dies for fire retardants, are those being used in Australia right now? Or is that not a market that you sell into?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes. I don't believe so, but I actually don't know the answer to that question. We can certainly find out and get back to you offline.\nMichael Harrison: Okay. And then last question is more on the consumer side of the business. Can you talk about what you're seeing in terms sell-through and point of sales data at your big box retail customers? Any sense of where those customers stand on inventory levels as we start to move into this slower seasonal period? Is that relatively normal inventory levels? Or are they running a little bit high?\nFrank Sullivan: No. I think consumer takeaway has been pretty solid. It was choppy, as we commented earlier, relative to slow in the summer or slower-than-expected and pretty solid in the fall. We were negatively impacted by some significant inventory adjustments by some of our major customers last year. I think inventory levels are lower, and we don't expect the same impact this year that we had last year from some significant inventory adjustments by our big box customers. So that, I think, year-over-year will be a positive.\nOperator: From JPMorgan, we have Jeff Zekauskas.\nJeffrey Zekauskas: At the beginning of the call, Frank, you characterized a lot of the operating profit progress is coming from the MAP to Growth program. But I was a little bit puzzled by the results because if your prices were up, I don't know, 1.7%, that would be about $24 million. And if your raw materials were down 1%, that would be another $8 million or $9 million. And so the combination of raw materials and price increases would account for all of the operating profit growth. So what's wrong with that analysis? In other words, how is the MAP to Growth program really influencing things given those two considerations?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes. A couple of things, Jeff. Number one, I would look at our margin expansion versus our peers. And for the last couple of quarters, we have had some meaningful margin points of expansion better than a number of our peers. So that should be 1 touch point because we're all benefiting from cost/price mix.  Secondly, across RPM, your assumption on raw material savings is mixed. So that's been true in our Construction Products Group and in our Performance Coatings Group, the old Industrial segment. It has not been true yet in our Consumer segment because of some of the categories that I talked about, principally packaging, and the fact that we're on FIFO accounting. So some of the benefits that you see, finally some breaks. Some final breaks in packaging that hit this fall will show up in our results in the coming quarters. And we are, like everybody, suffering some meaningful increases in labor costs and other items. And so I think that the simplest way to compare our results and whether MAP to Growth is working is to continue to look at our gross margin and our EBIT margin expansion versus our peers. And if it's equal to or less than, than I would suggest that your comments are correct. But if we continue to put up some pretty good numbers, you're seeing the benefits here.  The last thing I can tell you is we're closing plants. Our headcount is down by 600 or 700 people. And we are instituting successfully lean manufacturing disciplines in plants where it didn't exist before, and it's hitting our bottom line.\nJeffrey Zekauskas: Okay. Maybe a final quick question for Rusty. What's the adjusted cost of goods sold in the quarter?\nRussell Gordon: Yes. We don't disclose that. If you go to our website, you'll see that we do have some reconciliation slides that give you...\nJeffrey Zekauskas: Right. But that doesn't reconcile to the cost of goods sold number because you don't break out the individual items and how...\nFrank Sullivan: Correct. And I don't think for any number of competitive reasons that we or any of our competitors break out specifics of their cost of goods sold.\nOperator: From Wells Fargo, we have Michael Sison.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Richard on for Mike. Just a quick question on M&A. How much are you assuming for your 2.5% to 4% revenue growth range? And have you seen any change to the environment right now? How does the pipeline look? And which segments do you think you'll have opportunities?\nFrank Sullivan: So I don't think you'll see much in the way of impact in Q3 from M&A. And we did announce Profile Foods, which is part of our Specialty Products Group, a relatively small business. I think there's some good manufacturing synergies there. But the M&A pipeline has been a little skinny for us. And I do think -- as I commented earlier, I think we're really pleased with the focus of our businesses on their customers and on the marketplace, and you can see that in our results.  If there's one area through MAP to Growth that's been a little bit disappointing, it's the revenue from acquisitions. And it's a combination, I think, of 2 things. Number one, price expectations on sizable deals are such that we can put that capital to better use with better returns on share repurchases and other investments. And I do think that separately, the organization has been focused on executing MAP to Growth to a certain extent in a way that has negatively impacted our focus on acquisition activity, and we're working to change that.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. And just on Capex. I know last quarter, you'd guided $180 million of the year. Looks a little light so far in the first half. Do you expect that to step up in the second half? Or...\nFrank Sullivan: Yes. I think that's our current target. We could fall short of that just because of the ability to execute on the things that we have planned, but that's still the target for the year.\nOperator: And from Bloomberg, we have Christopher Perrella.\nChristopher Perrella: A question, I guess, on the pull forward from the first quarter into the second quarter and touching on the backlog. Do you expect any of that backlog or the backlogs discussed earlier to continue into the third quarter? Or you're caught up at this point with your customers?\nFrank Sullivan: I think that we're at kind of normal rates. We did see a bump, let's say, between our first quarter and the beginning of our second quarter in Consumer and Construction Products. But the backlog, as I mentioned earlier, in our roofing and waterproofing businesses is very solid. And the revenue growth we're experiencing in corrosion control coatings and industrial flooring seem to be pretty good. And as long as we don't get whipsawed by weather from one quarter or another, I think we've got some pretty solid expectations for growth for the second half of the year in our Consumer segment.\nChristopher Perrella: All right. And a follow-up. So you should see a larger working capital release with the seasonally strong fourth quarter compared to last year?\nFrank Sullivan: No. In fact, you'll see a little bit of the opposite. I think the biggest working capital improvement you'll start to see in fiscal '21. Of the $150 million of improvement year-over-year in cash flow and the impact of working capital on that, I think about $70 million to $80 million of that is a timing difference year-over-year as we have negotiated new payment terms with major suppliers and, quite candidly, focused businesses on cash flow every day as opposed to cash flow at quarter end. And so we did have some timing differences, particularly in Consumer. And so about $150 million of year-over-year cash flow improvement from our operations, really solid number. $70 million to $80 million of that was timing, the balance of it was higher earnings and better working capital performance that's more permanent.  So the fourth quarter -- back to your question, I think the fourth quarter cash flow will not show much improvement, if any, because of that timing difference triggered last year. But then as we get into fiscal '21, you'll see continued strength in our cash flow generation.\nOperator: We'll now turn it back to Frank Sullivan for closing comments.\nFrank Sullivan: I'd like to commend our associates worldwide for their continued hard work and dedication as they simultaneously focus on growing their business and execute on our 2020 MAP to Growth operating improvement plan. By combining our entrepreneurial growth-oriented culture with the continuous improvement in operational excellence that is resulting from our operating improvement programs, we are positioning RPM for sustained growth that will provide tremendous value for our customers, employees and shareholders in the coming quarters and the coming years to come.  Thank you very much for joining us on today's call. We look forward to updating you on our fiscal 2020 third quarter results in April. Happy New Year.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Matthew Ratajczak",
            "content": "Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. Please note that my comments will be about our financial results for this year's second quarter and will be on an as-adjusted basis. We achieved record consolidated net sales of $1.4 billion, up 2.8% compared to the $1.36 billion reported during the second quarter of fiscal 2019. As Frank stated, organic sales growth was 3.5% or $47.7 million. Acquisitions contributed 0.6% to sales or $8.5 million, while foreign exchange continued to be a headwind that reduced sales by 1.3% or $17.5 million.  As Frank also mentioned, our 2020 MAP to Growth program generated significant earnings leverage to the bottom line. Also contributing to the bottom line was the margin improvement resulting from pricing and some moderating raw material costs. EBIT increased 22% to $153.7 million for an EBIT margin of 11% versus last year's EBIT margin of 9.2%. Diluted EPS increased 31% to $0.76 per diluted share from $0.58 per diluted share a year ago. Share repurchases in the prior year's convertible bond retirement resulted in $0.02 per diluted share accretion for the quarter.  Now looking at our performance on a segment basis. Sales in our Construction Products Group was very strong and increased 6.9% to $499.5 million. Growth was largely organic at 7.4% or $34.5 million, aided by a backlog from last quarter that resulted from exceptionally rainy weather that had slowed construction activity. In addition, we picked up market share in a somewhat lukewarm North American commercial construction market. Acquisitions contributed 1.2% or $5.8 million, primarily from the recent Nudura and Schul transactions. Organic growth was offset by foreign currency translation, which reduced sales by 1.7% or $8.1 million, and also by product rationalization, through which we are discontinuing product offerings that did not meet our more stringent margin or working capital standards.  From a geographic perspective, European markets remained soft. We're combating this by reducing overhead and proactively managing our product mix to simultaneously improve earnings and margins.  Our Latin American businesses generated good growth in constant currencies. Segment EBIT increased 43.3% or $18.7 million to $61.9 million. This improvement was largely attributed to volume growth, 2020 MAP to Growth savings, pricing, and the contribution from acquisitions. Sales in our Performance Coatings Group were $292.7 million, up a modest 0.3% from last year. Organic growth was $1.7 million or $4.8 million, driven by our businesses providing corrosion control and fireproofing coatings. As we noted last quarter, the segment was reorganized under a global brand management structure, which is beginning to bear fruit. It's enabling us to pick up market share in Europe and we experienced continued growth in North America, particularly in our Carboline product line. Impacting organic sales were strategic actions to exit soft international markets and low-margin product lines. Acquisitions added 0.1% to sales, while foreign exchange was $4.3 million or a 1.5% headwind. Segment EBIT increased 12.6% to $37 million. Much like last quarter, 2020 MAP to Growth savings provided this segment with strong earnings leverage despite essentially flat sales growth. Operating improvement initiatives included workforce reductions and the exit from 2 margin-dilutive businesses. Also contributing to the bottom line was pricing and improved product mix.  In the Consumer Group, sales were strong, increasing 6% to $450.9 million. Organic sales increased 6.4% or $27.1 million, driven by new sealant and adhesive products that generated new accounts and market share gains. This segment also benefited from pent-up North American demand for exterior, small-project paints and coatings that was caused by the exceptionally wet weather during the spring and early summer. Sales in Europe, a large percentage of which are in the U.K., were soft due to the weak macroeconomic conditions in Europe and also uncertainty surrounding Brexit. Acquisitions contributed 0.6% or $2.5 million to sales, while foreign currency translation reduced sales by 1%.  EBIT in the Consumer Group was $54.7 million, an increase of 26.8% over the prior year. This improvement was a result of actions taken, including the 2020 MAP to Growth initiatives, such as enhanced manufacturing disciplines and 2 plant closures, plus the price increases from last year. These programs are helping margins recover and trend higher towards historical levels. The Specialty Products Group top line was impacted by a difficult comparison to the prior year when demand was elevated due to natural disasters. These included hurricane activity that boosted demand for our restoration equipment and more rampant wildfires that drove demand for our fluorescent pigments, which are used in fire retardant tracer dies.  In order to accelerate growth in the segment's top line, we have made recent management changes. Segment sales were $158.2 million. Organic sales decreased 10.5%, and foreign currency translation reduced sales by 0.6%. There was no impact from acquisitions. EBIT was $23.2 million during the quarter, which was lower than the $28.8 million of EBIT in the prior year. We continue to implement operational improvements to reduce costs in this segment, including the consolidation of the ERP system to 1 platform, and we also continue to invest in selective initiatives to revive growth going into fiscal 2021. We expect that the segment will see the benefits of these actions in the coming quarters.  Lastly, a comment on cash flow. For the first half of fiscal 2020, cash from operations grew by 102.4% to $300.2 million compared to $148.3 million a year ago. This increase of $151.9 million was due to initiatives to reduce working capital and improve margins.  I'll now turn the call over to Rusty for details on our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2020."

            "content": "Thanks, Matt. Looking forward to our 2020 third quarter, we expect to generate consolidated sales growth of 2.5% to 4%. We anticipate leveraging this sales growth to the bottom line for an estimated 25% to 30% adjusted EBIT growth, resulting in adjusted diluted EPS in the high teens to low $0.20 range. Historically, our third quarter generates our most modest results each year because it falls during the winter months of December through February, when painting and construction activity is slow due to cold and snowy weather. Additionally, I should point out that based on history, we expect roughly 20% of our annual consolidated sales to be generated during the third quarter, and a proportionate amount of this fiscal year's 2020 MAP to Growth savings will result during the period as well. Our fourth quarter results are typically the strongest as weather improves and work begins to accelerate on painting and construction projects.  Based on our results for the first half and our expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year, we are reaffirming the full year fiscal 2020 guidance we provided on July 22, 2019, and maintained in our last earnings release in October.  Our full year sales growth is anticipated to be on the low end of our previously disclosed range of 2.5% to 4%. As previously disclosed, we expect to leverage the positive momentum of the 2020 MAP to Growth operating improvement plan to our bottom line and are maintaining our projected adjusted EBIT growth in the 20% to 24% range. We expect this will result in adjusted diluted EPS between $3.30 and $3.42 for our full 2020 fiscal year.  This concludes our formal comments, and we will now be pleased to take your questions. Sure. Josh, it's Rusty here. In terms of the MAP savings we disclosed of $31 million, that's really total savings. That is not an incremental year-over-year savings. So that's maybe part of the confusion. And when I look at Specialty, just to focus on that, I see the sales were down $20 million, and the EBIT in Specialty was down about a little more than $5 million. So I think that's the normal drop down we'd see from a revenue loss. So did that help? Or can I answer some... Yes. That would be the Wave 1 and the small portion of Wave 2 savings, which we talked about last summer in our year-end earnings release. And as we discussed, much of Wave 2 is deferred to the back half of this fiscal year. Yes. And what we disclosed last year with that in year-end. First 3 quarters, we disclosed $32 million savings. Yes. In terms of some confusion, I think you're talking, Steve, about the third quarter and not the second quarter, right? Yes. As we tried to convey through our outlook, it's a seasonally low quarter. So we typically do roughly 20% of our sales in the third quarter. And if you're looking at MAP savings, and I'll make this up, let's say, there's $100 million of MAP savings, we would expect evenly throughout the year, you would not get 25% of those savings in the third quarter because sales volume is down, our cost of sales is down as a percent of the total year. So that might be some of the confusion in terms of the third quarter outlook. Yes. We don't disclose that. If you go to our website, you'll see that we do have some reconciliation slides that give you..."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Frank Sullivan",
            "content": "Thank you, Brandon. Happy New Year, and welcome to the RPM International Inc. investor call for our fiscal 2020 second quarter ended November 30, 2019. On today's call with me today are Rusty Gordon, RPM's Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Matt Ratajczak, our Vice President of Global Tax, Treasury, and also in charge of our Investor Relations.  I'll kick off the call with some comments on our second quarter results and an update on our 2020 MAP to Growth operating improvement plan. Then Matt will review the second quarter numbers in more detail. Rusty will conclude our formal comments with our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2020, and then we'll take your questions.  For the third consecutive quarter, our earnings were up significantly over the prior year and ahead of expectations. Our strong bottom line growth in the quarter was primarily driven by our 2020 MAP to Growth program, which is enabling us to grow earnings at a faster rate than our peers. Last year, selling price increases coupled with moderating raw material inflation has also positively impacted results. Revenue was up 2.8% during the quarter. Organic sales growth were up 3.5% due to market share gains and some pricing activity. We are pleased with this organic growth given the aggressive product line rationalization taking place at RPM along with the current macro environment in which we are operating.  In regard to our 2020 MAP to Growth operating improvement plan, the specific actions we have taken during the quarter included continuing to delayer management at different groups, consolidating manufacturing and shedding low-margin product lines to free up resources for more value-added EBIT-accretive volume.  So far through 2020 MAP to Growth program, we have discontinued product lines on an annualized basis with revenues of approximately $60 million to $70 million. We also announced the closure of 3 plants in the second quarter along with 1 more plant completed so far in the early part of the third quarter. This brings our total to 19 out of a planned MAP to Growth program 31 plant consolidations.  On a consolidated basis, we realized 2020 MAP to Growth savings in the second quarter totaling about $31 million, $9 million of which came from manufacturing, $10 million from procurement, and $12 million from G&A.  As you may recall, we realized savings during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and the first quarter of fiscal 2020 of $21 million and $26 million, respectively. I point this out because these successive quarterly increases in 2020 MAP to Growth operating improvement plan total savings demonstrate the strong momentum of earnings improvement that the program is generating.  In terms of our operating improvement plan, we continue to make progress in our central-led procurement function as we better leverage our spending through a consolidation of material spending across operating companies. Our strategic suppliers are finding opportunities as well so they can grow their business with RPM by capitalizing on this recent change in our approach.  Also on the procurement side, we continue to negotiate improved payment terms with the supplier base and have added some significant supplier financing programs that provide advantages for both RPM and our suppliers.  In manufacturing, we are increasing productivity by closing underutilized plants while improving efficiency in the plants that we continue to operate, allowing us to reduce costs and improve service to our customers.  We continue to invest in training our workforce and continuous improvement disciplines, and we are seeing good progress in our plants through our focused improvement team efforts. We are in the early innings of our accounting consolidation and expect to see the additional savings that it generates as well as savings from ERP consolidations in Wave 3 of our 2020 MAP to Growth program.  I'll now turn the call over to Matt Ratajczak to review our results for the quarter. Sure. In our roofing and waterproofing businesses, our backlog remains pretty robust. In the construction sealant business, we have seen some slowing, mostly around major projects. Our real strength is in broad distribution so that continues to be pretty good there. And the last comment I'll make is whether it's admixtures or roofing or waterproofing, we seem to be taking some market share because I think the growth that we're experiencing in North America is somewhat larger than what the market is delivering. No. John, it's the latter. It was really good, solid performance, and good growth. No channel filling in this quarter. Clearly, we were the beneficiary of, and the flip side has hurt in the first quarter of what was a really rainy and kind of bad weather start to the summer, which not only impacted us but impacted others. So some of the strength in the second quarter in Consumer, I think, was projects that were delayed from the early part of the summer because of the weather into the back end of the summer and into the fall, which impacted positively our first -- or our second quarter. Sure. As we communicated in the last couple of quarters, we expected to execute our share repurchase program a little more slowly and deliberately than the fast start we got out. As you'll recall, on our $1 billion repurchase commitment, we completed half of that inside of 9 months. And so, I think the balance of it will play out over the next couple of years. You should expect to see a balance of free cash flow between share repurchases and debt repayment. Sure. I think Mike Sullivan has been instrumental in helping to take over and really run the manufacturing and procurement side of our MAP to Growth program in partnership with Tim Kinser and Gordy Hyde, who are both part of RPM for a long time and really part of the team that architected the MAP to Growth program with Steve Knoop. We have exited the AlixPartners relationship entirely and are utilizing some regional consultants such did our annualized spend in the early parts of the MAP to Growth program. We're in the $25 million range, and now we're in the $5 million or $6 million range. So, I mentioned that as that gives you some sense of how we are internalizing some of the learnings that have come out of MAP to Growth. The work on the factory floor by our people is going really well, and it's a real tribute to them.  And I think that the challenge that we face at the Board level even, is in the next 12 months figuring out what elements of MAP to Growth are completed such that we wave the victory flag on plant consolidation and other elements, and then when elements of our MAP to Growth operating improvement initiative become permanent parts of how we operate. No. I think that as I've commented before, there are 2 assumptions we made upfront that in hindsight were a little bit incorrect. We assumed SG&A savings equally across the 3 waves. In fact, our biggest part of SG&A savings were in Wave 1, and as we get into the third and fourth quarter, we'll be annualizing those. And then the second part of SG&A savings, for all practical purposes, has been or will be deferred to the point that we complete the ERP implementations and some of the accounting consolidation that we're working on.  The other piece of it is the working capital. There's more to come there. Again, our original assumptions that we would get some of that early proved to be incorrect because, by necessity, we needed to get the plant consolidation and the continuous improvement elements initiated and completed such that we will really start to benefit. So you'll see, I think, more in the next fiscal year and beyond in terms of working capital conversion to cash, which we're excited about.  And as it relates to $290 million, we are on target. And I think post the original date of December 31, 2020, we will see ultimately more than $290 million as we benefit from some of these new initiatives in subsequent years. Sure. Without getting into too much in the way of specifics, in each case, these were product lines, particularly the Nudura and Schul acquisitions, that we could integrate into our Construction Products Group and bring the marketing and sales and distribution resources of our Construction Products Group to bear on those good businesses. And so the organic growth rates in those businesses are teens, mid- to high teens, and it's pretty exciting. I will tell you, historically, it was our 50% of revenue industrial segment that was the laggard at RPM in terms of margin performance and improvement. Having separated that into the Construction Products Group and the Performance Coatings Group, we've got 2 exceptional leadership teams. They're very strategic about the reorganization that we've affected, and we are seeing that in our results, and that's going to continue. Sure. As we've communicated the last couple of quarters, principally related to growth, the achievement of our absolute goals are probably 12 to 18 months further out than we had originally planned. And the principal reason there is that, as you'll recall, in our November 2018 investor communication and based on our historic growth rates over the prior 5 and 20 years, we assume the combination of organic growth and acquisition growth of about 5.6% compounded over that 3-year period.  The first half of this year consolidated results are up 1.8%. And so it's that growth element that's not unique to us that has caused us to communicate in the last couple of quarters that our achievement of absolute goals both in terms of $1 billion of EBIT and the margin goals are going to be pushed out a little bit. But we are still making great progress, and I think when you look at our results versus the prior year and what we hope will continue to be outperformance to many of our peers. The MAP to Growth program is working well and on track. We are continuing to look to add elements to our pipeline. And I don't know that I would add much more to that, but it's an ongoing process. Obviously, the bigger opportunities get done first. But there continue to be opportunities in plant improvement areas that we continue to add, and it's why we're very comfortable in the years following the December 31, 2020, end date that we originally communicated, we would expect to see MAP to Growth savings that exceed the $290 million in total. Yes. No, that's a great question, and the answer to that is no. We did pursue an acquisition for many years of a private company that would have been a good part of RPM, but they had some exposure there, and that was the principal reason that we did not acquire that business. It was subsequently acquired by a competitor. And so as you might imagine, given our past toward experience, we're highly sensitive to those issues. Sure. Of that organic growth, I think, on a consolidated basis, the way to think about it is an even split between unit volume and price. Obviously, that varies differently between our segments and our business units. We have greater challenges in our Consumer segment relative to some of their unique raw materials, metal cans and packaging, seedlac, a few other items. And so there's been some more challenges there than there have been in our industrial businesses, for instance. And we begin to annualize the largest effect of our price increases at the end of the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. And so you'll see the benefits of pure MAP to Growth savings and what volume we can generate hit our bottom line as we annualize that price activity in the spring. It's hard to say. I -- the economic activity is -- has been weak for a couple of years in Europe, and that continues. I think there's been some slowing in certain areas in North America. The good news is it seems like there is a decision on Brexit. And in our opinion, almost regardless of the near-term impact on the U.K., eliminating that uncertainty will be helpful. It appears as if the USMCA NAFTA revisited is going to get passed, that will be helpful. And so I think that we've got really good momentum in terms of growth and market share gains in our Construction Products Group in general. We continue to have some real strong performance in our Performance Coatings Group, specifically our Carboline corrosion control and fire Proofing coatings and our Stonhard flooring businesses.  We have the manufacturing challenges in Consumer that we believe will be overcome by the fourth quarter or into the summer. And then the biggest challenge that we have and we're tackling pretty hard is in our Specialty Products Group where the, I think, underinvestment in some of these higher-margin businesses has been a problem. We've had some leadership changes, as Matt alluded to, and are investing selectively in some new initiatives. And we would expect to see them return to positive sales and earnings growth in the new fiscal year. Sure. We picked up a bunch of market share, I think, as folks know in certain areas, interior wood stains and finishes. We picked up some share gains in our primary small-project paint area. We had lost some share at one of our major home center customers, and we've regained all that back. And we had some manufacturing issues that were of our own making. We had some environmental equipment that shut us down in 1 plant for a couple of weeks, that was a problem. We are investing in a significant new aerosol capacity, the installation of which caused some disruption in another major plant. And so it's a cacophony of those types of items, including capacity issues that we're now addressing, that caused some disruptions for us. And I wouldn't -- that's probably more information than you need to know, but we worked hard to make sure that we could service our customers in light of those issues. And now we're working hard to make sure that we get those efficiencies that will hit our bottom line. Sure. I would tell you that we had a big September, which was a -- and that was both in our Construction Products Group and our Consumer Group, and we feel that, that was a little bit outsized in relationship to some of the weather impact in the first quarter. And while not wanting to get into details month-by-month in the future, when you look at things, they're choppy. We didn't have a particularly great October, and we had a really strong November. December looks good. And I think we're on track for the forecast for the third quarter, which is going to be another strong quarter with great leverage to the bottom line. As I say that, I'm looking out my window and it's snowing in Cleveland, Ohio. And so our third quarter is always subject to weather impacts and other items given its relatively low seasonality. Sure. I think we see more of the same, and I think we're hopeful that maybe some of the uncertainty around trade will revive industrial production activity in construction markets. The biggest area of softness that we see are in big projects, things like the Apple headquarters. We had a lot of success in Canada around a very rapid build-out on cannabis -- in the cannabis industry in terms of warehousing and production. We had significant specification in the Mexico, the New Mexico City Airport, which was canceled. And so the -- if there's any disappointment or weakness, it's in that area. Our broad distribution, which really serves kind of the maintenance and repair and/or low commercial construction, continues to be pretty solid. Sure. Well, yes, there are two elements there. Number one, we've annualized most of our SG&A savings, and the next bank for SG&A savings will come in Wave 3. I commented on that earlier. And so the manufacturing improvements, the plant consolidation, those flow through our P&L with sales. And so you'll see a lower impact in Q3 because we have lower sales. That's -- the flip side is you'll see the same or more leverage to the EBIT line than we've done in the past, but it will be in relationship to the sales in the quarter. And then you'll see that pick back up again in Q4 because we have a higher sales volume typically in our fourth quarter. And so it will follow that. And we still have pretty good momentum, and we'll be in a position to talk more about what we see for fiscal '21 in April and certainly in July. But the next couple of quarters look solid and the MAP to Growth program is on track. And on the margin, we're continuing to add items to it. Yes. I don't know that we would get into the detail on the manufacturing issues there, it was -- beyond the detail I provided on an earlier question. It was a number of challenges around capacity and our efforts to address that with a few hiccups in the process, and we would expect to begin to see that. You'll see the better impact of that in Q4 and then into the next fiscal year, as Q3, again, given the seasonal low nature of it, isn't going to show up very well there. Sure. The last four months for us, I guess, kind of August through this quarter, have been pretty solid in terms of consumer takeaway and project work. And we don't see any particular weakness there. A lot of the weakness that we had over the last 12 months, we believe, is weather related, going back to last spring and the early parts of the summer. And our -- for instance, our performance in the wood stains and finishes category that we picked up at a major home center customers met or exceeded expectations in terms of what that would do. So the performance there is very solid. The manufacturing issues that you had asked about were part self-inflicted, and we've addressed those. Sure. I think the results that we've been seeing from a market perspective in Europe in the primary markets we serve there have been weak for 2 years. And in particular, as it relates to MAP to Growth, we have taken a very deliberate approach to looking to exit lower-margin business and, in some cases, discontinue lower-margin or, in a few instances, no-margin product lines. And so we've had a better earnings performance in the European market for our Construction Products and Performance Coatings business than we've had sales performance. And it's very deliberate process of strategically engineering a higher-margin business profile. I'd like to think with the Brexit decision and a focus on Europe that we'll see some activity in Europe improving, but we don't see that as we sit here today. I think that's a fair characterization. In a lot of categories, the deflation that's happened in the last 12 or 18 months is ending. We annualize our price increases depending on the business unit and the segment, starting in February and through the spring. So we won't have as much year-over-year price impact in Q3, and we will have a little or no in Q4. In a number of our businesses, our margins are still not where they were 5 or 6 years ago, so we've got work to do. Sure. Particularly in our Construction Products Group, I think that is about the right way to think of it, and I think that's sustainable. We have been the leader in roof restoration coatings and continue to pursue both better-performing and, from a raw material perspective, more environmentally friendly bio-based resin products. And so that's going really well. We've had some significant market share gains in our Carboline product lines, our DAP product lines. And I think this spring, we'll see a couple of other market share moves in our Consumer segment that we can talk about once they've happened. So there's -- I think the thing that we're most pleased with, and again, it's a great credit to the associates of RPM, is the ability to keep our sales and marketing and businesses focused on their customers. At the same time, we're going through a significant change on the factory floor and across organizations. That was our goal. And so far, knock wood, that's working, and we're excited about it.  I also think we've been the beneficiary in the Construction Products Group of some major competitors who have been for sale, reorganizing, and we've been very focused on growth, and that's helped us. Yes. And I think our gross margin improvement have demonstrated that. We have had gross margin expansion in excess of many of our peers. And we've had a combination of some impact of cost/price mix between price and raw material costs, but a significant portion of it has come through centralizing our procurement activities. And we have gone in a number of categories where we've not been very well-organized to 2 or 3 suppliers from 8 or 10. And with some outside consulting help, which is still involved, we've taken categories that are $50 million annual spend all the way down to $0.5 million annual spend, and we're starting to see the benefits of that consolidation. I think about half of our gross margin improvement, if we were to disclose a prime margin -- and I say prime margin, a big chunk of our gross margin improvement is on the factory floor in terms of plant consolidation and continuous improvement. At the prime margin level, I would think the rough way to think about it is 50% is from a cost/price mix benefit that the whole industry is experiencing and 50% is from the benefits of centralizing our procurement activity and consolidating our supplier base. I'm not sure I understand the question. I mean if you exclude Specialty relative to our consolidated results, then I think you would come to the conclusion that we have higher leverage in some of the other businesses. But I'm not -- maybe you could repeat that? And you would have to net that $31 million against the disclosed MAP savings this time last year in the quarter. Sure. We don't see any change in the market outlook for either of those. The deferment or cutting of kind of the capital spending budgets in the energy markets of a couple of years ago when oil prices plunged, have stabilized, and those -- that spend seems to be back to a normal level. Our energy activity is pretty broad as well. It's everything from pipelines to windmill blades to transmission to different refineries. One of the areas that used to be strong for us and it's been overcome by other parts of the market was offshore oil, not a lot of activity there. But it's been a real strong area of growth for us. And quite candidly, it's been like the one exception in the European marketplace where those product lines, both through the normal spends and some market share gains, have actually shown year-over-year solid growth in the European marketplace, about the only business unit or product lines that we've seen some solid growth in Europe. Yes. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the SG&A savings have been annualized, so there's no year-over-year MAP savings in SG&A. The next wave for us will be Wave 3. What has been continuing to grow is the plant consolidation and continuous improvement activity and the procurement activity. All of that gets capitalized into inventory, and then it gets realized as we sell products. And on a lower-revenue month, you're going to have lower income and a lower impact.  Having said that, a 25% to 30% EBIT growth year-over-year is actually an improvement over the EBIT growth that we just experienced in 2Q. And so we're well on track in terms of where we are. And we're on track in terms of our internal forecast relative to what we expect in the third quarter. And it continues to be solid EBIT growth on what appears to be continuing relative modest sales growth somewhere in the 2% to 4% range. No. That's the time line. I think that's correct, and that's what we see. You'll see them being a positive contributor to sales and earnings growth towards the back half of this fiscal year and into fiscal '21. So I think that's exactly the time line that we see. Yes. I think that the performance in the second quarter was slightly below our expectations in the Specialty segment, and it's principally around some major product categories. The Legend brands business had -- and the impact of weather-related events for that business was very modest. And then with our Day-Glo business, I think Rusty commented on this, a major product category for them in the past has been dyes and pigments used in fire spotting chemicals, retardants, and it was a very moderate fire season compared to the past seasons, notwithstanding the publicity of the fires around Los Angeles. And so that was a slower area. Both of those are high-margin businesses that had lower-than-expected revenues, and that negatively impacted the segment. For the balance of the year, I think they'll be back on track, but they will not recover the somewhat lower-than-expected sales results in Q2. Yes. I don't believe so, but I actually don't know the answer to that question. We can certainly find out and get back to you offline. No. I think consumer takeaway has been pretty solid. It was choppy, as we commented earlier, relative to slow in the summer or slower-than-expected and pretty solid in the fall. We were negatively impacted by some significant inventory adjustments by some of our major customers last year. I think inventory levels are lower, and we don't expect the same impact this year that we had last year from some significant inventory adjustments by our big box customers. So that, I think, year-over-year will be a positive. Yes. A couple of things, Jeff. Number one, I would look at our margin expansion versus our peers. And for the last couple of quarters, we have had some meaningful margin points of expansion better than a number of our peers. So that should be 1 touch point because we're all benefiting from cost/price mix.  Secondly, across RPM, your assumption on raw material savings is mixed. So that's been true in our Construction Products Group and in our Performance Coatings Group, the old Industrial segment. It has not been true yet in our Consumer segment because of some of the categories that I talked about, principally packaging, and the fact that we're on FIFO accounting. So some of the benefits that you see, finally some breaks. Some final breaks in packaging that hit this fall will show up in our results in the coming quarters. And we are, like everybody, suffering some meaningful increases in labor costs and other items. And so I think that the simplest way to compare our results and whether MAP to Growth is working is to continue to look at our gross margin and our EBIT margin expansion versus our peers. And if it's equal to or less than, than I would suggest that your comments are correct. But if we continue to put up some pretty good numbers, you're seeing the benefits here.  The last thing I can tell you is we're closing plants. Our headcount is down by 600 or 700 people. And we are instituting successfully lean manufacturing disciplines in plants where it didn't exist before, and it's hitting our bottom line. Correct. And I don't think for any number of competitive reasons that we or any of our competitors break out specifics of their cost of goods sold. So I don't think you'll see much in the way of impact in Q3 from M&A. And we did announce Profile Foods, which is part of our Specialty Products Group, a relatively small business. I think there's some good manufacturing synergies there. But the M&A pipeline has been a little skinny for us. And I do think -- as I commented earlier, I think we're really pleased with the focus of our businesses on their customers and on the marketplace, and you can see that in our results.  If there's one area through MAP to Growth that's been a little bit disappointing, it's the revenue from acquisitions. And it's a combination, I think, of 2 things. Number one, price expectations on sizable deals are such that we can put that capital to better use with better returns on share repurchases and other investments. And I do think that separately, the organization has been focused on executing MAP to Growth to a certain extent in a way that has negatively impacted our focus on acquisition activity, and we're working to change that. Yes. I think that's our current target. We could fall short of that just because of the ability to execute on the things that we have planned, but that's still the target for the year. I think that we're at kind of normal rates. We did see a bump, let's say, between our first quarter and the beginning of our second quarter in Consumer and Construction Products. But the backlog, as I mentioned earlier, in our roofing and waterproofing businesses is very solid. And the revenue growth we're experiencing in corrosion control coatings and industrial flooring seem to be pretty good. And as long as we don't get whipsawed by weather from one quarter or another, I think we've got some pretty solid expectations for growth for the second half of the year in our Consumer segment. No. In fact, you'll see a little bit of the opposite. I think the biggest working capital improvement you'll start to see in fiscal '21. Of the $150 million of improvement year-over-year in cash flow and the impact of working capital on that, I think about $70 million to $80 million of that is a timing difference year-over-year as we have negotiated new payment terms with major suppliers and, quite candidly, focused businesses on cash flow every day as opposed to cash flow at quarter end. And so we did have some timing differences, particularly in Consumer. And so about $150 million of year-over-year cash flow improvement from our operations, really solid number. $70 million to $80 million of that was timing, the balance of it was higher earnings and better working capital performance that's more permanent.  So the fourth quarter -- back to your question, I think the fourth quarter cash flow will not show much improvement, if any, because of that timing difference triggered last year. But then as we get into fiscal '21, you'll see continued strength in our cash flow generation. I'd like to commend our associates worldwide for their continued hard work and dedication as they simultaneously focus on growing their business and execute on our 2020 MAP to Growth operating improvement plan. By combining our entrepreneurial growth-oriented culture with the continuous improvement in operational excellence that is resulting from our operating improvement programs, we are positioning RPM for sustained growth that will provide tremendous value for our customers, employees and shareholders in the coming quarters and the coming years to come.  Thank you very much for joining us on today's call. We look forward to updating you on our fiscal 2020 third quarter results in April. Happy New Year."

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to RPM's Chairman and CEO, Mr. Frank Sullivan for opening remarks. Please go-ahead sir.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you, Hilda. Good morning and welcome to the RPM International Inc. Investor Call for our fiscal 2020 first quarter ended August 31, 2019. On the call with me today are Rusty Gordon, RPM's Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Matt Ratajczak, our Vice President of Global Tax and Treasury who is leading our Investor Relations function. I\u2019ll provide some high-level commentary on our first quarter results and an update on our 2020 MAP to Growth operating improvement plan. Then Matt will review the first quarter numbers in more detail. Rusty will wrap up our prepared remarks with our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2020 after which we\u2019ll be happy to answer your questions. The benefits of our 2020 MAP to Growth operating improvement plan, which really began to take hold during the fourth quarter of last year carried over into the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and generated significant earnings leverage. Initiatives that proved particularly beneficial included actions to rationalize our manufacturing and distribution footprint, improve production processes, and strengthen our supplier relationships through center-ledprocurement. In particular, during the first quarter we announced the closure of three additional plants, which brings our total to 15, out of 3, which are targeted for the total program. Additionally, we continue to streamline our workforce with approximately 80 additional reductions, which brings our total over the course of our restructuring to slightly more than 600. On a consolidated basis, we realized 2020 MAP to Growth savings in the first quarter to total $26 million; 7 million from manufacturing and operations, 7 million from procurement, and 12 million from G&A all of which flowed through our P&L.  These efforts resulted in an increased adjusted EBIT of 25.3% and an adjusted diluted earnings per share of 25% over the prior year quarter, which exceeds our guidance despite modest sales growth in the quarter, which we had anticipated. This was the direct result of three factors. Number 1, the decision to exit low margin product lines and businesses as we pursue a value over volume strategy in certain businesses.  For the fiscal 2020 year, this will reduce revenues by approximately $40 million in total. Also, we had an extremely wet June that slowed painting and construction activity, which particularly impacted our consumer segment and our construction products group, and sluggish international markets, particularly in Europe coupled with unfavorable foreign exchange impact on a transactional and translational basis.  I should note that the improvement in EBIT margin does not just contain to one or two segments but were spread across the entire enterprise which demonstrates the breadth and effectiveness of our 2020 MAP to Growth operating improvement program across RPM.  We continue to have a positive outlook on the outcomes of our restructuring program and as a result repurchased approximately $100 million of our common shares during the quarter. This was in addition to the 200 million we repurchased during fiscal 2019. When combined with the $200 million cash redemption of our convertible notes in November 2018, we are approximately halfway to our 2020 MAP to Growth goal of repurchasing $1 billion of our stock. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Matt Ratajczak, or a more detailed review of our financial results in the quarter.\nMatt Ratajczak: Thanks Frank, and good morning everyone. Before walking through our financial review, I would like to remind you of two changes that we communicated on our last earnings release on July 22. First, beginning this quarter, there is a change in classification of shipping costs paid to third-party shippers. We recast these costs from SG&A into cost of good sold. This change puts us in line with our peers and most other manufacturers classify shipping costs and provides investors with a better point of comparison, and it does not impact EBIT. And second, we realigned the business into four reportable operating segments from our previous three operating segments. The new operating segments are the Construction Products Group, Performance Coatings Group, Consumer Group, and Specialty Products Group. The goals of this change are two-fold: To position the business for accelerated growth and to also provide our investors with greater visibility into the company while providing better comparability among our peers. Starting with this first quarter, we are reporting our results under this four-segment structure. We\u2019re providing comparable fiscal 2019 financials that have been recast to reflect both the change in classification of shipping costs and the effect of the segment realignment. Next, I will walk through our financial results for the quarter. Please note that my comments will be on an as-adjusted basis. During the quarter, we achieved record consolidated net sales of 1.47 billion compared to the 1.46 billion reported during the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Organic sales growth was nearly flat. Acquisitions contributed 2.3% to sales or 34.1 million. Our foreign exchange was once again a headwind that reduced sales by 1.3% or 19.5 million.  As Frank indicated, our strong bottom line performance was primarily driven by our operating improvement initiatives, which generated significant earnings leverage. Also contributing to the bottom line was the margin recovery resulting from last year\u2019s price increases. Raw material costs were up slightly, and we experienced increased costs for labor. First quarter EBIT increased 25.3% to 192.6 million and diluted EPS increased 25% to $0.95 per diluted share from $0.76 per diluted share a year ago. The combination of our share repurchases and last year\u2019s convertible bond retirement resulted in $0.05 per diluted share accretion for the quarter. Now, turning to our segments. Sales in our construction products group increased 3.6% to 536.1 million during this year\u2019s first quarter, primarily driven by acquisition growth of 4.4%, resulting from the Nudura and Schul transactions. Organic growth added 0.7%, while foreign exchange reduced sales by 1.5%. This segment also benefited from strong performance for our basement waterproofing solutions business, as well as recovery in our Brazilian operation, which generated significant sales growth. Impacting our North American businesses in the segment were labor shortages and June weather conditions that delayed construction activity. Additionally, sales were discontinued in certain product lines and geographies as a result of strategic decisions to exit low-margin, high-risk working capital operations. Segment EBIT increased 23.1% or 16.3 million to 86.9 million. The improvement in EBIT was substantially driven by savings from our restructuring program, including management delayering, plant rationalization, and improved manufacturing disciplines. Sales in our Performance Coatings Group were 297.2 million. Organic growth was 0.4%. Acquisitions added 1.8%, while foreign exchange reduced sales by 1.9%. Despite modest sales growth, savings from our 2020 MAP to Growth plan provided significant earnings leverage in this segment. EBIT increased 31% to 36.9 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2020. The Performance Coatings Group generated highest earnings growth out of all of our segments during this quarter, driven by a reduction in its operating footprint and strategic decisions to exit low margin businesses. The segment also benefited from management delayering as it executes a reorganization towards a global brand management structure. In the Consumer Group, sales were 479.3 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Organic sales increased 0.1%, while acquisition growth contributed 1.3%. Foreign currency translation reduced sales by 1%. Segment sales were dampened by four factors. First, a difficult comparison to the prior year due to load ins. Second, a soft economy in the UK related to Brexit. Third, rainy weather in June. And fourth, deferred promotional activity by big box retailers. EBIT was 61.7 million, an increase of 18.6% over the prior year. The Consumer Group's improvement in EBIT was largely due to a favorable year-over-year comparison resulting from 10 million and associated costs from legal settlement during the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Additionally, segment results in the first quarter were impacted by confluence of factors. As part of our MAP to Growth program, which we kicked off over one year ago, we reduced headcount and rationalized our manufacturing footprint. These initiatives led to bottom-line savings. However, greater than expected market share gains at the end of FY 2019 led to elevated costs incurred by outsourcing production in order to service this increased demand. As a result, we are investing in new equipment, improving production methods, and leveraging our internal manufacturing network to provide increased capacity and produce more efficiently. The Specialty Products Group experienced sluggish demand in the OEM manufacturing and international markets it serves, which impacted the top line. Segment sales were [160.1 million] during the first quarter of 2020. Organic sales decreased 4.3%, and foreign currency translation reduced sales by 0.8%. However, on the bottom line, EBIT margin improved by 230 basis points during the quarter and EBIT increased by $2.2 million or 8.5% to 28.6 million. This was due to good cost discipline, manufacturing yield improvements, and restructuring activities from our 2020 MAP to Growth program. Next, a few comments on cash flow and our effective income tax rate. During the fiscal 2020 first quarter, cash generated from operations was 145.1 million, compared to cash used for operations of 7.1 million a year ago. This increase was due to improved earnings and margin improvement initiatives, as well as carryover what impact from the prior year removal of certain early cash payment discounts, which effectively shifted approximately 100 million in receipts from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and the first quarter of fiscal 2020, which we discussed in our previous earnings release. Lastly, as expected, our effective income tax rate for the quarter was higher this year versus the prior year's first quarter, which was impacted by more favorable discrete tax benefits. The higher effective tax rate resulted in lower diluted EPS of $0.05 as compared to last year's first quarter. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Rusty for details on our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2020.\nRusty Gordon: Thanks, Matt. As we look ahead to the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect to generate consolidated sales growth of 2% to 3%. We expect to leverage the sales growth to the bottom line for an estimated 20% to 24% adjusted EBIT growth resulting in an adjusted diluted EPS in the low-to-mid $0.70 range. Looking ahead to our fiscal 2020 third and fourth quarters, it is important to note the seasonality in our business. Historically our third quarter provides our most modest results each year because it falls during the winter months of December through February when painting and construction activity slows due to cold and snowy weather. Our fourth-quarter results are generally stronger as work begins to accelerate on painting and construction projects. Given our first quarter results and our expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year, we affirm that fiscal 2020 full-year guidance we provided on July 20, 2019. Revenue growth is anticipated to be at the low end of our previously disclosed range of 2.5% to 4%. Despite the tightening of our revenue growth assumption, we expect to leverage the positive momentum of 2020 MAP to Growth operating improvement plan to our bottom-line results. Therefore, we are maintaining our adjusted EBIT growth guidance in the 20% to 24% range as previously reported in July. We expect this to result in adjusted diluted EPS between $3.30 a share and $3.42 a share for the full-year of fiscal 2020. This concludes our formal comments. At this point we will be pleased to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have a question from John McNulty from BMO.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, John.\nJohn McNulty: Yes, good morning. Thanks, Frank, for taking my question and congratulations on solid results. I guess a couple of questions. The first one would be, in the consumer business, it sounds like some of the new business that you had won has been big enough where you\u2019ve actually had to outsource some of the production for that at least. I guess how long do you expect that to last before you, kind of, right size the business to the growth that you\u2019ve won, and how should we think about the cost pressures that you're seeing and when they start to subside there?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. You'll start to see a meaningful improvement in the second quarter, and we\u2019re seeing it as we speak. The first quarter results for consumer are not indicative of what they're doing now or what they\u2019ll be doing for the balance of the year. We had two issues. Number one was significant market share gains throughout the year starting in the first quarter of last year with the wood stains and finishes pickup. And then the second issue quite candidly was some self-inflicted wounds that resulted in some manufacturing issues. When you are closing plants and you are, as we are across RPM, instituting common manufacturing measurements and disciplines pretty aggressively across your businesses and you've got a business in this case Rust-Oleum, that was operating near capacity, we caused some hiccups.  So that resulted in outsourcing at significantly higher costs, most of that is behind us and we will be spending this year and into early next somewhere around $30 million in additional paint making and filling capacity to continue to meet the demands in the marketplace. So, those are issues that negatively impacted our first quarter that really have a good story underneath them, and you will see somewhat higher sales growth and leverage to the bottom line on the EBIT line and consumer that\u2019s more consistent with the leverage you\u2019re seeing across RPM on a consolidated basis starting in Q2.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then with regard to Michael Sullivan, I know he started with you, I guess now a few months ago, I guess any first impressions or thoughts on new opportunities around the MAP to Growth program from him?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So, Mike Sullivan is off to a great start. Just to remind folks, he started officially in June. We have regularly scheduled Board meetings starting this afternoon and tomorrow and our annual meeting of stockholders he will be presenting to our Board, and he will be present in our stockholders meeting, and he's identifying some different areas and also completing the buildout of the internal team that we need to continue the operating improvement and continuous improvement initiatives that we've undertaken at RPM. So, I would expect us to see a phase out of what has been a significant month-by-month and quarter-by-quarter third-party consulting costs as we get into calendar 2020. He\u2019s off to a great start.\nJohn McNulty: Great. And then maybe just one last question, its sounds like on the raw material front, it was, you know, maybe a little bit more benign than it had been in the prior couple quarters but not necessarily a surge in improvement. I guess how are you thinking about raw materials as we look out through the rest of the year given that it looks like a lot of commodity prices really have rolled over recently?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. We are seeing some relief in major categories, and that\u2019s partly reflected in our numbers, but we have continued to see some tariff and metal can impact. Those things should ease. Again, I would remind people that we\u2019re on a FIFO basis, so you\u2019re looking at raw material issues that we are dealing with 60 days or 90 days ago that are showing up in our results today. So, it is a much more benign environment than it's been over the past two years. The biggest part of the gross margin improvement and raw material improvement have been from the centralized procurement effort that we have undertaken in earnest.\nJohn McNulty: Great. Thanks a lot for the color.\nFrank Sullivan: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Frank.\nAziza Gazieva: Hi, guys. Its Aziza on for Frank.\nFrank Sullivan: Hi, Aziza.\nAziza Gazieva: Hi. First question, I was hoping to get about some of the underlying expectations of the construction markets that underpin the EBIT and EPS forecast?\nFrank Sullivan: So, the Construction Products Group, as a newly configured group over the past year under the leadership of Paul Hoogenboom and his team are off to a great start, and I think the results in the topline, which were up 3.6% will reflect well in other similar companies publish their September 30 results, but we are exiting product lines and businesses that are lower margin so that\u2019s having a negative effect. The flipside is the integration of Dryvit and Nudura into the Construction Products Group of Euclid and Tremco is kickstarting some growth and efficiency there, and Paul has assembled a really good team and we\u2019re really excited about what we\u2019re seeing there. I think when you look at Q1, and you\u2019re going to see more the same in Q2, the former industrial segment of RPM, which was our lowest margin business, is now reporting as our Performance Coatings Group and our Construction Products Group, and you\u2019re seeing significant margin improvement in both, and the opportunities in both of those segments to consolidate some former independent businesses, save some costs and take a more global approach to their markets is pretty exciting.\nAziza Gazieva: Okay. Thank you for that. And you elaborated on some of the trends, you know, you saw through the months in this past quarter, can you give some details, you know, by region or just the demands you\u2019re seeing \u2013 you saw through September?\nFrank Sullivan: So, I guess the only comment I would make about our start to the second quarter is the \u2013 you know the geographic trends aren\u2019t changing. Europe is not any better; the UK Brexit situation if anything is worse; Latin America is a mixed bag; Brazil is recovering nicely after nearly three years of the challenges. On the flipside, Argentina, which is smaller for us, but still an area where we have business in both industrial and consumer markets is a mess; so that\u2019s a mixed bag. The last comment I\u2019ll make is if June was September, we would have had a better first quarter. The sun\u2019s shining and if you're in our consumer business or our Construction Products business that's a good thing, it\u2019s only one month out of the quarter, but it certainly helped us and is part of the reason why we feel like in our forecast you'll see some slightly better sales numbers year-over-year in Q2 than we saw in Q1.\nAziza Gazieva: Perfect. Thank you very much.\nFrank Sullivan: Thanks, Aziza.\nOperator: We have a question from Rosemarie Morbelli from G. Research.\nRosemarie Morbelli: Thank you, good morning everyone.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning.\nRosemarie Morbelli : Frank, I was wondering if you could give us some details on the different underlying markets. You usually make comments generally on that particular subject, but today you didn't, so if you could that would be helpful.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I just commented a little bit geographically to Aziza. But in general, the \u2013 you know the geographic situation has not changed. The solid growth that we\u2019ve been experiencing in North America for the last couple years is still positive, but slowing down, so we\u2019re seeing a little bit slow down in the construction market, especially big projects. It impacts our Construction Products business somewhat less and some of our editors because we tend to have a broader focus on distribution that serves small-to-medium size projects. Industrial capital spending seems to be slowing a little bit. And then the other comment I would make is with the strength of the dollar foreign exchange, both transactional and translational, we\u2019re a headwind in Q1 and we anticipate that in Q2 as well.\nRosemarie Morbelli: So, while the construction \u2013 the large construction projects are slowing, your main focus is on maintenance, so could you touch on the maintenance environment in terms of roofing for example etcetera? This is what I meant, not geography, but markets, end-markets?\nFrank Sullivan: Absolutely, and as I said, the Construction Products Group had revenues up in the first quarter, 3.6%, and that was despite the rainiest June in recent memory, which negatively impacted Tremco roofing, Dryvit, some pretty sizable businesses on our Construction Products Group. So, you'll see I think some better growth numbers in the fall in part related to weather, and I think there's good excitement there.  We\u2019re taking some market share in certain places and the consolidation of driving in Nudura into the Construction Products Group is opening up those product line in businesses to the broader sales force and distribution of Tremco ceilings and Tremco roofing. So, there are some good synergy market synergy with this combination as well that I think will benefit us for the balance of fiscal 2020.\nRosemarie Morbelli: And then, if I may, two questions on the anticipated savings of 290 million, you were ahead \u2013 in 2019 ahead of your expectations. Are you seeing additional savings now that you are, you know, behind, I mean not behind, but you are done with 2019? And then as you are just about to have your board meetings should we expect additional dividend increase? And can you remind us of your dividend policy?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. To answer both those questions, first the dividend policy, we've increased our dividend for 45 consecutive years, and in our board meeting today and tomorrow, it is highly likely that we will increase our cash dividend to shareholders for our 46th consecutive year. I think it will be somewhat more modest than what we\u2019ve done over the last three or four years, where our dividend increases have been in the 7% or 8% range in part reflecting the significant return of capital to our shareholders over the last nine months with our share repurchase program. And so \u2013 but I think it's highly likely that we will continue our dividend \u2013 consecutive dividend increases, it\u2019s a hallmark of RPM that we would hope to continue for a long time. And your second question, Rosemarie?\nRosemarie Morbelli: Any change in the target of 290 million in savings now that the first year 2019 was ahead of schedule?\nFrank Sullivan: No, we\u2019re highly confident in achieving the $290 million of savings that we projected for our MAP to Growth program and disclosed publicly on November 28th of last year and we remain ahead of that curve. But as we communicated in the last quarter, it's likely that our absolute goals will be achieved 12 months or so later than we anticipated because of the lower growth levels that we and everybody around us are experiencing. But the MAP to Growth program is continuing to build. We\u2019re building in our, what\u2019s called the PMO, so building new projects and we have good momentum, and one of our challenges is to keep that momentum for the next 18 months.\nRosemarie Morbelli: Thank you.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: We have a question from Steve Byrne from Bank of America.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Steve.\nSteve Byrne: Good morning, Frank. You had put out a 16% EBIT margin target as part of this MAP to Growth program. At this point, how would you assess your level of confidence on hitting that, maybe the timing of that and whether you\u2019ve gained any confidence in the last couple of quarters about potentially some new initiatives that you might engage in restructuring?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So, as I commented on an earlier question, our absolute goals, the billion dollars in EBIT and the related EBIT margin goal are probably 12 months out in terms of where we had originally projected mostly because of the slower growth, but the MAP to Growth initiatives themselves are ahead of schedule. We have a firm \u2013 just as one example, a different firm and looking at our indirect spend and we\u2019re hopeful that that effort will \u2013 you know will add maybe somewhere in the $10 million to $20 million range, that's relatively new. But we are chasing from a procurement perspective not only our significant raw materials, but paper cups and pencils if we can save money on it. And so, we\u2019re continuing to find things that we can add to the pipeline and maintain the momentum of savings.\nSteve Byrne: And then just a couple of high-level questions on your consumer segment, versus where you were a year and a half years ago before the Sherwin-Lowe's exclusivity deal went through, how would you assess your business with each of those two big-box retailers now? And how much of your consumer business is sold through e-commerce?\nFrank Sullivan: Couple of questions. Number one, I think that our consumer business, a really good leadership and we\u2019re continuing to do really well across all our customers and channels in costs and sealants, patch repair products. The wood stains and finishes program is going well and, you know, our relationships are strong. As I commented earlier, we had some self-inflicted hiccups in manufacturing. When you are aggressively pursuing the things that we\u2019re pursuing, we\u2019re going to stop our toe here and there and it's for the right reasons. And so, we have corrected that. That caused us to do some outsourcing, which hurt our margins. In terms of customers, I think we\u2019re solid with all our customers. The only specific comment I\u2019ll make is a year ago or a year and a half ago, we had commented in the big strategic issue of a competitor that that resulted in about $22 million loss of business at Lowe's. As of the beginning of this summer, we\u2019ve picked up $16 million to 18 million of that lost business back at Rust-Oleum. So, we\u2019re continuing to focus on serving our customers in the primary areas that are our expertise and strength, which is small project paint and spray paint, wood stains and finishes, patch repair, caulks and sealants. Now, I mentioned that, you know that, but those are our focus. We wake up every day and think about innovation and how to serve customers in those markets, while we\u2019re competing with some major players who are principally architectural paint folks, which is not a space that we\u2019re much involved in.\nSteve Byrne: And any e-commerce for you Frank?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes, e-commerce, I would tell you in our consumer segment it's probably $15 million or $20 million, and it's our largest pieces with our largest customer. We do some through some online retailers. Interestingly enough, for instance, we actually sell some spray paint online. The nature of spray paint in terms of unit costs, in terms of shipping of a flammable good would not suggest that that\u2019s going to be a big category, but if there are orders at major customers, through some e-commerce folks we\u2019ll fill them.\nSteve Byrne: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.\nSteve Haynes: Hi, this is Steve Haynes on for Vincent. Quick question on maybe cash generation, could you maybe just lay out how you\u2019re thinking about the cash generation in 2020? I know there's $100 million kind of timing issue last year, but how do we think about, you know, the year-over-year kind of growth in free cash generation?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So, as you saw, we had a different fourth quarter cash generation at the end of fiscal 2019 than we had done in prior year. We had changed some of our approach in terms with suppliers, as well as internally, and so what we ended up with, which is the function of timing, and you saw that in our first quarter where we had a very strong cash generation in Q1. Some of that was just good strong execution and a big chunk of that was timing difference between fourth quarter and first quarter. Over the life of the MAP to Growth program, we expect to see 230 million and I think more of reductions in working capital versus the original base, and you'll see stronger cash generation both as we become more efficient on the plant floor, more efficient in working capital, and have higher margins. And so, we\u2019re on track for that.  The pickups to that in fiscal 2020 are the significant cash costs of outside consulting firms, which will start to wind down after January 1, and an extraordinary amount between ERP implementations and some PP&E. I would guess about $70 million or $80 million of extra CapEx that as we get through MAP to Growth will not be repeating. And so, those are temporary, and other than that our projections for improved cash flow are on target.\nSteve Haynes : Okay, thank you. And then maybe just a quick follow-up, there was a comment about deferred promotional activity at some of the boxes. I guess you could maybe give a little bit more color on that, and you know, what was behind that [if there\u2019s just] maybe a timing paying or you know how to think about it?\nFrank Sullivan: Just a timing issue between Q4 and Q1 and Q2 and some of that relates to weather issues and some of that relates to some of the manufacturing hiccups we had in our ability to pursue maybe some more aggressive sell-ins that we deferred, because of those issues, which are now behind us.\nSteve Haynes : Okay, thanks guys.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research.\nKevin McCarthy : Yes, good morning.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Kevin.\nKevin McCarthy: Frank, I think you, you alluded to $30 million of spending on capacity in your answer to the prior question, it sounded like there was going to be some temporarily elevated CapEx. I guess my simple question would be, what is your capital budget for fiscal 2020 and to the extent that you have visibility? How do you see that evolving going forward?\nRusty Gordon: Sure, Kevin. This is Rusty here. In terms of fiscal 2020, we're expecting CapEx to be about 180 million and about half of that is related to MAP to Growth. So, there is probably about $90 million of base CapEx, and of the $90 million related to MAP to Growth. Probably, nearly half of that maybe $40 million or so is related to the ERP consolidation that we're doing as we go down from 75 instances to four. And then the rest is production related as we consolidate production and we have other cost reduction projects going on in capital investment as well.\nKevin McCarthy: Okay. So that level does not seem dramatically different than what you had previously contemplated. Is that correct? So, these spends that you're referencing are essentially part of the plan. Is that a fair takeaway?\nRusty Gordon: Yes, that's right, yes. It should be exactly what we said in July.\nKevin McCarthy: Very good. And then my second question, I guess, to come back to consumer in the prepared remarks, I think you referenced four headwinds there, load-ins, the United Kingdom, June weather and then some promotional activity related to the big boxes. Obviously, June weather is behind you. Can you flush out the other three issues and maybe help clarify for us whether all of those are behind you or whether there are any lingering effects into the current quarter, if any?\nFrank Sullivan: I will tell you should see better sales results modestly better in the current quarter. The weather issue is not a problem in September and that's good. We can see it in consumer takeaway. We can see in our Construction Products Group. The European issue and the Brexit issue, we're not changing. There's not as much foreign exchange impact in consumers, there is in our Performance Coatings Group or Construction Products Group, but it exists. That's not changing and the hiccups that we had from a manufacturing perspective are mostly behind us. So, from a cost perspective we won't be incurring the same challenges that we had in Q1.\nKevin McCarthy: Okay, thank you very much.\nFrank Sullivan: Thanks, Kevin.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from J.P. Morgan.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning [indiscernible]. Oh, Jeff.\nJeff Zekauskas: Thanks for \u2013 This is Jeff. Yes, good. Were your average prices up between 1% and 1.5% in the quarter?\nFrank Sullivan: More like 2% across RPM.\nJeff Zekauskas: 2%. And U.S. interest rates have come down. Do you think that that's going to make a difference to the construction sector, that is, do you think, even though you've got a little bit of slowing, do you expect that to lift in its growth pattern or do you think because we're at such a low level of interest rates to begin with, it doesn't really make much difference?\nFrank Sullivan: We're not economists here, but I think from our perspective, the upside to us in the next year that we're not counting on, and this would be true for a lot of businesses would be the elimination of a lot of the distractions around trade wars and tariffs, and there are things that could be corrected politically. If they're corrected, when you look at our first quarter and I think you'll see similar results in Q2. The leverage that we're putting on our bottom line to modest sales growth is pretty solid. If we can find a way and economic help would certainly be welcomed to generate another 2% or 3% of sales growth, you really see that bottom line same. That's not in our forecast. We're not counting on it, but there is a scenario in which some of the economic disruptions out there globally get resolved or get better, and that could certainly pick up the housing market and the construction markets and we're hopeful that that will happen, but it's not in our forecast for the year.\nJeff Zekauskas: I realize that you had all kinds of weather events in the quarter, but was there organic volume growth in any of your businesses this quarter?\nFrank Sullivan: I think the area where we had the best organic growth was in our Construction Products Group, when you carve out the revenues that they are eliminating. On a consolidated basis, we are going to shed about $40 million of revenues this year. But our growth in control coatings business is having a rock-solid year. We just picked up the contract for the Eiffel Tower, which will be a nice piece of business for, maybe as much as nine months. We are taking market share in a lot of places there. The [TBS] business of our Construction Products Group, which is a below grade and in many instances residential level water proofing is having high single-digit revenue growth. And so, there is a number of areas where we're doing well. The caulks, sealants, patch and repair products business had organic growth of nearly 10%, really good business there and some of its market share \u2013 some of it's a combination of kind of small contractor, as well as DIY. So, there is a lot of patches of good growth. The flip side is our Specialty Products Group. You're not going to see in the rest of the year a lot of leverage to the bottom line with nearly 18% EBIT margins. We don't have an EBIT margin problem there. We have a growth problem and we're addressing that with some select investments and in some cases some leadership changes.\nJeff Zekauskas: Okay, great. Thank you so much.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: We have a question from Mike Sison from Wells Fargo.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Mike.\nMike Sison: Hi guys, nice start to the year. Frank, when you look at your outlook for sales in 2020, given the environment still doesn't seem easy, but if you do that, the low end 2.5% pretty good achievement there, but can you maybe walk through some of the components? I know you'll have some pricing there; you'll have some acquisitions; FX will be a negative and just wanted to get a clear feel for what your volume outlook will be this year?\nFrank Sullivan: So, I think you'll see some better volume growth in consumer versus what we reflected in the first quarter. As I commented earlier, we're seeing some nice pickups in some of the now being integrated construction Products Group companies like Nudura and Dryvit. And so I think for the balance of this year, we can pick up some revenue growth, just by expanding the specification and sales and distribution more broadly for those businesses that doesn't last forever, but that's still going on and then we'll have pockets in our Performance Coatings Group like our Carboline business to continue to put up solid numbers.  And so those are the things that make us feel like we'll hit the bottom end of that. The other thing that's worth noting is most of the acquisition activity that we reported in Q1 and that will impact Q2 starts to be annualized. So, at this stage, there isn't much in the way of acquisition activity planned for the second half of the year.\nMike Sison: Got it. And then when you think about acquisitions going forward in this environment. Can you maybe talk about the backlog or the project acquisition pipeline might be challenging in this environment? I understand what you're buying in terms of earnings power, but just give me your thoughts on what you think \u2013 how you think about acquisitions going forward?\nFrank Sullivan: So, our small to medium-sized acquisition program is generally alive and well. I will tell you that our pipeline is a little thinner than it's been for a while, in part because we've got most of the leaders of RPM focused on executing on our MAP to Growth program. And so, we're working on that and I think that will continue to be an important part of adding revenues and leveraging it to our bottom line in the coming years. But as I commented a minute ago, the second half of this year will likely not have much acquisition impact because of how we're annualizing transactions that were done last year and I think a small lull in acquisition activity that we hope to see pick up.\nMike Sison: Great, thank you.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kevin Hocevar from Northcoast Research.\nKevin Hocevar: Hi, good morning everybody.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning.\nKevin Hocevar: Frank, I think you mentioned that MAP to Growth added $26 million to EBIT in the first quarter, but looks like EBIT grew $39 million in total. So, what would you say is that other $13 million of EBIT growth is, because organic growth was pretty flat, so, but you mentioned price was positive? So, is that price rise \u2013 is that you have some acquisitions, is the acquisitions adding? What would you say drove the balance of that EBIT growth?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. If you carve out our MAP to Growth savings, EBIT would have been up. This is rough because you can't be exact, but EBIT would have been up in the 8% to 10% range and basically a 1% gain in revenues. So, pretty solid and I think that's a combination of price cost mix, which has been negative for two years and is now finally moving in the right direction on the gross margin line. The impact of acquisitions are small, but they certainly contribute some. And then the reason, it's not exactly a precise number is, our businesses have demonstrated really good SG&A discipline and leverage and so measuring how much of that would have happened without MAP to Growth per se or how much of its MAP to Growth is a judgment call. So, I think the way I would look at it internally, the way I do look at it internally is, is that EBIT would have been up in the 8% to 10% range, excluding the MAP to Growth and the balance of that's the MAP to Growth range is pretty good \u2013 pretty good leverage still on what's very modest revenue growth, and we'll keep plowing away.\nKevin Hocevar: Yes. Perfect. And then on the last quarter you gave some sales guidance by segment with mid-single-digit growth expected in Construction and Consumer and low single-digit in Performance and Specialty. Curious, if there's any update there on given you lower \u2013 didn't I guess move to the low end of the sales expectation range for the year. And just what you're seeing last several months, does that change at all? Are those still good expectations for the year?\nRusty Gordon: Sure. Kevin, this is Rusty. I would say one major change has been the impact of Brexit and the strengthening U.S. dollar. U.S. dollar, I read yesterday is at a two-year high against foreign currencies, including the euro for that matter and the FX impact on sales definitely looks like more of a headwind and we anticipated as we started off the year.\nFrank Sullivan: Let me, answer that by segment a little bit. I think you'll see, as we highlighted \u2013 I think you'll see somewhat better sales results in consumer, not only for Q2, but for the balance of the year versus Q1. I think you'll see better sales results in our Construction Products Group. So, both of those, kind of, low to mid-sales growth. Our Performance Coatings Group is going to be kind of flat-to-low for the balance of the year.  Some of that is a result of the very deliberate decisions to exit or discontinue product lines or businesses, most of those are kind of faraway relatively small overseas businesses. They don't have the margins that we'd like to see. And then the most challenged segment we have for the balance of the year will be our Specialty Products Group and in that case I think we're seeing flat to slightly down revenues for the reasons Rusty mentioned, foreign exchange will be a hit, they're annualizing tougher comps, but we've got some growth issues in some of those businesses, high margin really solid business. We have a new leader leadership team at Day-Glo, new leadership and our TCI business. I could go down the list in some selected investments. So, you're going to see the most challenge revenue segment for us to be Specialty Products. All great businesses, all high margin and hopefully you'll begin to see the benefits of the changes that we're making in the fourth quarter and in fiscal 2021.\nKevin Hocevar: Okay, great. Thank you very much.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: We have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Sullivan for final remarks.\nFrank Sullivan: Great. Thanks, Hilda. I'd like to remind everybody that tomorrow afternoon, at 2 o'clock, at the Crowne Plaza in Middleburg Heights is RPM's Annual Meeting of Stockholders. We regularly welcome 800 to 1,000 individual shareholders and a handful of institutional shareholders to our Annual Meeting. And lastly, I'd like to close by recognizing the RPM associates around the world who are doing a great job on executing on our MAP to Growth program and when we get through this program, the entrepreneurial spirit and culture of RPM combined with the operational excellence and continuous improvement culture that we are instituting is going to be hugely successful both in the marketplace and for our shareholders. Thank you very much for your time on the call today. We look forward to providing you our second quarter results in early January of 2021. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference. We thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Matt Ratajczak",
            "content": "Thanks Frank, and good morning everyone. Before walking through our financial review, I would like to remind you of two changes that we communicated on our last earnings release on July 22. First, beginning this quarter, there is a change in classification of shipping costs paid to third-party shippers. We recast these costs from SG&A into cost of good sold. This change puts us in line with our peers and most other manufacturers classify shipping costs and provides investors with a better point of comparison, and it does not impact EBIT. And second, we realigned the business into four reportable operating segments from our previous three operating segments. The new operating segments are the Construction Products Group, Performance Coatings Group, Consumer Group, and Specialty Products Group. The goals of this change are two-fold: To position the business for accelerated growth and to also provide our investors with greater visibility into the company while providing better comparability among our peers. Starting with this first quarter, we are reporting our results under this four-segment structure. We're providing comparable fiscal 2019 financials that have been recast to reflect both the change in classification of shipping costs and the effect of the segment realignment. Next, I will walk through our financial results for the quarter. Please note that my comments will be on an as-adjusted basis. During the quarter, we achieved record consolidated net sales of 1.47 billion compared to the 1.46 billion reported during the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Organic sales growth was nearly flat. Acquisitions contributed 2.3% to sales or 34.1 million. Our foreign exchange was once again a headwind that reduced sales by 1.3% or 19.5 million.  As Frank indicated, our strong bottom line performance was primarily driven by our operating improvement initiatives, which generated significant earnings leverage. Also contributing to the bottom line was the margin recovery resulting from last year's price increases. Raw material costs were up slightly, and we experienced increased costs for labor. First quarter EBIT increased 25.3% to 192.6 million and diluted EPS increased 25% to $0.95 per diluted share from $0.76 per diluted share a year ago. The combination of our share repurchases and last year's convertible bond retirement resulted in $0.05 per diluted share accretion for the quarter. Now, turning to our segments. Sales in our construction products group increased 3.6% to 536.1 million during this year's first quarter, primarily driven by acquisition growth of 4.4%, resulting from the Nudura and Schul transactions. Organic growth added 0.7%, while foreign exchange reduced sales by 1.5%. This segment also benefited from strong performance for our basement waterproofing solutions business, as well as recovery in our Brazilian operation, which generated significant sales growth. Impacting our North American businesses in the segment were labor shortages and June weather conditions that delayed construction activity. Additionally, sales were discontinued in certain product lines and geographies as a result of strategic decisions to exit low-margin, high-risk working capital operations. Segment EBIT increased 23.1% or 16.3 million to 86.9 million. The improvement in EBIT was substantially driven by savings from our restructuring program, including management delayering, plant rationalization, and improved manufacturing disciplines. Sales in our Performance Coatings Group were 297.2 million. Organic growth was 0.4%. Acquisitions added 1.8%, while foreign exchange reduced sales by 1.9%. Despite modest sales growth, savings from our 2020 MAP to Growth plan provided significant earnings leverage in this segment. EBIT increased 31% to 36.9 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2020. The Performance Coatings Group generated highest earnings growth out of all of our segments during this quarter, driven by a reduction in its operating footprint and strategic decisions to exit low margin businesses. The segment also benefited from management delayering as it executes a reorganization towards a global brand management structure. In the Consumer Group, sales were 479.3 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Organic sales increased 0.1%, while acquisition growth contributed 1.3%. Foreign currency translation reduced sales by 1%. Segment sales were dampened by four factors. First, a difficult comparison to the prior year due to load ins. Second, a soft economy in the UK related to Brexit. Third, rainy weather in June. And fourth, deferred promotional activity by big box retailers. EBIT was 61.7 million, an increase of 18.6% over the prior year. The Consumer Group's improvement in EBIT was largely due to a favorable year-over-year comparison resulting from 10 million and associated costs from legal settlement during the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Additionally, segment results in the first quarter were impacted by confluence of factors. As part of our MAP to Growth program, which we kicked off over one year ago, we reduced headcount and rationalized our manufacturing footprint. These initiatives led to bottom-line savings. However, greater than expected market share gains at the end of FY 2019 led to elevated costs incurred by outsourcing production in order to service this increased demand. As a result, we are investing in new equipment, improving production methods, and leveraging our internal manufacturing network to provide increased capacity and produce more efficiently. The Specialty Products Group experienced sluggish demand in the OEM manufacturing and international markets it serves, which impacted the top line. Segment sales were [160.1 million] during the first quarter of 2020. Organic sales decreased 4.3%, and foreign currency translation reduced sales by 0.8%. However, on the bottom line, EBIT margin improved by 230 basis points during the quarter and EBIT increased by $2.2 million or 8.5% to 28.6 million. This was due to good cost discipline, manufacturing yield improvements, and restructuring activities from our 2020 MAP to Growth program. Next, a few comments on cash flow and our effective income tax rate. During the fiscal 2020 first quarter, cash generated from operations was 145.1 million, compared to cash used for operations of 7.1 million a year ago. This increase was due to improved earnings and margin improvement initiatives, as well as carryover what impact from the prior year removal of certain early cash payment discounts, which effectively shifted approximately 100 million in receipts from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and the first quarter of fiscal 2020, which we discussed in our previous earnings release. Lastly, as expected, our effective income tax rate for the quarter was higher this year versus the prior year's first quarter, which was impacted by more favorable discrete tax benefits. The higher effective tax rate resulted in lower diluted EPS of $0.05 as compared to last year's first quarter. I'll now turn the call over to Rusty for details on our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2020."

            "content": "Thanks, Matt. As we look ahead to the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect to generate consolidated sales growth of 2% to 3%. We expect to leverage the sales growth to the bottom line for an estimated 20% to 24% adjusted EBIT growth resulting in an adjusted diluted EPS in the low-to-mid $0.70 range. Looking ahead to our fiscal 2020 third and fourth quarters, it is important to note the seasonality in our business. Historically our third quarter provides our most modest results each year because it falls during the winter months of December through February when painting and construction activity slows due to cold and snowy weather. Our fourth-quarter results are generally stronger as work begins to accelerate on painting and construction projects. Given our first quarter results and our expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year, we affirm that fiscal 2020 full-year guidance we provided on July 20, 2019. Revenue growth is anticipated to be at the low end of our previously disclosed range of 2.5% to 4%. Despite the tightening of our revenue growth assumption, we expect to leverage the positive momentum of 2020 MAP to Growth operating improvement plan to our bottom-line results. Therefore, we are maintaining our adjusted EBIT growth guidance in the 20% to 24% range as previously reported in July. We expect this to result in adjusted diluted EPS between $3.30 a share and $3.42 a share for the full-year of fiscal 2020. This concludes our formal comments. At this point we will be pleased to take your questions. Sure, Kevin. This is Rusty here. In terms of fiscal 2020, we're expecting CapEx to be about 180 million and about half of that is related to MAP to Growth. So, there is probably about $90 million of base CapEx, and of the $90 million related to MAP to Growth. Probably, nearly half of that maybe $40 million or so is related to the ERP consolidation that we're doing as we go down from 75 instances to four. And then the rest is production related as we consolidate production and we have other cost reduction projects going on in capital investment as well. Yes, that's right, yes. It should be exactly what we said in July. Sure. Kevin, this is Rusty. I would say one major change has been the impact of Brexit and the strengthening U.S. dollar. U.S. dollar, I read yesterday is at a two-year high against foreign currencies, including the euro for that matter and the FX impact on sales definitely looks like more of a headwind and we anticipated as we started off the year."

            "content": "Thank you, Hilda. Good morning and welcome to the RPM International Inc. Investor Call for our fiscal 2020 first quarter ended August 31, 2019. On the call with me today are Rusty Gordon, RPM's Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Matt Ratajczak, our Vice President of Global Tax and Treasury who is leading our Investor Relations function. I'll provide some high-level commentary on our first quarter results and an update on our 2020 MAP to Growth operating improvement plan. Then Matt will review the first quarter numbers in more detail. Rusty will wrap up our prepared remarks with our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2020 after which we'll be happy to answer your questions. The benefits of our 2020 MAP to Growth operating improvement plan, which really began to take hold during the fourth quarter of last year carried over into the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and generated significant earnings leverage. Initiatives that proved particularly beneficial included actions to rationalize our manufacturing and distribution footprint, improve production processes, and strengthen our supplier relationships through center-ledprocurement. In particular, during the first quarter we announced the closure of three additional plants, which brings our total to 15, out of 3, which are targeted for the total program. Additionally, we continue to streamline our workforce with approximately 80 additional reductions, which brings our total over the course of our restructuring to slightly more than 600. On a consolidated basis, we realized 2020 MAP to Growth savings in the first quarter to total $26 million; 7 million from manufacturing and operations, 7 million from procurement, and 12 million from G&A all of which flowed through our P&L.  These efforts resulted in an increased adjusted EBIT of 25.3% and an adjusted diluted earnings per share of 25% over the prior year quarter, which exceeds our guidance despite modest sales growth in the quarter, which we had anticipated. This was the direct result of three factors. Number 1, the decision to exit low margin product lines and businesses as we pursue a value over volume strategy in certain businesses.  For the fiscal 2020 year, this will reduce revenues by approximately $40 million in total. Also, we had an extremely wet June that slowed painting and construction activity, which particularly impacted our consumer segment and our construction products group, and sluggish international markets, particularly in Europe coupled with unfavorable foreign exchange impact on a transactional and translational basis.  I should note that the improvement in EBIT margin does not just contain to one or two segments but were spread across the entire enterprise which demonstrates the breadth and effectiveness of our 2020 MAP to Growth operating improvement program across RPM.  We continue to have a positive outlook on the outcomes of our restructuring program and as a result repurchased approximately $100 million of our common shares during the quarter. This was in addition to the 200 million we repurchased during fiscal 2019. When combined with the $200 million cash redemption of our convertible notes in November 2018, we are approximately halfway to our 2020 MAP to Growth goal of repurchasing $1 billion of our stock. I'll now turn the call over to Matt Ratajczak, or a more detailed review of our financial results in the quarter. Good morning, John. Sure. You'll start to see a meaningful improvement in the second quarter, and we're seeing it as we speak. The first quarter results for consumer are not indicative of what they're doing now or what they'll be doing for the balance of the year. We had two issues. Number one was significant market share gains throughout the year starting in the first quarter of last year with the wood stains and finishes pickup. And then the second issue quite candidly was some self-inflicted wounds that resulted in some manufacturing issues. When you are closing plants and you are, as we are across RPM, instituting common manufacturing measurements and disciplines pretty aggressively across your businesses and you've got a business in this case Rust-Oleum, that was operating near capacity, we caused some hiccups.  So that resulted in outsourcing at significantly higher costs, most of that is behind us and we will be spending this year and into early next somewhere around $30 million in additional paint making and filling capacity to continue to meet the demands in the marketplace. So, those are issues that negatively impacted our first quarter that really have a good story underneath them, and you will see somewhat higher sales growth and leverage to the bottom line on the EBIT line and consumer that's more consistent with the leverage you're seeing across RPM on a consolidated basis starting in Q2. Sure. So, Mike Sullivan is off to a great start. Just to remind folks, he started officially in June. We have regularly scheduled Board meetings starting this afternoon and tomorrow and our annual meeting of stockholders he will be presenting to our Board, and he will be present in our stockholders meeting, and he's identifying some different areas and also completing the buildout of the internal team that we need to continue the operating improvement and continuous improvement initiatives that we've undertaken at RPM. So, I would expect us to see a phase out of what has been a significant month-by-month and quarter-by-quarter third-party consulting costs as we get into calendar 2020. He's off to a great start. Sure. We are seeing some relief in major categories, and that's partly reflected in our numbers, but we have continued to see some tariff and metal can impact. Those things should ease. Again, I would remind people that we're on a FIFO basis, so you're looking at raw material issues that we are dealing with 60 days or 90 days ago that are showing up in our results today. So, it is a much more benign environment than it's been over the past two years. The biggest part of the gross margin improvement and raw material improvement have been from the centralized procurement effort that we have undertaken in earnest. Thanks, John. Good morning, Frank. Hi, Aziza. So, the Construction Products Group, as a newly configured group over the past year under the leadership of Paul Hoogenboom and his team are off to a great start, and I think the results in the topline, which were up 3.6% will reflect well in other similar companies publish their September 30 results, but we are exiting product lines and businesses that are lower margin so that's having a negative effect. The flipside is the integration of Dryvit and Nudura into the Construction Products Group of Euclid and Tremco is kickstarting some growth and efficiency there, and Paul has assembled a really good team and we're really excited about what we're seeing there. I think when you look at Q1, and you're going to see more the same in Q2, the former industrial segment of RPM, which was our lowest margin business, is now reporting as our Performance Coatings Group and our Construction Products Group, and you're seeing significant margin improvement in both, and the opportunities in both of those segments to consolidate some former independent businesses, save some costs and take a more global approach to their markets is pretty exciting. So, I guess the only comment I would make about our start to the second quarter is the \u2013 you know the geographic trends aren't changing. Europe is not any better; the UK Brexit situation if anything is worse; Latin America is a mixed bag; Brazil is recovering nicely after nearly three years of the challenges. On the flipside, Argentina, which is smaller for us, but still an area where we have business in both industrial and consumer markets is a mess; so that's a mixed bag. The last comment I'll make is if June was September, we would have had a better first quarter. The sun's shining and if you're in our consumer business or our Construction Products business that's a good thing, it's only one month out of the quarter, but it certainly helped us and is part of the reason why we feel like in our forecast you'll see some slightly better sales numbers year-over-year in Q2 than we saw in Q1. Thanks, Aziza. Good morning. Sure. I just commented a little bit geographically to Aziza. But in general, the \u2013 you know the geographic situation has not changed. The solid growth that we've been experiencing in North America for the last couple years is still positive, but slowing down, so we're seeing a little bit slow down in the construction market, especially big projects. It impacts our Construction Products business somewhat less and some of our editors because we tend to have a broader focus on distribution that serves small-to-medium size projects. Industrial capital spending seems to be slowing a little bit. And then the other comment I would make is with the strength of the dollar foreign exchange, both transactional and translational, we're a headwind in Q1 and we anticipate that in Q2 as well. Absolutely, and as I said, the Construction Products Group had revenues up in the first quarter, 3.6%, and that was despite the rainiest June in recent memory, which negatively impacted Tremco roofing, Dryvit, some pretty sizable businesses on our Construction Products Group. So, you'll see I think some better growth numbers in the fall in part related to weather, and I think there's good excitement there.  We're taking some market share in certain places and the consolidation of driving in Nudura into the Construction Products Group is opening up those product line in businesses to the broader sales force and distribution of Tremco ceilings and Tremco roofing. So, there are some good synergy market synergy with this combination as well that I think will benefit us for the balance of fiscal 2020. Sure. To answer both those questions, first the dividend policy, we've increased our dividend for 45 consecutive years, and in our board meeting today and tomorrow, it is highly likely that we will increase our cash dividend to shareholders for our 46th consecutive year. I think it will be somewhat more modest than what we've done over the last three or four years, where our dividend increases have been in the 7% or 8% range in part reflecting the significant return of capital to our shareholders over the last nine months with our share repurchase program. And so \u2013 but I think it's highly likely that we will continue our dividend \u2013 consecutive dividend increases, it's a hallmark of RPM that we would hope to continue for a long time. And your second question, Rosemarie? No, we're highly confident in achieving the $290 million of savings that we projected for our MAP to Growth program and disclosed publicly on November 28th of last year and we remain ahead of that curve. But as we communicated in the last quarter, it's likely that our absolute goals will be achieved 12 months or so later than we anticipated because of the lower growth levels that we and everybody around us are experiencing. But the MAP to Growth program is continuing to build. We're building in our, what's called the PMO, so building new projects and we have good momentum, and one of our challenges is to keep that momentum for the next 18 months. Thank you. Good morning, Steve. Sure. So, as I commented on an earlier question, our absolute goals, the billion dollars in EBIT and the related EBIT margin goal are probably 12 months out in terms of where we had originally projected mostly because of the slower growth, but the MAP to Growth initiatives themselves are ahead of schedule. We have a firm \u2013 just as one example, a different firm and looking at our indirect spend and we're hopeful that that effort will \u2013 you know will add maybe somewhere in the $10 million to $20 million range, that's relatively new. But we are chasing from a procurement perspective not only our significant raw materials, but paper cups and pencils if we can save money on it. And so, we're continuing to find things that we can add to the pipeline and maintain the momentum of savings. Couple of questions. Number one, I think that our consumer business, a really good leadership and we're continuing to do really well across all our customers and channels in costs and sealants, patch repair products. The wood stains and finishes program is going well and, you know, our relationships are strong. As I commented earlier, we had some self-inflicted hiccups in manufacturing. When you are aggressively pursuing the things that we're pursuing, we're going to stop our toe here and there and it's for the right reasons. And so, we have corrected that. That caused us to do some outsourcing, which hurt our margins. In terms of customers, I think we're solid with all our customers. The only specific comment I'll make is a year ago or a year and a half ago, we had commented in the big strategic issue of a competitor that that resulted in about $22 million loss of business at Lowe's. As of the beginning of this summer, we've picked up $16 million to 18 million of that lost business back at Rust-Oleum. So, we're continuing to focus on serving our customers in the primary areas that are our expertise and strength, which is small project paint and spray paint, wood stains and finishes, patch repair, caulks and sealants. Now, I mentioned that, you know that, but those are our focus. We wake up every day and think about innovation and how to serve customers in those markets, while we're competing with some major players who are principally architectural paint folks, which is not a space that we're much involved in. Yes, e-commerce, I would tell you in our consumer segment it's probably $15 million or $20 million, and it's our largest pieces with our largest customer. We do some through some online retailers. Interestingly enough, for instance, we actually sell some spray paint online. The nature of spray paint in terms of unit costs, in terms of shipping of a flammable good would not suggest that that's going to be a big category, but if there are orders at major customers, through some e-commerce folks we'll fill them. Sure. So, as you saw, we had a different fourth quarter cash generation at the end of fiscal 2019 than we had done in prior year. We had changed some of our approach in terms with suppliers, as well as internally, and so what we ended up with, which is the function of timing, and you saw that in our first quarter where we had a very strong cash generation in Q1. Some of that was just good strong execution and a big chunk of that was timing difference between fourth quarter and first quarter. Over the life of the MAP to Growth program, we expect to see 230 million and I think more of reductions in working capital versus the original base, and you'll see stronger cash generation both as we become more efficient on the plant floor, more efficient in working capital, and have higher margins. And so, we're on track for that.  The pickups to that in fiscal 2020 are the significant cash costs of outside consulting firms, which will start to wind down after January 1, and an extraordinary amount between ERP implementations and some PP&E. I would guess about $70 million or $80 million of extra CapEx that as we get through MAP to Growth will not be repeating. And so, those are temporary, and other than that our projections for improved cash flow are on target. Just a timing issue between Q4 and Q1 and Q2 and some of that relates to weather issues and some of that relates to some of the manufacturing hiccups we had in our ability to pursue maybe some more aggressive sell-ins that we deferred, because of those issues, which are now behind us. Good morning, Kevin. I will tell you should see better sales results modestly better in the current quarter. The weather issue is not a problem in September and that's good. We can see it in consumer takeaway. We can see in our Construction Products Group. The European issue and the Brexit issue, we're not changing. There's not as much foreign exchange impact in consumers, there is in our Performance Coatings Group or Construction Products Group, but it exists. That's not changing and the hiccups that we had from a manufacturing perspective are mostly behind us. So, from a cost perspective we won't be incurring the same challenges that we had in Q1. Thanks, Kevin. Good morning [indiscernible]. Oh, Jeff. More like 2% across RPM. We're not economists here, but I think from our perspective, the upside to us in the next year that we're not counting on, and this would be true for a lot of businesses would be the elimination of a lot of the distractions around trade wars and tariffs, and there are things that could be corrected politically. If they're corrected, when you look at our first quarter and I think you'll see similar results in Q2. The leverage that we're putting on our bottom line to modest sales growth is pretty solid. If we can find a way and economic help would certainly be welcomed to generate another 2% or 3% of sales growth, you really see that bottom line same. That's not in our forecast. We're not counting on it, but there is a scenario in which some of the economic disruptions out there globally get resolved or get better, and that could certainly pick up the housing market and the construction markets and we're hopeful that that will happen, but it's not in our forecast for the year. I think the area where we had the best organic growth was in our Construction Products Group, when you carve out the revenues that they are eliminating. On a consolidated basis, we are going to shed about $40 million of revenues this year. But our growth in control coatings business is having a rock-solid year. We just picked up the contract for the Eiffel Tower, which will be a nice piece of business for, maybe as much as nine months. We are taking market share in a lot of places there. The [TBS] business of our Construction Products Group, which is a below grade and in many instances residential level water proofing is having high single-digit revenue growth. And so, there is a number of areas where we're doing well. The caulks, sealants, patch and repair products business had organic growth of nearly 10%, really good business there and some of its market share \u2013 some of it's a combination of kind of small contractor, as well as DIY. So, there is a lot of patches of good growth. The flip side is our Specialty Products Group. You're not going to see in the rest of the year a lot of leverage to the bottom line with nearly 18% EBIT margins. We don't have an EBIT margin problem there. We have a growth problem and we're addressing that with some select investments and in some cases some leadership changes. Thank you. Good morning, Mike. So, I think you'll see some better volume growth in consumer versus what we reflected in the first quarter. As I commented earlier, we're seeing some nice pickups in some of the now being integrated construction Products Group companies like Nudura and Dryvit. And so I think for the balance of this year, we can pick up some revenue growth, just by expanding the specification and sales and distribution more broadly for those businesses that doesn't last forever, but that's still going on and then we'll have pockets in our Performance Coatings Group like our Carboline business to continue to put up solid numbers.  And so those are the things that make us feel like we'll hit the bottom end of that. The other thing that's worth noting is most of the acquisition activity that we reported in Q1 and that will impact Q2 starts to be annualized. So, at this stage, there isn't much in the way of acquisition activity planned for the second half of the year. So, our small to medium-sized acquisition program is generally alive and well. I will tell you that our pipeline is a little thinner than it's been for a while, in part because we've got most of the leaders of RPM focused on executing on our MAP to Growth program. And so, we're working on that and I think that will continue to be an important part of adding revenues and leveraging it to our bottom line in the coming years. But as I commented a minute ago, the second half of this year will likely not have much acquisition impact because of how we're annualizing transactions that were done last year and I think a small lull in acquisition activity that we hope to see pick up. Thank you. Good morning. Sure. If you carve out our MAP to Growth savings, EBIT would have been up. This is rough because you can't be exact, but EBIT would have been up in the 8% to 10% range and basically a 1% gain in revenues. So, pretty solid and I think that's a combination of price cost mix, which has been negative for two years and is now finally moving in the right direction on the gross margin line. The impact of acquisitions are small, but they certainly contribute some. And then the reason, it's not exactly a precise number is, our businesses have demonstrated really good SG&A discipline and leverage and so measuring how much of that would have happened without MAP to Growth per se or how much of its MAP to Growth is a judgment call. So, I think the way I would look at it internally, the way I do look at it internally is, is that EBIT would have been up in the 8% to 10% range, excluding the MAP to Growth and the balance of that's the MAP to Growth range is pretty good \u2013 pretty good leverage still on what's very modest revenue growth, and we'll keep plowing away. Let me, answer that by segment a little bit. I think you'll see, as we highlighted \u2013 I think you'll see somewhat better sales results in consumer, not only for Q2, but for the balance of the year versus Q1. I think you'll see better sales results in our Construction Products Group. So, both of those, kind of, low to mid-sales growth. Our Performance Coatings Group is going to be kind of flat-to-low for the balance of the year.  Some of that is a result of the very deliberate decisions to exit or discontinue product lines or businesses, most of those are kind of faraway relatively small overseas businesses. They don't have the margins that we'd like to see. And then the most challenged segment we have for the balance of the year will be our Specialty Products Group and in that case I think we're seeing flat to slightly down revenues for the reasons Rusty mentioned, foreign exchange will be a hit, they're annualizing tougher comps, but we've got some growth issues in some of those businesses, high margin really solid business. We have a new leader leadership team at Day-Glo, new leadership and our TCI business. I could go down the list in some selected investments. So, you're going to see the most challenge revenue segment for us to be Specialty Products. All great businesses, all high margin and hopefully you'll begin to see the benefits of the changes that we're making in the fourth quarter and in fiscal 2021. Thank you. Great. Thanks, Hilda. I'd like to remind everybody that tomorrow afternoon, at 2 o'clock, at the Crowne Plaza in Middleburg Heights is RPM's Annual Meeting of Stockholders. We regularly welcome 800 to 1,000 individual shareholders and a handful of institutional shareholders to our Annual Meeting. And lastly, I'd like to close by recognizing the RPM associates around the world who are doing a great job on executing on our MAP to Growth program and when we get through this program, the entrepreneurial spirit and culture of RPM combined with the operational excellence and continuous improvement culture that we are instituting is going to be hugely successful both in the marketplace and for our shareholders. Thank you very much for your time on the call today. We look forward to providing you our second quarter results in early January of 2021. Have a great day."

At this time, I would now like to turn the call over to RPM\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Mr. Frank Sullivan, for opening remarks. Please go ahead, sir.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you, Angelica. Good morning and welcome to the RPM International Inc. investor call for our fiscal 2021 fourth quarter and for the full year ended May 31, 2021. With me on today\u2019s call are Rusty Gordon, RPM\u2019s Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Matt Ratajczak, our Vice President of Global Tax and Treasury, who supports our Investor Relations activities. On today\u2019s call, I will provide details on the successful completion of our MAP to Growth operating improvement program. Matt will then review our fourth quarter results in some detail then Rusty will conclude with comments on our outlook for the first half of fiscal 2022. We will then be pleased to answer your questions. On our April investor call, we referenced rising inflation across our P&L at structurally high single-digits with some select spikes of 150% to 200%. Some on our call today thought that by now raw material costs and availability would have gotten better to the point of pressure from some customers to give back price. That was wrong in April and way wrong today. Raw material costs have increased to levels on average in the high-teens. More importantly, certain critical raw material shortages across our industry are negatively impacting our ability to produce and meet market demand. In Q4, this raw material availability cost us an estimated $100 million in revenue. It\u2019s likely to cost us more in Q1 and we anticipate having more raw material availability lost production days in Q1 this year than we had from the impact of COVID shutdowns in Q1 last year. These challenges notwithstanding, thanks to our successful MAP to Growth operating improvement program, we generated strong results for our 2021 fiscal year. Our full year consolidated sales increased 11% to $6.1 billion, our EBIT margin increased by 150 basis points, and adjusted EBIT was up 26.5%. Operating cash flow climbed nearly 40% to a record $766.2 million and our adjusted EBIT margin climbed to 12.8%, which was also a record. Our MAP to Growth program has been the principal driver of this strong financial performance. The successful execution of our MAP to Growth operating improvement plan, especially in light of the incredible disruptions caused by the COVID pandemic and more recently by unprecedented supply chain challenges, is a true testament to the dedication and resilience of the RPM associates worldwide. At the program\u2019s onset, we recognized that RPM had reached the point, where a center-led approach in selected areas of the business was required to take it to the next level of growth. In manufacturing, we formed a center-led team that has created a lasting culture of manufacturing excellence and continuous improvement disciplines across the organization. This team launched our MS-168 manufacturing system, which is allowing us to produce better products more quickly, more cost effectively and more sustainably. In addition, we reduced our global manufacturing footprint by 28 facilities, consolidating production to more strategically advantageous plants. Our original target was 31 plants, but consolidation efforts were slowed by the COVID pandemic. We expect to exceed the original target in the coming year. We also created a center-led procurement team that has consolidated material spending across our operating companies, negotiated improved payment terms with our supplier base and has helped us reduce working capital. These initiatives have created millions of dollars in cost savings. With stronger supplier partnerships, longer term contracts, we are in a much better position to secure necessary raw materials and control costs through the current raw material supply shortages than we would have been just 3 years ago. Additionally, we took significant steps to streamline many of our administrative functions. Through our financial realignment, we consolidated 46 accounting locations, improved controls, developed more effective and efficient accounting processes and reduced costs. Similar initiatives were undertaken in our IT infrastructure as we have migrated 75% of our organization to 1 of 4 group-level ERP platforms. Additionally, we have reduced the number of data centers we manage by shifting systems and hardware to the cloud and we are creating a number of platforms for centralized data-driven decision-making. Over the course of the 3-year MAP to Growth program, we have returned $1.1 billion of capital to shareholders through a combination of cash dividends and share repurchases. Aside from a significantly improved profit margin profile and stronger cash generation, as reflected in the cumulative total return generated by RPM, which has exceeded our peer group over the 3 years of the MAP to Growth program, the lasting legacy of our MAP to Growth operating improvement plan is the revolutionary change in how people work together at RPM. Our operating company leadership is managing today with a broader view of RPM as a whole, allowing us to better leverage resources. Another permanent change has been the operational disciplines we developed that will continue to generate improvements in profitability, cash flow and operating efficiency well into the future. Perhaps more significant has been our ability to maintain our unique entrepreneurial growth-oriented culture evidenced by the fact that our revenues continue to grow at or above industry averages throughout the MAP to Growth program. The real heroes behind the MAP to Growth success were our associates worldwide, particularly our frontline workers who kept our manufacturing and distribution centers operating during the COVID pandemic. We also owe a debt of gratitude to my good friend and one of RPM\u2019s great operating leaders, Steve Knoop, who is the architect of the MAP to Growth program and passed away prematurely in 2019. Additionally, I would like to recognize Mike Sullivan, Vice President of Operations and Chief Restructuring Officer; Tim Kinser, Vice President of Operations Procurement; and Gordy Hyde, Vice President of Operations, Manufacturing who successfully executed the program with an intense focus and strong leadership that were integral to delivering these results and instilling a permanent focus on operating efficiency and continuous improvement into our culture. While we have reached the 2020 MAP to Growth conclusion, there will be some runoff from the MAP to Growth program in fiscal \u201822, during which we expect to capture approximately $50 million in incremental savings. We will also be leveraging the lessons learned from this program to chart a course for 2025. Over the next 6 to 12 months, we will be working on a MAP 2.0 program in conjunction with our operating leaders. We remain fully committed to achieving our long-term goal of a 60% EBIT margin and we will be sharing more information about our progress for a new program in the coming quarters. I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Ratajczak, who will discuss our fourth quarter results in detail.\nMatt Ratajczak: Thanks, Frank and good morning everyone. Please keep in mind that my comments will be on an as-adjusted basis. For the fourth quarter, we generated consolidated net sales of $1.74 billion, an increase of 19.6% compared to the $1.46 billion reported in the year ago period. Sales growth was 13.9% organic, 2.2% as a result of recent acquisitions and 3.5% due to foreign currency translation tailwinds. We are very pleased with this strong top line growth in light of raw material shortages and supply chain disruptions. It has been challenging, but we have been managing these difficulties, thanks to our center-led procurement team, improved internal collaboration and leveraging of internal resources to get materials where they are most needed. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 13.3% to $1.28 compared to $1.13 in the fiscal 2020 fourth quarter. Our adjusted EBIT was $236.2 million compared to $213.6 million during the year ago period, which was an increase of 10.6%. Keep in mind that last year\u2019s fourth quarter was impacted by the pandemic\u2019s onset, which created the extraordinary situation where our non-operating segment reported a profit due to lower medical expenses, incentive reversals and other factors. On the other hand, during this year\u2019s fourth quarter, we experienced higher insurance costs due to business interruptions created by hurricanes and the winter storm Uri as well as higher incentives tied to improved performance. If you exclude the impact of our non-operating segment from both years, our four operating segments combined generated impressive sales growth of 19.6% and adjusted EBIT growth of 27.5% as they overcame margin pressures and supply availability challenges. Turning now to our segment performance for the quarter, our Construction Products Group generated record results. Construction, maintenance and repair activity accelerated in the U.S. during the quarter and even more so in international markets. Construction Products Group net sales were a record $629.4 million during the fiscal 2021 fourth quarter, which was an increase of 33.2% compared to fiscal 2020 fourth quarter net sales of $472.4 million. Organic growth was 28.4% and foreign currency translation provided a tailwind of 4.8%. Leading the way for the segment were our businesses in North America that provided commercial roofing materials and concrete admixtures and repair products as well as our European businesses, all of which generated record sales. Demand for our Nudura insulated concrete forms remained at elevated levels due to the relatively low installed cost, in addition to the environmental and structural benefits as compared to traditional building methods. Adjusted EBIT was a record $110.4 million compared to adjusted EBIT of $77.3 million reported during the year ago period. This represents an increase of 42.7%. The bottom line was boosted by volume leveraging, savings from our MAP to Growth program and higher selling prices. Our Performance Coatings Group also benefited from the release of pent-up demand for the construction, maintenance and repair of structures in the U.S. and abroad, which has leveraged into strong financial results. The segment\u2019s net sales were $283.3 million during the fiscal 2021 fourth quarter, which was an increase of 20.5% compared to the $235.1 million reported a year ago. Organic sales increased 12.9% and acquisitions contributed 2.9%. Foreign currency translation increased sales by 4.7%. This segment had been particularly challenged through the pandemic because of its greater exposure to international markets and the oil and gas industry as well as a greater reliance on facility access to apply its products. Points of strength in the Performance Coatings Group were its businesses providing commercial flooring systems and North American bridge and highway products as well as recovery in its international businesses. Adjusted EBIT was $31 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to $23.7 million during the year ago period, representing an increase of 31.2%. Segment earnings increased due to higher sales volumes, the MAP to Growth program and pricing, which helped to offset raw material inflation. Our Consumer Group reported record net sales of $628.9 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, an increase of 2% compared to net sales of $616.2 million reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Organic sales decreased 3.8% since this was the first quarter in which we comped against the surge in demand at the beginning of the pandemic. Acquisitions contributed 3.8% to sales. Foreign currency translation increased sales by 2%. During the first three quarters of this fiscal year, our Consumer Group sales and earnings have grown rapidly as it served the extraordinary demand for DIY home improvement products by consumers who were homebound during the pandemic. As more Americans became vaccinated and were no longer confined to their homes, DIY home improvement activity began to slow from its torrid pace during the quarter, though the pace of sales remained higher than the pre-pandemic levels. In international markets, many of which still have stay-at-home orders in place, they remain quite strong. Fiscal 2021 fourth quarter adjusted EBIT was $93.6 million, a decrease of 10.4% compared to adjusted EBIT of $104.5 million reported during the prior year period. Helping to partially offset the cost pressures were selling price increases and savings from our MAP to Growth program, some of which were invested in advertising programs to promote new products. The Specialty Products Group reported record net sales of $202.8 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, which increased 49.9% compared to net sales of $135.2 million in the fiscal 2020 fourth quarter. Organic sales increased 46.2%, while acquisitions contributed 0.7% to sales and foreign currency translation increased sales by 3%. For the second quarter in a row, our Specialty Products Group generated the highest organic growth among our four operating segments. Its results have improved sequentially over the past three quarters, with excellent top and bottom line results by nearly all of its businesses, including those providing coatings for recreational watercraft, OEM equipment, wood, food and pharmaceuticals as well as cleaning and restoration equipment and chemicals. Adjusted EBIT was a record $36.3 million in the fiscal 2021 fourth quarter, an increase of 395% compared to adjusted EBIT of $7.3 million in the prior year period. Its record results were driven by recent management changes, increased business development initiatives and improving market conditions. Lastly, I have a few comments in our liquidity. Our fiscal 2021 cash flow from operations, as Frank mentioned, was a record $766.2 million compared to last year\u2019s record of $549.9 million. This is primarily due to continued good working capital management and margin improvement initiatives from our MAP to Growth program. At year end, our total liquidity was $1.46 billion and included $246.7 million of cash and $1.21 billion in committed available credit. Our net leverage ratio, as calculated under our bank agreements, was 2.17 as of May 31, 2021. This was an improvement as compared to 2.89 a year ago. With a healthy balance sheet, we continue to use some of our record cash flow to reduce debt. Total debt at the end of fiscal 2021 was $2.38 billion compared to $2.54 billion a year ago. And as Frank mentioned, we are also investing more aggressively in growth initiatives, including advertising, operating improvements and acquisitions, plus we are rewarding our shareholders through our cash dividend and our stock repurchase program. Since the beginning of the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 38 million of stock. I will now turn the call over to Rusty for comments on our outlook.\nRusty Gordon: Thanks, Matt. As we discussed last quarter, various macroeconomic factors are creating inflationary and supply pressures on some of our product categories. As a result of the lag impact from our FIFO accounting methodology, we expect that our fiscal 2022 first half performance will be significantly impacted by inflation throughout our P&L, which is currently averaging in the upper teens. We are working to offset these increased costs with incremental MAP to Growth savings and commensurate selling price increases which we will continue to implement as necessary. More importantly, the limited availability of certain key raw material components is negatively impacting our ability to meet demand. Our most significant challenge for the first half of fiscal 2022 will be in our Consumer Group. Several factors are compressing margins in this segment. First, selling price negotiations took place last spring and material costs have rapidly risen further since then. Secondly, insufficient supply of raw materials, several of which are severely constrained due to trucking shortages or force majeure being declared by suppliers, has led to intermittent plant shutdowns and low productivity. Lastly, the Consumer Group has outsourced production in several cases to improve service levels at the expense of margins. To address these first half margin challenges, the Consumer Group is cutting costs and working with customers to secure additional price increases. We expect that our other three segments will successfully manage supply challenges to continue their robust top and bottom line momentum from the fourth quarter and carry it into the first half of fiscal 2022. Turning now to Q1 of fiscal 2022, we expect consolidated sales to increase in the low to mid single-digits compared to Q1 of fiscal 2021 when sales grew 9%, creating a difficult year-over-year comparison. Additionally, supply constraints have slowed production in some product categories. Despite these factors, our revenue growth is expected to continue in three of our four segments. We anticipate our Construction Products Group and Performance Coatings Group to generate sales increases in the high single or low double-digits. The Specialty Products Group is expected to generate double-digit sales increases. These sales projections assume that global economies continue to improve. Sales in our Consumer Group are expected to decline double-digits as it continues to experience difficult comparisons to the prior year when organic growth was up 34%. However, the Consumer Group\u2019s fiscal 2022 Q1 sales are expected to be above the pre-pandemic record, indicating that we have expanded the user base for our products since then. We expect our Q1 adjusted EBIT to grow in three of our four segments, with the exception again being our Consumer Group. Based on the anticipated decline in this one segment, our Q1 consolidated adjusted EBIT is expected to decrease 25% to 30% versus a difficult prior year comparison when adjusted EBIT in last year\u2019s first quarter was up nearly 40%. Moving to Q2 of fiscal 2022, we expect good performance again with the exception of the Consumer Group. As discussed earlier, the challenges in this segment are anticipated to result in a significant decline in adjusted EBIT against difficult prior year comparisons when sales were up 21% and adjusted EBIT was up 66%. We anticipate that the Q2 decline in consumer will be mostly offset by the combined EBIT growth in our three other segments, leading to consolidated adjusted EBIT being roughly flat versus another difficult prior year comparison when consolidated adjusted EBIT was up nearly 30%. After we work through the temporary supply chain challenges, we expect to emerge with the Consumer Group that has broader distribution and a larger user base than it had pre-pandemic. For our other three segments, good results are expected to continue due to recent strategic changes in our Specialty Products Group continuing to payoff and the catch-up of deferred maintenance driving additional business at our Construction Products Group and Performance Coatings Group. This concludes our formal comments and we will now be pleased to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nJohn McNulty: Yes, good morning.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, John.\nJohn McNulty: Good morning, Frank. Thanks for taking my question. So I guess the first one would just be in terms of the pricing that you need for each of the divisions, can you kind of walk us through how we should be thinking about that and the timing of which you hope to kind of implement some of these price increases just so we can kind of measure that versus the timing of the raw materials and when they may kind of level off?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So in Q4, on average, based upon the timing of the effectiveness of various price increases that we negotiated this spring, the effect was about 3% in Q4. And we would expect or anticipate at this point that the effect of pricing in Q1 will be in the 5% to 6% range, and that\u2019s based upon price increases that are in effect at this point. And we are going forward with additional price increase activity in the next month across a lot of our different businesses. I think, we will report, obviously, in the Q1 results when we report those results in October. But we are pursuing additional price increases in Consumer in particular as well as other parts of RPM on top of what\u2019s already been enacted.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then when we look at the construction business, the growth is pretty chunky, but admittedly, there is a lot of weird comps that we\u2019re trying to deal with. I guess, is there a way to think about how much of it is just the core business coming back versus how we should be thinking about market share gains and what you\u2019ve been doing there?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. Our Construction Products Group just completed its third consecutive year of strong sales growth, very strong EBIT margin improvement, and it\u2019s driven by market share gains, the introduction of new products and the integration of what were a collection of, very often, kind of independent operations, and you\u2019re going to see more to come. We entered the first quarter with really good momentum in our Construction Products Group, our Performance Coatings Group and our Specialty Products Group. Some of that momentum is being disrupted by the supply chain and really, raw material availability issues that Matt and Rusty referenced. We literally have had weeks of lost production days because of the lack of availability of certain critical elements. And were it not bad, you\u2019d see stronger growth than we even project. So we are likely, in the Construction Products Group, to be up in the 9% to 12% range in terms of sales for the quarter and the demand is higher than that. And the good momentum that we\u2019ve had for 3 years is continuing. You\u2019ll see, after Q1, a return to solid growth and margin enhancement in our three non-Consumer segments.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. And maybe I can sneak one last one in. With regard to cash flow, I mean, you\u2019ve certainly seen a big improvement in the cash flow since MAP to Growth was really put in place. I guess, can you speak to how we should be thinking about the M&A opportunities that you can look at as you look at 2022 versus buybacks and how we should be thinking about cash being returned to shareholders?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. We continue to have a pretty strong pipeline of kind of our typical small to medium acquisitions so we will pursue those and get them done where we can. We\u2019ve commented in the past on larger transactions. And we are committed both to achieving the original MAP to Growth goal of a 16% EBIT margin and a return of capital between dividends and share repurchases of $1.5 billion through May 31, \u201821. Our total return of capital as measured in the MAP to Growth program was $1.1 billion, so a little short there. So we will balance those, but we\u2019ve got a much stronger cash flow than we had 3 years ago to be able to have fun with that balance in terms of how we return capital to shareholders and continue to pursue growth.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. Thanks very much for the color, Frank.\nFrank Sullivan: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research. Your line is\u2026\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Frank.\nFrank Mitsch: Hey, good morning, Frank. I was struck by the comments regarding higher ad spending. Should we anticipate that the Guardian Protection Products, part of Specialty Products, will be the official sponsor of the Cleveland baseball team?\nFrank Sullivan: That\u2019s a great suggestion but we have not looked into that yet. But certainly, there is a nice connection there and go Guardians.\nFrank Mitsch: My goodness. That\u2019s going to take a long time to get used to. Really interesting that you got impacted by $100 million in the fiscal fourth quarter because of raw material availability, and you expect an even higher impact here in the first quarter. You kept mentioning critical components, etcetera. Can you identify what some of those critical components are so we can kind of track on the outside as to when companies are lifting force majeures, etcetera?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So, some of them are specific to critical elements in our roof restoration coatings. And certain intermediate chemicals have been unavailable, which has caused us to shut down production for, in one case, as long as 5 days. And so we find ourselves in a number of these areas sourcing raw materials that were readily available in the United States that have been disrupted by this winter storm Uri, the power outages in Texas and the lack of investment that happened during COVID. And so we are now finding replacement products typically in Asia, sometimes at higher prices, obviously, a longer supply line because they got to show up on a boat. When they get to Long Beach, California, they can sit for 3 or 4 weeks because of disruptions there. Another element, again, this is in Construction Products, is on traditional reroofing projects, not a roof restoration but traditional black line and felts. I think it\u2019s no surprise to people that there is a shortage in foam. It\u2019s disrupting, for instance, seating in the furniture markets and in the automotive seating area. And it\u2019s also \u2013 finds itself into roofing where you can have all of your materials shipped and sitting outside of a school building or a hospital, waiting for foam board insulation, which is on back order in a lot of places. So those are a couple of instances in the more industrial side. On the consumer side, unfortunately, there was an accident at a major alkyd resin producer in the United States that represented almost 30% of alkyd resin production. That\u2019s a particularly critical raw material for our small project paints category and spray paints category in our Consumer business. Again, we\u2019re looking at qualifying replacement product from Asia and other areas, longer supply lines, higher costs. And so all of these are temporary but they are certainly temporarily causing a pretty big disruption in our Consumer business.\nFrank Mitsch: Understood, understood. And then \u2013 and as you sit here today, obviously, 3 months ago or 4 months ago, you were anticipating high single-digit increases in raws and now it\u2019s coming in at upper teens, and that\u2019s very consistent with what we\u2019re hearing from other folks. What gives you confidence that perhaps that\u2019s going to moderate as we get into the second half of fiscal \u201822 or is that not part of your thinking?\nFrank Sullivan: I think that\u2019s part of our thinking. We\u2019ve been successful in instituting price increases. We still have some MAP to Growth benefits. And I think the biggest challenge we\u2019re facing is the disruptions from materials. Again, I can go on for an hour of MPIs and Pentas and MMAs and you name it, I am a finance guy, not a chemist but I\u2019m learning a lot about chemistry. And I think as we get into the second half, the momentum that we have in terms of product demand, market demand, the benefits from our MAP to Growth program will certainly serve us well. The other comment I\u2019d like to make is while we\u2019re going to have a very difficult period in our Consumer segment for the reasons we talked about in Q1 and Q2, our current estimate is on the top line, we will be about 12% ahead in Consumer in the first half of where we were 2 years ago in our fiscal \u201820 first half. So a 2-year over the pandemic expansion of 12% would indicate that we have expanded our customer base. We\u2019re excited about that. And some of these things are \u2013 they are temporary but I don\u2019t envision them being corrected until we get into the winter months or early spring of next year.\nFrank Mitsch: Got it. Thanks so much.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli from Gabelli and Company. Your line is now open.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Rosemarie.\nRosemarie Morbelli: Thank you. Good morning everyone. Frank, you just mentioned the fact that you are looking at small to medium-sized M&A. You have mentioned in the past that following the MAP program, you would be able to consider a larger acquisition. So are we waiting? Do you think it makes sense to wait until you have gone through MAP 2.0 before you can actually look at something substantially higher than what you have been doing recently?\nFrank Sullivan: No, I think we need \u2013 yes. No, I think that\u2019s a good question. And I think we need to solidify where we are in this supply chain environment certainly before we bring out publicly details of a MAP 2.0. But we have made significant strides, in particular, in our Construction Products Group and in our Consumer Group, such that I think we have the talent and the capabilities to integrate a larger transaction if one were to be available at the right price. And obviously, at today\u2019s prices, if you don\u2019t have the ability to drive synergies, you can\u2019t be competitive. And so in those two areas, I think we\u2019re getting there. But solidifying the supply chain challenges now is going to be important for everybody in terms of \u2013 you can talk about long-term goals, but the ground is shifting a little bit, and it\u2019s going to shift for a couple of quarters until the supply chain issue become more clear.\nRosemarie Morbelli: Okay, thank you. That is very helpful. And then looking at the Consumer, it seems as though the difficult comparison on the DIY and then some of us are going back to the office and so on. So it is \u2013 it makes sense that it will slow down and decline in the U.S. on a year-over-year basis. But you mentioned that it was stronger internationally. So when do you think that international DIY is going to be faced with the same comparison issues?\nFrank Sullivan: I don\u2019t know that we will have the same comparison issues internationally that we have in the U.S., in part because of market share. We tend to be the leader in every one of the categories that we operate in, in our Consumer segment in North America. And that is not true in the UK and Europe, which is our next biggest market and certainly not true in export markets like Latin America or in Asia. So we don\u2019t anticipate seeing the same year-over-year challenges in those markets because of our smaller market share and also because of the smaller sizes. The real challenge will be, again, on the raw material side and the cost side. I think we\u2019re pretty comfortable with when we finish the year, we will be substantially ahead in terms of sales and unit volume where we were 2 years ago pre pandemic and just need to work on the product availability and cost sides.\nRosemarie Morbelli: Alright. Thank you.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi from Baird. Your line is now open.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Ghansham.\nGhansham Panjabi: Thank you. Good morning, Frank. Good morning everyone. Maybe just following up on the last question, so your guidance for the fiscal first quarter for Consumer is down double digits in terms of sales. How much of that should we sort of think about in terms of raw material accessibility in terms of the impact on there? And then how would you characterize what I\u2019m sure is going on, which is just an inventory adjustment at the customer level as well? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense as to what the true underlying demand as we cycle into 2Q and beyond looks like for that segment?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. Our estimate across RPM is probably for another $100 million of lost revenue, and it\u2019s predominantly in Construction Products and Consumer. As I commented earlier, material outages, components of construction products or roofing projects are kind of impeding opportunities for sales that are in the market. Certainly, that\u2019s true based on our momentum and what we\u2019ve accomplished and that\u2019s continuing. It\u2019s also true based on incredible stimulus cities, counties, states have got billions of dollars and a lot of it\u2019s being applied towards infrastructure and renovation in school buildings in areas where we\u2019re very strong. On the consumer side, it\u2019s pretty much the same thing. We have lower-than-anticipated or expected fill rates principally as a result of this alkyd resin disruption and we\u2019re working hard to meet that. And so that\u2019s part of the cost issue. Our principal goal here is to meet demand, quite candidly, at whatever additional cost we need to in the interim. And then we will get out of tolling. I believe our North American chemical supply chain will return, and you\u2019ll see a significant improvement in our cost structure when those things happen.\nGhansham Panjabi: Okay, great. And then on the consumer additional selling price initiatives that you are pursuing, would that be more so a 4Q event in terms of sequential improvement or should we anticipate something starting to hit in 3Q as well?\nFrank Sullivan: I think that will hit probably by mid Q2. We are working on additional price increases in a number of places, not just Consumer for the end of August or September.\nGhansham Panjabi: Fantastic. Thank you so much.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Andrews.\nVincent Andrews: Thank you and good morning everyone. If I could just ask, Frank, when you say 12% for Consumer fiscal \u201822 over \u201819 or over pre pandemic, how are you getting to that? Is that based on your order book? Is that based on sort of your sort of qualitative assessment of the landscape or just sort of what\u2019s giving you that bridge?\nFrank Sullivan: It\u2019s based upon the forecast that we\u2019ve done internally for Q1 and Q2. And a big part of that, as we\u2019ve already talked about in the call, is not just a function of demand but a function of what we think we can supply. And so clearly, it would be stronger if we weren\u2019t facing the supply disruptions. But we regularly do a rolling two-quarter forecast with our Board. And based on with our Board and based on that forecast, that\u2019s what\u2019s driving that assumption.\nVincent Andrews: Okay. And Rusty, could I ask you just to give us some directional ideas on what could happen to working capital in fiscal \u201822? Just obviously, you have some production constraints but there is rising raw material costs and along those same lines. Now that MAP to Growth is done, are sort of the one-time expenses associated with that done so the earnings number should be cleaner or is there still some lingering stuff? And then lastly, if you have a CapEx number for this year?\nRusty Gordon: Sure. That\u2019s a number of questions. I\u2019ll address working capital first. We had a great year on working capital. But really, the supply chain disruption had thrown a wrench in our efforts to reduce inventory. Right now, we\u2019re just trying to get our hands on inventory from any source we can so that we can meet customer demand. So that probably has stalled us during the supply chain challenge on inventory. On payables, we\u2019ve done a great job and we continue to have our procurement team negotiate better terms and that should continue to help us. Sticking with cash flow. Looking ahead to fiscal \u201822, we are boosting our capital spending quite a bit to add capacity in a number of areas. We\u2019ve talked a lot about Nudura. That\u2019s a product line that\u2019s growing by 50% to 100% each quarter, so we need capacity there, more in liquid applied roofing, which as you know, Vincent, has grown year after year for us. And also in our Consumer businesses, we continue to constantly build share year in, year out and we will need capacity there. As far as the MAP to Growth program goes, we will have the incremental benefits. There will be a few charges as we plan to close a few plants and further delayer management.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research. Your lien is now open.\nKevin McCarthy: Good morning.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Kevin.\nKevin McCarthy: In your prepared remarks, I think you referenced the outsourcing of production in the Consumer segment in an effort to improve service, albeit at the expense of margins. Can you talk through how much of your production is outsourced or how much was outsourced last year, and whether or not you\u2019d expect that to change in fiscal \u201822? Just trying to get a feel for what the associated margin dynamics could be.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I don\u2019t have an exact number there, but I can tell you that the outsourcing, in some case, filling, in other cases, working on new resin suppliers and qualification of new suppliers and their formulas is costing us a couple of hundred basis points in gross margin. And those are margin points that we hope to regain, both with some of the investment Rusty\u2019s talking about and then eliminating some of this outsourced tolling both, in some cases, related to filling and, in other cases, related to resin manufacturing. And some of it will be, as I said, snapback of our traditional North American chemical supplier supply lines versus things that we\u2019re now procuring from Asia, which is a much longer lead time, more challenging freight costs. I don\u2019t know if these numbers right, but containers, which are principally controlled by China, used to be a couple of thousand bucks and now they are $20,000. I mean, the freight has been a big issue here as well and particularly for our Consumer group. Whether it\u2019s ocean freight, it wasn\u2019t a big thing that\u2019s become bigger and more expensive. Trucking. And so as I have commented in the last quarter and it\u2019s true today and you\u2019re hearing it from every industry, inflation is hitting pretty much every aspect of our P&L.\nKevin McCarthy: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then apologies if I missed it, but what is your capital budget for CapEx for fiscal \u201822 relative to the $157 million that you spent last year?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. Related to the comments that Rusty made about adding capacity, this year, it will be around $220 million.\nKevin McCarthy: Okay, thank you very much.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Sison from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Michael.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, it\u2019s actually Richard on for Michael.\nFrank Sullivan: Hi, Richard.\nUnidentified Analyst: Just wanted to touch again on the inflation expectations, if you look at price increases you\u2019re getting in the first quarter and you\u2019re going to push more in the second quarter, do you expect you\u2019re going to be able to grow EBIT in the second half of this fiscal year, given a lot of the issues impacting the first quarter are largely transitory?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes. We will be growing EBIT in the first quarter in three of our four segments. We will be growing EBIT sufficiently in our construction products, Specialty Products and Performance Coatings, to more than offset the decline in EBIT we\u2019re expecting in Q2 in Consumer. And then we fully expect to see EBIT growth across all four of our segments in the second half of the year. And as Rusty said, that presumes continued strong demand. And the only thing we see that would interrupt that would be some issues with COVID because the demand across all our businesses is strong, and both the demand dynamics that we see, the new products that we have in line and the massive amount of stimulus in the United States all indicate that it will be a strong year and that it will be particularly strong as we get these supply chain challenges behind us. That\u2019s going to take a couple of quarters, though.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, great. And then just a follow-up, on the MAP to Growth incremental savings of $50 million this fiscal 2022, can you remind us how that\u2019s going to flow through the segments? And I know you\u2019re working on the next leg, MAP 2.0, maybe if there is anything you can give us in terms of where you\u2019re focused on there as well?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I don\u2019t know that we provided how it would flow through the segments. It ought to flow around $10 million to $12 million a quarter throughout the fiscal year, relatively evenly except for the seasonal low third quarter. And MAP to Growth 2. 0 is something that we had targeted having put out an Investor Day in November of 2018 for something around that time frame. But given the massive disruptions of the supply chain challenges, I think \u2013 I know that our decision is to better solidify what\u2019s happening, have more certainty around our supply chains on a go-forward basis and then come out. So probably in the spring with some more details on what we think of as MAP to Growth 2.0 is something that we had targeted having put out an Investor Day in November of 2018 for something around that timeframe, given the massive disruptions of the supply chain challenges, I think \u2013 I know that our decision is to better solidify what\u2019s happening, more certainty around our supply chain is on a go forward basis and then come out. So, probably in the spring, give some more details on what we think of this MAP to Growth 2.0.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning Steve.\nLuke Washer: Hi, good morning. Sorry to disappoint, this is Luke Washer on for Steve. Thanks for taking my question here.\nFrank Sullivan: Hi, Frank.\nLuke Washer: You talked in the past \u2013 Frank, in the past, you have talked about the opportunities you see in driving top line growth, specifically as it relates to opening up new sales channels, identifying cross-selling opportunities and expanding internationally. Can you talk more about how you are incentivizing your four segment leaders to collaborate more than has been done historically? What have you changed that\u2019s really driving that top line sales growth that you are looking for?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure, that\u2019s a great question. So, a couple of things that we have changed and COVID helped to drive some of this, although MAP to Growth was getting us there. We have a much more often and more collaborative across our group communications than we have had in the past. And we are measuring what we call connections creating value that we have been talking about for 10 years and improving for 10 years, now very metrically across two categories. One is what\u2019s driving revenue growth in terms of technology transfer, channel sharing and/or leads from one division to another. And then the other area is on the cost side, where we have gotten much more efficient and cooperative in having one RPM company produce for another RPM company. Give you just a couple of quick examples. All of our wood stains and finishes under the Varathane brand for Rust-Oleum are produced by our Wood Finishes Group. DayGlo, which is the world leader in fluorescent color, is also a really high performance and specialty producer of polymers, and they are providing tens of millions of dollars of polymers to other RPM companies. And it\u2019s not just providing announced production. It\u2019s collaborating with those companies for unique polymers. We have a specialty coatings business, who are not specialty coatings, specialty chemical business called Arnette Polymers that\u2019s part of Stonhard. Their growth has gone from $15 million to $30 million in terms of supplying multiple RPM companies, critical raw materials, chemical raw materials. And as you might imagine, we are investing heavily in that, given the supply chain challenges we have today. So, I can give you tons of examples, but we are measuring that a lot more concretely. We are finally having some really solid success in the introduction of the roof restoration coatings of Tremco through our Consumer Group channels into big boxes. We have mentioned that in the past. Unfortunately, our big kickoff introduction was in the spring of \u201820, so it was disrupted by COVID, post-COVID that is taking off. And so the potential for our Construction Products Group\u2019s roof restoration coatings, sealants and concrete repair products into our Consumer Group, strong home center customers in the coming years, I think, could be hundreds of millions of dollars. And so this is an area that we have spent a lot of time talking about and focusing on and now measuring that\u2019s going to produce some really good results for us in the coming years.\nLuke Washer: Sounds good, Frank. And I wanted to touch a little bit on your MAP 2.0 program. I know you are going to be talking about that a little bit later, it sounds like. But is this really going to be an initiative to drive further margins to that 16% EBIT level that you have talked about or could we also see potential sales targets looking out to 2025? And as you look at the MAP 2.0 program, are there less specific lessons that you learned from the original MAP program that you are looking to take to the MAP 2.0, any kind of examples of the learnings that you have had from the original program?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So, in the MS 168 or manufacturing area, COVID disrupted our ability to take these continuous improvement initiatives into our small and medium plants. And so there is certainly tens of millions of dollars of benefits that we were not able to get to that we would get to going forward. There is a whole another level of indirect spend that our procurement activities, which have been highly successful, have not gotten to. So, that\u2019s an area for us. And then there are a number of areas on the revenue side, and that will be much more a part of MAP to Growth 2.0, where we have some opportunities to really spend with big growth. We have our capital industrial business, which has got some exciting opportunities in ag chemicals. Our Mantrose business is working on a product called VerdeCoat. It\u2019s patented, and it is a coating for paper and cardboard that would allow for use in various food packaging, and including temporary food packaging like the plastic clamshells that we have been all using for the last 2 years, that both serves its purpose of temporary packaging relative to fats or other food items, but is also completely compostable or biodegradable. So, there are a number of exciting areas for us, particularly in our Specialty Products Group that we will talk about in more detail in MAP to Growth 2.0.\nLuke Washer: Thank you, Frank.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Spector from UBS. Your line is now open.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning Josh.\nJosh Spector: Hi, good morning Frank, congrats. Good morning everyone. Just on Construction within EMEA in particular and your illbruck brand, just wondering if you can give some thoughts on where you are there versus 2019 and how things are developing currently versus the last quarter?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. Under the leadership of Melissa Schoger and she reports to Paul Hoogenboom, we have made great progress. And we took a collection of relatively independent and decentralized businesses that were under scale. We had tried our businesses there. We had illbruck. We had different Tremco businesses there, Flowcrete. And now they are all operating as the Tremco Construction Products Group in Europe. We have integrated back office functions. We have coordinated, in some cases, consolidated sales forces. And we really have created greater efficiency, greater focus and in some cases, better scale. And that\u2019s an area where we went from mid-single digit EBIT margins to low-double digit EBIT margins and there is more to come. And so, I appreciate that question, because it was really an area that was decentralized and to a certain extent, unfocused. And our Construction Products Group leadership team has brought real focus and discipline to that. And we are in a much better position to drive solid bottom line growth with top line performance. So, we made a lot of strides there.\nJosh Spector: Yes. Thanks. Appreciate that, Frank. I guess what I was trying to go with that was more from a volume perspective and trying to understand if there is room for further recovery there, perhaps than what you have seen in North America and the rest of the segment or would you say things are generally similar regionally?\nFrank Sullivan: No. There is clearly room for growth. This is our experience and it\u2019s also in the headlines. The United States is leading the economic recovery and the solid demand we are seeing that\u2019s high-single digit, low-double digits is \u2013 and you see it in our fourth quarter organic growth, is principally U.S. driven. I would say Europe, because of some resurgence in COVID is probably three months to six months behind the United States. The rest of the world that we operate in, quite candidly, is a pretty good mess and the results that our people are generating, is pretty incredible. And I say that about Latin America, we have a big operation in Brazil. We are in Colombia. We are in Mexico. But COVID is still a rising challenge there. We have an African and Middle East business that\u2019s run out of South Africa by a great team. And they performed extraordinarily well, although COVID continues to be an issue in that market. And then we are not a big player in Asia-Pacific, but our largest presence there is in India. And again, they also have their COVID challenges. So, unless things turnaround there, I would say that, that rest of the world is probably a year behind where we are in the U.S.\nJosh Spector: Got it. Thank you.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning.\nJeff Zekauskas: Hi, good morning. Thanks very much. You use the FIFO accounting. So, if it turns out that your raw material costs didn\u2019t rise after the end of your May quarter, and I know they did, but if they didn\u2019t, how long would it take until you were reflecting that level of raw material costs? In other words, how long is the LIFO FIFO delay?\nFrank Sullivan: So, I think the LIFO FIFO delay versus our peers is probably 60 days or 90 days. And we are on FIFO because somebody, about 7 years ago, decided to be on FIFO and then accounting regulations disallowed a change to LIFO. So, we are where we are and don\u2019t have that flexibility of changing. But the delay versus our peers is about 60 days to 90 days.\nJeff Zekauskas: Okay. And do you guys \u2013 and in your negotiations with the large big boxes, in your commentary, it sounds like you negotiate prices once a year. Is that true? And are you trying to have a different kind of negotiation with them or do you have to wait until next year comes before you can effectively lift them with the big box?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes. We had price negotiations and price increases that averaged in the 5% to 6% range with most of our consumer customers, in fact, with all of our Consumer customers in the spring. And as Rusty commented, our raw material situation has escalated rapidly and further from there, and we intend to have price negotiation discussions with all of our Consumer customers at the end of the summer or early fall.\nJeff Zekauskas: Okay, great. And then lastly, do you quantify what your FIFO benefit is relative to LIFO for 2021 and for the May quarter?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes. I don\u2019t think there is a \u2013 I think there is a LIFO reserve that people on LIFO get to talk about, there is no FIFO benefit.\nJeff Zekauskas: Okay. Thank you very much.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Mike Harrison from Seaport Research.\nMike Harrison: Hi, good morning. In Specialty, Frank, you called out the strong results. You mentioned some recent changes in management and business development initiatives. Can you give a little more detail on what\u2019s going right in that business? And maybe talk about your confidence level that we are seeing sustained improvements in that Specialty business.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. First of all, Ronnie Holman, who has been part of RPM, he was \u2013 ran the lab at our Chemical Coatings business in Hickory, North Carolina 30 years ago and he has been with RPM ever since. He is running that division, succeeds Steve Knoop and has done a great job. Those businesses were relatively starved of growth capital because many of them were part of the SPHC bankruptcy process to address the Bondex asbestos issue that\u2019s behind us. And so, two things have happened under Ronnie\u2019s leadership. Number one, we changed operating company leadership in a lot of places. In the last 2 years, we have a new leader at DayGlo, a new leader at our TCI Powder Coatings business. We have a long-serving leader at our Mantrose Food Group that retired and have a new leader there. And so there has been a significant number of leadership changes really to get those organizations revitalized. We talked about our MAP to Growth program and somebody earlier had asked about MAP to Growth 2.0 and an emphasis on sales and I think that\u2019s very perceptive. As part of our MAP to Growth, we added work with McKinsey, specifically at three different Specialty Products Group companies; our DayGlo business, our Mantrose business and our top coat industrial business. And I laughed with our Board, if my father, God bless them, heard me tell our Board that we hired McKinsey & Company or Oliver Wyman or any of these other good consulting firms to work on growth strategy with our businesses, he would be rolling over in his grave. But we are. And the combination of new leaders and some outside perspective and some views of the markets and the opportunities that are beyond what we have the resources to do here, have us on track for some very, very exciting growth in those businesses. And what spurred that, and I have said it in the past is, these are businesses with opportunities literally to double or triple their sales. And if we can\u2019t get on that path, we would consider their divestment. So right now, we are in a good place there and we are very excited about what we see. And the leaders in those businesses are really generating positive momentum and we will talk more in detail about that when we reveal MAP to Growth 2.0.\nMike Harrison: Alright. And then maybe a question for Rusty, you mentioned the non-operating segment was elevated due to the insurance costs and higher incentive comp. Looking forward into fiscal \u201822, is something in the $25 million to $30 million per quarter range a good placeholder for non-operating costs, any guidance for that segment?\nRusty Gordon: Yes, you are in the right range, Mike.\nMike Harrison: Alright. Thanks very much.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Mr. Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nArun Viswanathan: Hi Frank. Thanks for taking my question here. I guess I wanted to get your thoughts and your perspectives. So, you have obviously incurred a lot of raw material inflation. We have been hearing that from a number of folks. Maybe if you go across your different segments, just could I get your thoughts on how your suppliers, your partners, your customers are dealing with the material inflation as well? You don\u2019t get the sense that a lot of it is being placed upon you, or do you feel any support from your partners here to shoulder some of this pain or is it being placed squarely on the coatings companies? And I guess I am just curious, especially in the Consumer segment, where again, you are doing a lot to meet demand. So, I am just wondering what kind of sharing you are getting on some of these raw material increases? Thanks.\nFrank Sullivan: Yes. Thank you. I think many of our suppliers are working double time to get their own production back in order. And it\u2019s particularly related to the U.S. chemical supply and the impact of this Texas winter storm and then the power outages had, and that\u2019s disrupted things. The other thing that was far more disruptive than I think people realized until winter storm Uri happened was how underinvested or offline in the chemical industry in many supply bases around the globe relative to COVID and actions people took in COVID. People are also waking up to the fact that China controls the vast majority of shipping containers. Those have gone through the roof. You\u2019ve got port problems in China and Long Beach, California. So when materials get from Asia to Long Beach, they can sit for 3 or 4 weeks before they\u2019re offloaded. So I could go on and on. We have had suppliers that have been over backwards. Two other comments on that, clearly, epoxy resins, a huge raw material for us, is up significantly in terms of costs. Acrylic resins were up. All kinds of primary raw materials are up in terms of price. But the things that are disrupting us the most are like the critical ingredients to some of those. I talked about alkyd resins, a very important chemical raw material for our Consumer Group and particularly small project paints. Penta is an ingredient to that. It\u2019s in short supply globally. And so that\u2019s a challenge for anybody producing alkyd resins. And then sadly, as I commented earlier, there was an explosion at a alkyd resin producer in Ohio, and it ended up in a real tragic circumstance. That one supplier supplied roughly 30% of the alkyd resins in North America, they are offline. And so we have had to work hard to replace them. We have worked with them. So, the level of cooperation and work within the supply chain, I think, is better than you would expect, given all these disruptions. And we are working overtime both in terms of expanding additional opportunities. So, we are supplying some raws from Europe and from Asia that were traditionally supplied in the United States. We are expanding some of our own chemical \u2013 specialty chemical capabilities and the responses that we have, I don\u2019t think, are unique to RPM in this circumstance.\nArun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks. And just as a quick follow-up then. If you consider that potentially there are some capacity additions coming that would help maybe some of the supply chain tightness loosens up as well, how are you \u2013 how should we assume kind of the upper-teens raw material increases kind of progress from here? Do you expect that to kind of moderate in a ratable fashion, say, over the next four quarters? When do you expect your pricing to catch up to the raw materials inflation that you have experienced?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I will tell you the two things that we think about here as we think about that. I think we feel like we are kind of in the teeth of the worst part of it now, and that we should be working our way out of these challenges in the coming months and the coming quarters. The things that we worry about, the principal thing that we worry about, which would be unique to RPM is the chemical industry rebooting, rebuilding in North America is happening and it\u2019s happening at a pretty good pace. But our chemical supply base is pretty much Gulf Coast and Texas positioned in North America, and a major hurricane that further disrupted that area could put everybody way back on their heels. And so we don\u2019t predict the weather. I am just telling you relative to, I think, what\u2019s a very perceptive question. On the one hand, it feels like we are in the worst of it and it\u2019s starting to get better. On the other hand, as we look forward, we ask ourselves, \u201cAlright, what are the things that we need to be prepared for and how can we be prepared?\u201d And that\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s on people\u2019s mind.\nArun Viswanathan: Thanks a lot.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: There are no questions at this time. Please continue.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you for your participation on our call today. I particularly want to thank our associates who found ways to grow our businesses throughout the last 1.5 years through COVID and now through these supply chain difficulties and all along, successfully executing on our MAP to Growth operating improvement program. We look forward to providing you the details of our first quarter results when we meet in October. We also plan to have the RPM Annual Meeting of Stockholders during the first week of October in person, which will be the first time in nearly 2 years. And we remain grateful for your interest and investment in RPM. Thank you, and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Presenters, please standby for the post conference.",

            "name": "Matt Ratajczak",
            "content": "Thanks, Frank and good morning everyone. Please keep in mind that my comments will be on an as-adjusted basis. For the fourth quarter, we generated consolidated net sales of $1.74 billion, an increase of 19.6% compared to the $1.46 billion reported in the year ago period. Sales growth was 13.9% organic, 2.2% as a result of recent acquisitions and 3.5% due to foreign currency translation tailwinds. We are very pleased with this strong top line growth in light of raw material shortages and supply chain disruptions. It has been challenging, but we have been managing these difficulties, thanks to our center-led procurement team, improved internal collaboration and leveraging of internal resources to get materials where they are most needed. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 13.3% to $1.28 compared to $1.13 in the fiscal 2020 fourth quarter. Our adjusted EBIT was $236.2 million compared to $213.6 million during the year ago period, which was an increase of 10.6%. Keep in mind that last year's fourth quarter was impacted by the pandemic's onset, which created the extraordinary situation where our non-operating segment reported a profit due to lower medical expenses, incentive reversals and other factors. On the other hand, during this year's fourth quarter, we experienced higher insurance costs due to business interruptions created by hurricanes and the winter storm Uri as well as higher incentives tied to improved performance. If you exclude the impact of our non-operating segment from both years, our four operating segments combined generated impressive sales growth of 19.6% and adjusted EBIT growth of 27.5% as they overcame margin pressures and supply availability challenges. Turning now to our segment performance for the quarter, our Construction Products Group generated record results. Construction, maintenance and repair activity accelerated in the U.S. during the quarter and even more so in international markets. Construction Products Group net sales were a record $629.4 million during the fiscal 2021 fourth quarter, which was an increase of 33.2% compared to fiscal 2020 fourth quarter net sales of $472.4 million. Organic growth was 28.4% and foreign currency translation provided a tailwind of 4.8%. Leading the way for the segment were our businesses in North America that provided commercial roofing materials and concrete admixtures and repair products as well as our European businesses, all of which generated record sales. Demand for our Nudura insulated concrete forms remained at elevated levels due to the relatively low installed cost, in addition to the environmental and structural benefits as compared to traditional building methods. Adjusted EBIT was a record $110.4 million compared to adjusted EBIT of $77.3 million reported during the year ago period. This represents an increase of 42.7%. The bottom line was boosted by volume leveraging, savings from our MAP to Growth program and higher selling prices. Our Performance Coatings Group also benefited from the release of pent-up demand for the construction, maintenance and repair of structures in the U.S. and abroad, which has leveraged into strong financial results. The segment's net sales were $283.3 million during the fiscal 2021 fourth quarter, which was an increase of 20.5% compared to the $235.1 million reported a year ago. Organic sales increased 12.9% and acquisitions contributed 2.9%. Foreign currency translation increased sales by 4.7%. This segment had been particularly challenged through the pandemic because of its greater exposure to international markets and the oil and gas industry as well as a greater reliance on facility access to apply its products. Points of strength in the Performance Coatings Group were its businesses providing commercial flooring systems and North American bridge and highway products as well as recovery in its international businesses. Adjusted EBIT was $31 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to $23.7 million during the year ago period, representing an increase of 31.2%. Segment earnings increased due to higher sales volumes, the MAP to Growth program and pricing, which helped to offset raw material inflation. Our Consumer Group reported record net sales of $628.9 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, an increase of 2% compared to net sales of $616.2 million reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Organic sales decreased 3.8% since this was the first quarter in which we comped against the surge in demand at the beginning of the pandemic. Acquisitions contributed 3.8% to sales. Foreign currency translation increased sales by 2%. During the first three quarters of this fiscal year, our Consumer Group sales and earnings have grown rapidly as it served the extraordinary demand for DIY home improvement products by consumers who were homebound during the pandemic. As more Americans became vaccinated and were no longer confined to their homes, DIY home improvement activity began to slow from its torrid pace during the quarter, though the pace of sales remained higher than the pre-pandemic levels. In international markets, many of which still have stay-at-home orders in place, they remain quite strong. Fiscal 2021 fourth quarter adjusted EBIT was $93.6 million, a decrease of 10.4% compared to adjusted EBIT of $104.5 million reported during the prior year period. Helping to partially offset the cost pressures were selling price increases and savings from our MAP to Growth program, some of which were invested in advertising programs to promote new products. The Specialty Products Group reported record net sales of $202.8 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, which increased 49.9% compared to net sales of $135.2 million in the fiscal 2020 fourth quarter. Organic sales increased 46.2%, while acquisitions contributed 0.7% to sales and foreign currency translation increased sales by 3%. For the second quarter in a row, our Specialty Products Group generated the highest organic growth among our four operating segments. Its results have improved sequentially over the past three quarters, with excellent top and bottom line results by nearly all of its businesses, including those providing coatings for recreational watercraft, OEM equipment, wood, food and pharmaceuticals as well as cleaning and restoration equipment and chemicals. Adjusted EBIT was a record $36.3 million in the fiscal 2021 fourth quarter, an increase of 395% compared to adjusted EBIT of $7.3 million in the prior year period. Its record results were driven by recent management changes, increased business development initiatives and improving market conditions. Lastly, I have a few comments in our liquidity. Our fiscal 2021 cash flow from operations, as Frank mentioned, was a record $766.2 million compared to last year's record of $549.9 million. This is primarily due to continued good working capital management and margin improvement initiatives from our MAP to Growth program. At year end, our total liquidity was $1.46 billion and included $246.7 million of cash and $1.21 billion in committed available credit. Our net leverage ratio, as calculated under our bank agreements, was 2.17 as of May 31, 2021. This was an improvement as compared to 2.89 a year ago. With a healthy balance sheet, we continue to use some of our record cash flow to reduce debt. Total debt at the end of fiscal 2021 was $2.38 billion compared to $2.54 billion a year ago. And as Frank mentioned, we are also investing more aggressively in growth initiatives, including advertising, operating improvements and acquisitions, plus we are rewarding our shareholders through our cash dividend and our stock repurchase program. Since the beginning of the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 38 million of stock. I will now turn the call over to Rusty for comments on our outlook."

            "name": "Rusty Gordon",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt. As we discussed last quarter, various macroeconomic factors are creating inflationary and supply pressures on some of our product categories. As a result of the lag impact from our FIFO accounting methodology, we expect that our fiscal 2022 first half performance will be significantly impacted by inflation throughout our P&L, which is currently averaging in the upper teens. We are working to offset these increased costs with incremental MAP to Growth savings and commensurate selling price increases which we will continue to implement as necessary. More importantly, the limited availability of certain key raw material components is negatively impacting our ability to meet demand. Our most significant challenge for the first half of fiscal 2022 will be in our Consumer Group. Several factors are compressing margins in this segment. First, selling price negotiations took place last spring and material costs have rapidly risen further since then. Secondly, insufficient supply of raw materials, several of which are severely constrained due to trucking shortages or force majeure being declared by suppliers, has led to intermittent plant shutdowns and low productivity. Lastly, the Consumer Group has outsourced production in several cases to improve service levels at the expense of margins. To address these first half margin challenges, the Consumer Group is cutting costs and working with customers to secure additional price increases. We expect that our other three segments will successfully manage supply challenges to continue their robust top and bottom line momentum from the fourth quarter and carry it into the first half of fiscal 2022. Turning now to Q1 of fiscal 2022, we expect consolidated sales to increase in the low to mid single-digits compared to Q1 of fiscal 2021 when sales grew 9%, creating a difficult year-over-year comparison. Additionally, supply constraints have slowed production in some product categories. Despite these factors, our revenue growth is expected to continue in three of our four segments. We anticipate our Construction Products Group and Performance Coatings Group to generate sales increases in the high single or low double-digits. The Specialty Products Group is expected to generate double-digit sales increases. These sales projections assume that global economies continue to improve. Sales in our Consumer Group are expected to decline double-digits as it continues to experience difficult comparisons to the prior year when organic growth was up 34%. However, the Consumer Group's fiscal 2022 Q1 sales are expected to be above the pre-pandemic record, indicating that we have expanded the user base for our products since then. We expect our Q1 adjusted EBIT to grow in three of our four segments, with the exception again being our Consumer Group. Based on the anticipated decline in this one segment, our Q1 consolidated adjusted EBIT is expected to decrease 25% to 30% versus a difficult prior year comparison when adjusted EBIT in last year's first quarter was up nearly 40%. Moving to Q2 of fiscal 2022, we expect good performance again with the exception of the Consumer Group. As discussed earlier, the challenges in this segment are anticipated to result in a significant decline in adjusted EBIT against difficult prior year comparisons when sales were up 21% and adjusted EBIT was up 66%. We anticipate that the Q2 decline in consumer will be mostly offset by the combined EBIT growth in our three other segments, leading to consolidated adjusted EBIT being roughly flat versus another difficult prior year comparison when consolidated adjusted EBIT was up nearly 30%. After we work through the temporary supply chain challenges, we expect to emerge with the Consumer Group that has broader distribution and a larger user base than it had pre-pandemic. For our other three segments, good results are expected to continue due to recent strategic changes in our Specialty Products Group continuing to payoff and the catch-up of deferred maintenance driving additional business at our Construction Products Group and Performance Coatings Group. This concludes our formal comments and we will now be pleased to take your questions. Sure. That's a number of questions. I'll address working capital first. We had a great year on working capital. But really, the supply chain disruption had thrown a wrench in our efforts to reduce inventory. Right now, we're just trying to get our hands on inventory from any source we can so that we can meet customer demand. So that probably has stalled us during the supply chain challenge on inventory. On payables, we've done a great job and we continue to have our procurement team negotiate better terms and that should continue to help us. Sticking with cash flow. Looking ahead to fiscal \u201822, we are boosting our capital spending quite a bit to add capacity in a number of areas. We've talked a lot about Nudura. That's a product line that's growing by 50% to 100% each quarter, so we need capacity there, more in liquid applied roofing, which as you know, Vincent, has grown year after year for us. And also in our Consumer businesses, we continue to constantly build share year in, year out and we will need capacity there. As far as the MAP to Growth program goes, we will have the incremental benefits. There will be a few charges as we plan to close a few plants and further delayer management. Yes, you are in the right range, Mike."

            "content": "Thank you, Angelica. Good morning and welcome to the RPM International Inc. investor call for our fiscal 2021 fourth quarter and for the full year ended May 31, 2021. With me on today's call are Rusty Gordon, RPM's Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Matt Ratajczak, our Vice President of Global Tax and Treasury, who supports our Investor Relations activities. On today's call, I will provide details on the successful completion of our MAP to Growth operating improvement program. Matt will then review our fourth quarter results in some detail then Rusty will conclude with comments on our outlook for the first half of fiscal 2022. We will then be pleased to answer your questions. On our April investor call, we referenced rising inflation across our P&L at structurally high single-digits with some select spikes of 150% to 200%. Some on our call today thought that by now raw material costs and availability would have gotten better to the point of pressure from some customers to give back price. That was wrong in April and way wrong today. Raw material costs have increased to levels on average in the high-teens. More importantly, certain critical raw material shortages across our industry are negatively impacting our ability to produce and meet market demand. In Q4, this raw material availability cost us an estimated $100 million in revenue. It's likely to cost us more in Q1 and we anticipate having more raw material availability lost production days in Q1 this year than we had from the impact of COVID shutdowns in Q1 last year. These challenges notwithstanding, thanks to our successful MAP to Growth operating improvement program, we generated strong results for our 2021 fiscal year. Our full year consolidated sales increased 11% to $6.1 billion, our EBIT margin increased by 150 basis points, and adjusted EBIT was up 26.5%. Operating cash flow climbed nearly 40% to a record $766.2 million and our adjusted EBIT margin climbed to 12.8%, which was also a record. Our MAP to Growth program has been the principal driver of this strong financial performance. The successful execution of our MAP to Growth operating improvement plan, especially in light of the incredible disruptions caused by the COVID pandemic and more recently by unprecedented supply chain challenges, is a true testament to the dedication and resilience of the RPM associates worldwide. At the program's onset, we recognized that RPM had reached the point, where a center-led approach in selected areas of the business was required to take it to the next level of growth. In manufacturing, we formed a center-led team that has created a lasting culture of manufacturing excellence and continuous improvement disciplines across the organization. This team launched our MS-168 manufacturing system, which is allowing us to produce better products more quickly, more cost effectively and more sustainably. In addition, we reduced our global manufacturing footprint by 28 facilities, consolidating production to more strategically advantageous plants. Our original target was 31 plants, but consolidation efforts were slowed by the COVID pandemic. We expect to exceed the original target in the coming year. We also created a center-led procurement team that has consolidated material spending across our operating companies, negotiated improved payment terms with our supplier base and has helped us reduce working capital. These initiatives have created millions of dollars in cost savings. With stronger supplier partnerships, longer term contracts, we are in a much better position to secure necessary raw materials and control costs through the current raw material supply shortages than we would have been just 3 years ago. Additionally, we took significant steps to streamline many of our administrative functions. Through our financial realignment, we consolidated 46 accounting locations, improved controls, developed more effective and efficient accounting processes and reduced costs. Similar initiatives were undertaken in our IT infrastructure as we have migrated 75% of our organization to 1 of 4 group-level ERP platforms. Additionally, we have reduced the number of data centers we manage by shifting systems and hardware to the cloud and we are creating a number of platforms for centralized data-driven decision-making. Over the course of the 3-year MAP to Growth program, we have returned $1.1 billion of capital to shareholders through a combination of cash dividends and share repurchases. Aside from a significantly improved profit margin profile and stronger cash generation, as reflected in the cumulative total return generated by RPM, which has exceeded our peer group over the 3 years of the MAP to Growth program, the lasting legacy of our MAP to Growth operating improvement plan is the revolutionary change in how people work together at RPM. Our operating company leadership is managing today with a broader view of RPM as a whole, allowing us to better leverage resources. Another permanent change has been the operational disciplines we developed that will continue to generate improvements in profitability, cash flow and operating efficiency well into the future. Perhaps more significant has been our ability to maintain our unique entrepreneurial growth-oriented culture evidenced by the fact that our revenues continue to grow at or above industry averages throughout the MAP to Growth program. The real heroes behind the MAP to Growth success were our associates worldwide, particularly our frontline workers who kept our manufacturing and distribution centers operating during the COVID pandemic. We also owe a debt of gratitude to my good friend and one of RPM's great operating leaders, Steve Knoop, who is the architect of the MAP to Growth program and passed away prematurely in 2019. Additionally, I would like to recognize Mike Sullivan, Vice President of Operations and Chief Restructuring Officer; Tim Kinser, Vice President of Operations Procurement; and Gordy Hyde, Vice President of Operations, Manufacturing who successfully executed the program with an intense focus and strong leadership that were integral to delivering these results and instilling a permanent focus on operating efficiency and continuous improvement into our culture. While we have reached the 2020 MAP to Growth conclusion, there will be some runoff from the MAP to Growth program in fiscal \u201822, during which we expect to capture approximately $50 million in incremental savings. We will also be leveraging the lessons learned from this program to chart a course for 2025. Over the next 6 to 12 months, we will be working on a MAP 2.0 program in conjunction with our operating leaders. We remain fully committed to achieving our long-term goal of a 60% EBIT margin and we will be sharing more information about our progress for a new program in the coming quarters. I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Ratajczak, who will discuss our fourth quarter results in detail. Good morning, John. Sure. So in Q4, on average, based upon the timing of the effectiveness of various price increases that we negotiated this spring, the effect was about 3% in Q4. And we would expect or anticipate at this point that the effect of pricing in Q1 will be in the 5% to 6% range, and that's based upon price increases that are in effect at this point. And we are going forward with additional price increase activity in the next month across a lot of our different businesses. I think, we will report, obviously, in the Q1 results when we report those results in October. But we are pursuing additional price increases in Consumer in particular as well as other parts of RPM on top of what's already been enacted. Sure. Our Construction Products Group just completed its third consecutive year of strong sales growth, very strong EBIT margin improvement, and it's driven by market share gains, the introduction of new products and the integration of what were a collection of, very often, kind of independent operations, and you're going to see more to come. We entered the first quarter with really good momentum in our Construction Products Group, our Performance Coatings Group and our Specialty Products Group. Some of that momentum is being disrupted by the supply chain and really, raw material availability issues that Matt and Rusty referenced. We literally have had weeks of lost production days because of the lack of availability of certain critical elements. And were it not bad, you'd see stronger growth than we even project. So we are likely, in the Construction Products Group, to be up in the 9% to 12% range in terms of sales for the quarter and the demand is higher than that. And the good momentum that we've had for 3 years is continuing. You'll see, after Q1, a return to solid growth and margin enhancement in our three non-Consumer segments. Sure. We continue to have a pretty strong pipeline of kind of our typical small to medium acquisitions so we will pursue those and get them done where we can. We've commented in the past on larger transactions. And we are committed both to achieving the original MAP to Growth goal of a 16% EBIT margin and a return of capital between dividends and share repurchases of $1.5 billion through May 31, \u201821. Our total return of capital as measured in the MAP to Growth program was $1.1 billion, so a little short there. So we will balance those, but we've got a much stronger cash flow than we had 3 years ago to be able to have fun with that balance in terms of how we return capital to shareholders and continue to pursue growth. Thanks, John. Good morning, Frank. That's a great suggestion but we have not looked into that yet. But certainly, there is a nice connection there and go Guardians. Sure. So, some of them are specific to critical elements in our roof restoration coatings. And certain intermediate chemicals have been unavailable, which has caused us to shut down production for, in one case, as long as 5 days. And so we find ourselves in a number of these areas sourcing raw materials that were readily available in the United States that have been disrupted by this winter storm Uri, the power outages in Texas and the lack of investment that happened during COVID. And so we are now finding replacement products typically in Asia, sometimes at higher prices, obviously, a longer supply line because they got to show up on a boat. When they get to Long Beach, California, they can sit for 3 or 4 weeks because of disruptions there. Another element, again, this is in Construction Products, is on traditional reroofing projects, not a roof restoration but traditional black line and felts. I think it's no surprise to people that there is a shortage in foam. It's disrupting, for instance, seating in the furniture markets and in the automotive seating area. And it's also \u2013 finds itself into roofing where you can have all of your materials shipped and sitting outside of a school building or a hospital, waiting for foam board insulation, which is on back order in a lot of places. So those are a couple of instances in the more industrial side. On the consumer side, unfortunately, there was an accident at a major alkyd resin producer in the United States that represented almost 30% of alkyd resin production. That's a particularly critical raw material for our small project paints category and spray paints category in our Consumer business. Again, we're looking at qualifying replacement product from Asia and other areas, longer supply lines, higher costs. And so all of these are temporary but they are certainly temporarily causing a pretty big disruption in our Consumer business. I think that's part of our thinking. We've been successful in instituting price increases. We still have some MAP to Growth benefits. And I think the biggest challenge we're facing is the disruptions from materials. Again, I can go on for an hour of MPIs and Pentas and MMAs and you name it, I am a finance guy, not a chemist but I'm learning a lot about chemistry. And I think as we get into the second half, the momentum that we have in terms of product demand, market demand, the benefits from our MAP to Growth program will certainly serve us well. The other comment I'd like to make is while we're going to have a very difficult period in our Consumer segment for the reasons we talked about in Q1 and Q2, our current estimate is on the top line, we will be about 12% ahead in Consumer in the first half of where we were 2 years ago in our fiscal \u201820 first half. So a 2-year over the pandemic expansion of 12% would indicate that we have expanded our customer base. We're excited about that. And some of these things are \u2013 they are temporary but I don't envision them being corrected until we get into the winter months or early spring of next year. Thank you. Good morning, Rosemarie. No, I think we need \u2013 yes. No, I think that's a good question. And I think we need to solidify where we are in this supply chain environment certainly before we bring out publicly details of a MAP 2.0. But we have made significant strides, in particular, in our Construction Products Group and in our Consumer Group, such that I think we have the talent and the capabilities to integrate a larger transaction if one were to be available at the right price. And obviously, at today's prices, if you don't have the ability to drive synergies, you can't be competitive. And so in those two areas, I think we're getting there. But solidifying the supply chain challenges now is going to be important for everybody in terms of \u2013 you can talk about long-term goals, but the ground is shifting a little bit, and it's going to shift for a couple of quarters until the supply chain issue become more clear. I don't know that we will have the same comparison issues internationally that we have in the U.S., in part because of market share. We tend to be the leader in every one of the categories that we operate in, in our Consumer segment in North America. And that is not true in the UK and Europe, which is our next biggest market and certainly not true in export markets like Latin America or in Asia. So we don't anticipate seeing the same year-over-year challenges in those markets because of our smaller market share and also because of the smaller sizes. The real challenge will be, again, on the raw material side and the cost side. I think we're pretty comfortable with when we finish the year, we will be substantially ahead in terms of sales and unit volume where we were 2 years ago pre pandemic and just need to work on the product availability and cost sides. Thank you. Good morning, Ghansham. Sure. Our estimate across RPM is probably for another $100 million of lost revenue, and it's predominantly in Construction Products and Consumer. As I commented earlier, material outages, components of construction products or roofing projects are kind of impeding opportunities for sales that are in the market. Certainly, that's true based on our momentum and what we've accomplished and that's continuing. It's also true based on incredible stimulus cities, counties, states have got billions of dollars and a lot of it's being applied towards infrastructure and renovation in school buildings in areas where we're very strong. On the consumer side, it's pretty much the same thing. We have lower-than-anticipated or expected fill rates principally as a result of this alkyd resin disruption and we're working hard to meet that. And so that's part of the cost issue. Our principal goal here is to meet demand, quite candidly, at whatever additional cost we need to in the interim. And then we will get out of tolling. I believe our North American chemical supply chain will return, and you'll see a significant improvement in our cost structure when those things happen. I think that will hit probably by mid Q2. We are working on additional price increases in a number of places, not just Consumer for the end of August or September. Thank you. Good morning, Andrews. It's based upon the forecast that we've done internally for Q1 and Q2. And a big part of that, as we've already talked about in the call, is not just a function of demand but a function of what we think we can supply. And so clearly, it would be stronger if we weren't facing the supply disruptions. But we regularly do a rolling two-quarter forecast with our Board. And based on with our Board and based on that forecast, that's what's driving that assumption. Good morning, Kevin. Sure. I don't have an exact number there, but I can tell you that the outsourcing, in some case, filling, in other cases, working on new resin suppliers and qualification of new suppliers and their formulas is costing us a couple of hundred basis points in gross margin. And those are margin points that we hope to regain, both with some of the investment Rusty's talking about and then eliminating some of this outsourced tolling both, in some cases, related to filling and, in other cases, related to resin manufacturing. And some of it will be, as I said, snapback of our traditional North American chemical supplier supply lines versus things that we're now procuring from Asia, which is a much longer lead time, more challenging freight costs. I don't know if these numbers right, but containers, which are principally controlled by China, used to be a couple of thousand bucks and now they are $20,000. I mean, the freight has been a big issue here as well and particularly for our Consumer group. Whether it's ocean freight, it wasn't a big thing that's become bigger and more expensive. Trucking. And so as I have commented in the last quarter and it's true today and you're hearing it from every industry, inflation is hitting pretty much every aspect of our P&L. Sure. Related to the comments that Rusty made about adding capacity, this year, it will be around $220 million. Thank you. Good morning, Michael. Hi, Richard. Yes. We will be growing EBIT in the first quarter in three of our four segments. We will be growing EBIT sufficiently in our construction products, Specialty Products and Performance Coatings, to more than offset the decline in EBIT we're expecting in Q2 in Consumer. And then we fully expect to see EBIT growth across all four of our segments in the second half of the year. And as Rusty said, that presumes continued strong demand. And the only thing we see that would interrupt that would be some issues with COVID because the demand across all our businesses is strong, and both the demand dynamics that we see, the new products that we have in line and the massive amount of stimulus in the United States all indicate that it will be a strong year and that it will be particularly strong as we get these supply chain challenges behind us. That's going to take a couple of quarters, though. Sure. I don't know that we provided how it would flow through the segments. It ought to flow around $10 million to $12 million a quarter throughout the fiscal year, relatively evenly except for the seasonal low third quarter. And MAP to Growth 2. 0 is something that we had targeted having put out an Investor Day in November of 2018 for something around that time frame. But given the massive disruptions of the supply chain challenges, I think \u2013 I know that our decision is to better solidify what's happening, have more certainty around our supply chains on a go-forward basis and then come out. So probably in the spring with some more details on what we think of as MAP to Growth 2.0 is something that we had targeted having put out an Investor Day in November of 2018 for something around that timeframe, given the massive disruptions of the supply chain challenges, I think \u2013 I know that our decision is to better solidify what's happening, more certainty around our supply chain is on a go forward basis and then come out. So, probably in the spring, give some more details on what we think of this MAP to Growth 2.0. Good morning Steve. Hi, Frank. Sure, that's a great question. So, a couple of things that we have changed and COVID helped to drive some of this, although MAP to Growth was getting us there. We have a much more often and more collaborative across our group communications than we have had in the past. And we are measuring what we call connections creating value that we have been talking about for 10 years and improving for 10 years, now very metrically across two categories. One is what's driving revenue growth in terms of technology transfer, channel sharing and/or leads from one division to another. And then the other area is on the cost side, where we have gotten much more efficient and cooperative in having one RPM company produce for another RPM company. Give you just a couple of quick examples. All of our wood stains and finishes under the Varathane brand for Rust-Oleum are produced by our Wood Finishes Group. DayGlo, which is the world leader in fluorescent color, is also a really high performance and specialty producer of polymers, and they are providing tens of millions of dollars of polymers to other RPM companies. And it's not just providing announced production. It's collaborating with those companies for unique polymers. We have a specialty coatings business, who are not specialty coatings, specialty chemical business called Arnette Polymers that's part of Stonhard. Their growth has gone from $15 million to $30 million in terms of supplying multiple RPM companies, critical raw materials, chemical raw materials. And as you might imagine, we are investing heavily in that, given the supply chain challenges we have today. So, I can give you tons of examples, but we are measuring that a lot more concretely. We are finally having some really solid success in the introduction of the roof restoration coatings of Tremco through our Consumer Group channels into big boxes. We have mentioned that in the past. Unfortunately, our big kickoff introduction was in the spring of \u201820, so it was disrupted by COVID, post-COVID that is taking off. And so the potential for our Construction Products Group's roof restoration coatings, sealants and concrete repair products into our Consumer Group, strong home center customers in the coming years, I think, could be hundreds of millions of dollars. And so this is an area that we have spent a lot of time talking about and focusing on and now measuring that's going to produce some really good results for us in the coming years. Sure. So, in the MS 168 or manufacturing area, COVID disrupted our ability to take these continuous improvement initiatives into our small and medium plants. And so there is certainly tens of millions of dollars of benefits that we were not able to get to that we would get to going forward. There is a whole another level of indirect spend that our procurement activities, which have been highly successful, have not gotten to. So, that's an area for us. And then there are a number of areas on the revenue side, and that will be much more a part of MAP to Growth 2.0, where we have some opportunities to really spend with big growth. We have our capital industrial business, which has got some exciting opportunities in ag chemicals. Our Mantrose business is working on a product called VerdeCoat. It's patented, and it is a coating for paper and cardboard that would allow for use in various food packaging, and including temporary food packaging like the plastic clamshells that we have been all using for the last 2 years, that both serves its purpose of temporary packaging relative to fats or other food items, but is also completely compostable or biodegradable. So, there are a number of exciting areas for us, particularly in our Specialty Products Group that we will talk about in more detail in MAP to Growth 2.0. Thank you. Good morning Josh. Sure. Under the leadership of Melissa Schoger and she reports to Paul Hoogenboom, we have made great progress. And we took a collection of relatively independent and decentralized businesses that were under scale. We had tried our businesses there. We had illbruck. We had different Tremco businesses there, Flowcrete. And now they are all operating as the Tremco Construction Products Group in Europe. We have integrated back office functions. We have coordinated, in some cases, consolidated sales forces. And we really have created greater efficiency, greater focus and in some cases, better scale. And that's an area where we went from mid-single digit EBIT margins to low-double digit EBIT margins and there is more to come. And so, I appreciate that question, because it was really an area that was decentralized and to a certain extent, unfocused. And our Construction Products Group leadership team has brought real focus and discipline to that. And we are in a much better position to drive solid bottom line growth with top line performance. So, we made a lot of strides there. No. There is clearly room for growth. This is our experience and it's also in the headlines. The United States is leading the economic recovery and the solid demand we are seeing that's high-single digit, low-double digits is \u2013 and you see it in our fourth quarter organic growth, is principally U.S. driven. I would say Europe, because of some resurgence in COVID is probably three months to six months behind the United States. The rest of the world that we operate in, quite candidly, is a pretty good mess and the results that our people are generating, is pretty incredible. And I say that about Latin America, we have a big operation in Brazil. We are in Colombia. We are in Mexico. But COVID is still a rising challenge there. We have an African and Middle East business that's run out of South Africa by a great team. And they performed extraordinarily well, although COVID continues to be an issue in that market. And then we are not a big player in Asia-Pacific, but our largest presence there is in India. And again, they also have their COVID challenges. So, unless things turnaround there, I would say that, that rest of the world is probably a year behind where we are in the U.S. Thank you. Good morning. So, I think the LIFO FIFO delay versus our peers is probably 60 days or 90 days. And we are on FIFO because somebody, about 7 years ago, decided to be on FIFO and then accounting regulations disallowed a change to LIFO. So, we are where we are and don't have that flexibility of changing. But the delay versus our peers is about 60 days to 90 days. Yes. We had price negotiations and price increases that averaged in the 5% to 6% range with most of our consumer customers, in fact, with all of our Consumer customers in the spring. And as Rusty commented, our raw material situation has escalated rapidly and further from there, and we intend to have price negotiation discussions with all of our Consumer customers at the end of the summer or early fall. Yes. I don't think there is a \u2013 I think there is a LIFO reserve that people on LIFO get to talk about, there is no FIFO benefit. Thank you. Sure. First of all, Ronnie Holman, who has been part of RPM, he was \u2013 ran the lab at our Chemical Coatings business in Hickory, North Carolina 30 years ago and he has been with RPM ever since. He is running that division, succeeds Steve Knoop and has done a great job. Those businesses were relatively starved of growth capital because many of them were part of the SPHC bankruptcy process to address the Bondex asbestos issue that's behind us. And so, two things have happened under Ronnie's leadership. Number one, we changed operating company leadership in a lot of places. In the last 2 years, we have a new leader at DayGlo, a new leader at our TCI Powder Coatings business. We have a long-serving leader at our Mantrose Food Group that retired and have a new leader there. And so there has been a significant number of leadership changes really to get those organizations revitalized. We talked about our MAP to Growth program and somebody earlier had asked about MAP to Growth 2.0 and an emphasis on sales and I think that's very perceptive. As part of our MAP to Growth, we added work with McKinsey, specifically at three different Specialty Products Group companies; our DayGlo business, our Mantrose business and our top coat industrial business. And I laughed with our Board, if my father, God bless them, heard me tell our Board that we hired McKinsey & Company or Oliver Wyman or any of these other good consulting firms to work on growth strategy with our businesses, he would be rolling over in his grave. But we are. And the combination of new leaders and some outside perspective and some views of the markets and the opportunities that are beyond what we have the resources to do here, have us on track for some very, very exciting growth in those businesses. And what spurred that, and I have said it in the past is, these are businesses with opportunities literally to double or triple their sales. And if we can't get on that path, we would consider their divestment. So right now, we are in a good place there and we are very excited about what we see. And the leaders in those businesses are really generating positive momentum and we will talk more in detail about that when we reveal MAP to Growth 2.0. Thank you. Yes. Thank you. I think many of our suppliers are working double time to get their own production back in order. And it's particularly related to the U.S. chemical supply and the impact of this Texas winter storm and then the power outages had, and that's disrupted things. The other thing that was far more disruptive than I think people realized until winter storm Uri happened was how underinvested or offline in the chemical industry in many supply bases around the globe relative to COVID and actions people took in COVID. People are also waking up to the fact that China controls the vast majority of shipping containers. Those have gone through the roof. You've got port problems in China and Long Beach, California. So when materials get from Asia to Long Beach, they can sit for 3 or 4 weeks before they're offloaded. So I could go on and on. We have had suppliers that have been over backwards. Two other comments on that, clearly, epoxy resins, a huge raw material for us, is up significantly in terms of costs. Acrylic resins were up. All kinds of primary raw materials are up in terms of price. But the things that are disrupting us the most are like the critical ingredients to some of those. I talked about alkyd resins, a very important chemical raw material for our Consumer Group and particularly small project paints. Penta is an ingredient to that. It's in short supply globally. And so that's a challenge for anybody producing alkyd resins. And then sadly, as I commented earlier, there was an explosion at a alkyd resin producer in Ohio, and it ended up in a real tragic circumstance. That one supplier supplied roughly 30% of the alkyd resins in North America, they are offline. And so we have had to work hard to replace them. We have worked with them. So, the level of cooperation and work within the supply chain, I think, is better than you would expect, given all these disruptions. And we are working overtime both in terms of expanding additional opportunities. So, we are supplying some raws from Europe and from Asia that were traditionally supplied in the United States. We are expanding some of our own chemical \u2013 specialty chemical capabilities and the responses that we have, I don't think, are unique to RPM in this circumstance. Sure. I will tell you the two things that we think about here as we think about that. I think we feel like we are kind of in the teeth of the worst part of it now, and that we should be working our way out of these challenges in the coming months and the coming quarters. The things that we worry about, the principal thing that we worry about, which would be unique to RPM is the chemical industry rebooting, rebuilding in North America is happening and it's happening at a pretty good pace. But our chemical supply base is pretty much Gulf Coast and Texas positioned in North America, and a major hurricane that further disrupted that area could put everybody way back on their heels. And so we don't predict the weather. I am just telling you relative to, I think, what's a very perceptive question. On the one hand, it feels like we are in the worst of it and it's starting to get better. On the other hand, as we look forward, we ask ourselves, \u201cAlright, what are the things that we need to be prepared for and how can we be prepared?\u201d And that's one of the things that's on people's mind. Thank you. Thank you for your participation on our call today. I particularly want to thank our associates who found ways to grow our businesses throughout the last 1.5 years through COVID and now through these supply chain difficulties and all along, successfully executing on our MAP to Growth operating improvement program. We look forward to providing you the details of our first quarter results when we meet in October. We also plan to have the RPM Annual Meeting of Stockholders during the first week of October in person, which will be the first time in nearly 2 years. And we remain grateful for your interest and investment in RPM. Thank you, and have a great day."

[Operator Instructions] Please note that only financial analysts will be permitted to ask questions. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to RPM's Chairman and CEO, Mr. Frank Sullivan for opening remarks. Please go ahead, sir.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you, Michelle. Good morning, and welcome to the RPM International Inc. investor call for our fiscal 2021 third quarter ended February 28, 2021. Joining me on the call today are Rusty Gordon, RPM's Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Matt Ratajczak, our Vice President of Global Tax and Treasury, who is also supporting our Investor Relation activities. Before we begin, I would like to note that yesterday, I received my second COVID-19 vaccine shot. I have encouraged our associates to get vaccinated, and I recommend the same to everyone listening to this call. It's the only way we can all do our part to end the pandemic and return to normalcy and reinvigorate the global economy. I'll start today's call by summarizing the factors that drove our strong financial performance for the quarter and how we were able to overcome the disruption caused by the severe winter weather storm that hit the U.S. in February. I'll then discuss how we are utilizing our record cash from operations, and provide an update on our MAP to Growth operating improvement program. After that, I'll turn the call over to Matt, who will review our third quarter results in more detail. Rusty Gordon will conclude our formal remarks with the outlook for our fourth quarter. As you recall in mid-February, a severe winter storm blanketed nearly 75% of the U.S. in snow, which disrupted transportation, distribution, and supply chains. In anticipation of severe transportation gridlock, the potential of losing multiple shipping days in North America, which makes up 70% of our revenue, and the desire to maintain transparent communications with our investors, we lowered our third quarter guidance on February 18. The third quarter is our seasonally low quarter and historically generates only 5% to 10% of our annual earnings. So, the magnitude of relatively small changes in earnings becomes magnified. However, in the end, through the extraordinary measures of our associates as well as the fact that plants, distribution centers, and transportation network resumed operations more quickly than we anticipated, we were able to catch up and execute delivery of most of our customer orders in the final week of February, which enabled us to exceed our original third quarter sales and earnings guidance. For the quarter, we generated record consolidated sales, earnings, and cash from operations. Sales grew 8.1% with 4.9% being due to organic initiatives, 2.1% resulting from acquisitions and 1.1% as a result of favorable foreign exchange. Internationally, Europe and Canada showed good growth as well. Latin America showed growth in local currencies, but was flat when its results were translated back into U.S. dollars. Much like last quarter, three of our four operating segments generated solid sales growth and significant leverage to the EBIT line due to our MAP to Growth operating improvement program benefits, while being leveraged to the bottom line as we have done for the last eight quarters. This was particularly impressive given the supply chain challenges in typical comparison to last year's third quarter when our adjusted EBIT increased 304%. On a segment basis, our Specialty Products Group led the way with organic growth of 13.4% in the quarter, and produced a second consecutive quarter of double-digit top line and bottom line growth. Our Consumer Group also generated double-digit organic growth as it continued to benefit from strong DIY demand. The Construction Products Group again generated solid sales and significant EBIT growth in challenging market conditions by focusing on infrastructure, which encompasses about 15% of RPM's consolidated sales, and its strong performance in repair and renovation. Results in our Performance Coatings Group declined due to difficult conditions in its primary end markets. Matt Ratajczak will cover the segment results in more detail in a minute. We continue to prove why RPM is the best home for entrepreneurial businesses in our industry with two acquisitions in March. These include the Tuff Coat line of rubberized non-stick coatings used for aquatic applications, which is a great strategic fit with our Recreational Marine Products Group; and Bison Innovative Products, a manufacturer of raised flooring systems that will operate as part of our Fibergrate business. We have taken a more collaborative view of our manufacturing footprint as we add capacity. For example, to meet the consumer segment's explosive growth for its products, we are installing packaging and blending equipment at plants in our performance coatings and specialty products groups. This is an addition to capital spending in our consumer segment facilities, which includes new filling capacity for consumer group plants with particular emphasis on meeting the increased demand for small project paints, caulks and sealants in our repair categories. Other investments in our operations include new presses and injection molding equipment to meet surging orders for our Nudura ICF products and wall systems, and the construction of a new liquid applied roof coatings plant. I now like to discuss our MAP to Growth restructuring program, which continues to pay dividends. During the quarter, and so far in the fourth quarter, we announced the closure of two plants, which brings our total to 27 of the 31 plants that we originally targeted for consolidation at the beginning of the MAP to Growth Program. As discussed last quarter, we continue to be more efficient in utilizing our manufacturing assets to generate cost-saving opportunities. The benefits of our center-led procurement initiatives are becoming even more evident in the current inflationary raw material environment. Rusty Gordon will provide more color on this when he walks through our fourth quarter outlook. Lastly, in the G&A area, we continue to consolidate IT systems and accounting and finance operations. At the end of our fiscal year, May 31, 2021, we expect to exceed the original MAP to Growth programs planned run rate of $290 million in annualized savings. The program's learnings of continuous improvement in efficiency have become ingrained in our culture, and we will continue to add to our robust pipeline of cost savings initiatives and operational improvements. As we sustain the efficiency gains achieved through MAP to Growth, we are now shifting more focus and resources towards top line growth through internal investments and acquisitions. Our goal is to return to the exceptional revenue growth rates that have been one of the hallmarks of RPM success since its founding in 1947. I will now turn the call over to Matt Ratajczak for a detailed review of our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2021.\nMatt Ratajczak: Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. Note that my comments will be on an as adjusted basis. During the third quarter, we generated consolidated net sales of $1.27 billion, an increase of 8.1%, compared to the $1.17 billion reported during the same quarter of fiscal 2020. As Frank mentioned, organic sales growth was 4.9%, or $58 million. Acquisitions contributed 2.1% of sales, or $24.5 million. Our foreign exchange was a tailwind that increased sales by 1.1%, or $12.9 million. This was strong top line growth during the third quarter, which typically generates our most modest results each year because it falls during the winter months when painting and construction activity is slow. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.38, an increase of 65.2% compared to $0.23 in the year-ago quarter. Our consolidated adjusted EBIT was up 32.2% to $79.9 million, compared to $60.5 million reported in the fiscal 2020 third quarter. These excellent results were largely due to initiatives under our MAP to Growth restructuring program and our ability to leverage higher sales to the bottom line. Turning now to our segments. Sales in our Construction Products Group were strong, and increased 6.4% to $396 million. Growth was primarily organic at 5.4% or $20.3 million. Foreign currency translation increased sales by 1% or $3.6 million. With softness in commercial and institutional construction markets, our Construction Products Group remained focused on renovation and restoration projects, leading to solid sales growth during the quarter. Our roofing business performed well as did our Nudura Insulated Concrete forms, or ICS, which are experiencing accelerated long-term adoption as a wall system, as the lumber supply is tightened and prices have skyrocketed. The ICS also provide the benefits of improved energy efficiency and structural integrity. Adjusted EBIT in the Construction Products Group increased 206.4% to $18.5 million from $6 million during last year's third quarter. The group generated 310 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin growth due to MAP to Growth savings and the favorable leverage of sales volume increases. The segment\u2019s European businesses continue to improve as a result of ongoing restructuring and better product mix. During the quarter, challenging market trends persisted for our Performance Coatings Group, including weak energy demand that impacted industrial coatings and COVID-19 protocols that continue to restrict access to facilities for flooring system installations. Sales in this segment were $226.5 million and 11.4% decrease from the $255.7 million reported during last year's third quarter. Organic sales decreased 12.7%, or $32.4 million. Foreign exchange provided a tailwind of 1.3%, or $3.2 million. Segment adjusted EBIT decreased 41.6% to $14.1 million from $24.2 million during last year's third quarter. Lower sales volumes and pricing pressures resulted in earnings de-leveraging which was offset in part by discretionary cost cuts and MAP to Growth savings. As vaccines are administered and the impact of the pandemic diminishes, we expect the segment to rebound as its industrial customers catch up on maintenance and energy markets recover in part due to increased travel. In the Consumer Group, sales were robust, increasing 19.8% to $477.7 million. Organic sales increased 12.7% or $50.4 million and acquisitions increased sales by 6.1% or $24.5 million. Foreign currency translation increased sales by 1% or $4.1 million. The Consumer Group continued to capitalize on the positive DIY Home Improvement market trend by leveraging its broad distribution in market leadership in caulks, sealants, cleaners, abrasives, and small project paints. Similar to the U.S., Segment's international results were equally robust in Europe and Canada. Adjusted EBIT in the Consumer Group was $47.8 million, an increase of 48.6% over the prior-year.  Adjusted EBIT margin improved as a result of MAP to Growth savings and the leveraging of higher sales volumes, which offset rising distribution expenses. Results in our Specialty Products Group were a record and improved dramatically for the second consecutive quarter. Fiscal 2021 third quarter net sales increased 14.7% to $169.2 million from $147.5 million in the fiscal 2020 third quarter. Organic sales growth was 13.4% driven by more aggressive business development efforts and growth investments initiated by new management as well as improving market conditions for many of its businesses. In particular, our restoration equipment business driven by extreme weather events North America experienced excellent top line growth, as did our businesses serving the furniture, outdoor recreational equipment, food, cleaning, disinfecting and OEM markets. Favorable foreign currency translation at 1.3% of sales, adjusted EBIT was $25.3 million during the quarter, an increase of 44.2% compared to adjusted EBIT of $17.5 million in last year's quarter. The Specialty Products Group was able to drive MAP to Growth savings and operating leverage from higher sales volumes to the bottom line. Next, a few comments on our liquidity; our year-to-date cash flow from operation improved by $270.7 million or 71% over the last fiscal year to a record of $651.9 million as a result of continued with better working capital management, where all components of working capital improved as compared to the prior year, and margin improvement from our MAP to Growth program. At the quarters end, our total equity was $1.4 billion. Our net leverage ratio has calculated under our bank agreements was 2.13 on February 28, 2021, which was a significant improvement as compared to 2.90 a year ago. Our balance sheet remains strong and we've strategically deployed a record cash flow to reduce debt. Simultaneously, we were completing acquisitions and making investments to improve the efficiency of our operations. Additionally, we repurchased approximately $24.6 million of stock during the quarter. I'll now turn the call over to Rusty for our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2021.\nRusty Gordon: Thanks, Matt. The fourth quarter is seasonally our strongest and started off well in March. However, several macro-economic factors are creating inflationary and supply pressures on some of our product categories. These factors include supplier refineries operating at lower levels due to low fuel demand. The disruption winter storm Uri caused on supply chains, intermittent supplier plants shut down in response to the pandemic and significant worldwide demand for packaging solvent and chemicals used in cleaning products. We expect that these increased costs will be reflected in our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and more significantly during fiscal 2022. We are moving aggressively to offset the increased costs with commensurate selling price increases. Fortunately, due to our MAP to Growth program, we are in much better position to weather these challenges than we were three years ago, when the last inflationary cycle occurred. With a stronger partnership with our supplier base and longer term contracts, we are working with our supplier partners to secure necessary raw materials and control costs to whatever extent possible. In addition, our improved center-led processes and systems are providing more timely and actionable information to address these challenges. We are also working in collaboration with customers through the supply chain difficulty. On a segment-by-segment basis, we are encouraged by the following: Number one, resumption of discussions on federal action on an infrastructure program, as well as municipal funding and the recent since federal COVID stimulus bill that should support building maintenance and major end markets of our construction products group. Number two, the resumption of travel and the recent rebound in energy markets give us optimism that are industrial protective coatings business in our performance coatings group may have bottomed out as they start to lap into easier comparisons. Number three, the increasing re-entry of home improvement professionals into the market as more consumers become vaccinated and welcome outside contractors back into their homes, which will benefit our consumer group; and number four, high demand in our specialty products group for its legend brands, restoration equipment and solutions, which resulted from the property damage caused by winter storm Uri. While it disrupted many of our other businesses, storm provided revenues for legend brands in February and the back the log of more orders in the fourth quarter as we help our customers respond to this natural disaster. As we look ahead to our fourth quarter and beyond, there is currently a great deal of volatility around input costs and uncertainty regarding material availability. While our third quarter earnings did not reflect recent material cost spikes due to our FIFO inventory methodology, inflation will likely be significant in our fourth quarter and into the first quarter of fiscal 2022. We have been, and are in the process of implementing appropriate price increases and changes in terms, which we anticipate will offset the inflationary impact by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2022. There is also much uncertainty related to the breath and speed at which global economies reopen as people become vaccinated. Based on the information available to us today, we expect our fiscal 2021 fourth quarter sales to increase by double digit compared to the fiscal 2020 fourth quarter. Last year's fourth quarter should prove to be an easier revenue comparison because it was heavily impacted by the onset of the pandemic. Our earnings comparison versus last year on the other hand will be more challenging because of raw material inflation as well as an extraordinary situation last year when our non-operating segment reported a profit due to lower travel and medical expenses, incentive reversals, and other factors. As a result, our fourth quarter adjusted EBIT is expected to increase double-digits coupled with the rate of sales growth. Excluding our non-operating segment, adjusted EBIT for our four operating segments in total is expected to increase by more than 20%. This concludes our formal comments. We will now be pleased to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research. Your line is open.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Frank.\nFrank Mitsch: Yes. Good morning, Frank as well, and congrats on your second shot. I hope the other folks in the room are making progress on that front as well. And appreciate the commentary, especially the interplay between raw materials and pricing, you are going to have it fully offset by end of the fiscal first quarter of 2022. I am just curious if you could offer kind of qualitative comments or quantitative comments in terms of what percent raw material inflation you think you are facing here in the fiscal fourth quarter and in the fiscal first quarter? How significant are these headwinds?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I think a couple of things are happening. Number one, we were seeing inflationary increases at the end of calendar 2020 and beginning of calendar 2021 that were structural. Those were impacted, as I think everyone on this phone knows or call knows, by the winter storm and its impact. We are seeing temporarily certain raw materials like epoxies that are more than double in cost what they were a year ago, that's true across a number of categories. And so, with that aside, we think that you are going to see inflation. In our markets, it's going to be high single digits. And I think an important thing for people to understand is that inflationary impact on us and in our market and our industry exists throughout the P&L. It's not just raw material cost, it's transportation cost of all types: rail, over-the-road, truck, ocean freight not a big issue for us, but ocean freight, and it's also labor cost. You are seeing higher labor cost in factories and distribution centers, and to a certain extent across the organization. Labor costs are particularly interesting over the last year. To a certain extent, we are competing with the government. In some of our distribution centers, we would have seasonal part-time workers decided that if they could get paid more by staying at home, they would. We had replaced many of those with full-time workforce that has a higher benefit expense. So, inflation, in total, is going to be mid to high single digits throughout the year, that's structural. That does not include some of the extraordinary spikes that resulted from the storm and they're throughout the P&L.\nFrank Mitsch: That's very helpful. So, you are replacing that throughout the year, but by the time you come within six months or less than six months, actually, your price increases will have more than -- will have fully offset that. That's how we will think about it, correct?\nFrank Sullivan: That's correct. We will see some gross margin deterioration in our fourth quarter, particularly in our consumer business. We will see gross margin deterioration in Q1. Again, in the consumer business, particularly which will be a combination of two things: one, cost price mix; and two, the fact that a consumer in Q1 will be rounding a first quarter performance last year, where organic growth is up 34%, and we do not expect to exceed that. But those are the big challenges that we see. And I think you'll see a return to gross margin improvement after Q1 with strong sales leverage and the continued benefits of MAP to Growth. We should see EBIT margin improvement modestly in Q4 at the operating levels, as Rusty said, and then continuing in fiscal 2021. I am sorry\u2026\nFrank Mitsch: Very helpful.\nFrank Sullivan: -- fiscal 2022.\nFrank Mitsch: 2022, yes, gotcha. That's very helpful. Thanks so much.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you, Frank.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Rosemarie Morbelli from G Research. Your line is open.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Rosemarie.\nRosemarie Morbelli: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and I got my second shot as well.\nFrank Sullivan: Congratulations.\nRosemarie Morbelli: Just [Multiple Speakers] ringing the bell. So, Frank, can you talk about the trends you are seeing at the big box and other retailer outlets as far as your consumer business is concerned? I mean, you mentioned the anticipated benefit from the increasing vaccination for performance products, but people on the other hand are going back to work. So, they will be less do-it-yourself. And is professional painters and others enough to affect a potential decline on the DIY in 2022?\nFrank Sullivan: So, in general, we are seeing still solid consumer takeaway across all of our consumer group customer base. But it's certainly down from what it was in the summer and the fall. In the summer and the fall, we were looking at 30% organic growth rates. Consumer takeaway in the third quarter was more in the low single-digit range, low teens. And we expect to start rounding much more difficult comparisons in April and May, and the first and second quarter of fiscal 2022. So, I would expect, as we indicated a minute ago, that we will see some gross margin challenges and quite candidly some very difficult comparisons in our consumer segment. Our results will be above what at the time of records in fiscal 2019. But in the first-half of next year and really starting in April and May, I would expect this to be flat to slightly down relative to the comparisons that we will be facing. The flipside is, as we sit here, we are starting to see positive sales and earnings contribution from our Performance Coatings Group, really the first positive results in the top and bottom line from those more industrial-focused businesses and industries that we\u2019ve seen in more than a year. And as you can see in our results, the Specialty Products Group is roaring and the Construction Products Group is roaring. And the dynamics of their underlying market suggest that that will continue for some time in both segments.\nRosemarie Morbelli: And Frank, you talked about going back to RPM historical revenue growth. Can you remind us of what the -- you have had a lot of acquisitions during that particular timeframe, so can you remind us what the organic growth was historically?\nFrank Sullivan: Well, historically, Rosemarie, and this goes back to the beginning of our MAP to Growth Program, we had a 15 or 20-year compounded annual growth rate of about 6%. I would say, about half of that was from acquisitions. But when you look at where we were after our last restructuring in 1999-2000 range, from 2003 for about a decade, our organic growth averaged about 5% or 6%, so very impressive numbers. And we think we are going to get back to that. In fact, we are back to that as we speak. And I will tell you, our fourth quarter, our current view is we expect revenue growth somewhere in the 15% to 20% range. And we - I think we are well-poised for good growth in fiscal 2022. And the underlying fiscal dynamics will support perhaps even stronger growth, although I think it remains to be seen what actually comes out of the Washington in terms of a big infrastructure build, and also when and how quickly Europe recovers. We're continuing to see some modest challenges in Europe with these COVID lockdowns across some of the major countries that we operate in, while the United States seems to be picking up and that pick up is gaining momentum.\nRosemarie Morbelli: And if I may, that Q4 -- just following up on one of your comments that Q4 revenue growth of 15% to 20%, how much is from FX and acquisition, how much organic do you anticipate?\nFrank Sullivan: I don't have that specific number, I would tell you in general less than a quarter of it is from price and the balance will be mostly from organic growth, I would guess if we looked in this quarter and acquisition activity yes 2%. So you would expect another 2% of impact from acquisitions I think in Q4, the balance of the organic growth.\nRosemarie Morbelli: Okay, thank you.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question will come from Ghansham Panjabi from Baird. Your line is open.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Ghansham.\nGhansham Panjabi: Good morning, Frank. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for fitting me in. So Frank, can you personally in your comments you talked about, just given the journey you've been on and not the growth being better equipped to handle the current raw material environment, can you just give us some more detail in terms of what exactly that means. And then also, how's your pricing strategy just broadly changed since the last inflation cycle, which was three years ago?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So I'll hit you, you're going to steal my concluding comments, Ghansham with that question, which is a good one. Our MAP to Growth program has fundamentally changed RPM. And it's not just about saving or achieving the $290 million in savings in fact, that May 31 '21 will be at a roughly $300 million run rate, and we expect $50 million of MAP savings to benefit incrementally fiscal '22. But it really has in a relatively short period of time, begun to ingrain continuous improvements of lean manufacturing disciplines into our manufacturing and operations and really into our D&A there. The work that our teams have done in procurement has been extraordinary. We went from a quiet collaboration to a centralized procurement activity, Mike Sullivan, who took over as Chief Restructuring Officer from Steve and Tim Kinser and Gordie Hyde and their teams have done extraordinary work. Then the other thing that has fundamentally transformed RPM is the work of Rusty Gordon, Scott Copeland, Lonny DiRusso, who is our IT Director, and his teams; we have developed systems for tracking savings and efficiency programs out of the MAP to Growth initiative, we have -- and so that is something we call MPST. We have adopted that, we started a year-ago, we got disrupted by COVID, but adopted it internal and corporate system to MAP Growth initiatives called the MPGT. We have a consolidated effort to look much more aggressively and much more proactively at cost price mix. So what we've been able to do in terms of utilizing information across RPM on a centralized basis, to communicate better share best practices, and really have more real time data in which to make decisions is dramatically different from what RPM was three years ago. And we expect to continue to build on that. The last comment I'll make is that we have the procurement effort has really established us as a good partner to some of our major raw material suppliers in ways that we were not before and we have substantially more and different raw materials under global contracts that we did three years ago and that has been very fortuitous, and how that has helped us in this challenging raw material cost increase environment. But at least as we speak now also the raw material and availability environment, time around the kind of the cultural change that we've affected in MAP to Growth which is I think in the long run, probably more important than the execution of achieving a particular efficiency number. And that concludes my prepared remarks.\nGhansham Panjabi: And also for my second question, going back to 3Q in your original guidance before you had that release 18th, construction came in well above, I think what you'd originally see. I know it's a small quarter. But can you just give us a sense as to where exactly the upside came from and what drove that specific with 3Q?\nFrank Sullivan: So I have commented before on this, Paul Hoogenboom who leads our Construction Products Group and his team are doing extraordinary work. And it's a combination of two things that kind of that came together at the right time. One is an effort to bring together and this started before MAP to Growth, our collection of Construction Products businesses, so Dryvit Nudura, different parts of Tremco, some of which operated relatively independently in our nuclear chemical business into a much more integrated, kind of holistic approach to the market. So while we call it the RPM Construction Products Group, they're going to market globally as the Tremco Construction Products Group and so that integration on the common IT platforms, we're getting some comment specification efforts is really paying big dividends. You overlay that with the benefits of MAP to Growth. And you're seeing a really good combination of market beating top line performance and leverage to the bottom line. And that's continuing to see continue in the fourth quarter. And boy, I would expect it to continue for the next couple of years. We have some more work to do. But the enthusiasm amongst our people in the Tremco Construction Products Group and the extraordinary work they're doing is just fantastic. And you can see in the marketplace. And the last comment I'll make is I ramble on here is, there's been a decided shift there towards more renovation as opposed to new construction, new construction is still probably 30% of the Construction Products Group if not more, but we've become more renovation focused, which has really served us well. Infrastructure spending, a big boom in construction activity will only serve to help accelerate the performance that we're seeing.\nGhansham Panjabi: Okay, perfect. Thanks, Frank, and congrats again on the vaccine.\nFrank Sullivan: Thanks, Ghansham.\nOperator: And your next question will come from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Steve.\nSteve Byrne: Good morning, Frank. So, you made a comment about as MAP to Growth is winding down, you're going to start shifting your investment internally. And I'm curious to hear your outlook for the key revenue growth drivers over these next couple of years. How would you rank the buckets, the potential share gains from cross selling, integrating the commercial efforts as one bucket, another one being growing more outside of the U.S. and the third one being M&A?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. And a great question in terms of where we're going and how we're thinking about growth. First of all, in our investor presentation, we outlined kind of what we think is the addressable markets globally for our four segments, and it comes up to about $134 billion, half of that relates to our Construction Products Group. So, given the comments I just made and the opportunities that we see there, I would expect that to be probably our fastest growing group, particularly in light of the extraordinary year which consumer has had. We're also in the early stages of cross-selling, if you will, between our Construction Products Group and our consumer group, particularly where there's an interest with some of our Big Box customers in some of the Construction Products Groups, waterproofing, roofing, coatings and sealant products, as well as concrete patch and repair products. So there're opportunities there. We have as part of MAP to Growth, this was not part of the original plan, but we add into it, brought in McKinsey to really help kick start growth in our Specialty Products Group. We had under invested in our Specialty Products Group for a long time in part because most of those businesses were part of the solution challenge. And so we're being managed for cash. And I think you're seeing the early results of both our focus on growth in those businesses in the Specialty Products Group and some leadership changes that we're in a position to talk about more over as they come to fruition, we get comfortable about what we want to disclose publicly. But and then lastly, we're better able to integrate bolt-on acquisitions than we ever have. Having said that, all of our bolt-on acquisition activity is really done with a focus on growth, how can we take a unique product line or a unique technology and leveraging it over our distribution on our sales forces? So, the combination is pretty exciting for us. And there's a pretty good M&A pipeline to end stock market value.\nSteve Byrne: And maybe just to drill in on one of those, Frank, the [indiscernible] Construction Products, are those contractors that do the renovation work, and you obviously have good relationships with them, how do you develop those in new regions and grow ex-U.S. or do you need acquisitions to give you some of a footprint in a new region that you can then grow relationships?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. That should start to pay-off us in Europe. A disparate collection of construction chemical businesses in the U.S., when you look at Europe between Flowcrete and Dryvit which is headquartered in Poland, our yield growth business and our Tremco business, they all operated independently. And under the leadership of Melissa Schoger who is doing a great job over the years been with us for quite a while and leads the Construction, Tremco Construction Products Group efforts in Europe, we have integrated those businesses, we're going to market more as Tremco Construction Products Group. And it's been a real fixer up job. And I think we're getting towards the end stages of the fixed part in terms of planning, consolidation, really getting people to see themselves as part of one Construction Products Group team. And then they'll quickly be able to shift to a focus on growth. Hopefully, we'll be lucky on the timing because Europe is certainly behind the United States relative to opening up an activity principally related to these recurring national shutdowns in some of our major markets, like Germany and France and Italy. We're actually doing pretty well in the U.K. And then outside of that, we've got really exciting growth in places like Europe and Asia, but it's on a very small basis. And so, acquisitions will certainly help us accelerate growth and establish a bigger presence in international markets.\nSteve Byrne: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question will come from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJeff Zekauskas: Thanks, Frank.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Jeff.\nJeff Zekauskas: Hi, by calculation to offset your raw material inflation, you'd need about a 3% increase and 3% is normally tough to get in the middle of a calendar year, in that things really readjust themselves at the beginning of the year. Is 3% roughly the right number, and is the reason that you're confident that you can achieve that is that customers really need a product. And so they're willing to be more flexible in pricing terms?\nFrank Sullivan: So I think that just to reflect the comments we made earlier, we anticipate structural changes in inflation in our markets throughout our P&L, there's going to be high single digits. And we have gone out with price increases that are in the 6% to 8% range. We went out, some of our businesses went out early in anticipation, these are industrial businesses and looking at the changes at the end of the calendar year and beginning of this new calendar year, with 3% to 5% price increases and as we sit here today, it goes on and off and they're going out again. And in certain categories, I mentioned epoxy; we've increased prices on certain of our product lines by 14%. That's in light of epoxy primer, which we think are temporary which have more than doubled. They'll certainly come down from their current highs, but they will be substantially higher than they were a year-ago and that from our perspective is a structural change in most all of our raw materials from acrylic resins to epoxy resins to all types of polymers and polyols. It's just been an extraordinary period of time in terms of spikes, but really in terms of inflation, corrugate, packaging, transportation costs all going up. And so, we'll have maybe better information in July in terms of where we are. And then the last comment I'll make to your question is, I think, both good and fortunate in our ability not to have to short and/or not be able to supply. We have continued work to do on working capital. We've been a heavy working capital company. We've generated in excess of 200 million of positive cash flow from improvements in working capital, but whether it was raw material or inventory, whether it was new contracts so far we've been able to manage through these circumstances I think pretty well.\nJeff Zekauskas: Okay. Then for my follow-up, do you think volumes and consumer products are going to grow in fiscal '22. Or do you think they're going to shrink or be flat or roughly how they say it?\nFrank Sullivan: As I accommodate earlier on the call, starting in April and May and certainly through the first and second quarter, we anticipate consumer volume flat or slightly down, we think it will be picking up in the second half of next year. And that's in light of -- for instance, a first quarter of fiscal '20 organic growth of 34%, which is a mountain we don't expect to beat in the first quarter of this year. We do have some market share gains. We do have some new product introductions to the extent that there is acquisition activity that could end up resulting in a year-over-year higher performance, but on an organic basis starting in April, I think we anticipate flat to slightly down results in our consumer segment on the top line and the bottom line.\nJeff Zekauskas: That seems a little more pessimistic than you were three months ago. Is that true or\u2026\nFrank Sullivan: No, it's not true. I think, yes, three months ago, anytime--first of all, we didn't talk too much about fiscal '22, but I can tell you we have made numerous references the fact that we were not going to top a 34% organic growth in the first quarter, and I believed it six months ago, and I believe it three months ago, I believe it today. And I wouldn't say we're pessimistic. We will be meaningfully above the record results of where we were in our consumer business in fiscal '19. And so there has been an expansion broadly of the market of more confident DIYers, and we're excited about that, but circumstantially starting in April and certainly through our first quarter, we'd expect to be flat or slightly down in our consumer business versus these extraordinary comparisons to last year.\nJeff Zekauskas: Thank you so much.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJohn McNulty: Yes. Good morning, Frank, and thanks for taking my question. So a question first on new door, it sounds like that business is kind of really turning the corner and some of it may have been on high lumber prices. I guess, from your perspective, is it a function of -- okay, you're cheaper now or more cost competitive against lumber, but if and when lumber eventually comes back down to earth, it give some of that back or is it more, \"Hey, look, you've gotten a lot of contractors, a lot more comfortable with it, and maybe this high lumber price has kind of facilitated that, but because of that it's resulted in a little bit more of a secular shift.\" And now with that greater comfort level you can kind of see the growth continue to emerge from that. How should we be thinking about that?\nFrank Sullivan: Very much, the latter, John, it was growing double digits before the lumber price issue, we are working on greater specifications. ICF with contractors is initially a challenging sell because for better, for worse and sometimes it helps us contractors, architects, engineers are hesitant to change from systems that work, and when we get people that convert to ICF, they love it. It is less labor-intensive, and in many instances it provides the most durable sidewall in the market today, bar none. And it's highly energy efficient. And so, we have been focusing efforts through our Tremco Construction Products Group again on an integrated basis, utilizing the sales force of 200 plus people in the Tremco waterproofing sealant business to really drive sales in Nudura. The lumber price situation was some added gravy to help accelerate that, but we're very excited about that and we're also excited about the ability to deliver a more integrated wall. Nudura independently was bought and part of drive it. Today, they're all part of our Tremco Construction Products Group. So our specifications around Nudura are not just for an ICF wall system. Therefore the Tremco sealants and all the joints therefore drive it or new brick or other siding that we're involved in. And so, the opportunity there is very, very exciting. It's mostly residential and the opportunity to drive it in white commercial institutional markets like schools is huge.\nJohn McNulty: That definitely makes sense. And then could you give us a little bit of color in terms of the M&A pipeline, it sounds like you've made a couple of opportunistic acquisitions just this past quarter. How should we be thinking about that going forward, because it does look like the Middle East, some of the pricing just starting to creep up at this point? How are you looking at the opportunities and the value of those opportunities as you're looking forward?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. The M&A pipeline is really strong. We commented that we completed two acquisitions just this past month, Bison, which is a great addition to our Fibergrate business and I think also has some applicability to other parts of RPM that's a patented floor leveling system that we can use with grading or other systems. And then, Tuff Coat, again a non-skid Marine product that is already getting some interest from other parts of RPM and industrial settings. So, we're very excited about both of those. You've got management teams to run those even though we'll be pulling them in to RMS168 manufacturing process, and our centralized procurement activities. So there's more of that out there in general in our space. There are a lot of bigger transactions out there and I'll just repeat what I've said in the past. I don't see us paying 15 or 16 times EBITDA for anything. And so to the extent that there's large transactions and people are willing to pay those relatively peak multiples in a period of time where their peak earnings that will not likely be RPM, but if there are some larger transactions that we can get done at what we believe to a reasonable multiple with a reasonable IRR, we certainly wouldn't preclude looking at him.\nJohn McNulty: Okay. Got it, makes sense. Thanks very much for the color.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: The question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nVincent Andrews: Good morning.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Vincent.\nVincent Andrews: Good morning, Frank. Just wanted to ask a couple of things, one, you mentioned COVID restrictions are still holding things back and performance coding, which is wondering now that Texas has pretty much opened up and Florida is pretty much opened up, big geography, when you look at your results in those states, are you seeing that with those restrictions lifted that performance of those underlying businesses is really snapping back and how does that compare into what you're seeing in places that are kind of halfway open and any thoughts there would be helpful?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure, I commented earlier on the call that as we sit here today in the spring, we're seeing positive results for the first time in a year on the top line and bottom line of those businesses. I think we'll have better color in July because the biggest reason is that we're starting to analyze really poor results. We've had our Carboline business in particular given their exposure to oil and gas and heavy industry 10%, 12% sales declines pretty consistently, Stonhard business and our foreign polymer flooring business has been flat to slightly down, their backlog is bigger than ever. And so we're very hopeful that you're going to see some nice robust growth there, but we'll have better color for you in July to really look back over three or four months and determine, how much of this is a pickup and demand and good robust organic growth versus how much of this is, \"Hey, we look great, because last year was terrible.\"\nVincent Andrews: Fair enough. I look forward to that. And just as a follow-up in Specialty Products you mentioned that, you did benefit from the weather disruption created some demand for you. Is that continuing given that Uri was in the middle of the last month of the quarter, is that continuing into the fiscal fourth quarter and from an order of magnitude perspective that's something that we really need to be thinking about when we model these quarters for our next fiscal year in terms of just having tough comps?\nFrank Sullivan: Well, I think it is continuing to the fourth quarter, and I think that's true of our Legend brands business, but we have new leadership in a number of places over the last two years. We've been really looking to drive growth. If you look at our marketing profile and how it's improving in Specialty Products in the last two quarters I think you'll see comparable improvement in Q4. That's in our Day-Glo for us in color and colorant business. It's in our MRT business, which is our marine coatings and some of the specialty products there. It's pretty exciting in terms of what the work we're doing there. And some of the leadership changes that we've affected is doing for that segment. So we'll have much tougher comps next year in Q3 and Q4 and legend brands, but I think Specialty Segment is poised for some pretty solid growth in the top and bottom line for the coming year.\nVincent Andrews: Okay, great. And congrats on that second shot.\nFrank Sullivan: Yes. Thank you. I encourage everybody to go get theirs.\nOperator: The next question will come from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research. Your line is open.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Kevin.\nKevin McCarthy: Good morning. How are you?\nFrank Sullivan: Fine.\nKevin McCarthy: Frank, in Washington, D.C., I imagine there'll be a lot of conversations and perhaps some horses traded before we know what a infrastructure bill could really look like. But that said, I'm tempted to ask two things. A, what were your preliminary thoughts on the bill as it was unveiled? And then B, to the extent we might have a little bit better visibility at this juncture. Is there anything you feel that you would be doing differently in terms of capital allocation or operating strategy ahead of such substantial fiscal stimulus?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. Without being too much of a politician, I think we're going to have an infrastructure bill. I'm hopeful that it'll be more bipartisan than the -- in the most recent COVID bill. And I say that because of, it's more bipartisan, whether it's larger or smaller, it will be more focused on bridges and highways and airports and poor facilities and the things that will drive our business. And so I do think we'll be a beneficiary of that, and I think whatever benefit comes out of that will be in addition to the growth that we're experiencing in our construction products group now.\nKevin McCarthy: Okay. Then second a bit more of a housekeeping question, but as it relates to winter storm Uri you talked about catching up in the final week of February. You also talked about some benefits flowing through into your Legend brands business. And if we kind of roll up all the puts and takes was, was Uri a material positive or negative in February and what do you think the answer to that question would be for March as well?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. Certainly for our legend brands business, it was a positive in terms of driving their air handling equipment, dehumidification equipment and stuff that they work with all their major customers in helping homeowners in light commercial, recover from storms like this. For our team as a whole, I would call it a net neutral. I think we panicked a little bit with literally two days of trucks not coming in and trucks not going out, and at least one of our more significant consumer plants closed and not knowing when all that would change. I think we recovered most of it. So I would say in the quarter it's a net neutral, as you think about what our PM's comparison might be for next year with the exception of Legend brands business.\nKevin McCarthy: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Next question comes from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Arun.\nArun Viswanathan: Good morning, Frank. Thanks for taking my question here. I guess first off just on the pricing outlook, could you just elaborate on maybe by business segment if possible what you feel is the pricing outlook is, I'm just curious the volumes obviously and consumer are still relatively robust. On the other hand, maybe industrial performance is a little bit weaker. And does that kind of pretend for weaker pricing prospects over the next couple of months. How should we think about kind of pricing by segment?\nFrank Sullivan: I don't know that we would provide pricing by segment. I do think it's driven certainly by the underlying raw materials in specific areas and then by my commentary on inflation throughout our P&L in general. And so, I would anticipate -- again, we're not going to recover the spike for berry, it's crazy. And you'll see that in our fourth quarter, and again, with epoxy resins and acrylic resins some different solvents literally doubling price temporarily in some cases it's more than doubling in price. But we think there's an underlying inflation that's high single-digits across our P&L. And in some cases we've had modest price increases, in other cases like epoxy resins, as I commented earlier in certain product categories, we've gone out with a 14% price increase in its sticking. The other aspect of this, I think that's important to understand is you're trying to manage your supply chain. And so if you want to get product to meet customer demands and serve your customers then you're going to have to work with your suppliers on product availability and what their costs are doing and what they're doing with their prices in order to get raw materials to serve our customers. And so that's certainly part of what's driving some of our price increases as well.\nArun Viswanathan: Okay. That's helpful. And then this is a quick follow-up. So then when you think about subsequent quarters, ultimately, it sounds like you will be able to get price here. But it may take some time, but in the future, I guess maybe beyond the August quarter, would you expect that you know for us moderate that you should see some margin expansion i.e. hold onto that price in subsequent periods as well?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I think there's -- as I mentioned, there's $50 million of expected kind of final incremental benefits of our massive growth program in fiscal '22. Most of that is in the manufacturing and procurement areas. And so I would hope that after, as I commented earlier after our first quarter, you'll start to see that gross margin improvement. We're keenly focused on that in terms of our conversion costs as well as that centralized procurement activity that we're talking about. To an earlier question, I'll repeat, we're seeing inflation throughout our P&L and from a political perspective United States spent $3 trillion on COVID relief and stimulus in calendar '20. We're going to spend already $2 trillion more in calendar '21, and if there's a big infrastructure bill that's true. You start to marry that with the inflation that our industry and manufacturing in general is seeing across packaging and freight costs and metals and everything else. I think the bigger concern we ought to have broadly is, we in for a return of some level of inflation? And what does that do to interest rates? I'm not an economist, but we don't see anything that suggests that we're going to backwards in raw materials structurally. We're certainly going to come down from some of the crazy spikes that we've seen in certain raw materials. Again, I don't anticipate that epoxy resins will be a 100% or 150% higher for the rest of the year, but they are as we sit here today, same is true on some acrylics. So quite to the contrary of your question, our price increase activity is anticipating some significant reductions of the real crazy spikes that we're experiencing as we sit here today.\nArun Viswanathan: Okay. That's helpful. And sorry, one more quick one, so just on the M&A side, I know that you said that the evaluations may be a little bit high now, especially for the larger deals, but given the changes in your strategy through map and potentially integrating prior acquisitions. Do you foresee greater synergy opportunities, I guess, in this -- with future acquisitions, or is there any color you could share on what you expected to drive out of the Bison or other acquisitions that you've completed recently?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I think that if we look at bigger deals for the most part they would have and particularly if they're higher valuations that we've been, we paid in the past, they would have to come with meaningful synergies and -- versus 20 years ago, my father would go out and acquire at a reasonable fair price. Family owned businesses that would operate independently as part of RPM. The vast majority of our acquisitions today are driven by the strategic growth imperatives of our groups, as opposed to buying totally freestanding businesses that don't have a connection necessarily for, in some level of integration within an RPM within one of our four segments.\nArun Viswanathan: Great, thanks.\nOperator: And your next question will come from Mike Harrison from Seaport Global Securities. Your line is open.\nMike Harrison: Hi, good morning.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Mike.\nMike Harrison: I'm wondering if just to follow-up on some of the acquisition discussion when you acquired the Ali business it looks like it had annual sales of around $75 million and this quarter, it sounds like around $24 million, $25 million in what would -- what I would think is a seasonally weaker quarter. So can you talk about how you've been able to leverage Ali and the Gator brand relative to your expectations and where we should think about that revenue run rates as we get into the spring and summer a heavier season here?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. The Ali family had built a great business with a great brand, a great adjacent product line for our consumer segment. And so we're excited to have it. Our first challenge there was kind of into the COVID period with a shutdown of valley for a few weeks and a lot of catching up and really some supply issues. And we have worked very aggressively, both in terms of investment and outsourcing in a few categories to correct that disruption and we have caught up. And so now there's good demand there and it's just a great business. And to the extent, particularly in conjunction with the sales and marketing teams at Rust-Oleum to go into some of our big accounts on a joint basis is something that we're excited about. So we would expect to see that business grow at a high single-digit or low double-digit growth organically. We're thrilled to have them as part of RPM, but we did have a two or three months on anticipated supply disruption relative to how COVID impacted that business after we acquired it.\nMike Harrison: All right. And then, also in the consumer business, you had noted that Europe and Canada were pretty robust. I believe that the DIY demand trajectory was a little bit different in those international markets than what you saw with the strength in the U.S. in April and May. So how should we think about the comps of that international consumer business and maybe the pace of DIY demand over the next couple quarters there?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. We do a couple of hundred million dollars of DIY business in Europe, disproportionally in the U.K. And so, there has been more business activity in the U.K., for instance, this recent shutdown wasn't applied as previously the business activity as earlier UK activities were. And we've had a surprising to me, but really great execution by our leadership team there of a significant increase in e-commerce business. Literally, paint products and accessories direct to consumers and that's growing. I think it's one of the areas broadly in the DIY markets, and to me, again, surprisingly, somewhat in the paint markets. One of the positive outcomes of all this is it's really accelerated consumer and customer interest in buying some of our products via e-commerce and direct ship, and our ability to learn how to do that more efficiently. And that was particularly pronounced in Europe and really good execution by our leadership team and their associates there.\nMike Harrison: All right, thanks very much.\nOperator: And your next question will come from Josh Spector from UBS. Your line is open.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Josh.\nJosh Spector: Hey, good morning, Frank. Hi, everyone. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just a quick one on price again, when you talked about how you're going to capture the higher raw materials, you talked about changes in terms of something you could work with. Can you just give us an example of how that would work and how that would close the price real gap?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. Without getting into specifics really the terms are part of price increase adjustments. And so it's really an account by account situation. It's a function of when the price increase goes effective, it's a function of a customer saying, can we change terms here or there? I don't know that that means a lot for the biggest slug of our receivables, because we have a program with MUFG. On the payable side, that's been favorable for us and favorable for both suppliers and that's on the purchase side there. So that's an area where terms have benefited from us. You can see that in our payables. So it's really throughout the supply chain and anytime you're talking price increases, you're talking level of price increases, initiation dates and as how it might affect terms as part of the negotiation, but I wouldn't provide any specifics for obvious reasons.\nJosh Spector: Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And just quickly, you talked about M&A for cash deployment. How about buybacks, and now that you've initiated buybacks again or started doing them, initially you had targets to do a certain amount over a period of time. I think there's maybe a half a billion left in that target. Do you have any plans for the timeframe you plan to execute that over?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes. I don't know that we've announced a specific timeframe. We have an open-ended repurchase program that's active again. You know, like everybody our reaction in the spring of last year was to run the cash and plan for the worst. And I think our people managed through that pretty well, and in our performance actually turned out to be better than we first feared in the March, April and May period a year ago. And so with our board's approval we reinitiated our repurchase program in January. And so, quite quickly with a board meeting at the end of January, we repurchased about $25 million of stock in the quarter. So that was over essentially a two month period and certainly subject to various levels of where our stock price is. We intend to continue at different levels purchasing our stock on a go-forward basis, but I don't -- we certainly will not purchase the next half-a-billion dollars of stock as quickly as we affected the first, which I think was about 18 months. I would expect it to take us multiple years.\nJosh Spector: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Kevin Hocevar from Northcoast Research. Your line is open.\nKevin Hocevar: Hey, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here. On the raw material supply side, you talked a lot about the inflation that you're seeing, but curious if the supply issues here have impacted your ability to produce it all. Have you had to take any plant downtime or reduce shifts or anything like that? Just curious if it's impacted your production capabilities at all?\nFrank Sullivan: The answer is yes, thankfully not on a sustained or meaningful basis, but we've had situations where we would have to stop production and/or wait for raw materials. And we have pursued certain raw materials and certain chemicals direct through distribution under contracts, in our industry, they're starting. The good news is they're starting to roll off, but at the end of February and early March we in our industry were met with about 30 plus forced mature triggers by primary raw material suppliers. And you know, some of the biggest chemical suppliers in the world. And most of those are starting to be to roll off, which is a really good sign. But we have not had any sustained outages due to raw material disruptions, but we have had some spot outages here and there that have been temporary.\nKevin Hocevar: Okay. And then on the roofing side of the business, I know you've got a nice price in thin liquid applied roofing with AlphaGuard and I believe that this is a -- it sounds like you're even expanding capacity on this. And I know it's tends to be a lower cost alternative to fully tearing off and replacing the roof, which I'd have to imagine that this environment is pretty appealing. So curious how you that product line in particular is how building owners are adjusting to the environment. Are you seeing a lot more adoption of folks that might have previously done a full tear and replace with roofing membranes using liquid applied instead, so just kind of curious how that holding up in this environment?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes, absolutely. We're in the process of a $20 million capital expansion in terms of our roof restoration coatings. And I think we've made -- we've been the leader, I say headway but we've been the leader in driving roof restoration coatings as a way to extend the life of a typical end of useful life 30 or 40 year old roof of all types EPM Rubber Roofing and other things, the ability to extend that for anywhere from 10 years in the short-end to 20 years in the long end at a fraction of the cost of ripping something off and replacing it. And so the benefits of not filling up landfills, the benefits to building owners at lower costs, and actually a re-roofing or roof restoration process, it also has shorter timelines and duration are all positives that are now starting to be picked-up in the marketplace. And of course, we have competitors that are chasing that market as well, but that's continuing to grow for us at double-digits. And we're continuing to invest in expanding our capacity there.\nKevin Hocevar: Great, thank you.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: I have no further questions. Thank you. I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Sullivan for closing remarks.\nFrank Sullivan: Yes, thanks, Michelle. And Ghansham grabbed most of my concluding comments, but I did want to just reemphasize that our people have executed our 2020 MAP to Growth Operating Improvement Program extraordinarily well. But the real benefits of the MAP to Growth program have been to transition and really transform RPM in a lot of ways that will serve us well into the future. It's a program that will formally end at May 31, 2021; five months, longer than we anticipated, because of COVID. We're working on kind of what's next and look forward to communicating some of the details of that to our investors in July or perhaps October. I mentioned a lot of people that are driving that success, two people that have been paramount to the success of their program are Steve Knoop and Paul Hoogenboom. Steve, as many of you know, passed away a couple years ago, but he was the primary architect of this and was a big, big passionate believer in MAP to Growth and our ability to execute. And we've done it. And Paul Hoogenboom was a leader in also developing that program, but as you have all heard driving our performance in our Construction Products Group. And there's a lot of exciting things to come there. So, with that, I'd like to thank you all for your participation in our Investor Call today. I want to thank our associates for their tremendous efforts and dedication, and what's been the most volatile environment that any of us have ever operated in, and as volatility continues, and thank our investors for their investment in RPM, and we very much look forward to talking about the details of the conclusion of our fourth quarter and our fiscal '21 full-year when we talk to investors in release earnings in July, and also provide you more detail both about our fiscal '22 outlook and some of the longer term MAP to Growth 2.0 ideas we have, both on the growth side and efficiency side. Thanks for participating in our call today, and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you everyone. This will conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Matt Ratajczak",
            "content": "Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. Note that my comments will be on an as adjusted basis. During the third quarter, we generated consolidated net sales of $1.27 billion, an increase of 8.1%, compared to the $1.17 billion reported during the same quarter of fiscal 2020. As Frank mentioned, organic sales growth was 4.9%, or $58 million. Acquisitions contributed 2.1% of sales, or $24.5 million. Our foreign exchange was a tailwind that increased sales by 1.1%, or $12.9 million. This was strong top line growth during the third quarter, which typically generates our most modest results each year because it falls during the winter months when painting and construction activity is slow. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.38, an increase of 65.2% compared to $0.23 in the year-ago quarter. Our consolidated adjusted EBIT was up 32.2% to $79.9 million, compared to $60.5 million reported in the fiscal 2020 third quarter. These excellent results were largely due to initiatives under our MAP to Growth restructuring program and our ability to leverage higher sales to the bottom line. Turning now to our segments. Sales in our Construction Products Group were strong, and increased 6.4% to $396 million. Growth was primarily organic at 5.4% or $20.3 million. Foreign currency translation increased sales by 1% or $3.6 million. With softness in commercial and institutional construction markets, our Construction Products Group remained focused on renovation and restoration projects, leading to solid sales growth during the quarter. Our roofing business performed well as did our Nudura Insulated Concrete forms, or ICS, which are experiencing accelerated long-term adoption as a wall system, as the lumber supply is tightened and prices have skyrocketed. The ICS also provide the benefits of improved energy efficiency and structural integrity. Adjusted EBIT in the Construction Products Group increased 206.4% to $18.5 million from $6 million during last year's third quarter. The group generated 310 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin growth due to MAP to Growth savings and the favorable leverage of sales volume increases. The segment's European businesses continue to improve as a result of ongoing restructuring and better product mix. During the quarter, challenging market trends persisted for our Performance Coatings Group, including weak energy demand that impacted industrial coatings and COVID-19 protocols that continue to restrict access to facilities for flooring system installations. Sales in this segment were $226.5 million and 11.4% decrease from the $255.7 million reported during last year's third quarter. Organic sales decreased 12.7%, or $32.4 million. Foreign exchange provided a tailwind of 1.3%, or $3.2 million. Segment adjusted EBIT decreased 41.6% to $14.1 million from $24.2 million during last year's third quarter. Lower sales volumes and pricing pressures resulted in earnings de-leveraging which was offset in part by discretionary cost cuts and MAP to Growth savings. As vaccines are administered and the impact of the pandemic diminishes, we expect the segment to rebound as its industrial customers catch up on maintenance and energy markets recover in part due to increased travel. In the Consumer Group, sales were robust, increasing 19.8% to $477.7 million. Organic sales increased 12.7% or $50.4 million and acquisitions increased sales by 6.1% or $24.5 million. Foreign currency translation increased sales by 1% or $4.1 million. The Consumer Group continued to capitalize on the positive DIY Home Improvement market trend by leveraging its broad distribution in market leadership in caulks, sealants, cleaners, abrasives, and small project paints. Similar to the U.S., Segment's international results were equally robust in Europe and Canada. Adjusted EBIT in the Consumer Group was $47.8 million, an increase of 48.6% over the prior-year.  Adjusted EBIT margin improved as a result of MAP to Growth savings and the leveraging of higher sales volumes, which offset rising distribution expenses. Results in our Specialty Products Group were a record and improved dramatically for the second consecutive quarter. Fiscal 2021 third quarter net sales increased 14.7% to $169.2 million from $147.5 million in the fiscal 2020 third quarter. Organic sales growth was 13.4% driven by more aggressive business development efforts and growth investments initiated by new management as well as improving market conditions for many of its businesses. In particular, our restoration equipment business driven by extreme weather events North America experienced excellent top line growth, as did our businesses serving the furniture, outdoor recreational equipment, food, cleaning, disinfecting and OEM markets. Favorable foreign currency translation at 1.3% of sales, adjusted EBIT was $25.3 million during the quarter, an increase of 44.2% compared to adjusted EBIT of $17.5 million in last year's quarter. The Specialty Products Group was able to drive MAP to Growth savings and operating leverage from higher sales volumes to the bottom line. Next, a few comments on our liquidity; our year-to-date cash flow from operation improved by $270.7 million or 71% over the last fiscal year to a record of $651.9 million as a result of continued with better working capital management, where all components of working capital improved as compared to the prior year, and margin improvement from our MAP to Growth program. At the quarters end, our total equity was $1.4 billion. Our net leverage ratio has calculated under our bank agreements was 2.13 on February 28, 2021, which was a significant improvement as compared to 2.90 a year ago. Our balance sheet remains strong and we've strategically deployed a record cash flow to reduce debt. Simultaneously, we were completing acquisitions and making investments to improve the efficiency of our operations. Additionally, we repurchased approximately $24.6 million of stock during the quarter. I'll now turn the call over to Rusty for our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2021."

            "content": "Thanks, Matt. The fourth quarter is seasonally our strongest and started off well in March. However, several macro-economic factors are creating inflationary and supply pressures on some of our product categories. These factors include supplier refineries operating at lower levels due to low fuel demand. The disruption winter storm Uri caused on supply chains, intermittent supplier plants shut down in response to the pandemic and significant worldwide demand for packaging solvent and chemicals used in cleaning products. We expect that these increased costs will be reflected in our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and more significantly during fiscal 2022. We are moving aggressively to offset the increased costs with commensurate selling price increases. Fortunately, due to our MAP to Growth program, we are in much better position to weather these challenges than we were three years ago, when the last inflationary cycle occurred. With a stronger partnership with our supplier base and longer term contracts, we are working with our supplier partners to secure necessary raw materials and control costs to whatever extent possible. In addition, our improved center-led processes and systems are providing more timely and actionable information to address these challenges. We are also working in collaboration with customers through the supply chain difficulty. On a segment-by-segment basis, we are encouraged by the following: Number one, resumption of discussions on federal action on an infrastructure program, as well as municipal funding and the recent since federal COVID stimulus bill that should support building maintenance and major end markets of our construction products group. Number two, the resumption of travel and the recent rebound in energy markets give us optimism that are industrial protective coatings business in our performance coatings group may have bottomed out as they start to lap into easier comparisons. Number three, the increasing re-entry of home improvement professionals into the market as more consumers become vaccinated and welcome outside contractors back into their homes, which will benefit our consumer group; and number four, high demand in our specialty products group for its legend brands, restoration equipment and solutions, which resulted from the property damage caused by winter storm Uri. While it disrupted many of our other businesses, storm provided revenues for legend brands in February and the back the log of more orders in the fourth quarter as we help our customers respond to this natural disaster. As we look ahead to our fourth quarter and beyond, there is currently a great deal of volatility around input costs and uncertainty regarding material availability. While our third quarter earnings did not reflect recent material cost spikes due to our FIFO inventory methodology, inflation will likely be significant in our fourth quarter and into the first quarter of fiscal 2022. We have been, and are in the process of implementing appropriate price increases and changes in terms, which we anticipate will offset the inflationary impact by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2022. There is also much uncertainty related to the breath and speed at which global economies reopen as people become vaccinated. Based on the information available to us today, we expect our fiscal 2021 fourth quarter sales to increase by double digit compared to the fiscal 2020 fourth quarter. Last year's fourth quarter should prove to be an easier revenue comparison because it was heavily impacted by the onset of the pandemic. Our earnings comparison versus last year on the other hand will be more challenging because of raw material inflation as well as an extraordinary situation last year when our non-operating segment reported a profit due to lower travel and medical expenses, incentive reversals, and other factors. As a result, our fourth quarter adjusted EBIT is expected to increase double-digits coupled with the rate of sales growth. Excluding our non-operating segment, adjusted EBIT for our four operating segments in total is expected to increase by more than 20%. This concludes our formal comments. We will now be pleased to take your questions."

            "name": "Frank Sullivan",
            "content": "Thank you, Michelle. Good morning, and welcome to the RPM International Inc. investor call for our fiscal 2021 third quarter ended February 28, 2021. Joining me on the call today are Rusty Gordon, RPM's Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Matt Ratajczak, our Vice President of Global Tax and Treasury, who is also supporting our Investor Relation activities. Before we begin, I would like to note that yesterday, I received my second COVID-19 vaccine shot. I have encouraged our associates to get vaccinated, and I recommend the same to everyone listening to this call. It's the only way we can all do our part to end the pandemic and return to normalcy and reinvigorate the global economy. I'll start today's call by summarizing the factors that drove our strong financial performance for the quarter and how we were able to overcome the disruption caused by the severe winter weather storm that hit the U.S. in February. I'll then discuss how we are utilizing our record cash from operations, and provide an update on our MAP to Growth operating improvement program. After that, I'll turn the call over to Matt, who will review our third quarter results in more detail. Rusty Gordon will conclude our formal remarks with the outlook for our fourth quarter. As you recall in mid-February, a severe winter storm blanketed nearly 75% of the U.S. in snow, which disrupted transportation, distribution, and supply chains. In anticipation of severe transportation gridlock, the potential of losing multiple shipping days in North America, which makes up 70% of our revenue, and the desire to maintain transparent communications with our investors, we lowered our third quarter guidance on February 18. The third quarter is our seasonally low quarter and historically generates only 5% to 10% of our annual earnings. So, the magnitude of relatively small changes in earnings becomes magnified. However, in the end, through the extraordinary measures of our associates as well as the fact that plants, distribution centers, and transportation network resumed operations more quickly than we anticipated, we were able to catch up and execute delivery of most of our customer orders in the final week of February, which enabled us to exceed our original third quarter sales and earnings guidance. For the quarter, we generated record consolidated sales, earnings, and cash from operations. Sales grew 8.1% with 4.9% being due to organic initiatives, 2.1% resulting from acquisitions and 1.1% as a result of favorable foreign exchange. Internationally, Europe and Canada showed good growth as well. Latin America showed growth in local currencies, but was flat when its results were translated back into U.S. dollars. Much like last quarter, three of our four operating segments generated solid sales growth and significant leverage to the EBIT line due to our MAP to Growth operating improvement program benefits, while being leveraged to the bottom line as we have done for the last eight quarters. This was particularly impressive given the supply chain challenges in typical comparison to last year's third quarter when our adjusted EBIT increased 304%. On a segment basis, our Specialty Products Group led the way with organic growth of 13.4% in the quarter, and produced a second consecutive quarter of double-digit top line and bottom line growth. Our Consumer Group also generated double-digit organic growth as it continued to benefit from strong DIY demand. The Construction Products Group again generated solid sales and significant EBIT growth in challenging market conditions by focusing on infrastructure, which encompasses about 15% of RPM's consolidated sales, and its strong performance in repair and renovation. Results in our Performance Coatings Group declined due to difficult conditions in its primary end markets. Matt Ratajczak will cover the segment results in more detail in a minute. We continue to prove why RPM is the best home for entrepreneurial businesses in our industry with two acquisitions in March. These include the Tuff Coat line of rubberized non-stick coatings used for aquatic applications, which is a great strategic fit with our Recreational Marine Products Group; and Bison Innovative Products, a manufacturer of raised flooring systems that will operate as part of our Fibergrate business. We have taken a more collaborative view of our manufacturing footprint as we add capacity. For example, to meet the consumer segment's explosive growth for its products, we are installing packaging and blending equipment at plants in our performance coatings and specialty products groups. This is an addition to capital spending in our consumer segment facilities, which includes new filling capacity for consumer group plants with particular emphasis on meeting the increased demand for small project paints, caulks and sealants in our repair categories. Other investments in our operations include new presses and injection molding equipment to meet surging orders for our Nudura ICF products and wall systems, and the construction of a new liquid applied roof coatings plant. I now like to discuss our MAP to Growth restructuring program, which continues to pay dividends. During the quarter, and so far in the fourth quarter, we announced the closure of two plants, which brings our total to 27 of the 31 plants that we originally targeted for consolidation at the beginning of the MAP to Growth Program. As discussed last quarter, we continue to be more efficient in utilizing our manufacturing assets to generate cost-saving opportunities. The benefits of our center-led procurement initiatives are becoming even more evident in the current inflationary raw material environment. Rusty Gordon will provide more color on this when he walks through our fourth quarter outlook. Lastly, in the G&A area, we continue to consolidate IT systems and accounting and finance operations. At the end of our fiscal year, May 31, 2021, we expect to exceed the original MAP to Growth programs planned run rate of $290 million in annualized savings. The program's learnings of continuous improvement in efficiency have become ingrained in our culture, and we will continue to add to our robust pipeline of cost savings initiatives and operational improvements. As we sustain the efficiency gains achieved through MAP to Growth, we are now shifting more focus and resources towards top line growth through internal investments and acquisitions. Our goal is to return to the exceptional revenue growth rates that have been one of the hallmarks of RPM success since its founding in 1947. I will now turn the call over to Matt Ratajczak for a detailed review of our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. Good morning, Frank. Sure. I think a couple of things are happening. Number one, we were seeing inflationary increases at the end of calendar 2020 and beginning of calendar 2021 that were structural. Those were impacted, as I think everyone on this phone knows or call knows, by the winter storm and its impact. We are seeing temporarily certain raw materials like epoxies that are more than double in cost what they were a year ago, that's true across a number of categories. And so, with that aside, we think that you are going to see inflation. In our markets, it's going to be high single digits. And I think an important thing for people to understand is that inflationary impact on us and in our market and our industry exists throughout the P&L. It's not just raw material cost, it's transportation cost of all types: rail, over-the-road, truck, ocean freight not a big issue for us, but ocean freight, and it's also labor cost. You are seeing higher labor cost in factories and distribution centers, and to a certain extent across the organization. Labor costs are particularly interesting over the last year. To a certain extent, we are competing with the government. In some of our distribution centers, we would have seasonal part-time workers decided that if they could get paid more by staying at home, they would. We had replaced many of those with full-time workforce that has a higher benefit expense. So, inflation, in total, is going to be mid to high single digits throughout the year, that's structural. That does not include some of the extraordinary spikes that resulted from the storm and they're throughout the P&L. That's correct. We will see some gross margin deterioration in our fourth quarter, particularly in our consumer business. We will see gross margin deterioration in Q1. Again, in the consumer business, particularly which will be a combination of two things: one, cost price mix; and two, the fact that a consumer in Q1 will be rounding a first quarter performance last year, where organic growth is up 34%, and we do not expect to exceed that. But those are the big challenges that we see. And I think you'll see a return to gross margin improvement after Q1 with strong sales leverage and the continued benefits of MAP to Growth. We should see EBIT margin improvement modestly in Q4 at the operating levels, as Rusty said, and then continuing in fiscal 2021. I am sorry... -- fiscal 2022. Thank you, Frank. Good morning, Rosemarie. Congratulations. So, in general, we are seeing still solid consumer takeaway across all of our consumer group customer base. But it's certainly down from what it was in the summer and the fall. In the summer and the fall, we were looking at 30% organic growth rates. Consumer takeaway in the third quarter was more in the low single-digit range, low teens. And we expect to start rounding much more difficult comparisons in April and May, and the first and second quarter of fiscal 2022. So, I would expect, as we indicated a minute ago, that we will see some gross margin challenges and quite candidly some very difficult comparisons in our consumer segment. Our results will be above what at the time of records in fiscal 2019. But in the first-half of next year and really starting in April and May, I would expect this to be flat to slightly down relative to the comparisons that we will be facing. The flipside is, as we sit here, we are starting to see positive sales and earnings contribution from our Performance Coatings Group, really the first positive results in the top and bottom line from those more industrial-focused businesses and industries that we've seen in more than a year. And as you can see in our results, the Specialty Products Group is roaring and the Construction Products Group is roaring. And the dynamics of their underlying market suggest that that will continue for some time in both segments. Well, historically, Rosemarie, and this goes back to the beginning of our MAP to Growth Program, we had a 15 or 20-year compounded annual growth rate of about 6%. I would say, about half of that was from acquisitions. But when you look at where we were after our last restructuring in 1999-2000 range, from 2003 for about a decade, our organic growth averaged about 5% or 6%, so very impressive numbers. And we think we are going to get back to that. In fact, we are back to that as we speak. And I will tell you, our fourth quarter, our current view is we expect revenue growth somewhere in the 15% to 20% range. And we - I think we are well-poised for good growth in fiscal 2022. And the underlying fiscal dynamics will support perhaps even stronger growth, although I think it remains to be seen what actually comes out of the Washington in terms of a big infrastructure build, and also when and how quickly Europe recovers. We're continuing to see some modest challenges in Europe with these COVID lockdowns across some of the major countries that we operate in, while the United States seems to be picking up and that pick up is gaining momentum. I don't have that specific number, I would tell you in general less than a quarter of it is from price and the balance will be mostly from organic growth, I would guess if we looked in this quarter and acquisition activity yes 2%. So you would expect another 2% of impact from acquisitions I think in Q4, the balance of the organic growth. Thank you. Good morning, Ghansham. Sure. So I'll hit you, you're going to steal my concluding comments, Ghansham with that question, which is a good one. Our MAP to Growth program has fundamentally changed RPM. And it's not just about saving or achieving the $290 million in savings in fact, that May 31 '21 will be at a roughly $300 million run rate, and we expect $50 million of MAP savings to benefit incrementally fiscal '22. But it really has in a relatively short period of time, begun to ingrain continuous improvements of lean manufacturing disciplines into our manufacturing and operations and really into our D&A there. The work that our teams have done in procurement has been extraordinary. We went from a quiet collaboration to a centralized procurement activity, Mike Sullivan, who took over as Chief Restructuring Officer from Steve and Tim Kinser and Gordie Hyde and their teams have done extraordinary work. Then the other thing that has fundamentally transformed RPM is the work of Rusty Gordon, Scott Copeland, Lonny DiRusso, who is our IT Director, and his teams; we have developed systems for tracking savings and efficiency programs out of the MAP to Growth initiative, we have -- and so that is something we call MPST. We have adopted that, we started a year-ago, we got disrupted by COVID, but adopted it internal and corporate system to MAP Growth initiatives called the MPGT. We have a consolidated effort to look much more aggressively and much more proactively at cost price mix. So what we've been able to do in terms of utilizing information across RPM on a centralized basis, to communicate better share best practices, and really have more real time data in which to make decisions is dramatically different from what RPM was three years ago. And we expect to continue to build on that. The last comment I'll make is that we have the procurement effort has really established us as a good partner to some of our major raw material suppliers in ways that we were not before and we have substantially more and different raw materials under global contracts that we did three years ago and that has been very fortuitous, and how that has helped us in this challenging raw material cost increase environment. But at least as we speak now also the raw material and availability environment, time around the kind of the cultural change that we've affected in MAP to Growth which is I think in the long run, probably more important than the execution of achieving a particular efficiency number. And that concludes my prepared remarks. So I have commented before on this, Paul Hoogenboom who leads our Construction Products Group and his team are doing extraordinary work. And it's a combination of two things that kind of that came together at the right time. One is an effort to bring together and this started before MAP to Growth, our collection of Construction Products businesses, so Dryvit Nudura, different parts of Tremco, some of which operated relatively independently in our nuclear chemical business into a much more integrated, kind of holistic approach to the market. So while we call it the RPM Construction Products Group, they're going to market globally as the Tremco Construction Products Group and so that integration on the common IT platforms, we're getting some comment specification efforts is really paying big dividends. You overlay that with the benefits of MAP to Growth. And you're seeing a really good combination of market beating top line performance and leverage to the bottom line. And that's continuing to see continue in the fourth quarter. And boy, I would expect it to continue for the next couple of years. We have some more work to do. But the enthusiasm amongst our people in the Tremco Construction Products Group and the extraordinary work they're doing is just fantastic. And you can see in the marketplace. And the last comment I'll make is I ramble on here is, there's been a decided shift there towards more renovation as opposed to new construction, new construction is still probably 30% of the Construction Products Group if not more, but we've become more renovation focused, which has really served us well. Infrastructure spending, a big boom in construction activity will only serve to help accelerate the performance that we're seeing. Thanks, Ghansham. Good morning, Steve. Sure. And a great question in terms of where we're going and how we're thinking about growth. First of all, in our investor presentation, we outlined kind of what we think is the addressable markets globally for our four segments, and it comes up to about $134 billion, half of that relates to our Construction Products Group. So, given the comments I just made and the opportunities that we see there, I would expect that to be probably our fastest growing group, particularly in light of the extraordinary year which consumer has had. We're also in the early stages of cross-selling, if you will, between our Construction Products Group and our consumer group, particularly where there's an interest with some of our Big Box customers in some of the Construction Products Groups, waterproofing, roofing, coatings and sealant products, as well as concrete patch and repair products. So there're opportunities there. We have as part of MAP to Growth, this was not part of the original plan, but we add into it, brought in McKinsey to really help kick start growth in our Specialty Products Group. We had under invested in our Specialty Products Group for a long time in part because most of those businesses were part of the solution challenge. And so we're being managed for cash. And I think you're seeing the early results of both our focus on growth in those businesses in the Specialty Products Group and some leadership changes that we're in a position to talk about more over as they come to fruition, we get comfortable about what we want to disclose publicly. But and then lastly, we're better able to integrate bolt-on acquisitions than we ever have. Having said that, all of our bolt-on acquisition activity is really done with a focus on growth, how can we take a unique product line or a unique technology and leveraging it over our distribution on our sales forces? So, the combination is pretty exciting for us. And there's a pretty good M&A pipeline to end stock market value. Sure. That should start to pay-off us in Europe. A disparate collection of construction chemical businesses in the U.S., when you look at Europe between Flowcrete and Dryvit which is headquartered in Poland, our yield growth business and our Tremco business, they all operated independently. And under the leadership of Melissa Schoger who is doing a great job over the years been with us for quite a while and leads the Construction, Tremco Construction Products Group efforts in Europe, we have integrated those businesses, we're going to market more as Tremco Construction Products Group. And it's been a real fixer up job. And I think we're getting towards the end stages of the fixed part in terms of planning, consolidation, really getting people to see themselves as part of one Construction Products Group team. And then they'll quickly be able to shift to a focus on growth. Hopefully, we'll be lucky on the timing because Europe is certainly behind the United States relative to opening up an activity principally related to these recurring national shutdowns in some of our major markets, like Germany and France and Italy. We're actually doing pretty well in the U.K. And then outside of that, we've got really exciting growth in places like Europe and Asia, but it's on a very small basis. And so, acquisitions will certainly help us accelerate growth and establish a bigger presence in international markets. Good morning, Jeff. So I think that just to reflect the comments we made earlier, we anticipate structural changes in inflation in our markets throughout our P&L, there's going to be high single digits. And we have gone out with price increases that are in the 6% to 8% range. We went out, some of our businesses went out early in anticipation, these are industrial businesses and looking at the changes at the end of the calendar year and beginning of this new calendar year, with 3% to 5% price increases and as we sit here today, it goes on and off and they're going out again. And in certain categories, I mentioned epoxy; we've increased prices on certain of our product lines by 14%. That's in light of epoxy primer, which we think are temporary which have more than doubled. They'll certainly come down from their current highs, but they will be substantially higher than they were a year-ago and that from our perspective is a structural change in most all of our raw materials from acrylic resins to epoxy resins to all types of polymers and polyols. It's just been an extraordinary period of time in terms of spikes, but really in terms of inflation, corrugate, packaging, transportation costs all going up. And so, we'll have maybe better information in July in terms of where we are. And then the last comment I'll make to your question is, I think, both good and fortunate in our ability not to have to short and/or not be able to supply. We have continued work to do on working capital. We've been a heavy working capital company. We've generated in excess of 200 million of positive cash flow from improvements in working capital, but whether it was raw material or inventory, whether it was new contracts so far we've been able to manage through these circumstances I think pretty well. As I accommodate earlier on the call, starting in April and May and certainly through the first and second quarter, we anticipate consumer volume flat or slightly down, we think it will be picking up in the second half of next year. And that's in light of -- for instance, a first quarter of fiscal '20 organic growth of 34%, which is a mountain we don't expect to beat in the first quarter of this year. We do have some market share gains. We do have some new product introductions to the extent that there is acquisition activity that could end up resulting in a year-over-year higher performance, but on an organic basis starting in April, I think we anticipate flat to slightly down results in our consumer segment on the top line and the bottom line. No, it's not true. I think, yes, three months ago, anytime--first of all, we didn't talk too much about fiscal '22, but I can tell you we have made numerous references the fact that we were not going to top a 34% organic growth in the first quarter, and I believed it six months ago, and I believe it three months ago, I believe it today. And I wouldn't say we're pessimistic. We will be meaningfully above the record results of where we were in our consumer business in fiscal '19. And so there has been an expansion broadly of the market of more confident DIYers, and we're excited about that, but circumstantially starting in April and certainly through our first quarter, we'd expect to be flat or slightly down in our consumer business versus these extraordinary comparisons to last year. Thank you. Very much, the latter, John, it was growing double digits before the lumber price issue, we are working on greater specifications. ICF with contractors is initially a challenging sell because for better, for worse and sometimes it helps us contractors, architects, engineers are hesitant to change from systems that work, and when we get people that convert to ICF, they love it. It is less labor-intensive, and in many instances it provides the most durable sidewall in the market today, bar none. And it's highly energy efficient. And so, we have been focusing efforts through our Tremco Construction Products Group again on an integrated basis, utilizing the sales force of 200 plus people in the Tremco waterproofing sealant business to really drive sales in Nudura. The lumber price situation was some added gravy to help accelerate that, but we're very excited about that and we're also excited about the ability to deliver a more integrated wall. Nudura independently was bought and part of drive it. Today, they're all part of our Tremco Construction Products Group. So our specifications around Nudura are not just for an ICF wall system. Therefore the Tremco sealants and all the joints therefore drive it or new brick or other siding that we're involved in. And so, the opportunity there is very, very exciting. It's mostly residential and the opportunity to drive it in white commercial institutional markets like schools is huge. Sure. The M&A pipeline is really strong. We commented that we completed two acquisitions just this past month, Bison, which is a great addition to our Fibergrate business and I think also has some applicability to other parts of RPM that's a patented floor leveling system that we can use with grading or other systems. And then, Tuff Coat, again a non-skid Marine product that is already getting some interest from other parts of RPM and industrial settings. So, we're very excited about both of those. You've got management teams to run those even though we'll be pulling them in to RMS168 manufacturing process, and our centralized procurement activities. So there's more of that out there in general in our space. There are a lot of bigger transactions out there and I'll just repeat what I've said in the past. I don't see us paying 15 or 16 times EBITDA for anything. And so to the extent that there's large transactions and people are willing to pay those relatively peak multiples in a period of time where their peak earnings that will not likely be RPM, but if there are some larger transactions that we can get done at what we believe to a reasonable multiple with a reasonable IRR, we certainly wouldn't preclude looking at him. Thank you. Good morning, Vincent. Sure, I commented earlier on the call that as we sit here today in the spring, we're seeing positive results for the first time in a year on the top line and bottom line of those businesses. I think we'll have better color in July because the biggest reason is that we're starting to analyze really poor results. We've had our Carboline business in particular given their exposure to oil and gas and heavy industry 10%, 12% sales declines pretty consistently, Stonhard business and our foreign polymer flooring business has been flat to slightly down, their backlog is bigger than ever. And so we're very hopeful that you're going to see some nice robust growth there, but we'll have better color for you in July to really look back over three or four months and determine, how much of this is a pickup and demand and good robust organic growth versus how much of this is, \"Hey, we look great, because last year was terrible.\" Well, I think it is continuing to the fourth quarter, and I think that's true of our Legend brands business, but we have new leadership in a number of places over the last two years. We've been really looking to drive growth. If you look at our marketing profile and how it's improving in Specialty Products in the last two quarters I think you'll see comparable improvement in Q4. That's in our Day-Glo for us in color and colorant business. It's in our MRT business, which is our marine coatings and some of the specialty products there. It's pretty exciting in terms of what the work we're doing there. And some of the leadership changes that we've affected is doing for that segment. So we'll have much tougher comps next year in Q3 and Q4 and legend brands, but I think Specialty Segment is poised for some pretty solid growth in the top and bottom line for the coming year. Yes. Thank you. I encourage everybody to go get theirs. Good morning, Kevin. Fine. Sure. Without being too much of a politician, I think we're going to have an infrastructure bill. I'm hopeful that it'll be more bipartisan than the -- in the most recent COVID bill. And I say that because of, it's more bipartisan, whether it's larger or smaller, it will be more focused on bridges and highways and airports and poor facilities and the things that will drive our business. And so I do think we'll be a beneficiary of that, and I think whatever benefit comes out of that will be in addition to the growth that we're experiencing in our construction products group now. Sure. Certainly for our legend brands business, it was a positive in terms of driving their air handling equipment, dehumidification equipment and stuff that they work with all their major customers in helping homeowners in light commercial, recover from storms like this. For our team as a whole, I would call it a net neutral. I think we panicked a little bit with literally two days of trucks not coming in and trucks not going out, and at least one of our more significant consumer plants closed and not knowing when all that would change. I think we recovered most of it. So I would say in the quarter it's a net neutral, as you think about what our PM's comparison might be for next year with the exception of Legend brands business. Good morning, Arun. I don't know that we would provide pricing by segment. I do think it's driven certainly by the underlying raw materials in specific areas and then by my commentary on inflation throughout our P&L in general. And so, I would anticipate -- again, we're not going to recover the spike for berry, it's crazy. And you'll see that in our fourth quarter, and again, with epoxy resins and acrylic resins some different solvents literally doubling price temporarily in some cases it's more than doubling in price. But we think there's an underlying inflation that's high single-digits across our P&L. And in some cases we've had modest price increases, in other cases like epoxy resins, as I commented earlier in certain product categories, we've gone out with a 14% price increase in its sticking. The other aspect of this, I think that's important to understand is you're trying to manage your supply chain. And so if you want to get product to meet customer demands and serve your customers then you're going to have to work with your suppliers on product availability and what their costs are doing and what they're doing with their prices in order to get raw materials to serve our customers. And so that's certainly part of what's driving some of our price increases as well. Sure. I think there's -- as I mentioned, there's $50 million of expected kind of final incremental benefits of our massive growth program in fiscal '22. Most of that is in the manufacturing and procurement areas. And so I would hope that after, as I commented earlier after our first quarter, you'll start to see that gross margin improvement. We're keenly focused on that in terms of our conversion costs as well as that centralized procurement activity that we're talking about. To an earlier question, I'll repeat, we're seeing inflation throughout our P&L and from a political perspective United States spent $3 trillion on COVID relief and stimulus in calendar '20. We're going to spend already $2 trillion more in calendar '21, and if there's a big infrastructure bill that's true. You start to marry that with the inflation that our industry and manufacturing in general is seeing across packaging and freight costs and metals and everything else. I think the bigger concern we ought to have broadly is, we in for a return of some level of inflation? And what does that do to interest rates? I'm not an economist, but we don't see anything that suggests that we're going to backwards in raw materials structurally. We're certainly going to come down from some of the crazy spikes that we've seen in certain raw materials. Again, I don't anticipate that epoxy resins will be a 100% or 150% higher for the rest of the year, but they are as we sit here today, same is true on some acrylics. So quite to the contrary of your question, our price increase activity is anticipating some significant reductions of the real crazy spikes that we're experiencing as we sit here today. Sure. I think that if we look at bigger deals for the most part they would have and particularly if they're higher valuations that we've been, we paid in the past, they would have to come with meaningful synergies and -- versus 20 years ago, my father would go out and acquire at a reasonable fair price. Family owned businesses that would operate independently as part of RPM. The vast majority of our acquisitions today are driven by the strategic growth imperatives of our groups, as opposed to buying totally freestanding businesses that don't have a connection necessarily for, in some level of integration within an RPM within one of our four segments. Good morning, Mike. Sure. The Ali family had built a great business with a great brand, a great adjacent product line for our consumer segment. And so we're excited to have it. Our first challenge there was kind of into the COVID period with a shutdown of valley for a few weeks and a lot of catching up and really some supply issues. And we have worked very aggressively, both in terms of investment and outsourcing in a few categories to correct that disruption and we have caught up. And so now there's good demand there and it's just a great business. And to the extent, particularly in conjunction with the sales and marketing teams at Rust-Oleum to go into some of our big accounts on a joint basis is something that we're excited about. So we would expect to see that business grow at a high single-digit or low double-digit growth organically. We're thrilled to have them as part of RPM, but we did have a two or three months on anticipated supply disruption relative to how COVID impacted that business after we acquired it. Sure. We do a couple of hundred million dollars of DIY business in Europe, disproportionally in the U.K. And so, there has been more business activity in the U.K., for instance, this recent shutdown wasn't applied as previously the business activity as earlier UK activities were. And we've had a surprising to me, but really great execution by our leadership team there of a significant increase in e-commerce business. Literally, paint products and accessories direct to consumers and that's growing. I think it's one of the areas broadly in the DIY markets, and to me, again, surprisingly, somewhat in the paint markets. One of the positive outcomes of all this is it's really accelerated consumer and customer interest in buying some of our products via e-commerce and direct ship, and our ability to learn how to do that more efficiently. And that was particularly pronounced in Europe and really good execution by our leadership team and their associates there. Good morning, Josh. Sure. Without getting into specifics really the terms are part of price increase adjustments. And so it's really an account by account situation. It's a function of when the price increase goes effective, it's a function of a customer saying, can we change terms here or there? I don't know that that means a lot for the biggest slug of our receivables, because we have a program with MUFG. On the payable side, that's been favorable for us and favorable for both suppliers and that's on the purchase side there. So that's an area where terms have benefited from us. You can see that in our payables. So it's really throughout the supply chain and anytime you're talking price increases, you're talking level of price increases, initiation dates and as how it might affect terms as part of the negotiation, but I wouldn't provide any specifics for obvious reasons. Yes. I don't know that we've announced a specific timeframe. We have an open-ended repurchase program that's active again. You know, like everybody our reaction in the spring of last year was to run the cash and plan for the worst. And I think our people managed through that pretty well, and in our performance actually turned out to be better than we first feared in the March, April and May period a year ago. And so with our board's approval we reinitiated our repurchase program in January. And so, quite quickly with a board meeting at the end of January, we repurchased about $25 million of stock in the quarter. So that was over essentially a two month period and certainly subject to various levels of where our stock price is. We intend to continue at different levels purchasing our stock on a go-forward basis, but I don't -- we certainly will not purchase the next half-a-billion dollars of stock as quickly as we affected the first, which I think was about 18 months. I would expect it to take us multiple years. The answer is yes, thankfully not on a sustained or meaningful basis, but we've had situations where we would have to stop production and/or wait for raw materials. And we have pursued certain raw materials and certain chemicals direct through distribution under contracts, in our industry, they're starting. The good news is they're starting to roll off, but at the end of February and early March we in our industry were met with about 30 plus forced mature triggers by primary raw material suppliers. And you know, some of the biggest chemical suppliers in the world. And most of those are starting to be to roll off, which is a really good sign. But we have not had any sustained outages due to raw material disruptions, but we have had some spot outages here and there that have been temporary. Yes, absolutely. We're in the process of a $20 million capital expansion in terms of our roof restoration coatings. And I think we've made -- we've been the leader, I say headway but we've been the leader in driving roof restoration coatings as a way to extend the life of a typical end of useful life 30 or 40 year old roof of all types EPM Rubber Roofing and other things, the ability to extend that for anywhere from 10 years in the short-end to 20 years in the long end at a fraction of the cost of ripping something off and replacing it. And so the benefits of not filling up landfills, the benefits to building owners at lower costs, and actually a re-roofing or roof restoration process, it also has shorter timelines and duration are all positives that are now starting to be picked-up in the marketplace. And of course, we have competitors that are chasing that market as well, but that's continuing to grow for us at double-digits. And we're continuing to invest in expanding our capacity there. Thank you. Yes, thanks, Michelle. And Ghansham grabbed most of my concluding comments, but I did want to just reemphasize that our people have executed our 2020 MAP to Growth Operating Improvement Program extraordinarily well. But the real benefits of the MAP to Growth program have been to transition and really transform RPM in a lot of ways that will serve us well into the future. It's a program that will formally end at May 31, 2021; five months, longer than we anticipated, because of COVID. We're working on kind of what's next and look forward to communicating some of the details of that to our investors in July or perhaps October. I mentioned a lot of people that are driving that success, two people that have been paramount to the success of their program are Steve Knoop and Paul Hoogenboom. Steve, as many of you know, passed away a couple years ago, but he was the primary architect of this and was a big, big passionate believer in MAP to Growth and our ability to execute. And we've done it. And Paul Hoogenboom was a leader in also developing that program, but as you have all heard driving our performance in our Construction Products Group. And there's a lot of exciting things to come there. So, with that, I'd like to thank you all for your participation in our Investor Call today. I want to thank our associates for their tremendous efforts and dedication, and what's been the most volatile environment that any of us have ever operated in, and as volatility continues, and thank our investors for their investment in RPM, and we very much look forward to talking about the details of the conclusion of our fourth quarter and our fiscal '21 full-year when we talk to investors in release earnings in July, and also provide you more detail both about our fiscal '22 outlook and some of the longer term MAP to Growth 2.0 ideas we have, both on the growth side and efficiency side. Thanks for participating in our call today, and have a great day."

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to RPM\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Mr. Frank Sullivan for opening remarks. Please go ahead, sir.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you, Denise. Happy New Year and welcome to the RPM International Inc. investor call for our fiscal 2021 second quarter. Joining me on today\u2019s call are Rusty Gordon, RPM's Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Matt Ratajczak, our Vice President of Global Tax and Treasury, who is also supporting our Investor Relation activities. I'll take a few moments to provide an overview of the factors driving our strong financial performance for the quarter, and also share an update on our MAP to Growth operating improvement program. Matt will then review our second quarter financial results in detail, and then Rusty will wrap up with our formal remarks with an outlook for the third quarter of our fiscal 2021 year. After which we'll take your questions. I'm very pleased to report that we generated record sales, earnings and cash flow for our second quarter. The excellent performance was achieved largely due to the efforts of our associates to grow our top line, which was achieved by three out of our four segments, despite challenging economic conditions worldwide, coupled with operational efficiency improvement activities. The MAP to Growth initiative once again generated strong leverage to the bottom line and moderate sales growth of 6%. Organic sales grew in a broad range of categories, including cleaning, disinfecting products, air purification equipment, small project paints, OEM coatings and other areas. Acquisitions also contributed to sales, including the second quarter edition of Ali Industries, which is best known for its Gator brand of abrasive products. Ali is the largest acquisition we've made since fiscal 2013 and positively impacted both sales and earnings in the quarter, while also demonstrating our renewed focus to invest in growth initiatives. Foreign currency translation also added to sales as international markets, particularly those in Europe, showed improvement. On an adjusted basis, our consolidated EBIT margin increased 240 basis points to 13.4% during the quarter, driven by three of our four segments registering substantial EBIT margin improvements and high EBIT growth. This was even more impressive given a tough comparison last year when adjusted EBIT increased 22%. Our consumer business continues to lead the way driven by unprecedented consumer demand for its small project paints, caulks, sealants, stains and cleaners, while our other segments are finding ways to compete and win in the markets they serve. Our businesses remained focused on growth and are continuing to develop new innovative solutions for our customers. One example is DAP\u2019s Eclipse Rapid Wall Repair Patch, which is just introduced and was developed to quickly fix most common drywall damage with simple mess -- very mess free repair. And other is Carboline\u2019s Pyrocrete 341, a next generation cementitious coating for passive fire protection. With enhanced application properties and excellent durability, Pyrocrete 341 positions Carboline as a market leader in fire \u2013 in passive fire protection. In addition, our Construction Products Group recently introduced a suite of products that will keep us working this winter in temperatures as low as minus 20 degrees Fahrenheit, including AlphaGuard PUMA and Vulkem EWS waterproofing coatings, which are used to protect roofs and concrete. And in a challenging construction market, our Construction Products Group continues to focus on renovation is exemplified by its Spectrum Simple Seal for fa\u00e7ade restoration. And one recent residential tower in Minnesota, a complete window replacement was estimated to cost $15 million. Tremco won the job by recommending its Spectrum Simple solution which was used to restore the fa\u00e7ade at a cost of only $1 million. We expect significantly more of this restoration product project sales. Our MAP to Growth program continues to have tremendous momentum. During the second quarter, we announced the closure of two plants, which brings our total to 25 out of the 31 plants that were originally targeted for closure at the start of the program. We're also becoming much more efficient in utilizing our manufacturing assets as our focused improvement team meetings continue to deliver cost savings opportunities. One example is a Dryvit manufacturing engineer recently trained in Six Sigma principles, who identified process improvements to reduce scrap and increase yields, which will result in $250,000 in annual savings. There are literally hundreds of other continuous improvement examples like this across RPM, as we have invested in training our operations associates throughout the MAP to Growth program. In addition, the targeted benefits from our center-led procurement initiatives are ahead of plan and our administrative improvements in ERP consolidations are continuing to be implemented. As mentioned last quarter, we expect that we will reach the MAP to Growth programs planned run rate of $290 million in annualized savings by the inclusion of this fiscal year. That said to our culture of continuous improvement, we continue to add to our robust pipeline of cost savings initiatives and operational improvements that will carry into fiscal 2022 and beyond, and will ultimately result in exceeding our original MAP to Growth expectations. Based on our improved margins and better working capital management, our business units generated record cash from operations, which increased 93% to $580 million. We've been strategic in managing this record cash flow, using it to pay down debt, make acquisitions and an increase in our cash reserve. At quarter-end, total liquidity stood at $1.6 billion, making our balance sheet stronger than it's been in a long time. One final comment I'd like to make relates to my predecessor, Tom Sullivan, who is also my father and mentor who passed away on November 30. I share this because he had a tremendous influence on shaping the RPM of today. He took over the business in 1971 after his father died unexpectedly. At that time, RPM sales were $11 million. Following a 55-year career with RPM, Tom retired from our Board in 2016 when annual sales had reached nearly $5 billion. His leadership engrained practices within the organization to continue to perpetuate our growth and success and his spirit continues to drive RPM. I'll now turn the call over to Matt Ratajczak, who will review our fiscal 2021 second quarter financial results in more detail.\nMatt Ratajczak: Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. Please note that my comments will be on an as adjusted basis. During the second quarter, we generated record consolidated net sales of $1.49 billion, an increase of 6% compared to the $1.4 billion reported during the same quarter of fiscal 2020. Organic sales increased 3.5%, or $49.5 million. Acquisitions contributed 2.3% to sales, or $32.6 million. Foreign exchange was a tailwind that increased sales by 0.2%, or $2.5 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.6, an increase of 39.5% compared to $0.76 in the year ago quarter. Our consolidated adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, EBIT, increased 29.7% to $199.3 million compared to $153.7 million reported in the fiscal 2020 second quarter. Turning now to our segment results. Sales in our Construction Products Group increased 0.8% to $503.5 million compared to $499.5 million a year ago. Organic sales increased 1.2% or $6.1 million. There was no impact from acquisitions. Foreign currency translation reduced sales by 0.4% or $2.1 million. Adjusted EBIT in the Construction Products Group increased 26.8% to $78.5 million from adjusted EBIT of $61.9 million reported in the year ago period. The segment was able to leverage its modest sales growth into outstanding results on the bottom line, largely due to MAP to Growth initiatives, aggressive discretionary cost cuts and proactive management to improve its product mix. This was achieved despite soft commercial and institutional construction markets in North America and in Europe.  The segment was able to maintain its top line by focusing on renovation and restoration projects, expanding its position as a single source provider of building envelope systems and continuing to take market share with its industry leading construction technologies, including its Nudura insulated concrete forms Sales in our Performance Coatings Group decreased 11.6% to $258.8 million from $292.7 million a year ago. Organic sales declined to 12.2% or $35.6 million. Acquisitions contributed $0.6 million or 0.2% to sales. Foreign exchange increased sales 0.4% or $1.1 million. The segment's adjusted EBIT was down 24.2% to $28 million compared to $37 million in the prior year period. Similar to last quarter, the Performance Coatings Group's sales continue to be impacted by COVID-19 restrictions that limited access to construction sites, and also by weak energy markets that have resulted in a deferral of industrial maintenance spending. Industrial capital spending has been restricted, especially in the energy sector, which is the largest market for our industrial corrosion control and fireproofing coatings businesses. The segment was particularly challenged in emerging markets, and its Carboline business was temporarily disrupted by hurricanes in the Gulf region of the U.S. The segment's earnings were impacted by declining sales, partially offset by MAP to Growth savings and discretionary cost reductions. Out of all of our segments, the Performance Coatings Group has been unfavorably affected the most by the pandemic. However, it also stands to benefit significantly from the pandemics end as its customers catch up on deferred maintenance and construction projects. The unprecedented demand for our consumer products continued this quarter, resulting in a significant increase in sales for our Consumer group. They increase 21.4% to $547.5 million from $450.9 million in the fiscal 2020 second quarter. Organic sales increased 15.2% or $68.6 million. Acquisitions contributed $26 million or 5.8% of sales. Foreign currency translation increased sales by 0.4% or $2 million. Adjusted EBIT in the Consumer group increased 65.8% to $90.7 million compared to $54.7 million in last year's second quarter. Our Consumer group\u2019s outstanding performance was driven by our broad distribution, and by leveraging our market leading position as homebound consumers tackled significantly more projects. We are investing in paint making and aerosol filling capacity to help meet this demand. The top line also benefited from vigorous cleaning product sales, favorable translational foreign exchange, and the acquisition of Ali Industries. Raw material costs were stable overall during the quarter. However, we are currently seeing broad based inflation in a number of raw materials. High sales volumes and MAP to Growth savings were leveraged to the segment\u2019s strong bottom line. Specialty Products Group sales were $176.1 million, an increase of 11.3% compared to $158.2 million in the year ago period. Organic sales increased 6.6% or $10.4 million. Acquisitions contributed 3.8% or $6 million to sales. Foreign currency translation increased sales by 0.9% or $1.5 million. Adjusted EBIT in this segment increased 27.7% to $29.6 million this quarter, compared to $23.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Management changes that we implemented at the Specialty Products Group have helped to turn around results at the segment this quarter. Sales were boosted by increased hurricane and wildfire fire activity, which drove demand for our water restoration equipment as well as fluorescent pigments which are used in fire retardant tracer dyes. Additionally, we continue to experience strong demand for our expanding product lineup of disinfectants, air purification equipment and HEPA filters. Several of the segment\u2019s end markets have improved. For example, sales of its industrial wood protection products increased as a result of improved lumber demand in the U.S., and we have expanded sales in our forestry chemicals business in Australia and New Zealand. The segment\u2019s bottom line increased as a result of higher sales volumes, operational improvements and MAP to Growth savings.\nRusty Gordon: Now, Rusty will walk you through our outlook.\nRusty Gordon: Thanks, Matt. As we look ahead to the fiscal 2021 third quarter, we anticipate consolidated sales growth in the mid-single-digit range with continued strong leverage to the bottom line from our MAP to Growth program, resulting in adjusted EBIT growth of 30% or more. Our third quarter typically provides relatively modest sales activity each year, because it falls during the winter months when painting and construction activity slow. As a result, there is typically greater volatility in percentage terms, given the unpredictable weather. Also, this seasonal reduction of activity will benefit our consumer segment, enabling it to replenish retail inventory after working to meet unprecedented demand over the last 6 months. From a segment perspective, we expect fiscal 2021 third quarter sales to be flat to negative in the Construction Products Group. This group will continue to outperform its peers in a challenging construction market by continuing to focus upon building restoration and renovation with innovative products and service solutions. We expect the sales declined to continue in the Performance Coatings Group, which serves the most challenged end markets at RPM. We expect the Consumer group to continue to leverage its market leading position into double-digit sales growth due to a number of factors including number one continuation of strong POS results. Number two, more shelf restocking after retail inventories have dropped due to unprecedented demand; and number three, continued benefit on both the top and bottom line from the Ali acquisition, which is performing better than we anticipated. We expect positive sales growth from the Specialty Products Group to continue into the third quarter as well. New management has brought fresh ideas and processes for business development, and their OEM customer base has recovered as manufacturing is picked back up from the shutdowns last spring. Additionally, RPM\u2019s cash flow has soared to new highs due to margin improvement and better working capital management as well as the unprecedented consumer demand, which has drawn down our consumer inventory. A portion of this working capital reduction will not be sustained. Since we will need to rebuild Consumer group inventory. Across all of RPM, there is so much work to do to improve our manufacturing flexibility and planning processes that will help us simultaneously serve our customers, while reducing the necessary safety stock levels. Sales in all four segments should be up in the fiscal 2021 fourth quarter, due to an easier comparison to last year's fourth quarter, which is when the economic interruption caused by the pandemic was most severe. With recent optimism surrounding the vaccines for COVID-19, let me spend a moment to tell you about what life getting back to normal means for our four segments. For consumer, we would expect DIY activity to return to more normalized levels as people venture out of their homes. But we still anticipate elevated demand due to the expectation of continued low interest rates, good housing turnover, and expanded end user base since more DIYers have recently entered the category and our Consumer Pro business picking up again as contractors gain access more often to residences. We also believe that cleaning is an area of greater consumer interest as we go forward. For our CPG and PCG segments, getting back to normal will improve facility access for our contractors, and likely improve construction activity from what has been a challenging 2020 calendar year. We would also expect a boomerang effect in the future as deferred maintenance catches up. For those who followed RPM in the last great recession, you'll recall that our former industrial segment experienced double digit growth in 2011 and 2012 from the catch up at deferred maintenance. For SPG, we continue to rebuild growth momentum under the new management team. Due to continued economic uncertainty related to the impacts of COVID-19, we are not providing fiscal 2021 full year earnings guidance. This wraps up our formal comments. We will now be pleased to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJohn McNulty: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. First, my condolences to you and the RPM team with the passing of Tom who obviously left an amazing legacy behind.\nFrank Sullivan: Thanks, John.\nJohn McNulty: For sure. So, I guess the first question, because we've obviously seen some inflation in some of the raw materials and you made mention of it in some of the prepared remarks. Can you speak to the type or level of inflation you expect to see as you work through the rest of your fiscal year? And also speak to the ability that you have to price it through, so that you can offset some of those headwinds in a timely fashion?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So we're seeing some challenges in areas like silicones, epoxies, metal cans, and certain other raw material categories. We fully expect to offset those initially through the continuing benefits of our consolidated procurement activities, which have been providing, I think, leverage and benefits beyond what our original MAP to Growth expectations were. And then, while we're very stable in terms of pricing now, I think, it's highly likely that you will see across our industry some price increase activities this spring.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. Fair enough. And then I guess, you've got a number of new growth initiatives, you've got some grab and go programs coming on, you made mention of some of the investments even in new paint capacity. Can you speak to how programs are going at this point in terms of the growth and your expectation? And also, how you're thinking about the investment needed to drive these businesses?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. Number one, we're making the investment needed to drive these businesses as we speak today. We expanded capacity in consumer and a number of categories. We're also expanding capacity in our Construction Products Group. And we are making a not-so-subtle shift in our MAP to Growth activities to the growth aspect of it. I think you can see that most pronounced in our Construction Products Group, which actually had modestly positive organic growth in this quarter in a very challenged end market pretty much globally. And they have shifted to some major restoration activities. The combination of our Dryvit business, Nudura, the Tremco Roofing, Tremco Sealants and the spec efforts are paying big, big dividends and we would expect more of that to come particularly in any type of construction activity rebound. And so, you're seeing that we mentioned a few of the new product categories today. We are keenly focused on driving organic growth in the coming years. And at the same time, I think, Rusty made reference to the fact that, we would expect MAP to Growth, which is exceeding our expectations to continue to deliver additional savings as we get into fiscal 2022.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. Thanks very much for the color.\nFrank Sullivan: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Rosemarie Morbelli with G-Research. Your line is open.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Rosemarie.\nRosemarie Morbelli: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. And again, I will join up on my condolences regarding Tom's passing. Frank, we are all terribly sorry and I worked with him for many years more than I like to think about. Looking at your investments, what \u2013 which particular product lines are you thinking of growing. I mean, we face this, which product lines are you investing towards additional capacity in your different businesses?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. In consumer, we are investing in a small project paint capacity, aerosol capacity. We're also looking at gallon goods, and capacity and caulks and sealants, which are pretty much across the board. We're also expanding capacity and cleaning product categories. In our Construction Products Group, we're expanding capacity and roof restoration coatings, across a whole broad spectrum of areas and we're expanding capacity in facade restoration projects, so that range is across Nudura drive it in Tremco Sealant unique product categories. We're also expanding capacity and number of specialty products group businesses, particularly a legend brands in terms of their capacity for air filtration and air handling and restoration equipment. About the only area that we're not expanding capacity at this point is in our Performance Coatings Group, given the impact of the pandemic in oil and gas prices on some of their projects -- major product categories.\nRosemarie Morbelli: Do you see you need to eliminate some capacity on the Performance Coatings, as some categories may not go back to the pre-COVID level?\nFrank Sullivan: We would fully expect categories to get back to pre-COVID levels over the next coming years and that's been our history in the past. I will tell you we had been eliminating capacity across RPM as we highlighted in our pre-recorded or our formal remarks. We completed the closure of 25 manufacturing facilities. And I believe by the time that we're finished, we will exceed by a few the original 31 plant closures that we targeted in MAP to Growth. And so, we're having a very deliberate reallocation of capital into growth areas and into efficiency. So while we're expanding capacity, by the time we're done with MAP to Growth, our net manufacturing footprint around the globe will be smaller.\nRosemarie Morbelli: Thank you. And I was wondering if you could make some comments regarding your efforts towards adding architectural paint to your portfolio?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. We have commented in the past about a number of kind of unique category architectural paint opportunities that we've had across a number of our major customers. And in that, I think, we'll have a better sense of that this spring in the summer as we get through kind of the post-COVID supply challenges across numerous areas in the consumer DIY market.\nRosemarie Morbelli: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Your line is open.\nFrank Mitsch: Hey, good morning, and congrats on the quarter. More importantly, Frank, let me add to the condolences. I've mentioned before that I thought your eulogy was one of the best I've ever heard what an amazing man in life. And on a happier note, congrats on your browns and good luck on -- I don't know if it's Saturday or Sunday. but be nice to take care of the guys in Pittsburgh. You spoke a little bit about cash generation, record free cash flow and your strategic uses. Didn't hear much with respect to buybacks. And when might they resurface and/or what your pipeline is looking like on the M&A side? How do we think about the interplay for RPM on M&A versus buybacks?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So cash generation is at record levels, and it will continue that way for the foreseeable future combination of margin expansion, the capital allocation strategies we\u2019re deploying as well as just excellent working capital improvements. For the time being, we have indicated that we had suspended our share repurchase program in favor of debt reduction. We've been able to affect some meaningful debt reduction. Going forward, the pipeline of M&A activity and our industry is pretty full and growing. So we continue to pursue our typical small and medium size acquisition activity. And I think over the next 12 to 24 months, you'll see more transactions like the Ali Industry transaction we completed in the second quarter. As it relates to share repurchases, that's something that our Board will take up in Board meetings here this winter and the spring.\nFrank Sullivan: Got you. Got you. Obviously, the consumer business has been a standout, very strong sales. You mentioned that you're going to take the opportunity during the fiscal third quarter to rebuild inventories. Were there -- did you lose any sales you think on the consumer side? Because you were sold out? Could the results have been better? How do we think about what could have been in that regard?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes, clearly, we have lost some sales relative to go rates. It's not unique to us. It's impacted many DIY categories. As people know in our first quarter, we had organic growth and consumer of 34%. We had an organic growth in the second quarter and the mid-teens. We continue to see strong organic growth. And certainly there were some opportunities for us for additional growth and we've been able to fill, orders at a higher rate, as Rusty commented in our in that comment or not prepared remarks. We see catching up on a lot of activity in the third quarter. And I think we remain very bullish about both our position in the DIY market and where the DIY market will continue in terms of pretty strong growth for the foreseeable period of time in calendar. \u2019 21 \nFrank Mitsch: Got you. Many thanks.\nFrank Sullivan: Thanks, Frank.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Your line is open. \nGhansham Panjabi: Good morning, Ghansham.\nGhansham Panjabi: Hey, guys. Good morning. Happy New Year and Frank, my best to your family as well.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nGhansham Panjabi: Yes. So just given that your quarter ended in November, obviously lock downs have picked up in Europe. Since then, can you just give us a sense as to how things have progressed to December, what they're tracking, like in early January, across your businesses? And if anything is different from a pre-trend line, specific to the first lockdown across your business?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. That's, I think, a great question because the possibility exists for a lot of variability in our Q3. But we are off to a great start. Organic growth continues across our different businesses. The beginning of the third quarter, leverage from the bottom line has been tremendous. And we would expect to meet or exceed the forecast, numbers or the guidance numbers that Rusty provided in the formal comments that we made. What could interrupt that is further lockdowns. The U.K has lockdown into mid-February as you know. If that is followed by lockdowns throughout Europe and then back in the United States, certainly that could disrupt what otherwise would be another very strong quarter for RPM.\nGhansham Panjabi: Got it. And then in Performance, you called out for deferred maintenance in the energy sector. Can you give us a sense as to how that dynamic impacted you specific to the 12% sales decline you reported in the second quarter? And what's reasonable in terms of the catch-up phase? Because I assume it can\u2019t deferred for too long. Thanks.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I think the best way we can address that again was in the prepared remarks that Rusty made. We look back at calendar 2011, 2012 and we generated double-digit organic growth in our Performance Coatings Group businesses and our Construction Products Group businesses on the rebound. And certainly, in the Performance Coatings Group area, the negative impact, particularly in oil and gas, energy and heavy industry spending has been as severe as it was back then, and so we would expect a meaningful rebound in those categories on any economic recovery activity. And so I think we're really well poised there and you'll see in the coming quarters the benefits of the MAP to Growth activity on the performance Coatings Group. In this quarter, their earnings performance was negatively impacted by some unique circumstances around the hurricanes and weather activity that impacted the Gulf and their major manufacturing facility in Lake Charles, Louisiana. So, part of that earnings performance was circumstantial of the quarter. So we are pleased with where they are. The Construction Products Group, I think it has the opportunity to really drive our performance into fiscal '22. We are taking market share, we are introducing new product categories, we are combining prior independent businesses to attack facade restoration on a holistic basis. And so, there's a lot of exciting things happening there that again we would expect to see accelerate in the new type of economic recovery.\nGhansham Panjabi: Perfect. Thank you so much, Frank.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nVincent Andrews : Thank you and good morning, everyone. If I could just follow-up on the consumer business, a couple of questions. Are you noticing within the DIY customer, that the product mix that they're purchasing is evolving to the extent that maybe there's sort of a lifecycle where people that were early in DIY, were doing certain types of projects, and now six months later, they're doing different types of projects. But you're seeing a new cohort come in that sort of at the earlier stage, or just sort of any evaluation of the trends you're seeing that can help us understand your confidence and sort of the sustainability of this into the next fiscal year.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. Both in terms of what we've experienced and what we've heard from our major customers, the base of confident DIYers has expanded pretty significantly and certainly in ways that neither we are big customers could have accomplished in normal circumstances on our own. And a good example of that is our wood stains and finishes, businesses had the same type of robust organic growth as our small project paint business. And that requires a some more Craftsman skills and their larger projects. And so I think we're all pretty confident that this larger base is here to stay. And that we can grow from there. The one area that was meaningfully negatively impacted was the Pro. And so that might be 20% to 25% of our Rust-Oleum small project paints in cleaner categories. But closer to 40% or 50% of our DAP caulks and sealants and patch repair products, and resins or primers. And Pro contractors had been inhibited from gaining access to residences to the interior of residences, where most of our products are applied as well as its impact on some kind of small project, like commercial restoration. So we see that business coming back strongly once people have more confidence in putting the COVID pandemic behind us. And then the last comment I'll make are new categories that we've been testing. We have had three different opportunities, which are still ongoing to test new programs in architectural paint. And so you put all that together, and we're pretty bullish about our consumer business through this pandemic period.\nVincent Andrews : Okay, if I could just ask a follow-up on the alley acquisition. You mentioned that it's proceeding better than projected? Is that both on the top line and from the synergy perspective, or just any incremental color you can provide will be helpful.\nFrank Sullivan: Yes, it's both on the top line and what we're able to do with that business. Post MAP to Growth RPM to bring some more immediate value to businesses that we acquired. Our manufacturing and operations folks have been working with Ali on a look forward for 3 years in terms of some manufacturing, capacity expansion, and also some automation efficiency improvements. So we're excited about that. And the ability to take advantage of the sales and marketing expertise at Rust-Oleum, which I believe is as good as anybody in the entire DIY space across any category. It's pretty exciting as the Rust-Oleum sales and marketing folks, marry up with the Ali folks in terms of new opportunities and approaches.\nVincent Andrews : Thank you, and I'm sorry for your loss.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research. Your line is open.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Kevin.\nKevin McCarthy: Yes. Good morning. Frank, do you have any businesses were price declined in the fiscal second quarter. And then looking ahead as raw material costs come up, as you described, where would you say you're most confident -- confident and the ability to pass along those increases and where do you think it could be more challenging\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. We've had a period of price deflation that we've benefited from as well as the benefits of our consolidated purchasing activity, which is going quite well. -We have not had meaningful price givebacks in any category across anywhere at RPM. In terms of price increases, we've had some very modest price increases, and some very unique categories that aren't big enough to move the whole needle. Going forward, as I mentioned, this spring and the summer, meet the product categories that are most likely to be driving price increases across a number of our businesses are end packaging, especially as it relates to metal cans, as well as in a number of chemical areas, depending on how things transpire in the coming months. in the areas of silicones, epoxies, acetone, a number of categories that are seeing price increases, as we speak for the first time. It's worth keeping in mind from an RPM perspective, we were one of the few particularly in the U.S on FIFO accounting. So, the impact of these wouldn't hit our P&L for probably 60 to 90 days versus a lot of our peers. And we have the ability to both lead in some categories, but also following others in terms of what's happening in price increases across the market.\nKevin McCarthy: Okay. And then in terms of, I guess what I was trying to get at Frank is your ability to raise price to your customers and pass that along. Are there any areas that you would call out where you already may be out in the market with proposed increases, for example?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes, we do not have any price increases in the marketplace today. I anticipate price increases in the future. And our ability to pass on price is consistent with what it's always been relatively timely in our industrial businesses and typically with a 6 to 12-month lag in our consumer DIY businesses, I think some of that will be tightened just because of where we sit with a few product categories. But we have passed on price appropriately in the past, you can see that in our margin expansion throughout this period. And I don't see anything that changes those dynamics, both on the plus side, which is our ability to ultimately pass on price. And on the lag side in terms of the delay and timing that we've experienced for decades in our consumer DIY businesses.\nKevin McCarthy: Thank you for that. And then secondly, if I may. In consumer, Frank, what is the level of inventory that you would need to replenish and what impact could that have on sales and door margins? And what's normally a seasonally weak recorder for the business?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I would expect really strong performance out of consumer in our third quarter unless there is, as referenced earlier, some type of significant COVID impact which would impact everybody. But we anticipate continued strong performance there and into Q4 as well. Rusty referenced working capital and consumer, certainly we have tens of millions of dollars, low tens of millions of dollars of inventory to catch up on. And I think that's a good news story as well for the coming quarters.\nKevin McCarthy: Thanks for the comments. And Frank all the best to you and the family in 2021.\nFrank Sullivan: Thanks, Kevin.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Josh Spector with UBS. Your line is open.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning.\nJosh Spector: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up from a prior question quickly. Are you able to size the hurricane impact and performance on the top and bottom line in the quarter at all?\nFrank Sullivan: Well, I don't have those details. I don't know we have them. Rusty, is that something that you might be able to comment on?\nRusty Gordon: Yes. In terms of unusual expenses, it was a few million dollars of expenses. And in terms of sale, there was disruption from three hurricanes that pass either right through Lake Charles or nearby in the second quarter. So that did disrupt not just our plant, but our customers in the Gulf region. So, yes, there was some sales impact that definitely played into the decline you saw at PCG.\nFrank Sullivan: Yes, that's why I mentioned in my comments, it was circumstantial to the quarter. And actually, despite the very challenged end markets, the MAP to Growth benefits on the PCG segment pretty pronounced. And I think you'll see those in the coming quarters in a positive way.\nJosh Spector: Okay. Yes, I guess I'm trying to think about around this is you had 12% declines in performance in both last -- in both of the last two quarters. Is there a way to think about like, what the exit rate was or what the normalized demand was as we start to look at the next quarter and think about the recovery over the next couple of quarters?\nFrank Sullivan: I think you'll see the positive results as we get into our fiscal '22 in part because they'll be annualizing easier comps. But I do think with any economic recovery, there's a significant amount of pent-up maintenance and heavy industry spend that will be the beneficiaries of.\nJosh Spector: Okay. Thanks for that.\nFrank Sullivan: And I guess the last comment I'll make is, if you look at what we expect in Q3, and Q4 out of that segment, I think you'll get a better sense of the positive impact of MAP to Growth, even as revenues continue to be down year-over-year or flat. And it'll give you a better sense from a margin profile of what type of leverage we would have when positive sales results return.\nJosh Spector: Okay. I appreciate. That's helpful. And just one last quick one, if I can just on MAP to Growth and the savings that you expect to realize. I mean, you reiterated your run rate savings target here. Are you able to quantify how much savings you expect to be realized in fiscal '21 versus fiscal '22 at this point?\nFrank Sullivan: Again, I'll defer that to Rusty other than to say that we're highly confident that some of our ability to execute timely has been impacted by the COVID pandemic. But we're highly confident that as we get into fiscal '22 and continue to benefit from our MAP to Growth activities, that the total program savings will be well in excess of $300 million.\nRusty Gordon: Again, Josh, as we said on the last call, we expect $100 million or more of MAP savings to favorably impact FY '21.\nJosh Spector: Okay. Thank you.\nRusty Gordon: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital. Your line is open.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Arun.\nArun Viswanathan: Great. Good morning, Frank. Thanks for taking my question. And my condolences to you as well. I guess I just wanted to first ask about the consumer segment, the margin performance. If you think about it, Q1 '21 to Q2 '21, you had about close to 500 basis point margin drop off in EBIT percent. Obviously, there's a lot going on in there, but how would you kind of characterize that performance? Do you feel that the Consumer segment was potentially impacted by some of those stock outs and do you see the margins kind of recovering to higher levels in subsequent quarters?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I only address that broadly and then Rusty can address it in some detail. But all of our businesses, particularly our Consumer businesses are seasonal. And I think if you look year-over-year, we're continuing to see significant margin expansion. But obviously, from one subsequent quarter to the next as we get into our fourth quarter and first quarter, which are absolutely our seasonal highs and our second quarter and third quarter are meaningfully less in revenues, and there's a fixed level of expense. So that's what's driving the margin differential quarters over subsequent quarter. But we've continued to experience significant year-over-year margin improvement and we would expect that to continue. And I think Rusty could add a little more detail to that. \nRusty Gordon: Yes. That's correct, Frank. Yes, as we get into cooler months in the fall, sales typically fall off as they normally do. So, the fact that we had stronger sales and more leverage on fixed costs, Arun, would naturally lead to higher margin in Q1 and Q2. But when I look year-over-year, Consumers is up 450 basis points in EBIT in Q2, so I think we're doing pretty well.\nArun Viswanathan: Agreed. Thanks for that detail. And then on construction products, you guys alluded to potential opportunities coming your way to gain share. Do you believe that there is inorganic additions you have to make to your portfolio to capitalize on that, or could you potentially capture that share through some of these investments you've described as well?\nFrank Sullivan: So I believe we can and are capturing that share through the activities that we've taken. As we speak, there will be inorganic opportunities in that category, broader opportunities that may appear, but on a pretty regular basis product lines that we can acquire and expand across our distribution base. But fundamentally what happened in -- by going from our former six groups into the four groups and four segments, we have consolidated a number of businesses more completely into a more comprehensive construction products group. And so, we operated across the globe with maybe five or six different business units, we are now operating in North America and in Europe as a Tremco Construction Products Group. And pulling together for instance, Tremco sealants, the Nudura and the Dryvit businesses and approaching the market on an integrated basis is opening up opportunities for us and FACADE restoration that is driving organic growth that we were not experiencing the way we are organized in the past. So the biggest part of it has to do with reorganizing into a more integrated $2 billion construction products group, which from a market perspective is the Tremco Construction Products Group on a pretty integrated basis. We have exceptional leadership there. And we continue to take market share, whether it's in add mixtures shifting from different business units into a more integrated approach to the marketplace, it's something we're really excited about. There will be organic, there will be inorganic acquisition opportunities to accentuate that as well. But we do not need those to keep driving market share gains and organic growth.\nArun Viswanathan: Okay, thanks for that. And then real quickly lastly on the raw material front. You foresee any categories, things specifically like MMA and/or epoxies, where you potentially could face some supply chain disruptions or availability issues that you're concerned about? Or do you feel okay, with the overall level of inventory that you have in your raw material procurement?\nFrank Sullivan: So we have over the last few quarters and months facings challenges in certain packaging areas, and particularly in metal cans. We have faced some challenges in silicones. A lot of those categories in terms of availability are being cleaned up. So I don't think we have the same concerns going forward as we've had over the last couple of quarters in those categories. And so I think that's certainly an observant comment about what's happened in a couple categories, particularly for us in some packaging areas and silicones.\nArun Viswanathan: Great, thank you. Good luck in the quarter.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nRusty Gordon: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike Harrison with Seaport Global. Your line is open.\nFrank Sullivan: Hi, Mike.\nMike Harrison: Thank you and our condolences to you and your family, Frank.\nFrank Sullivan: Thanks.\nMike Harrison: You mentioned the management change that occurred in the Specialty segment and talked about some new ideas, new processes around business development. Can you give a little more color on what changes have been made there and your confidence in sustainability of improving results in that business?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. We have a new segment leader who's been in charge of that group for just about two years. And Ronnie Holman who's done a great job. Ronnie started as a leader of our R&D effort in a $15 million wood coatings businesses that was acquired by RPM probably 30 years ago, and helped grow our OEM coatings businesses to nearly $300 million and he is now in charge of this larger group. We have new leadership, the Day-Glo. We have new leadership coming at our Mantrose-Haeuser business. We have reorganized a new leadership across our Valvtect and Pettit Marine and really excited about what's happening there. And so there's been a number of leadership changes there that have consolidated accounting administration not only from a cost perspective, but take those administrative functions away from essentially business leaders that are refocused on growth. We have also changed our mentality at RPM. My father Tom and his partner Jim Karman for decades, we just did not use outside consultants. We've had a lot of success, both with our teams, and the good work of some consultants in the MAP to Growth program. And I mentioned that because something that we would not have done in the past we're doing today. We hired McKinsey to work with our Day-Glo team and our Mantrose-Haeuser specialty food business teams focused on market sizing and market opportunities. So the shift that I mentioned earlier in terms of really focusing our businesses on growth, as well as sustaining and implementing the MAP to Growth cultural changes with RPM are happening. And I think the thing that we're most excited about big picture, our primary goal in MAP to Growth was to get it efficiencies that were there to have to change our culture to be focused not only in growth but on efficiency, but do it in a way that did not meaningfully negatively impact our entrepreneurial culture. And so far, we have been able to do that, and it's paying dividends and I think people are going to see that in the coming quarters across RPM, particularly in the Construction Products Group, and particularly in our Specialty Products Group.\nMike Harrison: All right. That's very helpful. And then also wanted to ask about the online sales portal, your online sales efforts. That was an area that you were kind of struggling with last season. I was wondering if you've made some changes or progress in those online sales that should enable you to better leverage potential demand to the bottom line as we get into the busier season in 2021?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. And again, Rusty may have some more detail. I could tell you, particularly in our Consumer group, our ability to service online ordering has improved dramatically. And we have seen significant improvement, and huge percentage gains, but they're on a small base. But improvement in our ability to fulfill and meaningful growth in some of our big box customers and more traditional online customers like Amazon.\nRusty Gordon: Yes, our growth in online sales is not quite double, but it's probably up close to 80% this year. And your question is very perceptive, because we are focusing a lot of our operating improvement team initiatives in the area of distribution. So I think we're going to continue to improve that this year, because you're right, the landscape has shifted.\nMike Harrison: All right. Thanks very much.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nFrank Sullivan: Hey, Michael.\nMichael Sison: Hey, guys. My condolences to you Frank as well. And just wanted to say I always enjoyed meeting with Tom during the fall days back, and then those were all fun meetings.\nFrank Sullivan: Yes. Thanks a lot.\nMichael Sison: But just one quick question. The first half of '21 free cash flow was above $500 million and it looks like you'll generate some free cash flow in the second half of the year. So is this sort of $600 million plus type free cash flow potential, kind of the right run rate that RPM can generate on an ongoing basis going forward?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes, big picture and again details like I'll turn it over to Rusty. But big picture, I think we have gotten RPM to a new level of cash generation, both in terms of working capital requirements on a go-forward basis as well as our margin profiles. And we're excited about that. I think Rusty can provide more details as it relates to fiscal '21 and beyond.\nRusty Gordon: Sure. Yes, you might remember Mike on Investor Day, we\u2019ve showed a slide that said our cash from operations, our target was $872 million, I believe. And if you look over the last 12 months, we're running over $800 million of cash flow from operations for the trailing 12 months. So we're pretty close to that. If you look at the dividend and the capital spending, this year we'll do over $140 million of capital spending. I think the dividend is pushing close to $200 million. So to answer your question on free cash flow, at the rate we're running, yes, we're certainly over $400 million of free cash flow. It's hard to take the last 12 months as any guide for what normal is because of the pandemic. For example, we have deferred some government payments for about $25 million, including the payroll tax. We have drawn down inventories, but other businesses, as we discussed, are suffering because of the pandemic. So it's tough to use the last 12 months as a guide, but we appear to be tracking towards that MAP target.\nMichael Sison: Right. Thank you.\nFrank Sullivan: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Steve.\nSteve Byrne: Yes. Thank you. Can you quantify how much discretionary spending cuts were in the quarter and what portion of that might reverse?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes, I'll defer that detail to Rusty again. But big picture, we have had some meaningful reductions in discretionary spending that's associated with a pandemic that will come back. I can tell you that you'll see and this is part of our guidance, a more normal spend in our Consumer Group in terms of advertising and promotion in the third and fourth quarter in the spring. So that's already coming back and part of our outlook. And while some of it will return, part of it was just lucky, in terms of coinciding with our MAP to Growth activities, because across a number of our businesses, there will be a kind of a new level of discretionary spend that will be below probably even where we originally targeted in MAP to Growth.\nRusty Gordon: Yes, in terms of the biggest area of standard travel costs, so we're probably saving somewhere around north of $10 million a quarter in travel costs. And like Frank said, with the new world we're in today, we're finding that we can accomplish a lot of things without travel with video conferencing. So I don't think necessarily all of that will come back. In the spring, we talked about medical costs going down, because nobody went to the doctor, that's been back to normal this year. So that's another area you might be interested in.\nSteve Byrne: And since you brought up MAP to Growth in that response, so just wanted to drill into that on a couple of fronts. One being, how much of that $300 million target or maybe what you can say how much of the savings you've achieved so far will from MAP to Growth? Would you say that was risen from lower raw material costs?\nFrank Sullivan: Rusty can check me on this. I would say, I don't know, $50 million or $60 million is maybe lower raw material costs and the balances from our specific activities, the -- and that certainly is part of a centralized procurement function that in combination with lower raws has exceeded our expectations. And then the other area that we've commented on was our original target for manufacturing operations between plant consolidation and efficiency gains was $75 million bucks and will exceed $100 million in that category.\nRusty Gordon: Yes, I think the question might be about the commodity cycle, assumption and MAP, and we assumed $145 million of procurement savings and we said, I believe, $65 million in Wave 3 would be related to the commodity cycle.\nSteve Byrne: That all seem right to you, Rusty?\nRusty Gordon: Yep. Yep.\nSteve Byrne: And then just one last one for you, Frank. As you close out this MAP to Growth initiative, is it reasonable to think that you might introduce kind of the next plan, anything that you have learned from this initiative that might lead you down a new path of productivity initiatives?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. We'll -- I think we'll be in a better position to address that with some specifics. In July, when we talk about guidance for fiscal '22 and kind of maybe a longer term post MAP to Growth outlook, but clearly there are elements of the MAP to Growth program that are here to stay. The MS 168 element of manufacturing operations, our ability to be a more strategic partner to large global suppliers and what we're doing on the sales front as well are something that we'll be able to talk about. And we've been able to put in procedures, just a little in the weeds. But what came out of MAP to Growth was a very detailed, what we call MPGT, which is -- MPGT, which is the I'm sorry, MPST, which is the MAP project savings tracker. And so we've been able to track literally thousands of categories of savings across procurement across SG&A and efficiency and we're taking some of those disciplines into a growth process as well. And we'll be able to talk more about that both in terms of what we're doing and the impact it's having this summer.\nSteve Byrne: Very good. Thank you.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: And your last question comes from Silke Kueck with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Silke.\nSilke Kueck: Hi, good morning. I'm also old enough to remember Tom Sullivan. And so, I'm sorry to hear about his passing. But I'm glad I got to know him.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you very much.\nSilke Kueck: I have two questions. One on the Consumer segment and one of the Construction segment. In the Consumer segment, is there a way to quantify -- just in ballpark terms, what the benefit of COVID-related sales may have been in the quarter? Whether that's something that's like $10 million or something that's mid-single digit? Or is there any way to think about it?\nFrank Sullivan: Rusty might have a better answer than I do. The only thing I can tell you is historically solid organic growth in Consumer has been in the 5% or 6% range. So clearly, a 34% organic growth in the first quarter in mid-teens organic growth in Q2 is extraordinary relative to historic levels.\nRusty Gordon: Yes, I think the best way to think about it, Silke, is to look at the comp store sales numbers out of Lowe's and Home Depot. They've been running over 20%. And you could compare that to more normalized base. I think that would be probably the best way to think about it.\nSilke Kueck: Right. And that leads to -- so, I've had a follow-up question on Consumer. That is Lowe's have announced, thinking about like the year ahead on a calendar basis, and I think their view is that the U.S. home improvement market maybe down -- I don't know -- 5% or 7% in calendar 2021. Is that the way you too see it, and it's sort of like -- is it like a similar alignment for RPM in the Product Consumer business specifically?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes. First of all, that is not how we see it. We would expect to see continued double-digit growth in the first part of the calendar or first 4 or 5 months of calendar '21. And then I expect from what we're seeing to see positive growth rates for the balance of the year. And Lowe's perspective, that you referenced, is not universal across our customer base. We have some significant customers that see continued expansion in the DIY market, albeit at a lower pace.\nSilke Kueck: Okay, helpful. And my question on the Construction segment is the -- that the margin improvement in the Construction segment has been pretty high with the MAP program even though the sales growth has been slow. And the fourth quarter is typically the largest quarter for the Construction segment and the comparisons are relatively easy as you pointed out. And so, like do you think that that business in the fourth quarter can approach margins that are something like 20% if you all of a sudden had good volume growth?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I'm going to give you a dodge on that question for two reasons. Number one, we're really not providing details on our fourth quarter. We'll do so in April. But secondly, it's really going to be hard to tell. We had -- we should add some easier comps, particularly in April and May. As you see in this quarter, the leverage to the bottom line out of our Construction Products Group is pretty extraordinary. And I would expect that leverage to continue, at least directionally in what you're talking about, when they start to post organic growth that's in the mid-single digits, which recovery is coming.\nSilke Kueck: Okay. Thanks very much.\nFrank Sullivan: Thanks, Silke.\nOperator: And now I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Sullivan for closing remarks.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you. As always, I'm grateful for the hard work and dedication of our associates around the world. It's through their efforts that we found ways to safely operate our businesses, meet our customer's needs, develop new innovative solutions and serve the communities in which we operate. I also greatly appreciate our shareholders for their continued investment in RPM. We remain focused on generating long-term value for you. We learned over decades that the market that are used growth over efficiency. And what we've learned in MAP to Growth is that we can do both. We expect to continue to do both. Finally, to everyone on the call, I wish you and your families a happy and healthy New Year. We look forward to updating you on our fiscal 2021 third quarter results in April. Thank you for your investment in RPM and for joining our conference call this morning. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Matt Ratajczak",
            "content": "Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. Please note that my comments will be on an as adjusted basis. During the second quarter, we generated record consolidated net sales of $1.49 billion, an increase of 6% compared to the $1.4 billion reported during the same quarter of fiscal 2020. Organic sales increased 3.5%, or $49.5 million. Acquisitions contributed 2.3% to sales, or $32.6 million. Foreign exchange was a tailwind that increased sales by 0.2%, or $2.5 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.6, an increase of 39.5% compared to $0.76 in the year ago quarter. Our consolidated adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, EBIT, increased 29.7% to $199.3 million compared to $153.7 million reported in the fiscal 2020 second quarter. Turning now to our segment results. Sales in our Construction Products Group increased 0.8% to $503.5 million compared to $499.5 million a year ago. Organic sales increased 1.2% or $6.1 million. There was no impact from acquisitions. Foreign currency translation reduced sales by 0.4% or $2.1 million. Adjusted EBIT in the Construction Products Group increased 26.8% to $78.5 million from adjusted EBIT of $61.9 million reported in the year ago period. The segment was able to leverage its modest sales growth into outstanding results on the bottom line, largely due to MAP to Growth initiatives, aggressive discretionary cost cuts and proactive management to improve its product mix. This was achieved despite soft commercial and institutional construction markets in North America and in Europe.  The segment was able to maintain its top line by focusing on renovation and restoration projects, expanding its position as a single source provider of building envelope systems and continuing to take market share with its industry leading construction technologies, including its Nudura insulated concrete forms Sales in our Performance Coatings Group decreased 11.6% to $258.8 million from $292.7 million a year ago. Organic sales declined to 12.2% or $35.6 million. Acquisitions contributed $0.6 million or 0.2% to sales. Foreign exchange increased sales 0.4% or $1.1 million. The segment's adjusted EBIT was down 24.2% to $28 million compared to $37 million in the prior year period. Similar to last quarter, the Performance Coatings Group's sales continue to be impacted by COVID-19 restrictions that limited access to construction sites, and also by weak energy markets that have resulted in a deferral of industrial maintenance spending. Industrial capital spending has been restricted, especially in the energy sector, which is the largest market for our industrial corrosion control and fireproofing coatings businesses. The segment was particularly challenged in emerging markets, and its Carboline business was temporarily disrupted by hurricanes in the Gulf region of the U.S. The segment's earnings were impacted by declining sales, partially offset by MAP to Growth savings and discretionary cost reductions. Out of all of our segments, the Performance Coatings Group has been unfavorably affected the most by the pandemic. However, it also stands to benefit significantly from the pandemics end as its customers catch up on deferred maintenance and construction projects. The unprecedented demand for our consumer products continued this quarter, resulting in a significant increase in sales for our Consumer group. They increase 21.4% to $547.5 million from $450.9 million in the fiscal 2020 second quarter. Organic sales increased 15.2% or $68.6 million. Acquisitions contributed $26 million or 5.8% of sales. Foreign currency translation increased sales by 0.4% or $2 million. Adjusted EBIT in the Consumer group increased 65.8% to $90.7 million compared to $54.7 million in last year's second quarter. Our Consumer group's outstanding performance was driven by our broad distribution, and by leveraging our market leading position as homebound consumers tackled significantly more projects. We are investing in paint making and aerosol filling capacity to help meet this demand. The top line also benefited from vigorous cleaning product sales, favorable translational foreign exchange, and the acquisition of Ali Industries. Raw material costs were stable overall during the quarter. However, we are currently seeing broad based inflation in a number of raw materials. High sales volumes and MAP to Growth savings were leveraged to the segment's strong bottom line. Specialty Products Group sales were $176.1 million, an increase of 11.3% compared to $158.2 million in the year ago period. Organic sales increased 6.6% or $10.4 million. Acquisitions contributed 3.8% or $6 million to sales. Foreign currency translation increased sales by 0.9% or $1.5 million. Adjusted EBIT in this segment increased 27.7% to $29.6 million this quarter, compared to $23.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Management changes that we implemented at the Specialty Products Group have helped to turn around results at the segment this quarter. Sales were boosted by increased hurricane and wildfire fire activity, which drove demand for our water restoration equipment as well as fluorescent pigments which are used in fire retardant tracer dyes. Additionally, we continue to experience strong demand for our expanding product lineup of disinfectants, air purification equipment and HEPA filters. Several of the segment's end markets have improved. For example, sales of its industrial wood protection products increased as a result of improved lumber demand in the U.S., and we have expanded sales in our forestry chemicals business in Australia and New Zealand. The segment's bottom line increased as a result of higher sales volumes, operational improvements and MAP to Growth savings."

            "content": "Now, Rusty will walk you through our outlook. Thanks, Matt. As we look ahead to the fiscal 2021 third quarter, we anticipate consolidated sales growth in the mid-single-digit range with continued strong leverage to the bottom line from our MAP to Growth program, resulting in adjusted EBIT growth of 30% or more. Our third quarter typically provides relatively modest sales activity each year, because it falls during the winter months when painting and construction activity slow. As a result, there is typically greater volatility in percentage terms, given the unpredictable weather. Also, this seasonal reduction of activity will benefit our consumer segment, enabling it to replenish retail inventory after working to meet unprecedented demand over the last 6 months. From a segment perspective, we expect fiscal 2021 third quarter sales to be flat to negative in the Construction Products Group. This group will continue to outperform its peers in a challenging construction market by continuing to focus upon building restoration and renovation with innovative products and service solutions. We expect the sales declined to continue in the Performance Coatings Group, which serves the most challenged end markets at RPM. We expect the Consumer group to continue to leverage its market leading position into double-digit sales growth due to a number of factors including number one continuation of strong POS results. Number two, more shelf restocking after retail inventories have dropped due to unprecedented demand; and number three, continued benefit on both the top and bottom line from the Ali acquisition, which is performing better than we anticipated. We expect positive sales growth from the Specialty Products Group to continue into the third quarter as well. New management has brought fresh ideas and processes for business development, and their OEM customer base has recovered as manufacturing is picked back up from the shutdowns last spring. Additionally, RPM's cash flow has soared to new highs due to margin improvement and better working capital management as well as the unprecedented consumer demand, which has drawn down our consumer inventory. A portion of this working capital reduction will not be sustained. Since we will need to rebuild Consumer group inventory. Across all of RPM, there is so much work to do to improve our manufacturing flexibility and planning processes that will help us simultaneously serve our customers, while reducing the necessary safety stock levels. Sales in all four segments should be up in the fiscal 2021 fourth quarter, due to an easier comparison to last year's fourth quarter, which is when the economic interruption caused by the pandemic was most severe. With recent optimism surrounding the vaccines for COVID-19, let me spend a moment to tell you about what life getting back to normal means for our four segments. For consumer, we would expect DIY activity to return to more normalized levels as people venture out of their homes. But we still anticipate elevated demand due to the expectation of continued low interest rates, good housing turnover, and expanded end user base since more DIYers have recently entered the category and our Consumer Pro business picking up again as contractors gain access more often to residences. We also believe that cleaning is an area of greater consumer interest as we go forward. For our CPG and PCG segments, getting back to normal will improve facility access for our contractors, and likely improve construction activity from what has been a challenging 2020 calendar year. We would also expect a boomerang effect in the future as deferred maintenance catches up. For those who followed RPM in the last great recession, you'll recall that our former industrial segment experienced double digit growth in 2011 and 2012 from the catch up at deferred maintenance. For SPG, we continue to rebuild growth momentum under the new management team. Due to continued economic uncertainty related to the impacts of COVID-19, we are not providing fiscal 2021 full year earnings guidance. This wraps up our formal comments. We will now be pleased to take your questions. Yes. In terms of unusual expenses, it was a few million dollars of expenses. And in terms of sale, there was disruption from three hurricanes that pass either right through Lake Charles or nearby in the second quarter. So that did disrupt not just our plant, but our customers in the Gulf region. So, yes, there was some sales impact that definitely played into the decline you saw at PCG. Again, Josh, as we said on the last call, we expect $100 million or more of MAP savings to favorably impact FY '21. Sure. Yes. That's correct, Frank. Yes, as we get into cooler months in the fall, sales typically fall off as they normally do. So, the fact that we had stronger sales and more leverage on fixed costs, Arun, would naturally lead to higher margin in Q1 and Q2. But when I look year-over-year, Consumers is up 450 basis points in EBIT in Q2, so I think we're doing pretty well. Thank you. Yes, our growth in online sales is not quite double, but it's probably up close to 80% this year. And your question is very perceptive, because we are focusing a lot of our operating improvement team initiatives in the area of distribution. So I think we're going to continue to improve that this year, because you're right, the landscape has shifted. Sure. Yes, you might remember Mike on Investor Day, we've showed a slide that said our cash from operations, our target was $872 million, I believe. And if you look over the last 12 months, we're running over $800 million of cash flow from operations for the trailing 12 months. So we're pretty close to that. If you look at the dividend and the capital spending, this year we'll do over $140 million of capital spending. I think the dividend is pushing close to $200 million. So to answer your question on free cash flow, at the rate we're running, yes, we're certainly over $400 million of free cash flow. It's hard to take the last 12 months as any guide for what normal is because of the pandemic. For example, we have deferred some government payments for about $25 million, including the payroll tax. We have drawn down inventories, but other businesses, as we discussed, are suffering because of the pandemic. So it's tough to use the last 12 months as a guide, but we appear to be tracking towards that MAP target. Yes, in terms of the biggest area of standard travel costs, so we're probably saving somewhere around north of $10 million a quarter in travel costs. And like Frank said, with the new world we're in today, we're finding that we can accomplish a lot of things without travel with video conferencing. So I don't think necessarily all of that will come back. In the spring, we talked about medical costs going down, because nobody went to the doctor, that's been back to normal this year. So that's another area you might be interested in. Yes, I think the question might be about the commodity cycle, assumption and MAP, and we assumed $145 million of procurement savings and we said, I believe, $65 million in Wave 3 would be related to the commodity cycle. Yep. Yep. Yes, I think the best way to think about it, Silke, is to look at the comp store sales numbers out of Lowe's and Home Depot. They've been running over 20%. And you could compare that to more normalized base. I think that would be probably the best way to think about it."

            "name": "Frank Sullivan",
            "content": "Thank you, Denise. Happy New Year and welcome to the RPM International Inc. investor call for our fiscal 2021 second quarter. Joining me on today's call are Rusty Gordon, RPM's Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Matt Ratajczak, our Vice President of Global Tax and Treasury, who is also supporting our Investor Relation activities. I'll take a few moments to provide an overview of the factors driving our strong financial performance for the quarter, and also share an update on our MAP to Growth operating improvement program. Matt will then review our second quarter financial results in detail, and then Rusty will wrap up with our formal remarks with an outlook for the third quarter of our fiscal 2021 year. After which we'll take your questions. I'm very pleased to report that we generated record sales, earnings and cash flow for our second quarter. The excellent performance was achieved largely due to the efforts of our associates to grow our top line, which was achieved by three out of our four segments, despite challenging economic conditions worldwide, coupled with operational efficiency improvement activities. The MAP to Growth initiative once again generated strong leverage to the bottom line and moderate sales growth of 6%. Organic sales grew in a broad range of categories, including cleaning, disinfecting products, air purification equipment, small project paints, OEM coatings and other areas. Acquisitions also contributed to sales, including the second quarter edition of Ali Industries, which is best known for its Gator brand of abrasive products. Ali is the largest acquisition we've made since fiscal 2013 and positively impacted both sales and earnings in the quarter, while also demonstrating our renewed focus to invest in growth initiatives. Foreign currency translation also added to sales as international markets, particularly those in Europe, showed improvement. On an adjusted basis, our consolidated EBIT margin increased 240 basis points to 13.4% during the quarter, driven by three of our four segments registering substantial EBIT margin improvements and high EBIT growth. This was even more impressive given a tough comparison last year when adjusted EBIT increased 22%. Our consumer business continues to lead the way driven by unprecedented consumer demand for its small project paints, caulks, sealants, stains and cleaners, while our other segments are finding ways to compete and win in the markets they serve. Our businesses remained focused on growth and are continuing to develop new innovative solutions for our customers. One example is DAP's Eclipse Rapid Wall Repair Patch, which is just introduced and was developed to quickly fix most common drywall damage with simple mess -- very mess free repair. And other is Carboline's Pyrocrete 341, a next generation cementitious coating for passive fire protection. With enhanced application properties and excellent durability, Pyrocrete 341 positions Carboline as a market leader in fire \u2013 in passive fire protection. In addition, our Construction Products Group recently introduced a suite of products that will keep us working this winter in temperatures as low as minus 20 degrees Fahrenheit, including AlphaGuard PUMA and Vulkem EWS waterproofing coatings, which are used to protect roofs and concrete. And in a challenging construction market, our Construction Products Group continues to focus on renovation is exemplified by its Spectrum Simple Seal for fac\u0327ade restoration. And one recent residential tower in Minnesota, a complete window replacement was estimated to cost $15 million. Tremco won the job by recommending its Spectrum Simple solution which was used to restore the fac\u0327ade at a cost of only $1 million. We expect significantly more of this restoration product project sales. Our MAP to Growth program continues to have tremendous momentum. During the second quarter, we announced the closure of two plants, which brings our total to 25 out of the 31 plants that were originally targeted for closure at the start of the program. We're also becoming much more efficient in utilizing our manufacturing assets as our focused improvement team meetings continue to deliver cost savings opportunities. One example is a Dryvit manufacturing engineer recently trained in Six Sigma principles, who identified process improvements to reduce scrap and increase yields, which will result in $250,000 in annual savings. There are literally hundreds of other continuous improvement examples like this across RPM, as we have invested in training our operations associates throughout the MAP to Growth program. In addition, the targeted benefits from our center-led procurement initiatives are ahead of plan and our administrative improvements in ERP consolidations are continuing to be implemented. As mentioned last quarter, we expect that we will reach the MAP to Growth programs planned run rate of $290 million in annualized savings by the inclusion of this fiscal year. That said to our culture of continuous improvement, we continue to add to our robust pipeline of cost savings initiatives and operational improvements that will carry into fiscal 2022 and beyond, and will ultimately result in exceeding our original MAP to Growth expectations. Based on our improved margins and better working capital management, our business units generated record cash from operations, which increased 93% to $580 million. We've been strategic in managing this record cash flow, using it to pay down debt, make acquisitions and an increase in our cash reserve. At quarter-end, total liquidity stood at $1.6 billion, making our balance sheet stronger than it's been in a long time. One final comment I'd like to make relates to my predecessor, Tom Sullivan, who is also my father and mentor who passed away on November 30. I share this because he had a tremendous influence on shaping the RPM of today. He took over the business in 1971 after his father died unexpectedly. At that time, RPM sales were $11 million. Following a 55-year career with RPM, Tom retired from our Board in 2016 when annual sales had reached nearly $5 billion. His leadership engrained practices within the organization to continue to perpetuate our growth and success and his spirit continues to drive RPM. I'll now turn the call over to Matt Ratajczak, who will review our fiscal 2021 second quarter financial results in more detail. Thanks, John. Sure. So we're seeing some challenges in areas like silicones, epoxies, metal cans, and certain other raw material categories. We fully expect to offset those initially through the continuing benefits of our consolidated procurement activities, which have been providing, I think, leverage and benefits beyond what our original MAP to Growth expectations were. And then, while we're very stable in terms of pricing now, I think, it's highly likely that you will see across our industry some price increase activities this spring. Sure. Number one, we're making the investment needed to drive these businesses as we speak today. We expanded capacity in consumer and a number of categories. We're also expanding capacity in our Construction Products Group. And we are making a not-so-subtle shift in our MAP to Growth activities to the growth aspect of it. I think you can see that most pronounced in our Construction Products Group, which actually had modestly positive organic growth in this quarter in a very challenged end market pretty much globally. And they have shifted to some major restoration activities. The combination of our Dryvit business, Nudura, the Tremco Roofing, Tremco Sealants and the spec efforts are paying big, big dividends and we would expect more of that to come particularly in any type of construction activity rebound. And so, you're seeing that we mentioned a few of the new product categories today. We are keenly focused on driving organic growth in the coming years. And at the same time, I think, Rusty made reference to the fact that, we would expect MAP to Growth, which is exceeding our expectations to continue to deliver additional savings as we get into fiscal 2022. Thanks, John. Good morning, Rosemarie. Sure. In consumer, we are investing in a small project paint capacity, aerosol capacity. We're also looking at gallon goods, and capacity and caulks and sealants, which are pretty much across the board. We're also expanding capacity and cleaning product categories. In our Construction Products Group, we're expanding capacity and roof restoration coatings, across a whole broad spectrum of areas and we're expanding capacity in facade restoration projects, so that range is across Nudura drive it in Tremco Sealant unique product categories. We're also expanding capacity and number of specialty products group businesses, particularly a legend brands in terms of their capacity for air filtration and air handling and restoration equipment. About the only area that we're not expanding capacity at this point is in our Performance Coatings Group, given the impact of the pandemic in oil and gas prices on some of their projects -- major product categories. We would fully expect categories to get back to pre-COVID levels over the next coming years and that's been our history in the past. I will tell you we had been eliminating capacity across RPM as we highlighted in our pre-recorded or our formal remarks. We completed the closure of 25 manufacturing facilities. And I believe by the time that we're finished, we will exceed by a few the original 31 plant closures that we targeted in MAP to Growth. And so, we're having a very deliberate reallocation of capital into growth areas and into efficiency. So while we're expanding capacity, by the time we're done with MAP to Growth, our net manufacturing footprint around the globe will be smaller. Sure. We have commented in the past about a number of kind of unique category architectural paint opportunities that we've had across a number of our major customers. And in that, I think, we'll have a better sense of that this spring in the summer as we get through kind of the post-COVID supply challenges across numerous areas in the consumer DIY market. Sure. So cash generation is at record levels, and it will continue that way for the foreseeable future combination of margin expansion, the capital allocation strategies we're deploying as well as just excellent working capital improvements. For the time being, we have indicated that we had suspended our share repurchase program in favor of debt reduction. We've been able to affect some meaningful debt reduction. Going forward, the pipeline of M&A activity and our industry is pretty full and growing. So we continue to pursue our typical small and medium size acquisition activity. And I think over the next 12 to 24 months, you'll see more transactions like the Ali Industry transaction we completed in the second quarter. As it relates to share repurchases, that's something that our Board will take up in Board meetings here this winter and the spring. Got you. Got you. Obviously, the consumer business has been a standout, very strong sales. You mentioned that you're going to take the opportunity during the fiscal third quarter to rebuild inventories. Were there -- did you lose any sales you think on the consumer side? Because you were sold out? Could the results have been better? How do we think about what could have been in that regard? Yes, clearly, we have lost some sales relative to go rates. It's not unique to us. It's impacted many DIY categories. As people know in our first quarter, we had organic growth and consumer of 34%. We had an organic growth in the second quarter and the mid-teens. We continue to see strong organic growth. And certainly there were some opportunities for us for additional growth and we've been able to fill, orders at a higher rate, as Rusty commented in our in that comment or not prepared remarks. We see catching up on a lot of activity in the third quarter. And I think we remain very bullish about both our position in the DIY market and where the DIY market will continue in terms of pretty strong growth for the foreseeable period of time in calendar. ' 21 Thanks, Frank. Thank you. Sure. That's, I think, a great question because the possibility exists for a lot of variability in our Q3. But we are off to a great start. Organic growth continues across our different businesses. The beginning of the third quarter, leverage from the bottom line has been tremendous. And we would expect to meet or exceed the forecast, numbers or the guidance numbers that Rusty provided in the formal comments that we made. What could interrupt that is further lockdowns. The U.K has lockdown into mid-February as you know. If that is followed by lockdowns throughout Europe and then back in the United States, certainly that could disrupt what otherwise would be another very strong quarter for RPM. Sure. I think the best way we can address that again was in the prepared remarks that Rusty made. We look back at calendar 2011, 2012 and we generated double-digit organic growth in our Performance Coatings Group businesses and our Construction Products Group businesses on the rebound. And certainly, in the Performance Coatings Group area, the negative impact, particularly in oil and gas, energy and heavy industry spending has been as severe as it was back then, and so we would expect a meaningful rebound in those categories on any economic recovery activity. And so I think we're really well poised there and you'll see in the coming quarters the benefits of the MAP to Growth activity on the performance Coatings Group. In this quarter, their earnings performance was negatively impacted by some unique circumstances around the hurricanes and weather activity that impacted the Gulf and their major manufacturing facility in Lake Charles, Louisiana. So, part of that earnings performance was circumstantial of the quarter. So we are pleased with where they are. The Construction Products Group, I think it has the opportunity to really drive our performance into fiscal '22. We are taking market share, we are introducing new product categories, we are combining prior independent businesses to attack facade restoration on a holistic basis. And so, there's a lot of exciting things happening there that again we would expect to see accelerate in the new type of economic recovery. Thank you. Sure. Both in terms of what we've experienced and what we've heard from our major customers, the base of confident DIYers has expanded pretty significantly and certainly in ways that neither we are big customers could have accomplished in normal circumstances on our own. And a good example of that is our wood stains and finishes, businesses had the same type of robust organic growth as our small project paint business. And that requires a some more Craftsman skills and their larger projects. And so I think we're all pretty confident that this larger base is here to stay. And that we can grow from there. The one area that was meaningfully negatively impacted was the Pro. And so that might be 20% to 25% of our Rust-Oleum small project paints in cleaner categories. But closer to 40% or 50% of our DAP caulks and sealants and patch repair products, and resins or primers. And Pro contractors had been inhibited from gaining access to residences to the interior of residences, where most of our products are applied as well as its impact on some kind of small project, like commercial restoration. So we see that business coming back strongly once people have more confidence in putting the COVID pandemic behind us. And then the last comment I'll make are new categories that we've been testing. We have had three different opportunities, which are still ongoing to test new programs in architectural paint. And so you put all that together, and we're pretty bullish about our consumer business through this pandemic period. Yes, it's both on the top line and what we're able to do with that business. Post MAP to Growth RPM to bring some more immediate value to businesses that we acquired. Our manufacturing and operations folks have been working with Ali on a look forward for 3 years in terms of some manufacturing, capacity expansion, and also some automation efficiency improvements. So we're excited about that. And the ability to take advantage of the sales and marketing expertise at Rust-Oleum, which I believe is as good as anybody in the entire DIY space across any category. It's pretty exciting as the Rust-Oleum sales and marketing folks, marry up with the Ali folks in terms of new opportunities and approaches. Thank you. Good morning, Kevin. Sure. We've had a period of price deflation that we've benefited from as well as the benefits of our consolidated purchasing activity, which is going quite well. -We have not had meaningful price givebacks in any category across anywhere at RPM. In terms of price increases, we've had some very modest price increases, and some very unique categories that aren't big enough to move the whole needle. Going forward, as I mentioned, this spring and the summer, meet the product categories that are most likely to be driving price increases across a number of our businesses are end packaging, especially as it relates to metal cans, as well as in a number of chemical areas, depending on how things transpire in the coming months. in the areas of silicones, epoxies, acetone, a number of categories that are seeing price increases, as we speak for the first time. It's worth keeping in mind from an RPM perspective, we were one of the few particularly in the U.S on FIFO accounting. So, the impact of these wouldn't hit our P&L for probably 60 to 90 days versus a lot of our peers. And we have the ability to both lead in some categories, but also following others in terms of what's happening in price increases across the market. Yes, we do not have any price increases in the marketplace today. I anticipate price increases in the future. And our ability to pass on price is consistent with what it's always been relatively timely in our industrial businesses and typically with a 6 to 12-month lag in our consumer DIY businesses, I think some of that will be tightened just because of where we sit with a few product categories. But we have passed on price appropriately in the past, you can see that in our margin expansion throughout this period. And I don't see anything that changes those dynamics, both on the plus side, which is our ability to ultimately pass on price. And on the lag side in terms of the delay and timing that we've experienced for decades in our consumer DIY businesses. Sure. I would expect really strong performance out of consumer in our third quarter unless there is, as referenced earlier, some type of significant COVID impact which would impact everybody. But we anticipate continued strong performance there and into Q4 as well. Rusty referenced working capital and consumer, certainly we have tens of millions of dollars, low tens of millions of dollars of inventory to catch up on. And I think that's a good news story as well for the coming quarters. Thanks, Kevin. Good morning. Well, I don't have those details. I don't know we have them. Rusty, is that something that you might be able to comment on? Yes, that's why I mentioned in my comments, it was circumstantial to the quarter. And actually, despite the very challenged end markets, the MAP to Growth benefits on the PCG segment pretty pronounced. And I think you'll see those in the coming quarters in a positive way. I think you'll see the positive results as we get into our fiscal '22 in part because they'll be annualizing easier comps. But I do think with any economic recovery, there's a significant amount of pent-up maintenance and heavy industry spend that will be the beneficiaries of. And I guess the last comment I'll make is, if you look at what we expect in Q3, and Q4 out of that segment, I think you'll get a better sense of the positive impact of MAP to Growth, even as revenues continue to be down year-over-year or flat. And it'll give you a better sense from a margin profile of what type of leverage we would have when positive sales results return. Again, I'll defer that to Rusty other than to say that we're highly confident that some of our ability to execute timely has been impacted by the COVID pandemic. But we're highly confident that as we get into fiscal '22 and continue to benefit from our MAP to Growth activities, that the total program savings will be well in excess of $300 million. Good morning, Arun. Sure. I only address that broadly and then Rusty can address it in some detail. But all of our businesses, particularly our Consumer businesses are seasonal. And I think if you look year-over-year, we're continuing to see significant margin expansion. But obviously, from one subsequent quarter to the next as we get into our fourth quarter and first quarter, which are absolutely our seasonal highs and our second quarter and third quarter are meaningfully less in revenues, and there's a fixed level of expense. So that's what's driving the margin differential quarters over subsequent quarter. But we've continued to experience significant year-over-year margin improvement and we would expect that to continue. And I think Rusty could add a little more detail to that. So I believe we can and are capturing that share through the activities that we've taken. As we speak, there will be inorganic opportunities in that category, broader opportunities that may appear, but on a pretty regular basis product lines that we can acquire and expand across our distribution base. But fundamentally what happened in -- by going from our former six groups into the four groups and four segments, we have consolidated a number of businesses more completely into a more comprehensive construction products group. And so, we operated across the globe with maybe five or six different business units, we are now operating in North America and in Europe as a Tremco Construction Products Group. And pulling together for instance, Tremco sealants, the Nudura and the Dryvit businesses and approaching the market on an integrated basis is opening up opportunities for us and FACADE restoration that is driving organic growth that we were not experiencing the way we are organized in the past. So the biggest part of it has to do with reorganizing into a more integrated $2 billion construction products group, which from a market perspective is the Tremco Construction Products Group on a pretty integrated basis. We have exceptional leadership there. And we continue to take market share, whether it's in add mixtures shifting from different business units into a more integrated approach to the marketplace, it's something we're really excited about. There will be organic, there will be inorganic acquisition opportunities to accentuate that as well. But we do not need those to keep driving market share gains and organic growth. So we have over the last few quarters and months facings challenges in certain packaging areas, and particularly in metal cans. We have faced some challenges in silicones. A lot of those categories in terms of availability are being cleaned up. So I don't think we have the same concerns going forward as we've had over the last couple of quarters in those categories. And so I think that's certainly an observant comment about what's happened in a couple categories, particularly for us in some packaging areas and silicones. Thank you. Hi, Mike. Thanks. Sure. We have a new segment leader who's been in charge of that group for just about two years. And Ronnie Holman who's done a great job. Ronnie started as a leader of our R&D effort in a $15 million wood coatings businesses that was acquired by RPM probably 30 years ago, and helped grow our OEM coatings businesses to nearly $300 million and he is now in charge of this larger group. We have new leadership, the Day-Glo. We have new leadership coming at our Mantrose-Haeuser business. We have reorganized a new leadership across our Valvtect and Pettit Marine and really excited about what's happening there. And so there's been a number of leadership changes there that have consolidated accounting administration not only from a cost perspective, but take those administrative functions away from essentially business leaders that are refocused on growth. We have also changed our mentality at RPM. My father Tom and his partner Jim Karman for decades, we just did not use outside consultants. We've had a lot of success, both with our teams, and the good work of some consultants in the MAP to Growth program. And I mentioned that because something that we would not have done in the past we're doing today. We hired McKinsey to work with our Day-Glo team and our Mantrose-Haeuser specialty food business teams focused on market sizing and market opportunities. So the shift that I mentioned earlier in terms of really focusing our businesses on growth, as well as sustaining and implementing the MAP to Growth cultural changes with RPM are happening. And I think the thing that we're most excited about big picture, our primary goal in MAP to Growth was to get it efficiencies that were there to have to change our culture to be focused not only in growth but on efficiency, but do it in a way that did not meaningfully negatively impact our entrepreneurial culture. And so far, we have been able to do that, and it's paying dividends and I think people are going to see that in the coming quarters across RPM, particularly in the Construction Products Group, and particularly in our Specialty Products Group. Sure. And again, Rusty may have some more detail. I could tell you, particularly in our Consumer group, our ability to service online ordering has improved dramatically. And we have seen significant improvement, and huge percentage gains, but they're on a small base. But improvement in our ability to fulfill and meaningful growth in some of our big box customers and more traditional online customers like Amazon. Thank you. Hey, Michael. Yes. Thanks a lot. Yes, big picture and again details like I'll turn it over to Rusty. But big picture, I think we have gotten RPM to a new level of cash generation, both in terms of working capital requirements on a go-forward basis as well as our margin profiles. And we're excited about that. I think Rusty can provide more details as it relates to fiscal '21 and beyond. Thanks, Mike. Good morning, Steve. Yes, I'll defer that detail to Rusty again. But big picture, we have had some meaningful reductions in discretionary spending that's associated with a pandemic that will come back. I can tell you that you'll see and this is part of our guidance, a more normal spend in our Consumer Group in terms of advertising and promotion in the third and fourth quarter in the spring. So that's already coming back and part of our outlook. And while some of it will return, part of it was just lucky, in terms of coinciding with our MAP to Growth activities, because across a number of our businesses, there will be a kind of a new level of discretionary spend that will be below probably even where we originally targeted in MAP to Growth. Rusty can check me on this. I would say, I don't know, $50 million or $60 million is maybe lower raw material costs and the balances from our specific activities, the -- and that certainly is part of a centralized procurement function that in combination with lower raws has exceeded our expectations. And then the other area that we've commented on was our original target for manufacturing operations between plant consolidation and efficiency gains was $75 million bucks and will exceed $100 million in that category. Sure. We'll -- I think we'll be in a better position to address that with some specifics. In July, when we talk about guidance for fiscal '22 and kind of maybe a longer term post MAP to Growth outlook, but clearly there are elements of the MAP to Growth program that are here to stay. The MS 168 element of manufacturing operations, our ability to be a more strategic partner to large global suppliers and what we're doing on the sales front as well are something that we'll be able to talk about. And we've been able to put in procedures, just a little in the weeds. But what came out of MAP to Growth was a very detailed, what we call MPGT, which is -- MPGT, which is the I'm sorry, MPST, which is the MAP project savings tracker. And so we've been able to track literally thousands of categories of savings across procurement across SG&A and efficiency and we're taking some of those disciplines into a growth process as well. And we'll be able to talk more about that both in terms of what we're doing and the impact it's having this summer. Thank you. Good morning, Silke. Thank you very much. Rusty might have a better answer than I do. The only thing I can tell you is historically solid organic growth in Consumer has been in the 5% or 6% range. So clearly, a 34% organic growth in the first quarter in mid-teens organic growth in Q2 is extraordinary relative to historic levels. Yes. First of all, that is not how we see it. We would expect to see continued double-digit growth in the first part of the calendar or first 4 or 5 months of calendar '21. And then I expect from what we're seeing to see positive growth rates for the balance of the year. And Lowe's perspective, that you referenced, is not universal across our customer base. We have some significant customers that see continued expansion in the DIY market, albeit at a lower pace. Sure. I'm going to give you a dodge on that question for two reasons. Number one, we're really not providing details on our fourth quarter. We'll do so in April. But secondly, it's really going to be hard to tell. We had -- we should add some easier comps, particularly in April and May. As you see in this quarter, the leverage to the bottom line out of our Construction Products Group is pretty extraordinary. And I would expect that leverage to continue, at least directionally in what you're talking about, when they start to post organic growth that's in the mid-single digits, which recovery is coming. Thanks, Silke. Thank you. As always, I'm grateful for the hard work and dedication of our associates around the world. It's through their efforts that we found ways to safely operate our businesses, meet our customer's needs, develop new innovative solutions and serve the communities in which we operate. I also greatly appreciate our shareholders for their continued investment in RPM. We remain focused on generating long-term value for you. We learned over decades that the market that are used growth over efficiency. And what we've learned in MAP to Growth is that we can do both. We expect to continue to do both. Finally, to everyone on the call, I wish you and your families a happy and healthy New Year. We look forward to updating you on our fiscal 2021 third quarter results in April. Thank you for your investment in RPM and for joining our conference call this morning. Have a great day."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference may be recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your host today, Mr. Frank Sullivan, Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead, sir.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, and welcome to the RPM International Inc. investor call for our fiscal 2021 first quarter. Joining me on today\u2019s call are Rusty Gordon, RPM's Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Matt Ratajczak, our Vice President of Global Tax and Treasury, who is supporting our Investor Relation activities. I'll share insights behind our strong financial performance for the quarter, as well as an update on our MAP to Growth operating improvement program. Then Matt will walk you through a review of our first quarter adjusted financial results. Rusty will conclude our formal remarks with our outlook for the remainder of fiscal '21, after which we'll take your questions. Our strategically balanced business model, the resiliency of our operating companies and our MAP to Growth operating improvement program have enabled RPM to pull through the depths of the economic slowdown created by the COVID-19 pandemic. With the dual benefit of improved margins and better working capital management, our businesses are generating excellent cash flow, which allowed us to pay down nearly $200 million of debt during the first quarter. Today our liquidity is up to $1.5 billion. We have pivoted back to investing for accelerating growth as demonstrated by the acquisition of Ali Industries, as well as our strong organic growth in a number of our segments in the first quarter. During our fiscal '21 first quarter, selected segments of the global economy began to gain momentum as stay-at-home orders were relaxed. This freed pent-up demand from last year's fourth quarter and help drive our record top line results, which grew 9.1% over the prior year period. This was in sharp contrast to the COVID-19 related sales decline we reported for the fiscal 2020 fourth quarter. Our two largest segments posted positive growth in the first quarter, while two of our segments declined. Overall, RPM's results benefited from the positive impact of our MAP to Growth operating improvement program and our balanced business model were strength in one segment, offsets weakness in another. In addition, much credit for our strong performance is due to our management philosophy, which keeps customer centric decision-making at the operating level and enables our companies to be very nimble and adapting to change. Some examples around RPM of leaning into the pandemics disruption include Rust-Oleum, tinting wall paint, and shipping to residents through a new e-commerce program hosted by a big box home center. Tremco developing innovative indoor air quality services with a global MRO distributor for use on its customer's facilities and our Legend Brands business pivoting from disaster remediation to disinfecting and air purification in response to evolution of its contractors business needs. The most significant driver of RPM's first quarter growth was our consumer segment, which had already been experiencing unprecedented demand for small project paints, caulk, sealants, stains, cleaners, patch repair products as consumers completed more DIY home improvement projects. On a consolidated basis, international markets rebounded with 2% growth after a 26% drop during the difficult fourth quarter when construction or hardware channels were not deemed essential and were thus locked down in most of the international markets we serve. We continue to benefit from successfully implementing our MAP to Growth program, which enabled us to leverage the first quarter sales growth into even stronger bottom line results with adjusted EBIT that increased nearly 40%. During the first quarter, we announced the closure of one additional plant, which brings our total to 23 out of the previously announced 31 plants that originally targeted in our MAP to Growth operating improvement program. The momentum behind our MAP to Growth program continues to accelerate as it drives efficiency and operational excellence throughout our businesses. We are on track to reach the targeted run rate of $290 million in annualized savings by the conclusion of our current fiscal year, which ends May 31 '21. The projected benefits from our center-led procurement initiatives are ahead of plan, and our administrative improvements and ERP consolidations will continue into fiscal '22. In regard to our EI -- in regard to our IT investments, we are currently enhancing our capabilities in analytics, by centralizing systems and databases. This is allowing RPM to harness more complete information across its multiple business units and build decision support tools to improve the effectiveness of our procurement, distribution and sales teams. We're leveraging our information resources to make RPM stronger, and our success is a direct result of the cooperation of buying of our associates across RPM. While the MAP to Growth operating improvement program will be reaching its annualized cost savings target by the end of the fiscal year, we will run through that target as a result of continuing opportunities in the MAP to Growth pipeline, including consolidation to more accounting locations after the setup of new ERP systems are completed. In addition, we are establishing a culture of continuous improvement and operational excellence that will benefit RPM's bottom line for years to come. Most importantly, I'm proud of the efforts of our plant managers who have made our workers' health and safety a top priority during the pandemic, supported by Mike Sullivan and Ken Armstrong here at the corporate office, our operations personnel have successfully minimized workplace transmission of COVID-19 at a very low level. I'll now turn the call over to Matt Ratajczak, who will review our fiscal 2021 first quarter results on an adjusted basis.\nMatt Ratajczak: Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. Please note that my comments will be on an as-adjusted basis. During the first quarter, we generated consolidated net sales of $1.61 billion, an increase of 9.1% compared to the $1.47 billion reported during the same quarter of fiscal 2020. Organic sales increased 9.3% or $136.6 million. Acquisitions contributed 0.5% to sales or at $7.4 million. Foreign exchange was a headwind that reduced sales by 0.7% or $10.1 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.44, an increase of 51.6% compared to $0.95 in the year ago quarter. Our consolidated adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, EBIT, increased 39.8% to $269.2 million compared to $192.6 million reported in the fiscal 2020 first quarter. Now I will discuss our segments results. Sales at our Construction Products Group increased 2.2% to $547.7 million compared to $536.1 million a year-ago. Organic sales increased 3.6% or $18.9 million. There was no impact from acquisitions and foreign currency translation reduced sales by 1.4% or $7.3 million. Adjusted EBIT in the Construction Products Group increased 17.7% to $102.3 million compared to adjusted EBIT of $86.9 million during last year's first quarter. The segments commercial sealants and roofing businesses in North America performed well, driven by continued success in its restoration and building envelope systems initiatives. Sales were boosted by orders that were deferred during the fiscal 2020 fourth quarter. This segment also benefited from easier comparisons to last year's first quarter when extremely wet weather in North America slowed construction activity. MAP to Growth initiatives, price increases, and strong cost management enabled the segment's bottom line to vastly outpace its relatively modest sales growth. Sales in our Performance Coatings Group were down 12.6% to $259.8 million compared to the $297.2 million we reported during last year's first quarter. Organic sales declined 12.2% or $36.4 million. Acquisitions contributed $0.8 million or 0.3% to sales. Foreign exchange was a headwind of 0.7% or $1.9 million. The segments adjusted EBIT was down 16.4% to $30.9 million compared to $36.9 million during last year's first quarter. Similar to the fourth quarter, the segments top line continued to be impacted by poor energy market conditions that resulted in deferred industrial maintenance spending as well as by COVID-19 restrictions that limited outside contractors access to facilities and construction sites. In response, the segment has managed its detrimental margins well by aggressively cutting fixed costs and reducing its breakeven point. Cost savings that resulted from MAP to Growth operational improvements benefited the segments earnings. Adjusted EBIT margins would have actually improved during the quarter had it not been for the impact of transactional foreign exchange expense. Finally, we announced one more facility closing in this segment during the quarter. As Frank mentioned, there was unprecedented demand for our consumer products, which drove incredibly strong Consumer Group sales. They increased 33.8% to $641.2 million from $479.3 million during last year's first quarter. Organic sales increased 34% or $163.2 million. There was no impact from acquisitions and foreign currency translation reduced sales by 0.2% or $1.3 million. Adjusted EBIT in the Consumer Group increased 121.6% to $136.7 million compared to $61.7 million in the prior year period. Results were up significantly in the segment due to robust DIY demand as consumers spent more time in their homes, completing improvement projects during the pandemic. Our Consumer Group was a large beneficiary of this trend due to our market leadership position, and many years of building our retail distribution network. We are working around the clock to meet this unprecedented demand and are also making significant investments in plants, equipment, and operational disciplines to expand our capacity. The segment also benefited from an easier comparison to the prior year's first quarter when its product sales were tempered by extremely wet weather. The segments bottom line increased as a result of volume leveraging MAP to Growth savings, temporary reduction to discretionary spending, favorable product mix and moderation in some raw material categories. However, future cost pressure is anticipated due to recent inflation in certain raw materials and packaging as well as additional overhead expenses resulting from ongoing investments in capacity. We anticipate that we will see elevated demand over the next few quarters as housing turnover improves and more DIYers gain successful experience with new projects. Specialty Products Group sales were $158 million through the fiscal 2021 first quarter, a decline of 1.3% compared to sales of $160.1 million in the prior year period. Organic sales decreased 5.7% or $9.1 million, which was partially offset by acquisitions, which contributed 4.1% or $6.6 million to sales. Foreign currency translation increased sales by 0.3% or $0.4 million. Adjusted EBIT in the segment was down 15.9% to $24.1 million in the fiscal 2021 first quarter compared to $28.6 million in fiscal 2020. The segment's first quarter of sales rebounded and were nearly flat as compared to last year's first quarter. This was due to more favorable market conditions that drove demand for some of its products. Marine Coatings were boosted by increased outdoor activity, wet protectants were boosted by a stronger lumber sales and nail enamels increased because of greater demand for home beauty care. The unfavorable impact to the bottom line from product mix, operating disruptions associated with COVID-19 and deleveraging on lower volumes was partially offset by savings from the MAP to Growth operating improvement program. Now Rusty will walk you through our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2021.\nRusty Gordon: Thanks, Matt. For the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we expect to generate consolidated sales growth in the low to mid single digits with strong leverage to the bottom line for more than 20% adjusted EBIT growth, which are growth rates that are more in line with recent quarters prior to the outbreak of COVID-19. Our MAP to Growth momentum continues to be excellent, and the Ali acquisition, excluding acquisition related costs, will contribute towards good results in our second quarter. Our first quarter consolidated growth of 9.1% was a bit of an anomaly due to double-digit growth in the month of June as lockdown restrictions were eased in several markets. Looking ahead to the full year of fiscal 2021, our guidance is relatively unchanged from the direction we provided in our fiscal 2020 fourth quarter earnings release. We anticipate that our Construction Products Group and Performance Coatings Group could experience sales declines for the next two quarters, and then turned positive in the fourth quarter. Our Consumer Group should continue its strong sales momentum throughout the fiscal year. The Specialty Products Group is likely to face flat sales comparisons during the second quarter, which should turn in the second half of the year. These estimates assume that we do not experience a surge in COVID-19 that results in a second round of stay-at-home orders. Due to continued economic uncertainty related to the impacts of COVID-19 and the upcoming U.S election, we are not providing fiscal 2021 full year earnings guidance. This wraps up our formal comments. We will now be pleased to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nJohn McNulty: Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on a really solid set of results. I guess one of the questions I had, like you did have some really strong numbers, and I think some of it was expected. I think there was a lot of hope on the DIY side picking up and that type of thing, but you also had a lot of big new initiatives that you were launching some with Home Depot and Walmart. And I think even Grainger may have been on the list as well. So I guess, can you help us unpack how much of it came from kind of just core traditional growth versus how much of it came from kind of new product introductions and some of the initiatives that you're pushing there? How should we think about that?\nFrank Sullivan: I think most of it, John, came from our core traditional growth and just the surge in North American DIY activity. We're also starting to see that pick up in the U.K and parts of Europe. And the new initiatives are some tests in the wall paint area that we talked about and a few other categories that I think will have -- hopefully a greater impact in the coming quarters and into next year.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. That's helpful. And then it sounds like on the MAP to Growth side, your $290 million run rate by the end of fiscal '21, sounds like it's actually a little earlier than what we were expecting, and it also -- you certainly implied there's more to come in '22, as you get kind of the ERP system up. Can you speak to kind of what line of sight you have in terms of potential incremental savings above the $290 million that you were originally targeting?\nFrank Sullivan: You know, I think we'll certainly run through $300 million and then some as we get into '22. There's outperformance in the benefits of consolidating procurement areas. There's continuing benefits and outperforming in the manufacturing sector, it's a combination. We're getting what we expected from the plant consolidations, but the benefits of the lean manufacturing disciplines and continuous improvement activities will actually result in probably a $100 million of savings in the manufacturing sector versus the $75 million we originally projected.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just one last one, if I can sneak it in. On the cash flow side, your cash flow from operations was huge. I mean, it's probably double what you normally run. I guess, can you speak to how much of it is, is kind of one-time-ish in terms of some of the cleaning up and tightening up of working capital that you've been working on versus how much we should be thinking about it being sustainable. And then I guess just uses for that cash, are you starting to see the bid ask spread starting to narrow in terms of M&A, or do you see buyback opportunities picking up, how should we be thinking about that?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. It was -- I think we missed the opportunity in our prepared remarks to emphasize the cash flow and the balance sheet improvements we had in the quarter, pretty extraordinary. I think for the most part it's sustainable. Some of the working capital improvements in our consumer segment are probably a little overdone in the quarter just because our inventory levels are lower than we would like relative to a 34% organic growth and our need to continue to expand capacity. We also had probably $15 million or so of COVID related one-time benefits in the quarter. But in general, the strong cash flow I think is indicative of the operating efficiencies we've been pursuing, improvements in our working capital, most of which will be permanent and the higher margin profile that we're able to leverage on the sales growth we have. We paid off $200 million of debt in the quarter and there will be more to come and I think that's one of the real highlights of the quarter.\nJohn McNulty: Thanks very much for the color.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you, John.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Your line is now open.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Frank.\nFrank Mitsch: Thanks so much. Good morning and let me echo the congrats on the strong start to the year. Rusty, you mentioned that June had double-digit sales growth. I was wondering if you could kind of parse out where the rest of the quarter fell and where -- what you've seen so far in September?\nRusty Gordon: Sure. Yes. For the rest of the month, other than June where we had extraordinary double-digit growth as lock down restrictions eased. We are in the low to mid single-digit range, so that's why we projected Q2 similar way.\nFrank Mitsch: All right. Terrific. And Frank, you mentioned that you've closed 23 of the 31 plants. What is the timing on completing all of the plant rationalizations and how do we think about the financial impacts of the shutdowns impacting your bottom line?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure.\nFrank Mitsch: In terms of timing and pace.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. As we'd indicated in the past quarterly investor calls, the pace of some of our activities has been slowed by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. And so like most companies, we have kept independent contractors out of our plant facilities and offices, so it slowed the pace of the completion of some of our ERP implementations. It's also slowed the pace of some of the plant closure activity and in related areas slowed our ability to get into now kind of mid to smaller size manufacturing facilities with what we call fit events, which are really the kickoffs of the lean manufacturing disciplines and continuous improvement activities that are paying big dividends for us. And so we're probably 6 to 12 months beyond the original December 31, 2020 target date that we communicated a couple of years ago, only as a result of the slowdown from the pandemic and our ability to get people into plants and/or offices to complete these activities.\nFrank Mitsch: And is that chunky in any way shape or form in terms of in the back half of this year, you'll see a nice increase in the financials or is it kind of evenly spread? How do we think about that?\nFrank Sullivan: No, I think the -- there were some concerns by folks in the investment community, some expressed on this call in the past that we had a good benefit from our MAP to Growth program after the first year, but that some programs would lose steam. We accelerated in the second year of the MAP to Growth program and we don't see that acceleration stopping at this point. There's still gas in that tank.\nFrank Mitsch: Got you. And hopefully your brownies will continue to not lose steam. Congrats. Thanks.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you, Frank.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rosemarie Morbelli with G Research. Your line is now open.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Rosemarie.\nRosemarie Morbelli: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and congratulations one more time. Following up on the MAP benefit -- your savings were about $20 million in the first -- in the third quarter of last year, followed by $25 million in Q4. What did you -- what was the benefit in the first quarter of this year?\nFrank Sullivan: Just a little more than $30 million.\nRosemarie Morbelli: Okay. And you expect to generate the $290 million run rate by the end of the year. What would be the actual dollar amount that you expect to achieve in 2021?\nFrank Sullivan: I think roughly a $100 million, could be a little bit more. Keep in mind that a lot of the benefits here have been in cost of goods sold in the manufacturing area. So it flows through our P&L with the seasonality of our revenues. So you can't just take a $30 million or $32 million benefit in our seasonally high first quarter and flow it even -- evenly across months or quarters, but we'll get a $100 million this year. And we're probably $50 million ahead of our original targets through Wave 2. Some of that is pulling forward things that we plan for Wave 3. So not necessarily additional saving to our original goal and then others of it, our additional savings. I think that's why we're confident by the time we get through May 31, '21 we'll have achieved the $290 million. And then we believe there's another collection of tens of millions that will show up in fiscal '22 as well, and we'll benefit subsequent quarters.\nRosemarie Morbelli: Thank you. And then looking at the unrealistic growth on the DIY side, do you think -- do you have a feel as to whether your customers have been building inventory or replenishing inventory that they had, eliminated or reduced earlier on? And if that is the case, you are adding capacity but the demand is going to slow down to a more normal level. So do you think that you all may be a little overly optimistic in building this capacity or do you need it regardless of what the decline in DIY growth is next year, which I expect will be.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. A couple of things in that. Number one specific to DIY, I think in our categories and many others, and we have commented on this in the past. Good example is our wood stains and finishes category that's up big. That takes a greater skill set than just patching and repairing. And so we firmly believe and our big customers believe that the confident DIY are based in North America had grown, and that bodes well for the DIY sector across a lot of categories. And so we see solid growth in the consumer segment for the balance of this year, and we think it will be on a new base that's higher than what any of us could achieved on our own as a result of, I think one of the very few positive consequences of this pandemic in terms of driving that larger level of activity. The flip side is supply chains across all industries, and certainly in DIY had been disrupted mightily. We've seen some allocations on things like cans. Some of that's been driven by spikes in demand, some of it's been driven by plant closures associated with COVID-19 infections. So that's in our supply base. Inventory levels are not where they need to be in the DIY channel. Very few companies and we're one of them sit around with a idle capacity of 40% or 50%. And so the 34% organic growth that we experienced in the first quarter along with some of the supply chain disruptions has been challenging to us and everybody. And we're working hard to make sure that we can drive the efficiency to overcome that. So the long and the short of all that is we see solid performance in our consumer business for the balance of the year. We see a larger base that's going to be permanent and we continue to introduce new products and take market share. So we're pretty excited about what we see for the next couple of years in consumer.\nRosemarie Morbelli: Thank you, Frank, and good luck.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you. Thanks, Rosemarie.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Michael.\nMichael Sison: Hey guys. How are you doing? Congrats on a good and a great quarter, and hope you're excited about the Browns as I am.\nFrank Sullivan: Absolutely.\nMichael Sison: In terms of the -- in terms of DIY, we've had a really good run here. What are your thoughts in terms of that business over the next year or two? Do you think there's good sustainability in demand for DIY over pro and how long do you think this trend can continue of really strong growth?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. Well, I think the comments I just made in response to Rosemarie Morbelli answer that question in terms of a larger base. And I think really expectations by us and our customers of a continuation at least for the next couple of quarters of this larger than usual organic growth basis. You'll also see a pickup in the pro, and we're finally starting to see that and we would expect more of that in the new calendar year. Most of the big activity has been DIY as, at least over the late spring and early summer, homeowners were reticent to allow contractors in or around their homes. That's starting to change. And the pro business, particularly at some of our biggest customers will start to pick up. That has not been a big driver of demand so far, but we think it will be in the coming quarters in the next year.\nMichael Sison: Okay. And then in terms of -- you closed an acquisition in September I think and yes, the environment there improving. Is that an opportunity for more incremental growth over the next couple of quarters as well?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. We closed Ali Industries, great family business headquartered in Ohio. They're essentially in abrasives and sandpaper products and DIY. A great adjacency to our Rust-Oleum business, but also with some of our other businesses. So we're very excited about that and we're thrilled to have the Ali family and the Ali Industries associates join RPM. We had negotiated that transaction prior to the pandemic, and we [technical difficulty] put most of our acquisition activity on hold. I think given our strong results and our great cash flow, we are confident and restarting our acquisition activity. And I would expect that particularly in the small to medium sized private company space across all categories, you'll see activity pick up pretty aggressively between now in calendar year end in part in anticipation or concern about possible tax changes with an administrative change in the new year.\nMichael Sison: Got it. Thank you.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you, Mike.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Your line is now open.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Ghansham.\nGhansham Panjabi: Hey, guys. Good morning.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning.\nFrank Sullivan: Maybe, Frank, going back to the Construction segment, which is one of the -- obviously the sources of upside relative to the original guidance. Where did you see the upside relative to perhaps your initial predictions for the quarter. And then related to that, why would that turn negative in the second quarter, apart from just some forward based on pent-up demand? Is that what you're expecting for that segment?\nFrank Sullivan: No, I think it may be flat to slightly down in Q2, but we see it turning modestly positive in the second half. The challenge is there and our construction segment is really what happens with the economy. Our results in the first quarter and continuing the spring suggest to us that we're taking market share. We're seeing a decent modest revenue growth. It's leveraging to our bottom line really well. And some of our peers where we could get data are still experiencing negative results. If the economy continues to improve and if the health interventions around vaccines and treatment kind of help build confidence, then upside for us for the balance of the year and into '22 could be the activities in our Construction Group -- Construction Products Group. If there are hiccups relative to coronavirus and further shutdowns, like you're seeing in Israel and in select parts of Europe, then that'll be a challenge for us as we get into the new year. So that's the principle area that makes us scratch our head about providing any more detailed guidance for the year. But if things continue as they are, we'll do perhaps better than we've indicated in the second half of the year and for the full year of fiscal '21.\nGhansham Panjabi: Very clear. And then in terms of Performance Coatings, how would you characterize channel inventories for that segment? I mean, obviously there's some dislocations in the energy markets, but I would imagine that some of it would just be a deferral because I don't think you can defer the maintenance forever for that end market. And then just the final question for the consolidated portfolio. How did September actually play out for your company from a sales standpoint? Thank you.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I'll take the last question first. We'll just repeat what Rusty said. We anticipate kind of a mid organic growth in the second quarter and it'll have to leverage nicely with the bottom line with EBIT growth of 20% or more. And I think that's all we would say about the second quarter. As it relates to Performance Coatings, it's about $1 billion $1.1 billion segment in total. And as you recall about 30% of the revenues are tied to the oil and gas, energy and energy specific -- broadly energy, and that segment is taking it on the chin in terms of oil prices and the halting of spending and a lot of activity, that will rebound eventually. But we don't anticipate seeing really any positive numbers there year-over-year until we get into the fourth quarter.\nGhansham Panjabi: Thanks so much, Frank.\nFrank Sullivan: Thanks, Ghansham.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Arun.\nArun Viswanathan: Good morning, Frank. Thanks for taking my questions.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure.\nArun Viswanathan: Relates to the margin performance, I guess, first off in consumer, really impressive margin performance and obviously a good portion of that is volume and a good portion is potentially MAP to Growth. Is there any way that you could help us identify what you think the normal margin is and maybe -- do you expect margin to kind of moderate in the coming quarters as maybe some of the DIY search moderates? Yes, maybe we can just start with that. And I also wanted to ask basically the same question for Construction Products. Again, that was a little bit of our expectations. So just trying to think about how we should think about your margin trajectory from here in those two segments? Thanks.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. Our original MAP to Growth specific goals as you'll recall were a $1 billion of EBIT and a 16% consolidated EBIT margin. And as we indicated, while we started a year-ago, mostly because the revenue growth up until recently wasn't meeting our expectations, we had a couple of other headwinds that we didn't see achieving those within the timeframe we talked about. We are still keenly focused on a 16% consolidated EBIT margin. It'll take longer to get there than we thought. But there will be opportunities for continued margin expansion in certain parts of RPM in the coming -- I'd say 12 to 18 months. So those goals are still front and center for us. And I think you'll see EBIT margins improve. They're likely to improve in places other than consumer. With this performance, some of which has been COVID driven. We finally gotten back to margin levels that we had experienced in the past. And I would expect to see continued margin improvement in our Construction Products Group as well as the Specialty Products Group this year. And then eventually, but probably not until '22 in the Performance Coatings Group.\nArun Viswanathan: And then -- thanks for that. And then I guess, secondly could you just address the international performance. Obviously, you're seeing different trends in Europe and you mentioned potential lockdown risk outside of North America. So I guess, where do you think you are in your international businesses recovery wise? Maybe if you could characterize it from an earnings standpoint or a percent recovery, but yes, where do you think you are in some of those international markets?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I'll let Rusty handle that.\nRusty Gordon: Yes, thanks. Yes, in terms of international, Arun, we are pretty flat in Europe after having taken it on the chin, of course in April and May there due to tighter lockdown restrictions. Currency is not a headwind in Europe at the moment, so that's good news there as well. In Latin America, it's been really challenging as you can imagine in Brazil and other places. Mexico we've had challenging results and that's made worse by currencies that have weakened over time versus the U.S dollar. So Latin America has been a bit of a challenge and that's principally where most of our international business is. Canada did well in the first quarter. That was another place where they had tighter lockdown restrictions versus the U.S in April and May. So we had good performance there, and we have very strong consumer brands in Canada. So of course that business mix helps us and should help us looking ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: So I would just add to that that we're starting to see similar trends in the U.K and Europe in consumer takeaway that is building a bigger base than what we had before. And we would expect, for instance, in the second quarter, some pretty good organic growth in the U.K and Europe, assuming there are not further lockdowns as the DIY markets start to look a little bit like what we've experienced in North America.\nArun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks. And just a quick one, if I may. Just on price costs, are you experiencing any inflation, whether it be on the petrochemical side or input cost side or freight side? Could you just provide some commentary on those items? Thanks.\nRusty Gordon: Yes, sure. Yes, we are seeing some inflation in select raw materials like acetone, for example, is one that really stands out. Also as Frank mentioned due to some supply chain issues and metal packaging, we are having to find new sources often not with the same cost that we were used to from the old sources. So that'll certainly provide some cost pressure. Yes, I have heard of other raw materials and freight, as you mentioned, we expect that to go up by a modest, mid single-digit percentage next year, LTL freight, oil seems to go up and we expect more of the same.\nFrank Sullivan: And I would just add to that two things to keep in mind. One in general, the cost price mix is relatively flat. Now we haven't had meaningful price increases some time. We are benefiting from the fact, and we reminded folks of this in the past that we're one of the few of the major competitors that we get compared to that\u2019s on FIFO accounting. And so, you'll see reflected in our results in the first quarter, things that we experienced in terms of cost price mix 60 or 90 days ago. And so that's worth keeping in mind as well as you think about RPM versus peers.\nArun Viswanathan: Thanks.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research. Your line is now open.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Kevin.\nKevin McCarthy: Yes. Good morning, everyone. Question on MAP to Growth, beyond sort of the discrete items around plant closures, procurements and other facets to the program, my sense is that it's had a large impact on RPM's culture, in terms of operational excellence, continuous improvement, et cetera. If that's the case, Frank, can you speak to sustained productivity benefits? For example, some companies endeavor to offset inflation, ad infinitum, have you thought about future opportunities in those terms, and would be curious to understand what impact that may have beyond the formal end of the program and late fiscal '21?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So in terms of the lean manufacturing disciplines and continuous improvement disciplines that we are taking now in places outside of just the factory floor, I would say we're in middle innings and there's more to come. Obviously, over time that incremental benefit will become less impactful, but it should be the gift that keeps on giving for a long time. And it has changed our culture and the way that our people have embraced that change and the speed with which it has happened has been very impressive. And we work hard to make sure that we maintain those gains. And so we see more to come in that category. It'd be hard to talk about something offsetting inflation, because if you -- as you have followed us over 20 years, we're pretty raw material intensive as is everybody in our space. And when you get spikes in raw materials up or down, I certainly think we proven through price increases, although not always timely, but through price increases and now going forward, our ability to operate more efficiently. We can certainly maintain a level of margin profitability over a cycle, but we'll continue to see some swings in the future as we have in the past relative to the activity of raws. We are lastly taking the MAP to Growth activities into some more data intensive areas around product mix and other things that are going to help our margins in the future as well.\nKevin McCarthy: Understood. Good to hear. And then secondly, if I may, Frank, you made a comment that working around the clock in Consumer and another comment that I think you expect to face increased overhead costs. Do you need to invest in more capacity at this point? And if so, what impact might that have on your capital expenditures for this year and beyond?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I'll have Rusty answer the CapEx question, but we are investing in more capacity particularly in consumer. And you know, we obviously a 34% organic growth rate isn't anything we expect to be sustained, but there is a higher base of business. And we're expanding to meet that, particularly in small project paints and cleaning categories. In the cleaning category, we've gone from what was a modest start seven years ago with Krud Kutter, an acquisition that was $5 million to what should be a product category at Rust-Oleum in excess of $100 million. And that could be meaningfully larger category for us in the future. So those are two areas for instance, where we're expanding. We're also expanding capacity in the roof coating capabilities of our Construction Products Group.\nRusty Gordon: Yes. So, Kevin, back in July, we said our CapEx would be about $130 million this year. Now because of this above expectation demand in consumer, the CapEx will probably be closer to $140 million, which will make it pretty comparable to last year when we did about $147 million.\nKevin McCarthy: I see. Thank you so much.\nFrank Sullivan: Thanks, Kevin.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning.\nJeff Zekauskas: Hi. Thanks very much. Hi, good morning. You spoke about being on FIFO accounting.\nFrank Sullivan: Yes.\nJeff Zekauskas: Was there FIFO benefits in the quarter? And if there were, how much were they, where did the FIFO benefits come in your second quarter, given that raw materials probably bottomed in, I don't know, April, May.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. Again, I don't know that we would provide that kind of detail other than to just make clear that, on FIFO you're looking at across price mix that was in spot prices, what we experienced 60 or 90 days ago, as opposed to somebody on LIFO who would be reflecting spot prices as of today.\nJeff Zekauskas: So if I understand what you're saying though, you should have -- you're not going to feel a raw material, a detriment in the second quarter. You might feel it in the third.\nFrank Sullivan: I think that's correct.\nJeff Zekauskas: Okay. And then lastly, in other accrued liabilities, I think they went up from, maybe 272 to 365 sequentially. What's that about and where will that number go?\nRusty Gordon: Sure. Yes, the other accrued liability went up and the reason is that customer rebates went up because of our strong DIY activity. And that also relates to the timing of tax payments. That was a big reason for the $67 million increase versus 12 months ago.\nJeff Zekauskas: Where should that be at the end of the year?\nRusty Gordon: Well, typically we pay our customer rebates at the end of their year, which should be in the winter time. So that aspect will go down on the timing of tax payments. Matt, you have any idea?\nMatt Ratajczak: Yes. Some of that is some of the deferrals on the FICA stuff, but income tax payments will price spike a little bit in the second quarter or second quarter and then catch up in the latter half of the year.\nFrank Sullivan: So we communicated in the spring when companies were able to defer FICA about a $25 million benefit there? About a $25 million benefit and that's just a deferral into the next year. We did not choose to reduce the FICA payment of our payrolls that was an option and we chose not to pursue that.\nJeff Zekauskas: Okay, great. Thank you so much.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Spector with UBS. Your line is now open.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Josh.\nJosh Spector: Yes, hey guys. Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a question around the top line guidance range of low to mid single-digit. Just trying to think about what are the factors at this point that could move that from the top or bottom end of the guidance. Is it one particular sector, region or segment that you look at more?\nFrank Sullivan: I think we feel pretty good about our guidance for Q2. As it relates to the second half of the year, I really think it depends upon our Construction Products category. We've got a lot of new products, we've got a lot of good momentum there. We're taking market share. We are really pulling together what was a -- not very well coordinated collection of companies serving the construction, chemical industry broadly and waterproofing and sealants and floor coatings and things like that. And that has become a very well coordinated and got good leadership there. So we're poised to do really well. And it really depends on economic activity as we get into the new calendar year. And again, it goes to our hesitancy to provide more specific guidance. If the economic recovery continues, we will outperform this year. If some combination of COVID and disruptions around the elections result in an economic downturn as we get into calendar '21, then I think we'll be more at the bottom of what we talked about.\nJosh Spector: Okay. Thanks. And I mean, specifically for your fiscal second quarter, I mean, is it a fair base assumption to say that you're planning on consumer up maybe mid-teens and construction down low single-digit percent, or is it significantly different than that?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes, I wouldn't get into the segment details right now, other than to say kind of mid single-digit growth. We will continue to have outsize growth in consumer, although not to the extent that we had in the first quarter. And we should have a flat deposit of growth in our Construction Products Group, and I think the others go in line with what Rusty has talked about.\nJosh Spector: Okay, thanks. And then just maybe one quick one on working capital. So I mean, it's been mentioned a number of times that you've done better in the quarter-to-date. I don't know if you have an update of what you're thinking in terms of core working capital for the year overall, if you're kind of back on track to maybe improve that in fiscal 2021, or if that's going to be further delayed following plant closures.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. Well it's delayed as we've communicated from our original projection. I think we just made bad assumptions at the beginning of MAP to Growth that the working capital improvements that we expected to generate originally about $230 million in cash would come evenly. And the fact of the matter is the way it happens is you get your plant improvements first, you begin to get the benefits of some of your consolidating activities, and then your working capital improvements follow. We are seeing that now and certainly over the next 12, 18 months, there's another $100 million of relative working capital improvement. I say relative, obviously, the numbers will move based on a revenue growth.\nJosh Spector: Got it. Thank you.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Your line is now open.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Mike.\nMike Harrison: Hey, good morning. Congrats on the nice quarter.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nMike Harrison: I was wondering if you can talk about the operational impact of COVID that you referenced in the specialty business. How much can you quantify that impact for us and maybe discuss whether you've overcome those disruptions at this point?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I can do it just generally, and by some examples we've provided in the past. Our Marine Coatings business in April and May, our Guardian Protective Products business that supplies furniture retailers and furniture manufacturers, businesses like that literally saw their revenues drop 50%, 60%, 70% in April and May, and it was pretty scary. We are seeing a significant return in the Marine Coatings business to be very positive. As retailers open up, we're seeing a bigger than anticipated return in the Guardian Protective Products business. So we're seeing a nice rebound in those businesses and while the Specialty Products Group had negative results in the first quarter, you'll see positive results out of that group, I believe for the remainder of the fiscal year and it's for those reasons. But those were the disruptions that we saw. The disruptions in other parts of our business that have been hit and miss and are really referenced to the supply chain issue are in many cases around COVID related plant closures. We had a protocol very quickly that if we had any infections, we would close the facility and do a disinfecting and cleaning. And if we've had very few if any work-related exposures, most of our exposures over the summer have been from people who had been working at home. But in a few places we had to close a facility for two weeks. We've had suppliers that have had to close facilities for weeks. And so those disruptions in different raw materials and/ or different parts of the supply chain have been challenging. We're not seeing those today, although we're still suffering the impact for instance in the canned category.\nMike Harrison: All right. And then you mentioned price increases in the consumer business. How much pricing did you see? And it sounds like maybe there wasn't a formal increase announced. So this -- is it more a function of just less discounting or less promotional activity in a strong demand environment?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes, we did not have any price increases over the summer or in the quarter. And so the price increases that we got were mostly a year ago and those were necessary to overcome what were a couple of year of raw material challenges. And we certainly have benefited from that in the subsequent quarters in terms of cost price mix. But from a price perspective across most all of RPM, it's been -- there's been little or no price increases in the last couple of quarters.\nMike Harrison: All right. And just lastly, can you comment on what you're seeing in TiO2 pricing right now?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes, I don't have a good answer for that question. We can get back to you.\nMike Harrison: All right. Sounds good. Thanks very much.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. Thanks for squeezing me here.\nFrank Sullivan: Hey, Vince. How are you?\nUnidentified Analyst: And this is actually Steve on for Vincent. Sorry, should have let it at that. I think just to come back to consumer for a second, last quarter you had a comment that the full year would be kind of uploaded in single digits and clearly outperformed in the first quarter versus initial expectations. So could you help us maybe kind of size how we should be thinking about that prior guide going forward?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I think consumer will be kind of mid to upper single digits for the balance of the year.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Thanks.\nFrank Sullivan: Excellent. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nSteve Byrne: So Frank, I've seen massive purchases of Varathane [ph] in my house. I think my wife meaningfully contributed to your quarter. I just wanted to drill in on your consumer, your 34% organic growth, how much of that was volume and how much of it was price mix?\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, please stand by. Your conference will resume momentarily. Okay. Please proceed with the call.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you. Apparently we had a technology hiccup with line disconnection, but we're back on. If there are any further questions we will take them. And Liz, if there are no further questions, let me know.\nOperator: We do have Steve Byrne with a question. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Hey, go ahead, Steve. Sorry for the disconnect.\nSteve Byrne: Yes, no worries, Frank. So that 34% organic growth in consumer was that almost all volume or was there some price mix in there?\nFrank Sullivan: It was all volume and it was broadly across the entire category of small project paints, wood stains, and finishes caulks and sealants, patch and repair products. Cleaners were a big category. And so that was good.\nSteve Byrne: And when you look at those trends and I believe you've indicated in the past that you have almost real time visibility on purchases of your products from some of the home centers. Is there anything in particular that is driving that volume? I mean, is any particular categories that give you confidence of that; one, it's DIY driven and not pro, I'm not sure how you can differentiate that, but are there particular products that give you confidence that this DIY strength has some legs to it?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So when talking to our largest customers, they believe this DIY strength has some legs to it. I think we concur that there is a -- that this crazy dynamic has created a larger base of confident DIYers across a lot of categories, including ours. So there is a new larger base of business. They quite candidly neither we nor our big customers probably could have generated in this timeframe in normal circumstances, but it's here. And it is broad across all the different categories and it's continuing into the fall months. Obviously, it's -- in our case, it's a seasonal business. So we'll see seasonal slowdowns as we get into the colder winter months. We anticipate solid results in the spring whether they're back to kind of the normal mid single digits, or they're still a uptick in the spring when the seasonality comes back, we'll find out the hard way. But we're pretty excited as our customers about this whole category, about a larger base of business, and also in our case some tests in a couple areas like wall paint, a few other places that could get us into some new categories, but time will tell on that.\nSteve Byrne: And I recall last quarter, you mentioned e-commerce was somewhere in the tens of millions of revenue through homedepot.com and Amazon. How would you characterize it now? Is it continuing to post a doubler year-over-year?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes, it's increasing at a rate of double. It started on a relatively small base, call it 10 million, but we're seeing doubling of our e-commerce business through a number of platforms, but principally homedepot.com and Amazon.\nSteve Byrne: And just lastly \u2026\nFrank Sullivan: Those are the two biggest drivers. There are other platforms.\nSteve Byrne: And you just mentioned about the Walmart paint is grab-and-go. Is there any interest in Walmart to add in, paint -- color mixing machines and advance that beyond this, just grab and go approach?\nFrank Sullivan: So we have a tint based program that is a direct ship that we are having tests with a couple of other customers. So we do have a tint based program there. And on the Color Ready To Go program it's still in test at Walmart and it's going well. Walmart has other paint vendors that have tint based programs and that's, we are the Color To Go program.\nSteve Byrne: Okay. Thank you.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you, Steve.\nOperator: I'm showing no further questions in queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Sullivan for closing remarks.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. Before we hit our closing remarks, I'd like to qualify a couple of things. In the Construction Products Group and Performance Coatings Group, we anticipate flat to down sales for the next couple of quarters. The MAP to Growth should allow us particularly in Construction Products to leverage to positive EBIT growth there. And then we're hopeful that we'll see that turn up in the second half or certainly the fourth quarter. As it relates to TiO2, we're seeing over the last couple of months, about 2.5% -- 2% to 2.5% price increase impact there. At 2 O'clock Eastern Time tomorrow, we are going to hold our Annual Meeting of stockholders. As many companies have done and for obviously a solid and important health reasons, we will be doing it virtually. Our Annual Meeting of stockholders can be accessed through our website at www.rpminc.com, or at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/RPM2020. We remain optimistic that we'd be able to return to an in-person meeting next year and continue our tradition of engaging with shareholders in-person, and also providing samples of our newest products. We'd like to thank our associates worldwide for their continued hard work and dedication during these uncertain times. Through all these challenges we've experienced over the last few months, our associates have demonstrated incredible resilience as they find new and innovative ways to safely operate our businesses and continue to deliver for our customers. I'd like to especially thank our personnel at our Carboline plant in Lake Charles, Louisiana, whose resiliency in the face of the aftermath of hurricane Laura is inspiring to all of us. A number of our employees lost homes, our facilities received structural damage, there continued to be power outages and water outages for weeks after the hurricane. And despite all that, we were able to ship products to customers 11 days after the hurricane hit the area. And their response is symbolic of the RPM culture, where our employees act like owners of their businesses. I'd also like to thank our shareholders for their ongoing investment in RPM. We remain committed to completing our MAP to Growth program to generating solid revenue and earnings growth and creating value for you over the long-term. And to everyone on the call, I wish you and your family's good health. We look forward to updating you on our fiscal 2021 second quarter results in the first week of January and hope that many of you will join us for our Annual Meeting of stockholders tomorrow. Thank you and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Matt Ratajczak",
            "content": "Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. Please note that my comments will be on an as-adjusted basis. During the first quarter, we generated consolidated net sales of $1.61 billion, an increase of 9.1% compared to the $1.47 billion reported during the same quarter of fiscal 2020. Organic sales increased 9.3% or $136.6 million. Acquisitions contributed 0.5% to sales or at $7.4 million. Foreign exchange was a headwind that reduced sales by 0.7% or $10.1 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.44, an increase of 51.6% compared to $0.95 in the year ago quarter. Our consolidated adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, EBIT, increased 39.8% to $269.2 million compared to $192.6 million reported in the fiscal 2020 first quarter. Now I will discuss our segments results. Sales at our Construction Products Group increased 2.2% to $547.7 million compared to $536.1 million a year-ago. Organic sales increased 3.6% or $18.9 million. There was no impact from acquisitions and foreign currency translation reduced sales by 1.4% or $7.3 million. Adjusted EBIT in the Construction Products Group increased 17.7% to $102.3 million compared to adjusted EBIT of $86.9 million during last year's first quarter. The segments commercial sealants and roofing businesses in North America performed well, driven by continued success in its restoration and building envelope systems initiatives. Sales were boosted by orders that were deferred during the fiscal 2020 fourth quarter. This segment also benefited from easier comparisons to last year's first quarter when extremely wet weather in North America slowed construction activity. MAP to Growth initiatives, price increases, and strong cost management enabled the segment's bottom line to vastly outpace its relatively modest sales growth. Sales in our Performance Coatings Group were down 12.6% to $259.8 million compared to the $297.2 million we reported during last year's first quarter. Organic sales declined 12.2% or $36.4 million. Acquisitions contributed $0.8 million or 0.3% to sales. Foreign exchange was a headwind of 0.7% or $1.9 million. The segments adjusted EBIT was down 16.4% to $30.9 million compared to $36.9 million during last year's first quarter. Similar to the fourth quarter, the segments top line continued to be impacted by poor energy market conditions that resulted in deferred industrial maintenance spending as well as by COVID-19 restrictions that limited outside contractors access to facilities and construction sites. In response, the segment has managed its detrimental margins well by aggressively cutting fixed costs and reducing its breakeven point. Cost savings that resulted from MAP to Growth operational improvements benefited the segments earnings. Adjusted EBIT margins would have actually improved during the quarter had it not been for the impact of transactional foreign exchange expense. Finally, we announced one more facility closing in this segment during the quarter. As Frank mentioned, there was unprecedented demand for our consumer products, which drove incredibly strong Consumer Group sales. They increased 33.8% to $641.2 million from $479.3 million during last year's first quarter. Organic sales increased 34% or $163.2 million. There was no impact from acquisitions and foreign currency translation reduced sales by 0.2% or $1.3 million. Adjusted EBIT in the Consumer Group increased 121.6% to $136.7 million compared to $61.7 million in the prior year period. Results were up significantly in the segment due to robust DIY demand as consumers spent more time in their homes, completing improvement projects during the pandemic. Our Consumer Group was a large beneficiary of this trend due to our market leadership position, and many years of building our retail distribution network. We are working around the clock to meet this unprecedented demand and are also making significant investments in plants, equipment, and operational disciplines to expand our capacity. The segment also benefited from an easier comparison to the prior year's first quarter when its product sales were tempered by extremely wet weather. The segments bottom line increased as a result of volume leveraging MAP to Growth savings, temporary reduction to discretionary spending, favorable product mix and moderation in some raw material categories. However, future cost pressure is anticipated due to recent inflation in certain raw materials and packaging as well as additional overhead expenses resulting from ongoing investments in capacity. We anticipate that we will see elevated demand over the next few quarters as housing turnover improves and more DIYers gain successful experience with new projects. Specialty Products Group sales were $158 million through the fiscal 2021 first quarter, a decline of 1.3% compared to sales of $160.1 million in the prior year period. Organic sales decreased 5.7% or $9.1 million, which was partially offset by acquisitions, which contributed 4.1% or $6.6 million to sales. Foreign currency translation increased sales by 0.3% or $0.4 million. Adjusted EBIT in the segment was down 15.9% to $24.1 million in the fiscal 2021 first quarter compared to $28.6 million in fiscal 2020. The segment's first quarter of sales rebounded and were nearly flat as compared to last year's first quarter. This was due to more favorable market conditions that drove demand for some of its products. Marine Coatings were boosted by increased outdoor activity, wet protectants were boosted by a stronger lumber sales and nail enamels increased because of greater demand for home beauty care. The unfavorable impact to the bottom line from product mix, operating disruptions associated with COVID-19 and deleveraging on lower volumes was partially offset by savings from the MAP to Growth operating improvement program. Now Rusty will walk you through our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2021. Yes. Some of that is some of the deferrals on the FICA stuff, but income tax payments will price spike a little bit in the second quarter or second quarter and then catch up in the latter half of the year."

            "name": "Rusty Gordon",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt. For the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we expect to generate consolidated sales growth in the low to mid single digits with strong leverage to the bottom line for more than 20% adjusted EBIT growth, which are growth rates that are more in line with recent quarters prior to the outbreak of COVID-19. Our MAP to Growth momentum continues to be excellent, and the Ali acquisition, excluding acquisition related costs, will contribute towards good results in our second quarter. Our first quarter consolidated growth of 9.1% was a bit of an anomaly due to double-digit growth in the month of June as lockdown restrictions were eased in several markets. Looking ahead to the full year of fiscal 2021, our guidance is relatively unchanged from the direction we provided in our fiscal 2020 fourth quarter earnings release. We anticipate that our Construction Products Group and Performance Coatings Group could experience sales declines for the next two quarters, and then turned positive in the fourth quarter. Our Consumer Group should continue its strong sales momentum throughout the fiscal year. The Specialty Products Group is likely to face flat sales comparisons during the second quarter, which should turn in the second half of the year. These estimates assume that we do not experience a surge in COVID-19 that results in a second round of stay-at-home orders. Due to continued economic uncertainty related to the impacts of COVID-19 and the upcoming U.S election, we are not providing fiscal 2021 full year earnings guidance. This wraps up our formal comments. We will now be pleased to take your questions. Sure. Yes. For the rest of the month, other than June where we had extraordinary double-digit growth as lock down restrictions eased. We are in the low to mid single-digit range, so that's why we projected Q2 similar way. Yes, thanks. Yes, in terms of international, Arun, we are pretty flat in Europe after having taken it on the chin, of course in April and May there due to tighter lockdown restrictions. Currency is not a headwind in Europe at the moment, so that's good news there as well. In Latin America, it's been really challenging as you can imagine in Brazil and other places. Mexico we've had challenging results and that's made worse by currencies that have weakened over time versus the U.S dollar. So Latin America has been a bit of a challenge and that's principally where most of our international business is. Canada did well in the first quarter. That was another place where they had tighter lockdown restrictions versus the U.S in April and May. So we had good performance there, and we have very strong consumer brands in Canada. So of course that business mix helps us and should help us looking ahead. Yes, sure. Yes, we are seeing some inflation in select raw materials like acetone, for example, is one that really stands out. Also as Frank mentioned due to some supply chain issues and metal packaging, we are having to find new sources often not with the same cost that we were used to from the old sources. So that'll certainly provide some cost pressure. Yes, I have heard of other raw materials and freight, as you mentioned, we expect that to go up by a modest, mid single-digit percentage next year, LTL freight, oil seems to go up and we expect more of the same. Yes. So, Kevin, back in July, we said our CapEx would be about $130 million this year. Now because of this above expectation demand in consumer, the CapEx will probably be closer to $140 million, which will make it pretty comparable to last year when we did about $147 million. Sure. Yes, the other accrued liability went up and the reason is that customer rebates went up because of our strong DIY activity. And that also relates to the timing of tax payments. That was a big reason for the $67 million increase versus 12 months ago. Well, typically we pay our customer rebates at the end of their year, which should be in the winter time. So that aspect will go down on the timing of tax payments. Matt, you have any idea?"

            "content": "Thank you, Liz. Good morning, and welcome to the RPM International Inc. investor call for our fiscal 2021 first quarter. Joining me on today's call are Rusty Gordon, RPM's Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Matt Ratajczak, our Vice President of Global Tax and Treasury, who is supporting our Investor Relation activities. I'll share insights behind our strong financial performance for the quarter, as well as an update on our MAP to Growth operating improvement program. Then Matt will walk you through a review of our first quarter adjusted financial results. Rusty will conclude our formal remarks with our outlook for the remainder of fiscal '21, after which we'll take your questions. Our strategically balanced business model, the resiliency of our operating companies and our MAP to Growth operating improvement program have enabled RPM to pull through the depths of the economic slowdown created by the COVID-19 pandemic. With the dual benefit of improved margins and better working capital management, our businesses are generating excellent cash flow, which allowed us to pay down nearly $200 million of debt during the first quarter. Today our liquidity is up to $1.5 billion. We have pivoted back to investing for accelerating growth as demonstrated by the acquisition of Ali Industries, as well as our strong organic growth in a number of our segments in the first quarter. During our fiscal '21 first quarter, selected segments of the global economy began to gain momentum as stay-at-home orders were relaxed. This freed pent-up demand from last year's fourth quarter and help drive our record top line results, which grew 9.1% over the prior year period. This was in sharp contrast to the COVID-19 related sales decline we reported for the fiscal 2020 fourth quarter. Our two largest segments posted positive growth in the first quarter, while two of our segments declined. Overall, RPM's results benefited from the positive impact of our MAP to Growth operating improvement program and our balanced business model were strength in one segment, offsets weakness in another. In addition, much credit for our strong performance is due to our management philosophy, which keeps customer centric decision-making at the operating level and enables our companies to be very nimble and adapting to change. Some examples around RPM of leaning into the pandemics disruption include Rust-Oleum, tinting wall paint, and shipping to residents through a new e-commerce program hosted by a big box home center. Tremco developing innovative indoor air quality services with a global MRO distributor for use on its customer's facilities and our Legend Brands business pivoting from disaster remediation to disinfecting and air purification in response to evolution of its contractors business needs. The most significant driver of RPM's first quarter growth was our consumer segment, which had already been experiencing unprecedented demand for small project paints, caulk, sealants, stains, cleaners, patch repair products as consumers completed more DIY home improvement projects. On a consolidated basis, international markets rebounded with 2% growth after a 26% drop during the difficult fourth quarter when construction or hardware channels were not deemed essential and were thus locked down in most of the international markets we serve. We continue to benefit from successfully implementing our MAP to Growth program, which enabled us to leverage the first quarter sales growth into even stronger bottom line results with adjusted EBIT that increased nearly 40%. During the first quarter, we announced the closure of one additional plant, which brings our total to 23 out of the previously announced 31 plants that originally targeted in our MAP to Growth operating improvement program. The momentum behind our MAP to Growth program continues to accelerate as it drives efficiency and operational excellence throughout our businesses. We are on track to reach the targeted run rate of $290 million in annualized savings by the conclusion of our current fiscal year, which ends May 31 '21. The projected benefits from our center-led procurement initiatives are ahead of plan, and our administrative improvements and ERP consolidations will continue into fiscal '22. In regard to our EI -- in regard to our IT investments, we are currently enhancing our capabilities in analytics, by centralizing systems and databases. This is allowing RPM to harness more complete information across its multiple business units and build decision support tools to improve the effectiveness of our procurement, distribution and sales teams. We're leveraging our information resources to make RPM stronger, and our success is a direct result of the cooperation of buying of our associates across RPM. While the MAP to Growth operating improvement program will be reaching its annualized cost savings target by the end of the fiscal year, we will run through that target as a result of continuing opportunities in the MAP to Growth pipeline, including consolidation to more accounting locations after the setup of new ERP systems are completed. In addition, we are establishing a culture of continuous improvement and operational excellence that will benefit RPM's bottom line for years to come. Most importantly, I'm proud of the efforts of our plant managers who have made our workers' health and safety a top priority during the pandemic, supported by Mike Sullivan and Ken Armstrong here at the corporate office, our operations personnel have successfully minimized workplace transmission of COVID-19 at a very low level. I'll now turn the call over to Matt Ratajczak, who will review our fiscal 2021 first quarter results on an adjusted basis. I think most of it, John, came from our core traditional growth and just the surge in North American DIY activity. We're also starting to see that pick up in the U.K and parts of Europe. And the new initiatives are some tests in the wall paint area that we talked about and a few other categories that I think will have -- hopefully a greater impact in the coming quarters and into next year. You know, I think we'll certainly run through $300 million and then some as we get into '22. There's outperformance in the benefits of consolidating procurement areas. There's continuing benefits and outperforming in the manufacturing sector, it's a combination. We're getting what we expected from the plant consolidations, but the benefits of the lean manufacturing disciplines and continuous improvement activities will actually result in probably a $100 million of savings in the manufacturing sector versus the $75 million we originally projected. Sure. It was -- I think we missed the opportunity in our prepared remarks to emphasize the cash flow and the balance sheet improvements we had in the quarter, pretty extraordinary. I think for the most part it's sustainable. Some of the working capital improvements in our consumer segment are probably a little overdone in the quarter just because our inventory levels are lower than we would like relative to a 34% organic growth and our need to continue to expand capacity. We also had probably $15 million or so of COVID related one-time benefits in the quarter. But in general, the strong cash flow I think is indicative of the operating efficiencies we've been pursuing, improvements in our working capital, most of which will be permanent and the higher margin profile that we're able to leverage on the sales growth we have. We paid off $200 million of debt in the quarter and there will be more to come and I think that's one of the real highlights of the quarter. Thank you, John. Good morning, Frank. Sure. Sure. As we'd indicated in the past quarterly investor calls, the pace of some of our activities has been slowed by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. And so like most companies, we have kept independent contractors out of our plant facilities and offices, so it slowed the pace of the completion of some of our ERP implementations. It's also slowed the pace of some of the plant closure activity and in related areas slowed our ability to get into now kind of mid to smaller size manufacturing facilities with what we call fit events, which are really the kickoffs of the lean manufacturing disciplines and continuous improvement activities that are paying big dividends for us. And so we're probably 6 to 12 months beyond the original December 31, 2020 target date that we communicated a couple of years ago, only as a result of the slowdown from the pandemic and our ability to get people into plants and/or offices to complete these activities. No, I think the -- there were some concerns by folks in the investment community, some expressed on this call in the past that we had a good benefit from our MAP to Growth program after the first year, but that some programs would lose steam. We accelerated in the second year of the MAP to Growth program and we don't see that acceleration stopping at this point. There's still gas in that tank. Thank you, Frank. Good morning, Rosemarie. Just a little more than $30 million. I think roughly a $100 million, could be a little bit more. Keep in mind that a lot of the benefits here have been in cost of goods sold in the manufacturing area. So it flows through our P&L with the seasonality of our revenues. So you can't just take a $30 million or $32 million benefit in our seasonally high first quarter and flow it even -- evenly across months or quarters, but we'll get a $100 million this year. And we're probably $50 million ahead of our original targets through Wave 2. Some of that is pulling forward things that we plan for Wave 3. So not necessarily additional saving to our original goal and then others of it, our additional savings. I think that's why we're confident by the time we get through May 31, '21 we'll have achieved the $290 million. And then we believe there's another collection of tens of millions that will show up in fiscal '22 as well, and we'll benefit subsequent quarters. Sure. A couple of things in that. Number one specific to DIY, I think in our categories and many others, and we have commented on this in the past. Good example is our wood stains and finishes category that's up big. That takes a greater skill set than just patching and repairing. And so we firmly believe and our big customers believe that the confident DIY are based in North America had grown, and that bodes well for the DIY sector across a lot of categories. And so we see solid growth in the consumer segment for the balance of this year, and we think it will be on a new base that's higher than what any of us could achieved on our own as a result of, I think one of the very few positive consequences of this pandemic in terms of driving that larger level of activity. The flip side is supply chains across all industries, and certainly in DIY had been disrupted mightily. We've seen some allocations on things like cans. Some of that's been driven by spikes in demand, some of it's been driven by plant closures associated with COVID-19 infections. So that's in our supply base. Inventory levels are not where they need to be in the DIY channel. Very few companies and we're one of them sit around with a idle capacity of 40% or 50%. And so the 34% organic growth that we experienced in the first quarter along with some of the supply chain disruptions has been challenging to us and everybody. And we're working hard to make sure that we can drive the efficiency to overcome that. So the long and the short of all that is we see solid performance in our consumer business for the balance of the year. We see a larger base that's going to be permanent and we continue to introduce new products and take market share. So we're pretty excited about what we see for the next couple of years in consumer. Thank you. Thanks, Rosemarie. Good morning, Michael. Absolutely. Sure. Well, I think the comments I just made in response to Rosemarie Morbelli answer that question in terms of a larger base. And I think really expectations by us and our customers of a continuation at least for the next couple of quarters of this larger than usual organic growth basis. You'll also see a pickup in the pro, and we're finally starting to see that and we would expect more of that in the new calendar year. Most of the big activity has been DIY as, at least over the late spring and early summer, homeowners were reticent to allow contractors in or around their homes. That's starting to change. And the pro business, particularly at some of our biggest customers will start to pick up. That has not been a big driver of demand so far, but we think it will be in the coming quarters in the next year. Sure. We closed Ali Industries, great family business headquartered in Ohio. They're essentially in abrasives and sandpaper products and DIY. A great adjacency to our Rust-Oleum business, but also with some of our other businesses. So we're very excited about that and we're thrilled to have the Ali family and the Ali Industries associates join RPM. We had negotiated that transaction prior to the pandemic, and we [technical difficulty] put most of our acquisition activity on hold. I think given our strong results and our great cash flow, we are confident and restarting our acquisition activity. And I would expect that particularly in the small to medium sized private company space across all categories, you'll see activity pick up pretty aggressively between now in calendar year end in part in anticipation or concern about possible tax changes with an administrative change in the new year. Thank you, Mike. Good morning, Ghansham. Good morning. Maybe, Frank, going back to the Construction segment, which is one of the -- obviously the sources of upside relative to the original guidance. Where did you see the upside relative to perhaps your initial predictions for the quarter. And then related to that, why would that turn negative in the second quarter, apart from just some forward based on pent-up demand? Is that what you're expecting for that segment? No, I think it may be flat to slightly down in Q2, but we see it turning modestly positive in the second half. The challenge is there and our construction segment is really what happens with the economy. Our results in the first quarter and continuing the spring suggest to us that we're taking market share. We're seeing a decent modest revenue growth. It's leveraging to our bottom line really well. And some of our peers where we could get data are still experiencing negative results. If the economy continues to improve and if the health interventions around vaccines and treatment kind of help build confidence, then upside for us for the balance of the year and into '22 could be the activities in our Construction Group -- Construction Products Group. If there are hiccups relative to coronavirus and further shutdowns, like you're seeing in Israel and in select parts of Europe, then that'll be a challenge for us as we get into the new year. So that's the principle area that makes us scratch our head about providing any more detailed guidance for the year. But if things continue as they are, we'll do perhaps better than we've indicated in the second half of the year and for the full year of fiscal '21. Sure. I'll take the last question first. We'll just repeat what Rusty said. We anticipate kind of a mid organic growth in the second quarter and it'll have to leverage nicely with the bottom line with EBIT growth of 20% or more. And I think that's all we would say about the second quarter. As it relates to Performance Coatings, it's about $1 billion $1.1 billion segment in total. And as you recall about 30% of the revenues are tied to the oil and gas, energy and energy specific -- broadly energy, and that segment is taking it on the chin in terms of oil prices and the halting of spending and a lot of activity, that will rebound eventually. But we don't anticipate seeing really any positive numbers there year-over-year until we get into the fourth quarter. Thanks, Ghansham. Good morning, Arun. Sure. Sure. Our original MAP to Growth specific goals as you'll recall were a $1 billion of EBIT and a 16% consolidated EBIT margin. And as we indicated, while we started a year-ago, mostly because the revenue growth up until recently wasn't meeting our expectations, we had a couple of other headwinds that we didn't see achieving those within the timeframe we talked about. We are still keenly focused on a 16% consolidated EBIT margin. It'll take longer to get there than we thought. But there will be opportunities for continued margin expansion in certain parts of RPM in the coming -- I'd say 12 to 18 months. So those goals are still front and center for us. And I think you'll see EBIT margins improve. They're likely to improve in places other than consumer. With this performance, some of which has been COVID driven. We finally gotten back to margin levels that we had experienced in the past. And I would expect to see continued margin improvement in our Construction Products Group as well as the Specialty Products Group this year. And then eventually, but probably not until '22 in the Performance Coatings Group. Sure. I'll let Rusty handle that. So I would just add to that that we're starting to see similar trends in the U.K and Europe in consumer takeaway that is building a bigger base than what we had before. And we would expect, for instance, in the second quarter, some pretty good organic growth in the U.K and Europe, assuming there are not further lockdowns as the DIY markets start to look a little bit like what we've experienced in North America. And I would just add to that two things to keep in mind. One in general, the cost price mix is relatively flat. Now we haven't had meaningful price increases some time. We are benefiting from the fact, and we reminded folks of this in the past that we're one of the few of the major competitors that we get compared to that's on FIFO accounting. And so, you'll see reflected in our results in the first quarter, things that we experienced in terms of cost price mix 60 or 90 days ago. And so that's worth keeping in mind as well as you think about RPM versus peers. Thank you. Good morning, Kevin. Sure. So in terms of the lean manufacturing disciplines and continuous improvement disciplines that we are taking now in places outside of just the factory floor, I would say we're in middle innings and there's more to come. Obviously, over time that incremental benefit will become less impactful, but it should be the gift that keeps on giving for a long time. And it has changed our culture and the way that our people have embraced that change and the speed with which it has happened has been very impressive. And we work hard to make sure that we maintain those gains. And so we see more to come in that category. It'd be hard to talk about something offsetting inflation, because if you -- as you have followed us over 20 years, we're pretty raw material intensive as is everybody in our space. And when you get spikes in raw materials up or down, I certainly think we proven through price increases, although not always timely, but through price increases and now going forward, our ability to operate more efficiently. We can certainly maintain a level of margin profitability over a cycle, but we'll continue to see some swings in the future as we have in the past relative to the activity of raws. We are lastly taking the MAP to Growth activities into some more data intensive areas around product mix and other things that are going to help our margins in the future as well. Sure. I'll have Rusty answer the CapEx question, but we are investing in more capacity particularly in consumer. And you know, we obviously a 34% organic growth rate isn't anything we expect to be sustained, but there is a higher base of business. And we're expanding to meet that, particularly in small project paints and cleaning categories. In the cleaning category, we've gone from what was a modest start seven years ago with Krud Kutter, an acquisition that was $5 million to what should be a product category at Rust-Oleum in excess of $100 million. And that could be meaningfully larger category for us in the future. So those are two areas for instance, where we're expanding. We're also expanding capacity in the roof coating capabilities of our Construction Products Group. Thanks, Kevin. Good morning. Yes. Sure. Again, I don't know that we would provide that kind of detail other than to just make clear that, on FIFO you're looking at across price mix that was in spot prices, what we experienced 60 or 90 days ago, as opposed to somebody on LIFO who would be reflecting spot prices as of today. I think that's correct. So we communicated in the spring when companies were able to defer FICA about a $25 million benefit there? About a $25 million benefit and that's just a deferral into the next year. We did not choose to reduce the FICA payment of our payrolls that was an option and we chose not to pursue that. Thank you. Good morning, Josh. I think we feel pretty good about our guidance for Q2. As it relates to the second half of the year, I really think it depends upon our Construction Products category. We've got a lot of new products, we've got a lot of good momentum there. We're taking market share. We are really pulling together what was a -- not very well coordinated collection of companies serving the construction, chemical industry broadly and waterproofing and sealants and floor coatings and things like that. And that has become a very well coordinated and got good leadership there. So we're poised to do really well. And it really depends on economic activity as we get into the new calendar year. And again, it goes to our hesitancy to provide more specific guidance. If the economic recovery continues, we will outperform this year. If some combination of COVID and disruptions around the elections result in an economic downturn as we get into calendar '21, then I think we'll be more at the bottom of what we talked about. Yes, I wouldn't get into the segment details right now, other than to say kind of mid single-digit growth. We will continue to have outsize growth in consumer, although not to the extent that we had in the first quarter. And we should have a flat deposit of growth in our Construction Products Group, and I think the others go in line with what Rusty has talked about. Sure. Well it's delayed as we've communicated from our original projection. I think we just made bad assumptions at the beginning of MAP to Growth that the working capital improvements that we expected to generate originally about $230 million in cash would come evenly. And the fact of the matter is the way it happens is you get your plant improvements first, you begin to get the benefits of some of your consolidating activities, and then your working capital improvements follow. We are seeing that now and certainly over the next 12, 18 months, there's another $100 million of relative working capital improvement. I say relative, obviously, the numbers will move based on a revenue growth. Thank you. Good morning, Mike. Thank you. Sure. I can do it just generally, and by some examples we've provided in the past. Our Marine Coatings business in April and May, our Guardian Protective Products business that supplies furniture retailers and furniture manufacturers, businesses like that literally saw their revenues drop 50%, 60%, 70% in April and May, and it was pretty scary. We are seeing a significant return in the Marine Coatings business to be very positive. As retailers open up, we're seeing a bigger than anticipated return in the Guardian Protective Products business. So we're seeing a nice rebound in those businesses and while the Specialty Products Group had negative results in the first quarter, you'll see positive results out of that group, I believe for the remainder of the fiscal year and it's for those reasons. But those were the disruptions that we saw. The disruptions in other parts of our business that have been hit and miss and are really referenced to the supply chain issue are in many cases around COVID related plant closures. We had a protocol very quickly that if we had any infections, we would close the facility and do a disinfecting and cleaning. And if we've had very few if any work-related exposures, most of our exposures over the summer have been from people who had been working at home. But in a few places we had to close a facility for two weeks. We've had suppliers that have had to close facilities for weeks. And so those disruptions in different raw materials and/ or different parts of the supply chain have been challenging. We're not seeing those today, although we're still suffering the impact for instance in the canned category. Yes, we did not have any price increases over the summer or in the quarter. And so the price increases that we got were mostly a year ago and those were necessary to overcome what were a couple of year of raw material challenges. And we certainly have benefited from that in the subsequent quarters in terms of cost price mix. But from a price perspective across most all of RPM, it's been -- there's been little or no price increases in the last couple of quarters. Yes, I don't have a good answer for that question. We can get back to you. Thank you. Hey, Vince. How are you? Sure. I think consumer will be kind of mid to upper single digits for the balance of the year. Excellent. Thank you. Thank you. Apparently we had a technology hiccup with line disconnection, but we're back on. If there are any further questions we will take them. And Liz, if there are no further questions, let me know. Hey, go ahead, Steve. Sorry for the disconnect. It was all volume and it was broadly across the entire category of small project paints, wood stains, and finishes caulks and sealants, patch and repair products. Cleaners were a big category. And so that was good. Sure. So when talking to our largest customers, they believe this DIY strength has some legs to it. I think we concur that there is a -- that this crazy dynamic has created a larger base of confident DIYers across a lot of categories, including ours. So there is a new larger base of business. They quite candidly neither we nor our big customers probably could have generated in this timeframe in normal circumstances, but it's here. And it is broad across all the different categories and it's continuing into the fall months. Obviously, it's -- in our case, it's a seasonal business. So we'll see seasonal slowdowns as we get into the colder winter months. We anticipate solid results in the spring whether they're back to kind of the normal mid single digits, or they're still a uptick in the spring when the seasonality comes back, we'll find out the hard way. But we're pretty excited as our customers about this whole category, about a larger base of business, and also in our case some tests in a couple areas like wall paint, a few other places that could get us into some new categories, but time will tell on that. Yes, it's increasing at a rate of double. It started on a relatively small base, call it 10 million, but we're seeing doubling of our e-commerce business through a number of platforms, but principally homedepot.com and Amazon. Those are the two biggest drivers. There are other platforms. So we have a tint based program that is a direct ship that we are having tests with a couple of other customers. So we do have a tint based program there. And on the Color Ready To Go program it's still in test at Walmart and it's going well. Walmart has other paint vendors that have tint based programs and that's, we are the Color To Go program. Thank you, Steve. Sure. Before we hit our closing remarks, I'd like to qualify a couple of things. In the Construction Products Group and Performance Coatings Group, we anticipate flat to down sales for the next couple of quarters. The MAP to Growth should allow us particularly in Construction Products to leverage to positive EBIT growth there. And then we're hopeful that we'll see that turn up in the second half or certainly the fourth quarter. As it relates to TiO2, we're seeing over the last couple of months, about 2.5% -- 2% to 2.5% price increase impact there. At 2 O'clock Eastern Time tomorrow, we are going to hold our Annual Meeting of stockholders. As many companies have done and for obviously a solid and important health reasons, we will be doing it virtually. Our Annual Meeting of stockholders can be accessed through our website at www.rpminc.com, or at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/RPM2020. We remain optimistic that we'd be able to return to an in-person meeting next year and continue our tradition of engaging with shareholders in-person, and also providing samples of our newest products. We'd like to thank our associates worldwide for their continued hard work and dedication during these uncertain times. Through all these challenges we've experienced over the last few months, our associates have demonstrated incredible resilience as they find new and innovative ways to safely operate our businesses and continue to deliver for our customers. I'd like to especially thank our personnel at our Carboline plant in Lake Charles, Louisiana, whose resiliency in the face of the aftermath of hurricane Laura is inspiring to all of us. A number of our employees lost homes, our facilities received structural damage, there continued to be power outages and water outages for weeks after the hurricane. And despite all that, we were able to ship products to customers 11 days after the hurricane hit the area. And their response is symbolic of the RPM culture, where our employees act like owners of their businesses. I'd also like to thank our shareholders for their ongoing investment in RPM. We remain committed to completing our MAP to Growth program to generating solid revenue and earnings growth and creating value for you over the long-term. And to everyone on the call, I wish you and your family's good health. We look forward to updating you on our fiscal 2021 second quarter results in the first week of January and hope that many of you will join us for our Annual Meeting of stockholders tomorrow. Thank you and have a great day."

At this time, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to RPM\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Mr. Frank Sullivan, for opening remarks. Please go ahead, sir.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you, Michelle. Good morning and welcome to the RPM International Inc. investor call for our fiscal 2022 fourth quarter and yearend. Joining me on today\u2019s call are Rusty Gordon, RPM\u2019s Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Mike Laroche, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. I\u2019ll share a broad commentary on our consolidated performance for the quarter and the year, then Mike will provide details on our financial results and Rusty will conclude our prepared remarks and our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Please note that our comments will be on an as adjusted basis and all comparisons are to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 unless otherwise indicated. We provided a supplemental slide presentation to support our comments on this call. It can be accessed in the Presentations and Webcasts section of the RPM website at www.rpminc.com. After our remarks, we'll be pleased to take your questions. We generated record fourth quarter performance, which reflected accelerating momentum across RPM throughout fiscal 2022. As we progress through the year, our nimble businesses responded quickly to address ever-changing supply chain constraints, inflationary challenges and foreign exchange headwinds. I'd like to share a few examples for RPM. In response to the scarcity of some raw materials, we purchased a manufacturing facility in Texas last September. The dedicated team quickly ramped up production of alkyd resins, which were in very short supply, due to a supplier explosion at one of our primary suppliers in the industry. In addition, our R&D professionals have been working around the clock to reformulate literally thousands of products to qualify different materials, all while maintaining high performance. Another example is our disaster restoration equipment business, which was hampered by the semiconductor chip shortage. It found alternative supply and reconfigured its products to accommodate these challenges and deliver for its customers. As you can see on Slide 3, this chart reflects the quarter-by-quarter actions that we took to steadily generate momentum across our businesses throughout the year. Also having an impact were the investments we've been making to accelerate growth in the fastest-growing areas of our business, particularly our high-performance building construction and coating systems. Our associates' efforts along with solid construction and industrial maintenance activity as well as a rebound in energy markets culminated in the fourth quarter that produced consolidated record sales and record adjusted EBIT. On the next slide, you'll note driven by pricing adjustments and operational efficiencies, we achieved record results in all four segments in sales and record EBIT in three of our segments. The lone outlier was our consumer group, which began to narrow the year-over-year gap in adjusted EBIT results as price increases started to catch up with inflation and access to raw materials improved. Better materials availability was largely due to the production facility we acquired last fall. We also benefited from $17 million in incremental savings during the quarter from our ongoing operating improvement program efforts. On that subject, driving operating efficiency remains a top priority at RPM, and our teams have made significant progress in developing the follow-up plan to our highly successful NAFTA Growth operating improvement program, which concluded at the end of fiscal '21. We're calling the new program, MAP 2025, and we will share details about it with you at an Investor Day to be scheduled in October around the time of our first quarter earnings release and Annual Meeting of Shareholders. We are confident that MAP 2025 will contribute to the momentum we are building for a successful fiscal 2023 and beyond. I'll now turn the call over to Mike Laroche, to discuss our consolidated and segment financial results in more detail.\nMike Laroche: Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter, we generated record consolidated net sales of $1.98 billion, an increase of 13.7% compared to the $1.74 billion reported in the same quarter of fiscal 2021. Organic sales growth of 15% or $261.9 million. Acquisitions contributed 0.9% to sales or $16.3 million, while foreign currency exchange was a headwind that decreased sales by 2.2% or $38.6 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were a record $1.42, which was an increase of 10.9% compared to the $1.28 reported in the year-ago quarter. Our consolidated adjusted EBIT was up 11.7% to a record $263.7 million compared to $236.2 million reported in the fiscal 2021 fourth quarter. Our Construction Products Group generated fourth quarter record net sales of $745.9 million, up 18.5% compared to the fiscal 2021 fourth quarter. Organic sales growth was 19.9% and acquisitions contributed 1.6%. Foreign currency translation headwinds reduced sales by 3%. Despite comparisons to a strong prior year when sales and earnings were at record levels, CPG continued to generate high growth propelled by its differentiated service model as well as its unique building envelope and restoration solutions. The segment's business is producing the strongest sales growth were those providing roofing systems, insulated concrete forms as well as admixtures and repair products for concrete. Results in international markets were mixed with Europe being challenged by macroeconomic headwinds, while Latin America experienced significant double-digit sales gains. CPG fiscal 2022 fourth quarter adjusted EBIT increased 10.9% to a record $122.4 million. This segment was able to offset significant raw material inflationary pressure with selling price increases and operational improvements. Our Performance Coatings Group fiscal 2022 fourth quarter net sales were a record $329.4 million, an increase of 16.3% over the year-ago period. Organic sales increased 17.4% and acquisitions contributed 1.8%, which were partially offset by a foreign currency translation headwind of 2.9%. PCG's businesses providing flooring systems, protective coatings and FRP grading, all generated double-digit sales growth. A rebound in international markets as well as ongoing success in the company's vertical end markets, including energy, technology and food beverage helped drive PCG's results. In addition, improved sales management systems and price increases were major factors in the segment's excellent top line results. Adjusted EBIT increased 37.3% to a record $42.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, driven by volume growth, selling price increases, revenue growth leveraging good product mix and operational improvements. The Specialty Products Group reported record net sales of $225.8 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, an increase of 11.4% compared to the fiscal 2021 fourth quarter. Organic sales increased 12.2% and acquisitions added 0.5%, which were offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation of 1.3%. The majority of SPG's businesses experienced double-digit sales growth. Leading the way were its OEM coatings companies as well as its food coatings and additives business, which has improved performance under new management. Its disaster restoration equipment business continued to rebound as it cleared backlogs caused by semiconductor chip shortages and grew sales in the teens despite a difficult comparison to a strong prior year that had high demand for its products driven by winter storm Uri. SPG's adjusted EBIT was a record $44.2 million in the fiscal 2022 fourth quarter, an increase of 21.8% compared to adjusted EBIT of $36.3 million in last year's quarter. The segment's increase in adjusted EBIT was bolstered by the favourable impact of higher sales which were leveraged to the bottom line due to selling price increases that began catching up with prior cost inflation. Our Consumer Group achieved record net sales of $682.8 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, an increase of 8.6% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Organic sales increased 10%, which was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation of 1.4%. The Consumer Group's top line growth was driven by improved supply of key alkyd resins produced by the manufacturing plant we acquired last September as well as price increases and high growth in product lines with professional remodelers including cost and sealants. While North American markets grew, European markets remained challenged due to macroeconomic headwinds in the region. Fiscal 2022 fourth quarter adjusted EBIT was $80.3 million, an increase -- a decrease of 14.2% compared to adjusted EBIT of $93.6 million reported for the prior year period. Adjusted EBIT was impacted by continued raw material cost inflation and higher costs from ongoing shipping challenges and industry labor shortages. In response, the Consumer Group has been instituting price increases to catch up with inflation, building resilience in its supply chain and investing in capacity and process improvements to better respond to customer demand. To wrap up, I have a few comments on capital allocation. Our significant liquidity enables us to fund internal growth initiatives, make acquisitions and reward our investors with cash dividend payments and repurchases of our shares. Since our last earnings release in April, we repurchased $50 million of our common stock. This is in addition to earlier share repurchases and early reduction of our convertible notes in November 2018 with roughly $200 million of cash. Combined, this puts us at $658 million towards our $1 billion repurchase goal that was established at the onset of our MAP to Growth program in 2018. Now I'll turn the call over to Rusty to discuss our outlook.\nRusty Gordon: Thanks, Mike. Looking ahead to the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we will continue to focus on navigating a number of challenges. The strengthening US dollar is expected to be a headwind impacting the translation of our international results. We expect significant cost increases to continue for certain raw materials, labor and packaging. We also anticipate continued higher costs from unreliable bulk transportation, which creates production inefficiencies, although they should have less of an impact moving forward as well as fuel surcharges which are being driven by high energy prices that have been exacerbated by the conflict in Ukraine. These cost pressures are expected to disproportionately affect our consumer segment. Despite these challenges, the proactive measures we took over the course of fiscal 2022, enabled RPM to accelerate momentum in the business and it is expected to carry over into fiscal 2023. We expect to continue implementing price increases as needed and continue improving operational efficiencies in order to minimize cost pressures and restore margins closer to historical levels. While there is a recessionary undercurrent in the economy, we anticipate that demand for our products and services will remain strong particularly meet those that improve energy efficiency and extend the useful life of our customers' assets through protection and restoration. In addition, we are making strategic investments in organic growth initiatives focused on market opportunities and industry trends including the future funding for infrastructure and onshoring of industries responsible for pharmaceutical, food, technology and energy security. Based on these factors, we expect to generate fiscal 2023 first quarter consolidated sales growth in the mid-teens over last year's record first quarter sales. For each of our four segments, we anticipate sales growth in the teens. It is likely that the consumer group will generate the highest growth of the four segments due to; Number one, selling price increases that should allow it to catch up with inflation; number two, improved alkyd resin supply; and number three, investments made in new capacity and continuous improvement initiatives. Fiscal 2023 first quarter consolidated adjusted EBITDA is anticipated to increase 20% to 25% versus the same period last year. Lastly, I'd like to announce that we have hired Matt Schlarb [ph], as our Senior Director of Investor Relations. He previously held Investor Relations positions with Watery.com, Mettler Toledo and Fairmount Santrol. We're pleased to have him join RPM and look forward to having him raise our Investor Relations function to a new level. Matt will be joining us on our equity analyst calls this week and you'll be working more closely with them as we near the announcement of our first quarter results and the investor event that will provide details on our MAP 2025 initiative. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now be pleased to take your questions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from John Roberts from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nJohn Roberts: Good morning, and nice quarter. Does the alkyd resin capacity get you to the integration that you want or would you like to have even further integration if possible? It's always a trade-off between having capital deployed versus having your margins higher?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I think the Corsicana plan is relatively unique. We have another kind of backward integrated business as well with our Stonhard Group and I believe we have the backward integration that we desire at this point in time. We do plan to spend probably close to $100 million over the next three years at Corsicana to backward integrate into a few other categories as well as use that site for expansion of our new Dura product line. But we do not plan any additional significant investments in backward integration at this time other than internal investments on that site.\nJohn Roberts: Okay. And then you noted the recessionary undertones to the economy. Which markets do you think are most at risk here for RPM?\nFrank Sullivan: For us, we're doing quite well in North America. Latin America is relatively strong compared to last year. The areas that we see the biggest challenges shouldn't be a surprise. It's principally Europe and it's a function of some of the inflation hitting Europe later, slowing growth and most of which I would attribute to the Russian war on Ukraine and its impact, both on current economic activity and anticipated challenges in the energy markets in Europe, specifically.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mike Harrison, Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nMike Harrison: Was wondering if you can talk a little bit about the construction business and I guess specifically, can you break down how much of that organic growth -- 20% organic growth was pricing and how much was volume? And I guess as you're looking forward, how much macro impact would you expect to see in that construction business if we slip into a recession? What do you feel like trends around infrastructure spend and some of the onshoring or reshoring that you referenced might be enough to keep that underlying growth looking pretty solid?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So we, in general, feel really good about the dynamics, particularly North America for our Construction Products Group and our Performance Coatings Group. In both cases, unit volume growth was in the mid- to high single digits. And it could have been better, particularly in our Construction Products Group, but we continue to face shortages that impact projects. Some of those shortages are related to intermediate chemicals that we purchase, and others of those shortages related to fasteners or insulation board or other types of components on a construction product project that we're not directly involved in, but slow down projects. So that organic growth could have been better in the quarter, and we continue to face some of those challenges. I will tell you that the demand continues to be strong, and we feel pretty good about the literally, hundreds of billions of dollars that came from the American rescue plan in February of '21, and the $1.9 trillion infrastructure bill, at least $800 billion of which will go into real hardcore infrastructure, both of which bodes well for the dynamics in the markets that our Construction Products Group and Performance Coatings Group serve and again, those are principally driven in the United States.\nMike Harrison: All right. And maybe a question for Rusty. Obviously, we're in a pretty unusual situation as it relates to working capital, leading you guys to be free cash flow negative for Q4 as well as for all of fiscal '22. Can you give us some initial thoughts on working capital and CapEx for fiscal '23? I think we're all just trying to get a better sense of what the free cash flow might look like for this coming year.\nRusty Gordon: Sure. Yes. We had a rough year for cash flow in fiscal '22. When you combine decreasing margins and inflation, that's usually a bad sign for cash flow. And as a result of unreliable supply, we had to build up inventory where we could because supply was so unreliable as was transportation. As a result of that, our inventories need to get into balance better and fiscal -- don't have enough finished goods even though inventory did increase to really supply and service our customers like we'd like. So that's getting better as a number of the force majeures have expired over the year, we still face a few supply challenges, but not nearly as bad as last year. So now that as we said in our guidance, we're going to be back expanding margins again, EBIT margins. We would anticipate a much better year for cash flow. As it relates to capital expenditures, we are looking to play offense and invest more in our businesses. We have a lot of high-growth areas, including high-performance buildings. That's been a real growth area for us. And as a result, we're -- spending as probably closer to -- in fiscal '23. Acquisition, on the other hand, have continued to be at high multiples. And as you know about RPM, we're very disciplined and don't pay those crazy multiples. So we would anticipate acquisition activity to continue to be lower than historically we've been at. So hopefully, that answers your questions.\nOperator: The next question comes from John McNulty of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJohn McNulty: Thanks for taking my questions. So I guess maybe the first one, high level, can you give us some color as to how to think about price versus volume in the quarter? And overall, if there are any segments that kind of stood out as the leaders or the laggards and how that may change as we kind of push into the half of fiscal '23 for you?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So I provided the unit volume by group, mid- to high single digits in Construction Products and in Performance Coatings. Unit volume was relatively flat across the different businesses in our Specialty Products segment, and we were down high single digits in consumer for the quarter. I will tell you, high level, from our perspective, it was a great quarter. We delivered the guidance that we provided. In the fourth quarter, we are ahead of cost price mix in 3 of our 4 segments. In Q1, we should be ahead of the cost price/mix dynamics in all four of our segments, meaning you will see higher EBIT growth in three of our four segments, those EBIT margins will be at or near all-time records. And in consumer, we've got a lot of catch-up to do, but you'll see a significant EBIT margin, the quarter that just ended. And that momentum that you can see in Slide 3, as we build momentum, principally around the cost price mix dynamic that impacts -- and we think even better in Q2.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. No, that's helpful color. And then I guess maybe to that, back of the envelope, when I kind of look at 1Q, it looks like you're kind of assuming year-over-year, the margins improved by, whatever, 50 to 100 basis points for the corporate level. I guess how should we think about how that progresses through the year? I mean is that kind of a decent run rate? Do you continue to catch up with either more pricing or the raw materials maybe even giving away a little bit? I guess, how are you thinking about the potential for margin improvement throughout the year?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. The largest improvement you'll see in our consumer group. It's a function of finally catching up on cost price mix and also the operating efficiency initiatives that we're undertaking there. And -- relationship to a very challenged fiscal '22. So you'll see significant improvement there and continued improvement with reasonable leverage to the bottom line in our other three segments. . Rusty indicated that in Q1, we see earnings growth in the 20% to 25% range. Q2 should be better than that. And boy, we are hesitant to go beyond any further comments because depending on what week it is and what headline you read, we're either heading for more inflation or a recession and what's happening in Europe relative to energy markets. So it's difficult to predict three to five months, let alone anything beyond that. But the next 2 months will be rock solid in terms of sales growth, earnings growth and EBIT improvement in every one of our segments.\nOperator: The next question comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nVincent Andrews: Wondering if you can talk a little bit more about the EU, in particular, obviously, there's a lot of volatility in the energy markets and a lot of anxiety over what could happen from a supply perspective of natural gas and electricity. Could you talk about your exposure and what mitigation plans you have in place? And sort of what -- if there was a disruption, what that would mean not just for your European business, but would there be any sort of collateral consequences good, better or indifferent in other geographies?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So the European business on a consolidated basis is about $1 billion. When we finish '23, it could be less than that. Demand is certainly weaker than North America. And with the foreign exchange translation and the strength of the dollar, that will further lessen or negatively impact translated results back into U.S. dollars. It's really a slower demand throughout Europe, I think, because of the challenges that they're facing economically and significantly higher energy costs than what we're seeing in the U.S. Again, part of it is the oil and gas dynamics globally. And part of it is what's happening with Russia and the impact on natural gas. Natural gas is the primary feedstock to all of our big European, Russian chemicals suppliers. And in some cases, in our facility, some of our construction product facilities, it's a primary -- so that's something we'll be paying attention to. And those are the dynamics. And back to not being able to look out very far, you can certainly paint a geopolitical economic picture where things get better nicely, if a positive more -- and a threat of Russian turning off natural gas to Germany in particular, but Western Europe happens then you're going to have a very quick and negative dynamic shift, I think, in all manufacturing in Europe.\nVincent Andrews: Just as a follow-up, in PCG, you mentioned sort of the sales management systems. And I guess two questions about that. One would be just sort of how much runway is left in that improvement process? And is there anything that you can take from your learnings in that segment and apply to your other segments? Or is this just a question of PCG catching up with where everybody else is?\nFrank Sullivan: A couple of things. Number one, PCG is benefiting, particularly in our Carboline unit from higher spending in the oil and gas markets and energy markets. And certainly, that's cyclical, and it's not a cyclical upturn. As indicated earlier, the huge chunks of money, particularly in the United States, in the infrastructure bill and the American Rescue Recovery Act are serving our Performance Coatings business pretty well. . And the dynamics of some of the pricing benefits and commercial excellence that we've -- utilizing data -- a more detailed -- In some cases, it might the RPM catching up to what others are doing, but it's benefiting RPM in a lot of places. And it -- those practices are particularly shareable because of commonalities and sales forces and approaches to the market and compensation structures between our Performance Coatings Group and our Construction Products Group.\nOperator: The next question comes from Josh Spector of UBS. Please go ahead.\nJosh Spector: Question around construction and specifically margins in the quarter. I think typically, you have relatively similar margins fourth quarter, first quarter and construction margins have been generally outperform over the past couple of years. So curious maybe you can give us some more comments about what drove the lower margins in construction and where you see those heading over the next year?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. There's -- that I would call out that drove the Construction Products Group challenges. One is they are the owner of our Corsicana plant, even though the -- our Consumer Group relative to alkyd resin productions. So there's a $8 million or $10 million negative hit for the year or through -- construction products from that, that should get better as we further utilize that plan. The second area is silicon silicones. Silicones have been the primary largest year-over-year, up hundreds, a couple of hundred percent in terms of costs and our Construction Products Group, silicone polymers are up 211% versus last year in the fourth quarter. And our Construction Products Group is the largest purchaser of silicone or silicone-related products for a lot of their sealants. The other area where we buy silicones is in our DAP business. And so those are the primary drivers of it. Excluding those and to a certain extent, that's a silly statement because those are -- that's the world we work in, but those two factors were what impeded the construction products from otherwise generating record EBIT. And as you'll note, through the MAP to Growth program, their EBIT results -- their consolidated EBIT figures are up almost 500 basis points. And we anticipate that continuing to expand on a sustainable basis in the next couple of years.\nJosh Spector: That's helpful. And just another follow-up just on construction, but related with Europe. Are you able to quantify what you're seeing volumes in that segment in Europe relative to the rest of the world?\nFrank Sullivan: Well, it's flat to slightly down, and it's true across all of our businesses. And in the construction products -- we have a really nice mainstream facility in Poland, and Poland has been very challenged. We have Ukrainian -- fight. We have a Polish associates who are hosting Ukrainian families in their homes. And so there's a lot of challenging things going on there, and that's particularly unique to our construction products group that's got a significant manufacturing base of Poland. Other than that, it's pretty weak demand and concerns about energy costs across Europe, U.K. and across all of our segments.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kevin McCarthy of Vertical.\nKevin McCarthy: Bottom of Slide 3, you referenced product reformulations. And in your prepared remarks, I think you used the word thousands of products. I imagine that was quite an undertaking. Can you help us frame it in terms of what percentage of your sales would have been reformulated and whether that had any material cost impact, either positive or negative as you executed through that process?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I don't have a good number. We can work on that. But -- formulated over fiscal '22, literally thousands of products. So you had to reformulate them, recertify them due to the quality control checks. And it's literally in the face of initially some primary raw material shortages. Those are tough to reformulate around. But it was a lot of the smaller more modest intermediate chemicals that we were unable to get. One of the larger categories would be in seed oils, and that's a channel -- has reformulated a lot of coatings into more bio-based seed oils and very favorable performance and very favorable environmental footprint. In a few places, we've had -- based resins just as an example. And so you've got to go through the reformulation process, the recertification process with your customers or with codes and then make sure you're doing the QC checks such that this reformulation isn't impacting performance. And the -- and this is not unique to RPM in our industry. The real -- there's lots of heroes, I think, frontline workers during the COVID period. And certainly, in the last year, our folks in our labs have worked over time to address this issue and that's -- we can get a better sense of that for you. That's in light of what across the board in terms of materials quarter-over-quarter, it's up about 35% in terms of material inflation in the quarter last year versus this quarter but it was really an intermediate chemical raw material availability that drove most of the reformulation.\nKevin McCarthy: Okay. And then just to follow up on that latter comment. How do you expect that 35% inflation level to trend in the first quarter? Related to that, you commented on silicones and oil. So are there other sort of problem children in the family? And then also, are you starting to see relief anywhere among the raw material basket at this point?\nFrank Sullivan: So the biggest challenges for us in the fourth quarter year-over-year were areas like metal packaging, particularly impacting consumer, up 50% -- this quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year are up 115%. I mentioned silicone up over 200%. Other costs, some of these intermediate chemicals that were not big buyers of that are critical and MDI is up 72%. You've got freight costs and fuel costs and surcharges. So it's been, again, not unique to us, incredibly challenging. Our budgeting anticipates additional inflation over fiscal '23 of about 15%. And that's what we've anticipated. Most of the pricing action that we've needed to cover that would have occurred in fiscal '22 and/or is occurring. There's additional price increases in a number of RPM companies occurring in the first quarter of '23. And then we'll stay tuned to both availability issues and inflation issues. And it's hard to really judge. We are seeing underlying primary base chemicals that we don't purchase directly but impact our purchases, flat or declining. You're certainly seeing oil prices move in the right direction. That has not made its way into the things we buy yet. And the volatility is such, it's really hard to tell other than we're in a period of time where the core underlying chemicals and oil prices are certainly moving in the right direction.\nOperator: The next question comes from Frank Mitsch of Fermium Research.\nFrank Mitsch: I appreciate the product shout out in one of your early answers highlighting rock solid. Well done and well played.\nFrank Sullivan: I was trying to give you a headline.\nFrank Mitsch: It's under consideration. You mentioned 3 of the 4 segments should see all-time record margins or near all-time record margins. Is that -- was that a 1Q comment? Or was that a '23 comment? Or how should we think about that comment you made?\nFrank Sullivan: So -- Performance Coatings Group is at all-time record EBIT margins -- direction. Our Construction Products Group just missed, and it just missed is -- if you would just -- impact, we're about equal to record margins of last year's fourth quarter. The big bogey there I mentioned before is silicone. We're a big buyer of silicones and they have been a real challenge for us. And then our Specialty Products Group had a record EBIT percent in the fourth quarter as well. And we expect them to build upon that and get back to record EBIT margins for coming quarters. So in Q1, you should see year-over-year EBIT margin improvement in every one of our segments, including consumer. I think the consumer results that we should be posting in the next couple of quarters will look impressive. But you have to keep in mind that's in light of some pretty weak comparisons. But we're pretty excited. We thought we had a really good fourth quarter. And as I said earlier, we met the guidance that we provided. And to be able to be where we are, I think our industry broadly in terms of the cost price mix dynamic. We're ahead of the curve in three places, and we'll be ahead of the curve in all four in the first quarter.\nFrank Mitsch: Very helpful. And if I could just follow up on the inventory question earlier. Obviously, you've had to increase your inventories given the supply chain issues. And I'm curious, when do you expect that to normalize? And how do you see your customers because you'd assume that your customers are also seeing more inventories. How should we think about the inventories throughout the chain?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I think as everybody knows -- for business in general. Thankfully, we're not in fast fashion, but you've got a lot of fashion retailers that have a lot of what people don't want and very little of what they do. And so that's a dynamic that's playing out in certain industries. In our case, we kind of suspended our working capital goals, which will be, in some detail, talked about in our MAP 2025 about in our annual report that goes out in mid-August and then details in October. But this year was challenging. So we were doing our best to accumulate raw materials. In certain areas, we're accumulating as much raw material as we could get, but not producing as we're waiting for a valve or a particular intermediate chemicals so that we could start production. And so we have a higher level on a relative -- raw material inventory than we've ever had and then in certain other places, the other thing that's strange is and again not unique to RPM, we would have the largest chunk of something, we have relative little of which is whip and so you can products like in our Legend Brands business or in some -- in our Construction Products Group or Consumer Group that are partially finished and in the case of Legend Brands, literally waiting for a chip or batches that are partially completed, but waiting for a key element. And so with inventory is something we have little of anywhere and something that we and other people probably had a lot more of than they ever realized relative to the dynamics of raw material availability. And we expect that to improve significantly in '23. I don't believe we'll get back to record cash flows, but we will get back to the positive. This is the first year in my history that we had negative cash flows in the fourth quarter and for the year. And we'll get back to generating a few hundred million dollars of free cash flow and then some in fiscal '23.\nFrank Mitsch: Very helpful. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJeff Zekauskas: You guys have FIFO inventory and costs have been rising. Your FIFO costs -- are your FIFO costs and your LIFO costs about caught up? Or is there still a meaningful gap? And because of that gap, maybe raw materials will peak in the second quarter of next year? Is that fair as a base case?\nRusty Gordon: Yes. Jeff, this is Rusty here. As far as FIFO goes, you're correct in that we're going to continue to see increases go through the P&L from the last 3 months. On average, we hold about 90 days of inventory. So the latest quarter's purchase order inflation that we're seeing on actual POs will come through 90 days later in the first quarter. I would say our fourth quarter too was penalized somewhat again because of FIFO. A lot of people out work out sick at our suppliers, freight carriers and in our facilities, too. So we had a lot of production inefficiencies around New Year that hit us in the fourth quarter. So on the good news front, that should be flowed through, and we should have better efficiency coming through our cost of sales from that standpoint in Q1.\nJeff Zekauskas: Okay. Got that. In fiscal -- for my follow-up, in fiscal '22, were your consolidated volumes down low single digits?\nRusty Gordon: For consolidated fiscal '22, our volume was pretty flat for the year up a tad but yeah, is was not down. It was up very marginally.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Byrne of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nSteve Byrne: So Frank, you mentioned your raws for alkyd resins have effectively doubled. Is it fair to say that one of the key drivers of that are the materials that go into those resins, which just surged during your -- plant margins to -- in this fiscal first quarter or maybe in the fiscal second? Is that a fair expectation?\nRusty Gordon: Yes. Steve, this is Rusty here. As far as alkyd resins go, you are correct. A lot of the plant-based oils have been rising since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. And alkyd resins have gone up more so because of the explosion a year ago that took out 30% of North America alkyd resin production capacity. So they continue to go up here as we speak in the first quarter. So buying alkyd resins externally is going to continue to be more expensive every day. And you are correct. We are ramping up our Corsicana, Texas plant and getting more of our alkyd supply in-house, and that progress is continuing. So we continue to make more different varieties of alkyd resins and should continue to get more of our alkyd resins sourcing done in-house.\nSteve Byrne: And then Rusty, this plant was acquired by Tremco, right? And not -- why isn't the Tremco plant, not an RPM plant when you indicated consumer businesses getting resins from this plant? So I guess I'm not sure who drive sourcing at a plant that was acquired by Tremco and maybe you could comment even a little more broadly. How do you incentivize that cost fertilization between brand and businesses for production and sales?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. Steve, this is Frank. So we don't have any RPM plants. RPM International Inc. doesn't own plants. Our plants are owned and operated by our four segments or their operating company businesses. That's where we have the expertise. And I think we have a very strong manufacturing operations team in our Construction Products Group. And our expectations for the Corsicana plant, they had -- they were not producing out the resins when we acquired them and so while that is the primary driver of our focus and investment with them in fiscal '22, we expect to expand it in other areas. And we're also going to use that site as a significant expansion site for Nudura, which is also a Construction Products Group. Lastly, I'd say that the cooperation and communication across our businesses post-MAP to Growth in a center-led approach across many functions, but particularly in manufacturing and operations, makes it possible and it's working -- really wasn't, and it's working exceptionally well to be sharing manufacturing assets and so that is definitely a shared manufacturing asset. The Consumer Group is the biggest beneficiary of that in fiscal '22 and will be, I think, for most of '23. But it's an asset that's shared across multiple RPM businesses, and it's got to report somewhere, and it's not RPM because we don't have the manufacturing expertise in our shop.\nOperator: The next question comes from Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nArun Viswanathan: So yes, I just wanted to get back to the inventory issue, I guess. I was just curious, within your Consumer Group, how would you characterize inventory levels at the big box? Obviously, we've heard elevated levels in other areas of the retail channel, but is that also what you would say for your big box partners?\nFrank Sullivan: Fill rates in consumer across multiple categories are still below where they need to be. And so you're looking at an industry -- high 90s and today 70s, and that's true across multiple product categories. So there are still dynamics of core inventory -- fixed and will be fixed as we, in our case, as we roll into fiscal '23. And so the inventory -- and that has been true for the last 2 years.\nArun Viswanathan: Okay. And in that group, is it possible that you actually see maybe see some outsized performance or increased demand in the small project category, if we do go into a more material recession? Have you seen that in prior cycles?\nFrank Sullivan: We have and prior recessions we've actually seen an uptick in our consumer DIY business. And we could certainly see that -- what's a multiyear $70 million expansion of capacity in our consumer business by the end of the summer. And -- were through raw material availability issues and all these freight issues. We will find ourselves in a very good position, cost-wise, capacity-wise and hopefully, cost price mix as we work into the year relative to consumers. So we're in pretty good shape there and in all past recessions, that's been somewhat countercyclical aspect of RPM.\nArun Viswanathan: Great. And then if I could, just one more quick one. So on the next MAP program, I guess, would the focus be a little bit more on capital allocation and cash flow? I know SG&A was really an initial focus for the initial MAP to Growth program but does this switch a little bit more to capital allocation? Thanks.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. And so we'll get into the details, as Rusty indicated in October. But I do think in most areas, we have addressed SG&A. The new MAP program will be benefiting from improved cash flow, a particular focus on working capital and a particular focus on gross margin improvement along with some revenue growth expectations.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Sison of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nMike Sison: Just one quick one. Your outlook for the Q1 adjusted EBIT growth of 20%, 25%, it sounds like 2Q could even be better. How much of that growth will simply come from pricing, maybe catching up with raw materials and then the sort of volume growth and maybe some cost savings and such?\nFrank Sullivan: Pretty good strength in North America, some growth in Latin America. Asia is relatively small -- the larger shift very much and concern about demand and weakness in Europe. And so as I commented earlier by segment, I would expect us to see mid- to high single-digit unit growth in Construction Products Group and Performance Coatings Group qualified by any raw material availability challenges, which might pop up again, both for our products and/or components that are on projects -- construction projects that were a part of that might hold things up. I think you're going to see some improved unit volume growth in our Specialty Products Group, which has been relatively flat for most of fiscal '22. And I would expect that most of our profitability improvement in consumer in the next couple of quarters will be a combination of price finally catching up with costs and some of the operating efficiency efforts that we've been pursuing for the last year with unit volume relatively flat, although again, we'll see quarter-by-quarter.\nMike Sison: Right. So maybe the way to think about it is if you get that volume growth in mid-single digits, that probably levers up to about half the growth of the other half could be the price raws?\nFrank Sullivan: Again, it's really a segment-by-segment story. That's why I went through that, Michael. And we'll provide detail on how it plays out when we report first quarter results. But I think the first quarter results between unit and price will be comparable to what we delivered in Q4.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Ghansham Panjabi of Baird.\nMatthew Krueger: This is actually Matt Krueger sitting in for Ghansham. So first off, versus your pre-COVID baseline, can you talk about where we're at -- each of your businesses from a volume or demand perspective, however you want to portray that?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So in our Specialty Products Group, we are meaningfully improved from pre-COVID in terms of sales growth, both obviously price but also units. And we've affected a lot of efficiency. We are slightly below that. I believe their EBIT margin record is north of 17%. And so we would expect to get back there hopefully, in fiscal '23. In our Construction Products Group, except for the silicone issue and the Corsicana plant, we would be at all-time EBIT margins and we expect to build upon that in fiscal '23. Our Performance Coatings Group generated record EBIT margins throughout and we'll continue to build on that. It's really our Consumer Group that is the most dynamic. As you recall, our fiscal '21 was huge. We had organic growth in some quarters as high as 30%, particularly in the summer and the fall of -- really drove a higher level of -- seen before. And then some operating inefficiencies and some -- hit our consumer group worse in our other segments. And so we are ahead of our pre-COVID revenue in terms of unit volume; meaningfully ahead, obviously, in price, significant profitability and margin in fiscal 2021. As I said earlier, we would expect to regain a lot of that, certainly not all of it. So -- our Map to Growth goals, including by segment, and it will take us a couple of years to regain a record level of profitability that we had pre-COVID in our Consumer Group.\nMatthew Krueger: Got it. That makes sense. That's very helpful. And then just to round things out, I guess, we talked quite a bit about raw material challenges and supply chain constraints. But I wanted to switch over to interest rates. So how do you expect higher interest rates to impact demand across your various business units? And have you seen any impact from higher rates across any of your housing affordability or other reasons?\nFrank Sullivan: I'll address that in two ways. Number one, from an RPM perspective, 70% fixed rate -- at an average fixed rate of about 3.5%. And we're in really good shape relative -- rising interest rate environment, specifically on our balance sheet and our P&L. As it relates to the broader markets, we read all the headlines, but we're not seeing any impact in the United States yet. There's a funny dynamics, for instance, in new home construction. There is still a shortage relative to demand in housing. And yet you've got rents going up. You've got mortgage rates going up. So seeing how all those dynamics play out over time will be interesting in the near term, particularly in our DAP business, which has a significantly larger chunk of its business that goes in pros and into new home construction. The pro-business that we have is solid. It's high single digit in terms of unit volume and outperforming DIY meaningfully. The Construction Products Group, our Nudura business goes into light commercial and residential. It is component problems that are slowing down the completion of some of the housing and light commercial activities not demand. So as we sit here today, the dynamics in our business do not reflect some of the recessionary headlines that you're reading about.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. Please continue.\nFrank Sullivan: This year is one of milestones across RPM. RPM is now in its 75th year in business. When my grandfather founded Republic Powdered Metals in 1947, he had one product, the heavy-duty aluminum roof coating called illumination. First year sales were $90,000. To be in business for 7.5 decades and generate $6.7 billion of revenue this fiscal year is quite a feat considering our humble beginnings. Our Carboline business, a leading manufacturer of industrial corrosion control and fireproofing coatings also is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year. Topping both is our Stonhard business, a producer of high-performance flooring system, which is -- for 2022. Achieving these milestones is especially impressive when you consider the average life span of an S&P 500 company is 15 years according to -- The credit for this longevity belongs to our more than 16,000 associates worldwide and the hard work they put in every day to drive our growth and success, which was particularly challenging in the fiscal 2022 year just ended. Thank you for all you do to move the business forward and to build a better world. Our people, combined with positive market trends, innovative products and a strong balance sheet gives us confidence that we have a bright future ahead of us. I would also like to thank our shareholders for their continued investment in RPM. We remain focus -- 2023 first quarter results and to providing the MAP 2025 program in October. Thank you, and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Mike Laroche",
            "content": "Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter, we generated record consolidated net sales of $1.98 billion, an increase of 13.7% compared to the $1.74 billion reported in the same quarter of fiscal 2021. Organic sales growth of 15% or $261.9 million. Acquisitions contributed 0.9% to sales or $16.3 million, while foreign currency exchange was a headwind that decreased sales by 2.2% or $38.6 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were a record $1.42, which was an increase of 10.9% compared to the $1.28 reported in the year-ago quarter. Our consolidated adjusted EBIT was up 11.7% to a record $263.7 million compared to $236.2 million reported in the fiscal 2021 fourth quarter. Our Construction Products Group generated fourth quarter record net sales of $745.9 million, up 18.5% compared to the fiscal 2021 fourth quarter. Organic sales growth was 19.9% and acquisitions contributed 1.6%. Foreign currency translation headwinds reduced sales by 3%. Despite comparisons to a strong prior year when sales and earnings were at record levels, CPG continued to generate high growth propelled by its differentiated service model as well as its unique building envelope and restoration solutions. The segment's business is producing the strongest sales growth were those providing roofing systems, insulated concrete forms as well as admixtures and repair products for concrete. Results in international markets were mixed with Europe being challenged by macroeconomic headwinds, while Latin America experienced significant double-digit sales gains. CPG fiscal 2022 fourth quarter adjusted EBIT increased 10.9% to a record $122.4 million. This segment was able to offset significant raw material inflationary pressure with selling price increases and operational improvements. Our Performance Coatings Group fiscal 2022 fourth quarter net sales were a record $329.4 million, an increase of 16.3% over the year-ago period. Organic sales increased 17.4% and acquisitions contributed 1.8%, which were partially offset by a foreign currency translation headwind of 2.9%. PCG's businesses providing flooring systems, protective coatings and FRP grading, all generated double-digit sales growth. A rebound in international markets as well as ongoing success in the company's vertical end markets, including energy, technology and food beverage helped drive PCG's results. In addition, improved sales management systems and price increases were major factors in the segment's excellent top line results. Adjusted EBIT increased 37.3% to a record $42.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, driven by volume growth, selling price increases, revenue growth leveraging good product mix and operational improvements. The Specialty Products Group reported record net sales of $225.8 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, an increase of 11.4% compared to the fiscal 2021 fourth quarter. Organic sales increased 12.2% and acquisitions added 0.5%, which were offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation of 1.3%. The majority of SPG's businesses experienced double-digit sales growth. Leading the way were its OEM coatings companies as well as its food coatings and additives business, which has improved performance under new management. Its disaster restoration equipment business continued to rebound as it cleared backlogs caused by semiconductor chip shortages and grew sales in the teens despite a difficult comparison to a strong prior year that had high demand for its products driven by winter storm Uri. SPG's adjusted EBIT was a record $44.2 million in the fiscal 2022 fourth quarter, an increase of 21.8% compared to adjusted EBIT of $36.3 million in last year's quarter. The segment's increase in adjusted EBIT was bolstered by the favourable impact of higher sales which were leveraged to the bottom line due to selling price increases that began catching up with prior cost inflation. Our Consumer Group achieved record net sales of $682.8 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, an increase of 8.6% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Organic sales increased 10%, which was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation of 1.4%. The Consumer Group's top line growth was driven by improved supply of key alkyd resins produced by the manufacturing plant we acquired last September as well as price increases and high growth in product lines with professional remodelers including cost and sealants. While North American markets grew, European markets remained challenged due to macroeconomic headwinds in the region. Fiscal 2022 fourth quarter adjusted EBIT was $80.3 million, an increase -- a decrease of 14.2% compared to adjusted EBIT of $93.6 million reported for the prior year period. Adjusted EBIT was impacted by continued raw material cost inflation and higher costs from ongoing shipping challenges and industry labor shortages. In response, the Consumer Group has been instituting price increases to catch up with inflation, building resilience in its supply chain and investing in capacity and process improvements to better respond to customer demand. To wrap up, I have a few comments on capital allocation. Our significant liquidity enables us to fund internal growth initiatives, make acquisitions and reward our investors with cash dividend payments and repurchases of our shares. Since our last earnings release in April, we repurchased $50 million of our common stock. This is in addition to earlier share repurchases and early reduction of our convertible notes in November 2018 with roughly $200 million of cash. Combined, this puts us at $658 million towards our $1 billion repurchase goal that was established at the onset of our MAP to Growth program in 2018. Now I'll turn the call over to Rusty to discuss our outlook."

            "name": "Rusty Gordon",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Looking ahead to the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we will continue to focus on navigating a number of challenges. The strengthening US dollar is expected to be a headwind impacting the translation of our international results. We expect significant cost increases to continue for certain raw materials, labor and packaging. We also anticipate continued higher costs from unreliable bulk transportation, which creates production inefficiencies, although they should have less of an impact moving forward as well as fuel surcharges which are being driven by high energy prices that have been exacerbated by the conflict in Ukraine. These cost pressures are expected to disproportionately affect our consumer segment. Despite these challenges, the proactive measures we took over the course of fiscal 2022, enabled RPM to accelerate momentum in the business and it is expected to carry over into fiscal 2023. We expect to continue implementing price increases as needed and continue improving operational efficiencies in order to minimize cost pressures and restore margins closer to historical levels. While there is a recessionary undercurrent in the economy, we anticipate that demand for our products and services will remain strong particularly meet those that improve energy efficiency and extend the useful life of our customers' assets through protection and restoration. In addition, we are making strategic investments in organic growth initiatives focused on market opportunities and industry trends including the future funding for infrastructure and onshoring of industries responsible for pharmaceutical, food, technology and energy security. Based on these factors, we expect to generate fiscal 2023 first quarter consolidated sales growth in the mid-teens over last year's record first quarter sales. For each of our four segments, we anticipate sales growth in the teens. It is likely that the consumer group will generate the highest growth of the four segments due to; Number one, selling price increases that should allow it to catch up with inflation; number two, improved alkyd resin supply; and number three, investments made in new capacity and continuous improvement initiatives. Fiscal 2023 first quarter consolidated adjusted EBITDA is anticipated to increase 20% to 25% versus the same period last year. Lastly, I'd like to announce that we have hired Matt Schlarb [ph], as our Senior Director of Investor Relations. He previously held Investor Relations positions with Watery.com, Mettler Toledo and Fairmount Santrol. We're pleased to have him join RPM and look forward to having him raise our Investor Relations function to a new level. Matt will be joining us on our equity analyst calls this week and you'll be working more closely with them as we near the announcement of our first quarter results and the investor event that will provide details on our MAP 2025 initiative. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now be pleased to take your questions. Thank you. Sure. Yes. We had a rough year for cash flow in fiscal '22. When you combine decreasing margins and inflation, that's usually a bad sign for cash flow. And as a result of unreliable supply, we had to build up inventory where we could because supply was so unreliable as was transportation. As a result of that, our inventories need to get into balance better and fiscal -- don't have enough finished goods even though inventory did increase to really supply and service our customers like we'd like. So that's getting better as a number of the force majeures have expired over the year, we still face a few supply challenges, but not nearly as bad as last year. So now that as we said in our guidance, we're going to be back expanding margins again, EBIT margins. We would anticipate a much better year for cash flow. As it relates to capital expenditures, we are looking to play offense and invest more in our businesses. We have a lot of high-growth areas, including high-performance buildings. That's been a real growth area for us. And as a result, we're -- spending as probably closer to -- in fiscal '23. Acquisition, on the other hand, have continued to be at high multiples. And as you know about RPM, we're very disciplined and don't pay those crazy multiples. So we would anticipate acquisition activity to continue to be lower than historically we've been at. So hopefully, that answers your questions. Yes. Jeff, this is Rusty here. As far as FIFO goes, you're correct in that we're going to continue to see increases go through the P&L from the last 3 months. On average, we hold about 90 days of inventory. So the latest quarter's purchase order inflation that we're seeing on actual POs will come through 90 days later in the first quarter. I would say our fourth quarter too was penalized somewhat again because of FIFO. A lot of people out work out sick at our suppliers, freight carriers and in our facilities, too. So we had a lot of production inefficiencies around New Year that hit us in the fourth quarter. So on the good news front, that should be flowed through, and we should have better efficiency coming through our cost of sales from that standpoint in Q1. For consolidated fiscal '22, our volume was pretty flat for the year up a tad but yeah, is was not down. It was up very marginally. Yes. Steve, this is Rusty here. As far as alkyd resins go, you are correct. A lot of the plant-based oils have been rising since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. And alkyd resins have gone up more so because of the explosion a year ago that took out 30% of North America alkyd resin production capacity. So they continue to go up here as we speak in the first quarter. So buying alkyd resins externally is going to continue to be more expensive every day. And you are correct. We are ramping up our Corsicana, Texas plant and getting more of our alkyd supply in-house, and that progress is continuing. So we continue to make more different varieties of alkyd resins and should continue to get more of our alkyd resins sourcing done in-house."

            "name": "Frank Sullivan",
            "content": "Thank you, Michelle. Good morning and welcome to the RPM International Inc. investor call for our fiscal 2022 fourth quarter and yearend. Joining me on today's call are Rusty Gordon, RPM's Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Mike Laroche, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. I'll share a broad commentary on our consolidated performance for the quarter and the year, then Mike will provide details on our financial results and Rusty will conclude our prepared remarks and our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Please note that our comments will be on an as adjusted basis and all comparisons are to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 unless otherwise indicated. We provided a supplemental slide presentation to support our comments on this call. It can be accessed in the Presentations and Webcasts section of the RPM website at www.rpminc.com. After our remarks, we'll be pleased to take your questions. We generated record fourth quarter performance, which reflected accelerating momentum across RPM throughout fiscal 2022. As we progress through the year, our nimble businesses responded quickly to address ever-changing supply chain constraints, inflationary challenges and foreign exchange headwinds. I'd like to share a few examples for RPM. In response to the scarcity of some raw materials, we purchased a manufacturing facility in Texas last September. The dedicated team quickly ramped up production of alkyd resins, which were in very short supply, due to a supplier explosion at one of our primary suppliers in the industry. In addition, our R&D professionals have been working around the clock to reformulate literally thousands of products to qualify different materials, all while maintaining high performance. Another example is our disaster restoration equipment business, which was hampered by the semiconductor chip shortage. It found alternative supply and reconfigured its products to accommodate these challenges and deliver for its customers. As you can see on Slide 3, this chart reflects the quarter-by-quarter actions that we took to steadily generate momentum across our businesses throughout the year. Also having an impact were the investments we've been making to accelerate growth in the fastest-growing areas of our business, particularly our high-performance building construction and coating systems. Our associates' efforts along with solid construction and industrial maintenance activity as well as a rebound in energy markets culminated in the fourth quarter that produced consolidated record sales and record adjusted EBIT. On the next slide, you'll note driven by pricing adjustments and operational efficiencies, we achieved record results in all four segments in sales and record EBIT in three of our segments. The lone outlier was our consumer group, which began to narrow the year-over-year gap in adjusted EBIT results as price increases started to catch up with inflation and access to raw materials improved. Better materials availability was largely due to the production facility we acquired last fall. We also benefited from $17 million in incremental savings during the quarter from our ongoing operating improvement program efforts. On that subject, driving operating efficiency remains a top priority at RPM, and our teams have made significant progress in developing the follow-up plan to our highly successful NAFTA Growth operating improvement program, which concluded at the end of fiscal '21. We're calling the new program, MAP 2025, and we will share details about it with you at an Investor Day to be scheduled in October around the time of our first quarter earnings release and Annual Meeting of Shareholders. We are confident that MAP 2025 will contribute to the momentum we are building for a successful fiscal 2023 and beyond. I'll now turn the call over to Mike Laroche, to discuss our consolidated and segment financial results in more detail. Sure. I think the Corsicana plan is relatively unique. We have another kind of backward integrated business as well with our Stonhard Group and I believe we have the backward integration that we desire at this point in time. We do plan to spend probably close to $100 million over the next three years at Corsicana to backward integrate into a few other categories as well as use that site for expansion of our new Dura product line. But we do not plan any additional significant investments in backward integration at this time other than internal investments on that site. For us, we're doing quite well in North America. Latin America is relatively strong compared to last year. The areas that we see the biggest challenges shouldn't be a surprise. It's principally Europe and it's a function of some of the inflation hitting Europe later, slowing growth and most of which I would attribute to the Russian war on Ukraine and its impact, both on current economic activity and anticipated challenges in the energy markets in Europe, specifically. Sure. So we, in general, feel really good about the dynamics, particularly North America for our Construction Products Group and our Performance Coatings Group. In both cases, unit volume growth was in the mid- to high single digits. And it could have been better, particularly in our Construction Products Group, but we continue to face shortages that impact projects. Some of those shortages are related to intermediate chemicals that we purchase, and others of those shortages related to fasteners or insulation board or other types of components on a construction product project that we're not directly involved in, but slow down projects. So that organic growth could have been better in the quarter, and we continue to face some of those challenges. I will tell you that the demand continues to be strong, and we feel pretty good about the literally, hundreds of billions of dollars that came from the American rescue plan in February of '21, and the $1.9 trillion infrastructure bill, at least $800 billion of which will go into real hardcore infrastructure, both of which bodes well for the dynamics in the markets that our Construction Products Group and Performance Coatings Group serve and again, those are principally driven in the United States. Sure. So I provided the unit volume by group, mid- to high single digits in Construction Products and in Performance Coatings. Unit volume was relatively flat across the different businesses in our Specialty Products segment, and we were down high single digits in consumer for the quarter. I will tell you, high level, from our perspective, it was a great quarter. We delivered the guidance that we provided. In the fourth quarter, we are ahead of cost price mix in 3 of our 4 segments. In Q1, we should be ahead of the cost price/mix dynamics in all four of our segments, meaning you will see higher EBIT growth in three of our four segments, those EBIT margins will be at or near all-time records. And in consumer, we've got a lot of catch-up to do, but you'll see a significant EBIT margin, the quarter that just ended. And that momentum that you can see in Slide 3, as we build momentum, principally around the cost price mix dynamic that impacts -- and we think even better in Q2. Sure. The largest improvement you'll see in our consumer group. It's a function of finally catching up on cost price mix and also the operating efficiency initiatives that we're undertaking there. And -- relationship to a very challenged fiscal '22. So you'll see significant improvement there and continued improvement with reasonable leverage to the bottom line in our other three segments. . Rusty indicated that in Q1, we see earnings growth in the 20% to 25% range. Q2 should be better than that. And boy, we are hesitant to go beyond any further comments because depending on what week it is and what headline you read, we're either heading for more inflation or a recession and what's happening in Europe relative to energy markets. So it's difficult to predict three to five months, let alone anything beyond that. But the next 2 months will be rock solid in terms of sales growth, earnings growth and EBIT improvement in every one of our segments. Sure. So the European business on a consolidated basis is about $1 billion. When we finish '23, it could be less than that. Demand is certainly weaker than North America. And with the foreign exchange translation and the strength of the dollar, that will further lessen or negatively impact translated results back into U.S. dollars. It's really a slower demand throughout Europe, I think, because of the challenges that they're facing economically and significantly higher energy costs than what we're seeing in the U.S. Again, part of it is the oil and gas dynamics globally. And part of it is what's happening with Russia and the impact on natural gas. Natural gas is the primary feedstock to all of our big European, Russian chemicals suppliers. And in some cases, in our facility, some of our construction product facilities, it's a primary -- so that's something we'll be paying attention to. And those are the dynamics. And back to not being able to look out very far, you can certainly paint a geopolitical economic picture where things get better nicely, if a positive more -- and a threat of Russian turning off natural gas to Germany in particular, but Western Europe happens then you're going to have a very quick and negative dynamic shift, I think, in all manufacturing in Europe. A couple of things. Number one, PCG is benefiting, particularly in our Carboline unit from higher spending in the oil and gas markets and energy markets. And certainly, that's cyclical, and it's not a cyclical upturn. As indicated earlier, the huge chunks of money, particularly in the United States, in the infrastructure bill and the American Rescue Recovery Act are serving our Performance Coatings business pretty well. . And the dynamics of some of the pricing benefits and commercial excellence that we've -- utilizing data -- a more detailed -- In some cases, it might the RPM catching up to what others are doing, but it's benefiting RPM in a lot of places. And it -- those practices are particularly shareable because of commonalities and sales forces and approaches to the market and compensation structures between our Performance Coatings Group and our Construction Products Group. Sure. There's -- that I would call out that drove the Construction Products Group challenges. One is they are the owner of our Corsicana plant, even though the -- our Consumer Group relative to alkyd resin productions. So there's a $8 million or $10 million negative hit for the year or through -- construction products from that, that should get better as we further utilize that plan. The second area is silicon silicones. Silicones have been the primary largest year-over-year, up hundreds, a couple of hundred percent in terms of costs and our Construction Products Group, silicone polymers are up 211% versus last year in the fourth quarter. And our Construction Products Group is the largest purchaser of silicone or silicone-related products for a lot of their sealants. The other area where we buy silicones is in our DAP business. And so those are the primary drivers of it. Excluding those and to a certain extent, that's a silly statement because those are -- that's the world we work in, but those two factors were what impeded the construction products from otherwise generating record EBIT. And as you'll note, through the MAP to Growth program, their EBIT results -- their consolidated EBIT figures are up almost 500 basis points. And we anticipate that continuing to expand on a sustainable basis in the next couple of years. Well, it's flat to slightly down, and it's true across all of our businesses. And in the construction products -- we have a really nice mainstream facility in Poland, and Poland has been very challenged. We have Ukrainian -- fight. We have a Polish associates who are hosting Ukrainian families in their homes. And so there's a lot of challenging things going on there, and that's particularly unique to our construction products group that's got a significant manufacturing base of Poland. Other than that, it's pretty weak demand and concerns about energy costs across Europe, U.K. and across all of our segments. Sure. I don't have a good number. We can work on that. But -- formulated over fiscal '22, literally thousands of products. So you had to reformulate them, recertify them due to the quality control checks. And it's literally in the face of initially some primary raw material shortages. Those are tough to reformulate around. But it was a lot of the smaller more modest intermediate chemicals that we were unable to get. One of the larger categories would be in seed oils, and that's a channel -- has reformulated a lot of coatings into more bio-based seed oils and very favorable performance and very favorable environmental footprint. In a few places, we've had -- based resins just as an example. And so you've got to go through the reformulation process, the recertification process with your customers or with codes and then make sure you're doing the QC checks such that this reformulation isn't impacting performance. And the -- and this is not unique to RPM in our industry. The real -- there's lots of heroes, I think, frontline workers during the COVID period. And certainly, in the last year, our folks in our labs have worked over time to address this issue and that's -- we can get a better sense of that for you. That's in light of what across the board in terms of materials quarter-over-quarter, it's up about 35% in terms of material inflation in the quarter last year versus this quarter but it was really an intermediate chemical raw material availability that drove most of the reformulation. So the biggest challenges for us in the fourth quarter year-over-year were areas like metal packaging, particularly impacting consumer, up 50% -- this quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year are up 115%. I mentioned silicone up over 200%. Other costs, some of these intermediate chemicals that were not big buyers of that are critical and MDI is up 72%. You've got freight costs and fuel costs and surcharges. So it's been, again, not unique to us, incredibly challenging. Our budgeting anticipates additional inflation over fiscal '23 of about 15%. And that's what we've anticipated. Most of the pricing action that we've needed to cover that would have occurred in fiscal '22 and/or is occurring. There's additional price increases in a number of RPM companies occurring in the first quarter of '23. And then we'll stay tuned to both availability issues and inflation issues. And it's hard to really judge. We are seeing underlying primary base chemicals that we don't purchase directly but impact our purchases, flat or declining. You're certainly seeing oil prices move in the right direction. That has not made its way into the things we buy yet. And the volatility is such, it's really hard to tell other than we're in a period of time where the core underlying chemicals and oil prices are certainly moving in the right direction. I was trying to give you a headline. So -- Performance Coatings Group is at all-time record EBIT margins -- direction. Our Construction Products Group just missed, and it just missed is -- if you would just -- impact, we're about equal to record margins of last year's fourth quarter. The big bogey there I mentioned before is silicone. We're a big buyer of silicones and they have been a real challenge for us. And then our Specialty Products Group had a record EBIT percent in the fourth quarter as well. And we expect them to build upon that and get back to record EBIT margins for coming quarters. So in Q1, you should see year-over-year EBIT margin improvement in every one of our segments, including consumer. I think the consumer results that we should be posting in the next couple of quarters will look impressive. But you have to keep in mind that's in light of some pretty weak comparisons. But we're pretty excited. We thought we had a really good fourth quarter. And as I said earlier, we met the guidance that we provided. And to be able to be where we are, I think our industry broadly in terms of the cost price mix dynamic. We're ahead of the curve in three places, and we'll be ahead of the curve in all four in the first quarter. Sure. I think as everybody knows -- for business in general. Thankfully, we're not in fast fashion, but you've got a lot of fashion retailers that have a lot of what people don't want and very little of what they do. And so that's a dynamic that's playing out in certain industries. In our case, we kind of suspended our working capital goals, which will be, in some detail, talked about in our MAP 2025 about in our annual report that goes out in mid-August and then details in October. But this year was challenging. So we were doing our best to accumulate raw materials. In certain areas, we're accumulating as much raw material as we could get, but not producing as we're waiting for a valve or a particular intermediate chemicals so that we could start production. And so we have a higher level on a relative -- raw material inventory than we've ever had and then in certain other places, the other thing that's strange is and again not unique to RPM, we would have the largest chunk of something, we have relative little of which is whip and so you can products like in our Legend Brands business or in some -- in our Construction Products Group or Consumer Group that are partially finished and in the case of Legend Brands, literally waiting for a chip or batches that are partially completed, but waiting for a key element. And so with inventory is something we have little of anywhere and something that we and other people probably had a lot more of than they ever realized relative to the dynamics of raw material availability. And we expect that to improve significantly in '23. I don't believe we'll get back to record cash flows, but we will get back to the positive. This is the first year in my history that we had negative cash flows in the fourth quarter and for the year. And we'll get back to generating a few hundred million dollars of free cash flow and then some in fiscal '23. Sure. Steve, this is Frank. So we don't have any RPM plants. RPM International Inc. doesn't own plants. Our plants are owned and operated by our four segments or their operating company businesses. That's where we have the expertise. And I think we have a very strong manufacturing operations team in our Construction Products Group. And our expectations for the Corsicana plant, they had -- they were not producing out the resins when we acquired them and so while that is the primary driver of our focus and investment with them in fiscal '22, we expect to expand it in other areas. And we're also going to use that site as a significant expansion site for Nudura, which is also a Construction Products Group. Lastly, I'd say that the cooperation and communication across our businesses post-MAP to Growth in a center-led approach across many functions, but particularly in manufacturing and operations, makes it possible and it's working -- really wasn't, and it's working exceptionally well to be sharing manufacturing assets and so that is definitely a shared manufacturing asset. The Consumer Group is the biggest beneficiary of that in fiscal '22 and will be, I think, for most of '23. But it's an asset that's shared across multiple RPM businesses, and it's got to report somewhere, and it's not RPM because we don't have the manufacturing expertise in our shop. Fill rates in consumer across multiple categories are still below where they need to be. And so you're looking at an industry -- high 90s and today 70s, and that's true across multiple product categories. So there are still dynamics of core inventory -- fixed and will be fixed as we, in our case, as we roll into fiscal '23. And so the inventory -- and that has been true for the last 2 years. We have and prior recessions we've actually seen an uptick in our consumer DIY business. And we could certainly see that -- what's a multiyear $70 million expansion of capacity in our consumer business by the end of the summer. And -- were through raw material availability issues and all these freight issues. We will find ourselves in a very good position, cost-wise, capacity-wise and hopefully, cost price mix as we work into the year relative to consumers. So we're in pretty good shape there and in all past recessions, that's been somewhat countercyclical aspect of RPM. Sure. And so we'll get into the details, as Rusty indicated in October. But I do think in most areas, we have addressed SG&A. The new MAP program will be benefiting from improved cash flow, a particular focus on working capital and a particular focus on gross margin improvement along with some revenue growth expectations. Pretty good strength in North America, some growth in Latin America. Asia is relatively small -- the larger shift very much and concern about demand and weakness in Europe. And so as I commented earlier by segment, I would expect us to see mid- to high single-digit unit growth in Construction Products Group and Performance Coatings Group qualified by any raw material availability challenges, which might pop up again, both for our products and/or components that are on projects -- construction projects that were a part of that might hold things up. I think you're going to see some improved unit volume growth in our Specialty Products Group, which has been relatively flat for most of fiscal '22. And I would expect that most of our profitability improvement in consumer in the next couple of quarters will be a combination of price finally catching up with costs and some of the operating efficiency efforts that we've been pursuing for the last year with unit volume relatively flat, although again, we'll see quarter-by-quarter. Again, it's really a segment-by-segment story. That's why I went through that, Michael. And we'll provide detail on how it plays out when we report first quarter results. But I think the first quarter results between unit and price will be comparable to what we delivered in Q4. Sure. So in our Specialty Products Group, we are meaningfully improved from pre-COVID in terms of sales growth, both obviously price but also units. And we've affected a lot of efficiency. We are slightly below that. I believe their EBIT margin record is north of 17%. And so we would expect to get back there hopefully, in fiscal '23. In our Construction Products Group, except for the silicone issue and the Corsicana plant, we would be at all-time EBIT margins and we expect to build upon that in fiscal '23. Our Performance Coatings Group generated record EBIT margins throughout and we'll continue to build on that. It's really our Consumer Group that is the most dynamic. As you recall, our fiscal '21 was huge. We had organic growth in some quarters as high as 30%, particularly in the summer and the fall of -- really drove a higher level of -- seen before. And then some operating inefficiencies and some -- hit our consumer group worse in our other segments. And so we are ahead of our pre-COVID revenue in terms of unit volume; meaningfully ahead, obviously, in price, significant profitability and margin in fiscal 2021. As I said earlier, we would expect to regain a lot of that, certainly not all of it. So -- our Map to Growth goals, including by segment, and it will take us a couple of years to regain a record level of profitability that we had pre-COVID in our Consumer Group. I'll address that in two ways. Number one, from an RPM perspective, 70% fixed rate -- at an average fixed rate of about 3.5%. And we're in really good shape relative -- rising interest rate environment, specifically on our balance sheet and our P&L. As it relates to the broader markets, we read all the headlines, but we're not seeing any impact in the United States yet. There's a funny dynamics, for instance, in new home construction. There is still a shortage relative to demand in housing. And yet you've got rents going up. You've got mortgage rates going up. So seeing how all those dynamics play out over time will be interesting in the near term, particularly in our DAP business, which has a significantly larger chunk of its business that goes in pros and into new home construction. The pro-business that we have is solid. It's high single digit in terms of unit volume and outperforming DIY meaningfully. The Construction Products Group, our Nudura business goes into light commercial and residential. It is component problems that are slowing down the completion of some of the housing and light commercial activities not demand. So as we sit here today, the dynamics in our business do not reflect some of the recessionary headlines that you're reading about. This year is one of milestones across RPM. RPM is now in its 75th year in business. When my grandfather founded Republic Powdered Metals in 1947, he had one product, the heavy-duty aluminum roof coating called illumination. First year sales were $90,000. To be in business for 7.5 decades and generate $6.7 billion of revenue this fiscal year is quite a feat considering our humble beginnings. Our Carboline business, a leading manufacturer of industrial corrosion control and fireproofing coatings also is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year. Topping both is our Stonhard business, a producer of high-performance flooring system, which is -- for 2022. Achieving these milestones is especially impressive when you consider the average life span of an S&P 500 company is 15 years according to -- The credit for this longevity belongs to our more than 16,000 associates worldwide and the hard work they put in every day to drive our growth and success, which was particularly challenging in the fiscal 2022 year just ended. Thank you for all you do to move the business forward and to build a better world. Our people, combined with positive market trends, innovative products and a strong balance sheet gives us confidence that we have a bright future ahead of us. I would also like to thank our shareholders for their continued investment in RPM. We remain focus -- 2023 first quarter results and to providing the MAP 2025 program in October. Thank you, and have a great day."

At this time, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to RPM\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Mr. Frank Sullivan, for opening remarks. Please go ahead, sir.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning. Welcome to the RPM International Inc. investor call for our fiscal 2022 third quarter. Joining me on today\u2019s call is Rusty Gordon, RPM\u2019s Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Mike Laroche, our Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. I\u2019ll share a broad commentary on our consolidated performance for the quarter, Mike will provide details on our financial results and Rusty will conclude with our formal remarks and our outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, after which we\u2019ll take your questions. Please note that our comments will be on an as adjusted basis and all comparisons are to the third quarter of fiscal 2021 unless otherwise indicated. We provided a supplemental slide presentation to support our comments on this call. It can be accessed in the Presentations and Webcasts section of the RPM website at www.rpminc.com. For the third quarter of our fiscal 2022 RPM generated record consolidated EBIT and sales despite a difficult comparison to the prior year. These results were driven by our associates worldwide who persevere despite an extremely challenging operating environment, including ongoing raw material and labor shortages, Omicron-related disruptions that were particularly acute in the third quarter, as well as material, wage and freight cost inflation. Our consolidated adjusted EBIT growth was driven by three of our four segments, Construction Products, Performance Coatings and Specialty Products, which leveraged selling price adjustments and operational improvements to the bottomline. Our Consumer Group is the outlier. Mike will discuss this in more detail when he presents our segment results. With our primary real -- raw material costs up more than 40% on average versus a year ago, our Consumer Group will need to catch up with significant selling price increases, which will be instituted at the end of this month. We have been fast to respond to supply chain challenges by quickly scaling up in-house resin production at manufacturing facility we acquired in September. Additionally, due to our ongoing investments in the fastest growing areas of our business, our high performance building, construction and coding systems have generated accelerated growth. Construction and industrial maintenance activity is robust, and energy markets have recovered, while Consumer takeaway remained strong. Due to three years of extraordinary work for our associates to implement our math to growth operating improvement program, we have made structural improvements to RPM, while maintaining our entrepreneurial culture, which is a core strength of RPM. As a result, our Performance Coatings Group and Construction Products Group are operating not only at record sales and EBIT, but at record margins in the third quarter. Our Specialty Products Group is trending towards this same performance with record results in sales and EBIT and improving margin performance. And we are making good progress in our Consumer business. In short, we are playing on offense almost everywhere investing in accelerating organic growth, significant increases in capital expansion, particularly in the areas of Nudura ICF, roof restoration coatings and a number of our Consumer Products areas, all of which are building positive momentum as we go into the fourth quarter and we roll into fiscal 2023. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Mike Laroche to discuss our financial results in more detail.\nMike Laroche: Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. During the third quarter, we generated consolidated net sales of $1.43 billion, an increase of 13%, compared to the $1.27 billion reported during the same quarter of fiscal 2021. Organic sales growth was 13.4% or $170.1 million. Acquisitions contributed 1.4% of sales or $17.8 million, while exchange was a headwind that decrease sales by 1.8% or $23.4 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.38, which was unchanged compared to the year ago quarter. Our consolidated adjusted EBIT was up 0.8% to a record $80.6 million, compared to the $79.9 million reported in the fiscal 2021 third quarter. On a double-stack basis, comparing fiscal Q3 2022 to pre-pandemic Q3 of FY 2020, sales, EBIT, adjusted EBIT, net income, diluted EPS and adjusted diluted EPS, all achieved double- or triple-digit growth. Similar to the first and second quarters of fiscal 2022, our third quarter performance reflects the benefits of our balanced business portfolio, where softness in one segment is generally offset by strength in the others. During the third quarter of fiscal 2022, three of our four operating segments, Construction Products Group, Performance Coatings Group and Specialty Products Group generated strong double-digit sales growth. Combined sales in these three segments increased 19%, while sales in the Consumer segment were up modestly. Again, after removing Consumer, the remainder of RPM produced exceptional adjusted EBIT growth of 97%. Our Consumer Group continued to be disproportionately impacted by inflation, as well as by overtime related labor and supply chain disruption, particularly during December and January. This instability in supply caused inefficiencies and continued to negatively impact conversion costs, resulting in a decline in adjusted EBIT at our Consumer Group for the fourth consecutive quarter. Later in the call, we\u2019ll discuss the actions we\u2019re taking to address these challenges affecting this segment. Our Construction Products Group generated third quarter record net sales of $482 million, up 21.7% compared to the fiscal 2021 third quarter. Organic sales growth was 23.2% and acquisitions contributed 2.2%. Foreign currency translation headwinds reduced sales by 3.7%. CPG record revenue growth was largely due to the segments ongoing success in promoting its differentiated restoration solutions, which offer particular advantages versus new construction given the current raw materials and labor shortages. These same challenges have continued to help speed the adoption of the segment\u2019s innovative building envelopes products. CPG\u2019s fastest growing businesses are those providing roofing systems, insulated concrete forms, commercial sealants, as well as concrete admixtures and repair products. The segment\u2019s international operations generated strong topline growth in local currencies, which was muted by the strengthening U.S. dollar. CPG fiscal 2022 third quarter adjusted EBIT increased 89.7% to a record $35.1 million. Despite a difficult prior year comparison, CPG was able to dramatically increase adjusted EBIT and EBIT margin to third quarter records due to improve product mix, volume growth and operational improvements. All of these factors combined with selling price increases helped to offset higher raw material inflation. Our Performance Coatings Group\u2019s fiscal 2022 third quarter net sales were record $270.9 million, an increase of 19.6% over the year ago period. Organic sales increased 17.8% and acquisitions contributed 3.4%, which was partially offset by foreign currency translation headwind of 1.6%. PCG continued its momentum with all of its North American businesses generating double-digit organic sales growth. PCG\u2019s businesses serving emerging markets generated explosive growth and its European companies continued their steady rebound. Driving its strong topline or increased in industrial maintenance spending, recovery in energy markets and price increases. PCG\u2019s best performing businesses were those providing polymer flooring systems, corrosion control coatings and raised flooring systems. Adjusted EBIT increased 89.9% to a record of $26.8 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Adjusted EBIT increase as a result of volume growth, operational improvements and a more favorable product mix. Additionally, adjusted EBIT margin was a third quarter record. Specialty Products Group reported record net sales of $189.4 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2022, an increase of 11.9% compared to the fiscal 2021 third quarters. Organic sales increased 11.9% and acquisitions added 0.8%, which were offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation of 0.8%. SPG generated record sales as a result of strong performance at nearly all of its businesses, with the highest growth coming from those serving OEM and food additive markets. In addition, these segment sales of disaster restoration equipment rebounded after securing a supply of semiconductor chips and reconfiguring its products to accommodate. This is example of how our businesses quickly adjust to challenges demonstrating a key advantage to RPM\u2019s entrepreneurial culture. This business did face a tough comparison to the prior year period, when demand for its restoration equipment was inflated because of winter storm Uri. Adjusted EBIT was a record $26.6 million in fiscal 2022 third quarter, an increase of 5.4%, compared to adjusted EBIT of $25.3 million in the last year\u2019s quarter. This record adjusted EBIT was largely due to operational improvements. Our Consumer Group achieved record net sales of $491.6 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2022, an increase of 2.9% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2021. Organic sales increased 3.6%, which was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation of 0.7%. As we anticipated, the segment grew revenue in part due to its ability to mitigate the severe alkyd resin shortages it had experienced by leveraging the new Texas manufacturing facility we acquired in September. During the third quarter sales and productivity were challenged by unreliable shipping and supply, resulting from labor shortages caused by the Omicron variant, particularly in December and January. Speaking of challenges, the Consumer Group also faced a difficult comparison to the prior year period when sales increased 19.8% and adjusted EBIT increased 48.6% due to elevated demand for its home improvement products during the pandemic\u2019s first phase. Fiscal 2022 third quarter adjusted EBIT was $17.2 million, a decrease of 63.9%, compared to adjusted EBIT of $47.8 million reported during the prior year period. Due to the nature of its products and the markets it serves, inflation has been more impactful on the Consumer Group than RPMs other segments, and raw material inflation in particular, has had the most significant impact on EBIT. Partially offsetting these factors were price increases and operational improvements, as a Consumer Group is currently investing in capacity and process improvements to meet customer demand, as well as build resilience in its supply chain. The Consumer Group is continuing to implement price increases to catch up with the inflation this segment has experienced over the last four quarters. Lastly, I\u2019d like to note that we have significant liquidity, which enables us to fund internal growth initiatives, make acquisitions, reward our investors with cash dividend payments and repurchase our shares, helping to keep our liquidity strong as a $300 million bond offering we completed in January. Also during the third quarter we repurchase $15 million of our common stock. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Rusty to discuss our outlook.\nRusty Gordon: Thanks, Mike. For the fiscal 2022 fourth quarter, our operations and those of our suppliers are expected to be impacted by ongoing supply chain challenges and raw materials shortages, which will exert pressure on revenues and productivity. The strengthening U.S. dollar will also unfavorably impact the translation of our results in international markets. In addition the war in Ukraine is creating some supply and inflationary pressures, which Frank will address in a little bit. While it\u2019s too soon to tell, rising interest rates may slow business and Consumer spending in the coming months. Despite these challenges, we expect to generate fiscal 2022 fourth quarter consolidated sales growth in the low teens versus a difficult comparison to last year\u2019s fourth quarter sales, which grew 19.6%. On a segment basis, we anticipate sales growth in the low teens in all four of our operating groups, as a result of strategic investments we are making to capitalize on market opportunities and industry trends. We anticipate that consolidated adjusted EBIT for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 will increase in the low teens versus the same period last year when adjusted EBIT was up 10.6%. We expect that earnings will continue to be affected by raw material, freight and wage inflation, as well as by the impact on sales volumes from operational disruptions caused by raw material shortages. Our Consumer Group will be disproportionately impacted by these issues. Its EBIT margins have eroded all three quarters of this fiscal year due to inflationary pressures, which have a greater impact on the Consumer Group than RPM\u2019s other segments. We continue to work to neutralize these factors by improving operational efficiencies, employing additional price increases to catch up with inflation and adding manufacturing capacity to improve resiliency. This concludes our prepared comments. We are now pleased to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research. Your line is now open.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Frank.\nFrank Mitsch: Hey. Good Morning. Hey. Good morning, Frank. You mentioned that raws in some of your primary materials were up 40% plus in the third quarter, that was significantly up from what it was in the second quarter. Can you talk about where you see that trending? What is of most particular concern for you in terms of raw material availability?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I can give you some examples I think Frank. First of all, we were starting to see some flattening out of raw material prices in certain resins and other categories of oil-related items until the onset of the Russian war on Ukraine. And that flattening out has changed and things are once again for geopolitical reasons now looking like they might be heading up. So it\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess as to where we\u2019ll be in the fourth quarter, I can give you some specifics, just to put things in context. For instance, in Consumer, aerosol cans year-over-year up 66%, alkyd resins are up 113%, acrylic latex is up 41%, monomers are up 86. More appropriately to our industrial product lines, epoxy resins year-over-year are up 72% and DIs [ph] up 106%. And so it\u2019s a litany of sad higher increases in critical raw materials. We had seen a significant improvement in availability. Most of the force, not all, but most of the force measures that had been announced over the last 15 months to -- 12 months to 15 months had been rescinded. But once again we\u2019re anticipating some challenges in certain resins particularly some bio-based resins that we source in Europe and from India as a result of the disruptions from the Ukraine war.\nFrank Mitsch: Got you. Got you. So you did mention a couple times on the call that you are implementing price increases, you continue to implement price increases, how do we think about when, given what we know today in terms of when RPM will be able to have pricing cover, the impact of raws, and I guess, part of that question is also, if you\u2019re looking at sales in the fiscal fourth quarter up low teens, how are you looking at that in terms of price versus volume versus FX?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. On average in the quarter price was up 12.5%. And so you can see when you look at the organic growth, we had tremendous organic growth in our Construction Products Group and our Performance Coatings Group, a modest mix of -- would appear flat in Specialty Products Group, but it was a mix of some organic growth in certain units and others not. And when you do the math, you\u2019ll see that we had actually unit declines in the quarter in Consumer. That was as much a result of the manufacturing and operating disruptions, raw material challenges, as demand remains pretty solid there. As we think about the fourth quarter, as Rusty indicated. We\u2019ve got really good momentum going into Q4. We would expect to continue to operate at record levels of sales, EBIT and EBIT margins in our Construction Products Group, Performance Coatings Group, and at this point, we believe in our Specialty Products Group. And so on a consolidated basis, I think, we have a shot at having record results, it really depends on where we finish the quarter in Consumer. As we sit here today in Q4, price will add about 12.5% in terms of revenues. But as Rusty indicated, we\u2019re going out with another round of price increases across a number of product lines in RPM where appropriate. But in particular in our Consumer Group at the end of this month in relationship to both being impacted the most directly by raw material costs and packaging costs, being small project driven in paints and patch, repair and coats and sealants. We have a disproportionate packaging impact there as well and so we will report results in July. I would anticipate that we will be somewhat higher in the fourth quarter than the 12.5% based on our current pricing situation across RPM today.\nFrank Mitsch: Got you. Very helpful. Thanks, Frank.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nJohn McNulty: Yeah. Good morning and thanks for\u2026\nFrank Sullivan: Hi, John.\nJohn McNulty: Thanks for taking my question. Hey, Frank, and great job in a really tough environment. I guess I wanted to dig into maybe two areas. The first one would just be on the alkyds situation. I know it\u2019s been a really tough overhang for you guys for the last, call it, three quarters or so, it sounds like you\u2019ve got some of that remedied with the Texas facility up and running? I guess how should we think about how that takes some of the pressure off the Consumer business? It seems like there\u2019s a lot of other moving parts. But I guess, how much does that flip the switch where things get noticeably better for you?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. Since the fall, we have added internal capacity with the addition of the Corsicana, Texas plant. And the team, there\u2019s ability to ramp up successfully in producing alkyd resins, which they had not done before. That was part of the reason for the acquisition. There was another supplier during that timeframe that withdrew supply from the marketplace. So it remains a challenging environment, let\u2019s say, and the alkyd situation is a particularly critical raw material for our Consumer Group.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. So you\u2019ve got your asset running, but it sounds like somebody else actually took more capacity out. So it -- maybe it\u2019s helped, but not as much as it otherwise could have. Is that right?\nFrank Sullivan: That\u2019s correct.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. Okay. And then, on the Construction business, the volumes are really they\u2019re seeming like they\u2019re kind of really humming at this point. I guess, can you speak to how you see that playing out throughout the rest of this year and because you have kind of a contractor approach where you\u2019ve got your own labor force, like, I guess, I assume it gives you better visibility around that business. So, I guess, how far out in terms of line of sight do you have around the business trends that you\u2019re seeing there?\nFrank Sullivan: So I would tell you that the line of sight anywhere isn\u2019t very good relative to all the dynamics in the marketplace. As we roll into Q1, I would expect us to have record results in sales, earnings and margins everywhere, that includes Consumer based on the actions that we\u2019re taking and also rounding finally some easier comps after the extraordinary kind of stay-at-home driven boom and DIY products that we\u2019re rounding now. I think that organic growth that we\u2019re seeing in a Construction Products Group for the foreseeable few quarters, as far as we can tell, will remain in the mid-to-high single digits on an organic growth basis. You can add about 12% in terms of sale price impact to that. So, again, without getting too far over ski tips, just because it\u2019s difficult to predict the future in this environment. The momentum going into the next couple of quarters is really strong and it doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s anything that will interrupt that at this point.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. Perfect. Thanks very much for the color.\nFrank Sullivan: Yeah. I would add one more thing to that, John, we\u2019re -- whether it\u2019s in our Nudura ICF or roof restoration coatings, as we sit here today, we could be selling more, but we are out of capacity in a few of these product areas. And we have a significant capacity expansion program to Nudura, the first elements of which will go into effect at the end of the fourth quarter and through the summer. And we have a significant capital expansion in our roof restoration coatings, which should roll out throughout the balance of this calendar year.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. Can you -- actually just as a follow up to that, can you help us to understand how much capacity that might unlock?\nFrank Sullivan: I can tell you in roof restoration coatings, probably another $50 million or $100 million and in Nudura, we hope to realize another $40 million or $50 million of capacity by the end of this calendar year, and as much as another $100 million of capacity by the end of the summer of 2023.\nJohn McNulty: Wow! Okay. So pretty notable. Okay. Thanks very much for the color. That\u2019s really helpful.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi from Baird. Your line is now open.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Ghansham.\nGhansham Panjabi: Good morning, Frank. Thanks for putting me in. Just given that Europe is a pretty significant end market for RPM, can you just comment on current operating conditions post war and also anything that you may be seeing in China at this point, just given the lockdown, et cetera?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. Our business -- first of all, I\u2019ll tackle Asia, our business in Asia is relatively modest compared to some of our peers. We\u2019re not seeing much of an impact, but mostly because we don\u2019t have a big slug of business there and the business that we do have is driven by our industrial product lines and so at this point, it\u2019s relatively stable. We\u2019re not seeing much negative impact. As it relates to Europe, Europe was recovering more slowly than North America for sure. And that recovery seems to be okay today. Although, we certainly anticipate -- we have not seen any meaningful disruption to our business activities as of yet, although, we\u2019re certainly heightened to that. As it relates to the Ukraine situation, we were very quick and early to discontinue any and all business activities in Russia. We don\u2019t have any manufacturing business there. The business we do have is relatively modest. So it\u2019s about $5 million or $6 million on an annualized basis. And we both felt it was the right thing to do. And certainly wanted to respond to concerns that a significant number of our workforce in European manufacturing and distribution of Ukrainian descent. And so that\u2019s the impact on Russia -- and the Russian war in Ukraine. But, in general, we\u2019re heightened of kind of anticipating impacts, but we haven\u2019t seen it yet.\nGhansham Panjabi: That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you, Frank. And just in terms of the energy end markets, I mean, obviously, you\u2019ve seen a major step function higher with energy prices, et cetera. Just remind us how big energy is as an end market for RPM and what you\u2019re seeing in the end market from recovery standpoint, yeah, through post-COVID?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. Our energy exposure is mostly in our Performance Coatings Group, and mostly in Carboline of the Performance Coatings Group, let\u2019s say, is about $1.1 billion and Carboline and Stonhard are by far and away the two largest business units there. I would guess directly and indirectly now you\u2019re talking broadly, oil and gas, and refinery and pipelines and things like that, probably, $300 million or so of exposure to oil and gas markets broadly. The -- again as you can see, we got high-teens organic growth, high single-digit unit volume and there\u2019s somewhat higher growth in that business than average in those businesses or product lines that are exposed to energy markets and we see that continuing. So there\u2019s a little bit of a double edged sword in that. It is driving a significant increase in capital spending and business for us in our Industrial segments. It\u2019s also driving a significant increase in our raw material costs as well, so.\nGhansham Panjabi: Fantastic. Thanks so much.\nFrank Sullivan: Thanks, Ghansham.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Steve.\nSteve Byrne: Good morning. You have this intermediary between you and your end customer in your Consumer segment and I just was curious, what is the process that you go through to get price in the Consumer segment? Is that -- is there a delay? Is that a negotiation? Is that represent a bigger challenge for you than in your other segments?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes. There is typically a delay, and yes, it is a negotiation, particularly across our large customers. We\u2019ve announced three price increases over the last 12 months and the timing of those being instituted across large customers varies a little bit, not a lot. And we are both disproportionately being impacted by raw material costs both direct chemical raw material costs, as well as packaging costs in our Consumer business. And as our numbers reflect somewhat behind the curve in terms of addressing cost price mix, which is necessitating a fourth price increase, it will be announced at the end of this month.\nSteve Byrne: And Frank, you mentioned labor shortages in the segment, is that your, is that RPM employee labor shortages, is that your customer or your distribution channel and is that improving at this point?\nFrank Sullivan: It was really in two areas, the biggest area, our largest plants are our Consumer plants. And we had in a number of Rust-Oleum plants, both our largest DC which is in Wisconsin, in our largest manufacturing facility, which is in Wisconsin, a meaningful impact of Omicron in terms of either people that were out infected and/or people that were quarantined because of exposure. And so it had a disproportionate impact on our Consumer business, particularly Rust-Oleum. We also saw it in our Consumer business with the just in time -- traditionally, just in time, freight delivery of raws into our plants and then distribution where some of our customers pick up, and in some cases, we handle freight. And there was a disproportionate impact over that period of time, we believe because of Omicron and freight availability and truckers and so that impacted the segment as well.\nSteve Byrne: And the last month of this next quarter you\u2019re seeing things improved for you?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes. We are. In that category we\u2019re seeing things improve and so the flow through our plants is significantly better. That will help profitability and margins as we go into the fourth quarter. So the Omicron spike both across RPM we track. We\u2019ve been tracking quarantine and infections in COVID literally from March of 2020 every week. The Omicron spike was shockingly quick, high and then dissipated pretty quickly. And so we\u2019re back to a much more normal pace in terms of not having that same disruption at the end of February and March, and we\u2019re hopeful that the worst of COVID is behind us. It seems like if COVID isn\u2019t done with America, America\u2019s done with COVID, so.\nSteve Byrne: Very good. Thank you.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Vincent.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey. This is Stephen [ph] on for Vincent. Thanks for taking the question. So I ask a question on cash flow. Operating cash is down about $500 million year-on-year through the first nine months and it\u2019s mostly on working capital. So could you just talk a little bit on how you\u2019re thinking about operating cash generation for the full year and if you\u2019re expecting kind of a big release of working capital in the fourth quarter?\nMike Laroche: Sure. You\u2019re absolutely right. Operating cash flows were negatively impacted by working capital, largely driven by supply chain issues we\u2019ve been discussing and inflation, quite honestly. We expect that inflation is going to continue and we\u2019re going to continue to purchase opportunistically where we can to help lock in availability and price. So it -- you may see some unusual relationships in working capital as it relates to cash flows for the next few quarters.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you. And then maybe just a quick follow up on the conversion cost, is there a way you can maybe size, like, I guess, the cumulative impact throughout the full year so far, and just so we can get a, like, an idea of like, what the upside is, and ultimately, that begin with service?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. If you look at our EBIT margin, in general, quarter-by-quarter, and in particular, for instance this quarter where we\u2019re suffering the worst in Consumer. The vast majority of that EBIT margin decline is a gross margin decline, though we don\u2019t disclose gross margins by segment. And an of that, I would tell you, about two-thirds are, maybe a little bit more are material related and about one-third is operating efficiency and throughput in the plants. And so we fully expect in all of our businesses, as we get back to normal, the workforce disruptions are mitigated or eliminated and put behind us and we have normal flow through in our plants to where we were just a couple years ago, that that one-third impact on our margins would be recovered. The balance is literally a cost price mix dynamic, which we are managing better in our Industrial businesses than we have in our Consumer businesses year-to-date.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research. Your line is now open.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Kevin.\nKevin McCarthy: Good morning. How are you?\nFrank Sullivan: Good.\nKevin McCarthy: With regard to your Performance Coating segment, you said in your prepared remarks that you are seeing explosive growth in emerging markets, that word explosive got my attention? So I was wonder if you could kind of talk through where you\u2019re seeing the strongest growth and what exactly is driving that, is it to do with maybe some of the acquisition activity that you\u2019ve done or more organic in nature, I am curious you can offer any color there?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. It\u2019s more organic in nature and we\u2019ve taken a broader RPM platform approach to some of the developing markets and so there\u2019s a really good both cooperation between our Performance Coatings Group and our Construction Products Group, the two groups of RPM that had the greatest international exposure and the greatest developing world exposure and a real focus on driving organic growth and investing. So we\u2019re seeing significant growth in India, significant growth in Africa, in the Middle East, in Latin America. And I would tell you, some of it is recovery from COVID, for instance, in Latin America. Some of it is a result of a more intense focus on our more RPM platform basis and putting these regions under leaders who are responsible for a broader swath -- proven leaders who are responsible for a broader swath of RPM businesses and products and it\u2019s working. The last thing I would notice it\u2019s explosive on a relatively small base, but if we keep growing that base will keep getting bigger and become a more meaningful part of our business.\nKevin McCarthy: Great. And then my second question was much broader in nature. If I look at slide 11 of your deck, your sales forecast for the fourth quarter is extremely uniform across all of your segments. They\u2019re all expected to grow at a low teens pace. And so, I was wondering if you can talk about 2023, perhaps, it\u2019s early to get specific on guidance there. But sitting here today, how would you expect those trends to diverge moving forward? Do you have in your mind a segment that you would expect to grow materially faster than the others or slower at the other end of the spectrum?\nFrank Sullivan: So I think two comments on that, Kevin. One is, I think the furthest out we can really see is a quarter or two so, as I mentioned earlier, I -- as we sit here today, I would expect every one of our segments including Consumer to be generating solid sales and earnings growth in Q1. And the momentum that we are seeing in our Performance Coatings Group and Construction Products Group will continue. The Specialty Products Group should be back to record margins, not just higher sales and earnings. And we\u2019ll see solid recovery in Consumer, both on the top line and bottom line in part because the actions we\u2019re taking are taking hold, in part because of disruptions of COVID are being put behind us. And in part because we\u2019ll be rounding some easier comps in Consumer. So, you ought to see record results in Q1 for RPM on a consolidated business in each of our segments. I think this outlook really is a continuation of what we\u2019re experiencing in our three more industrial segments and an expectation that we\u2019re finally going to see positive results out of Consumer. Longer term, again, unless the dynamics change, we would expect to have a solid fiscal \u201823, and we\u2019ll provide pretty good details on that in July. And we also hope to be able to provide some longer-term perspective on where we\u2019re going with a map to growth 2.0, something that many of you know we\u2019ve been working on for a while. But our willingness to get out there and make longer-term commitments has been disrupted by COVID and supply chain challenges that were working their way into something more normal and stable until the Russian war on Ukraine. And so, I think that\u2019s the caveat here. We\u2019re not seeing much of an impact on our European business yet. But time will tell in the coming months as to what impact there might be and to what extent.\nKevin McCarthy: Excellent. We\u2019ll look forward to the updates. Thanks Frank.\nFrank Sullivan: Thanks, Kevin.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Arun.\nArun Viswanathan: Hi, Frank. Thanks for taking my question. I hope you\u2019re well. Yes. So, I guess, I just wanted to understand the low teens guidance. I think you mentioned 12.5% price. So, is that to imply kind of low single-digit unit volume growth or maybe a little bit better and offset by a little bit of FX pressure? How should we think about kind of your volume versus price dynamics?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I think particularly in Performance Coatings and Construction Products, we\u2019re expecting a mid-upper unit volume growth and the continuation of what\u2019s been about a 12%, 12.5%, on average price increase. So, you could see results on an organic basis in the mid-high teens. That\u2019s going to be knocked down a little bit by the strengthening U.S. dollar, which will take a couple of points off our results. So I think, in overall mix it\u2019s certainly possible that we\u2019ll continue mid-teen performance in some of the industrial businesses and would expect to see kind of a low teens kind of 10%, 12%-ish in Consumer. And so that\u2019s where we are, it will be a mix of both. But I think we feel pretty comfortable with this guidance. And as I said, I think we\u2019ll be in the fourth quarter at record EBIT on a consolidated basis and hopefully, record EBIT margins. It just depends on how quickly the actions we\u2019re taking in Consumer affect a stronger recovery there.\nArun Viswanathan: Okay. Thanks. And I guess, I also wanted to just follow-up on a comment you made earlier as far as potentially some of the cost pressures that you\u2019ve been feeling over the last couple of years have been plateauing or flattening out. And then, there was a little bit of a spike, I guess, with the Russia-Ukraine invasion. And has that moderated now? It does appear that some of the energy and price impacts have started to moderate as well. Would you say that, that\u2019s the case? And do you see that this is kind of a longer-term impact or is it just kind of transitory?\nFrank Sullivan: It\u2019s hard to say right now. Again, we were seeing some underlying positive trends in things like ethylene, propylene and even some of our direct purchase raw materials. And all of that reversed with the Russian war in Ukraine. And I -- really who knows? And I\u2019m not trying to be cagey here, if this thing is resolved, which I think the world is praying for relatively quickly, then, I do think we could see some stability. If this thing expands and has greater impact on oil and gas prices as well as some of the organic resins that are impacting that we purchase principally from India, but they\u2019ve spiked up for reasons that I don\u2019t -- some people do, I don\u2019t directly understand other than they\u2019ve spiked up because of the impact of the Russian war. It\u2019s hard to know how this will expand and what impact that will have on raws. And so, we are paying attention to both its impact on our European business, which so far thankfully, has not been much. And its impact on raw material costs, which at least in the near term have reversed an otherwise positive trend.\nArun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks. And then lastly, if I could just ask about the M&A strategy. I know that there was a greater focus on MAP growth over the last couple of years. But are you finding yourselves getting back into the inorganic market as well? How would you characterize the environment there? And if there\u2019s any focus, what areas are you focusing on and how are you seeing valuations? Thanks.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So, the pipeline of the typical RPM, small to medium sized product lines is pretty good. And we would expect to be able to just generally complete, let\u2019s say, $100 million or $200 million on an annualized basis of product line or business acquisitions. That\u2019s been our bread and butter. Large transactions have been in extraordinary prices. And I think that you\u2019re going to see some mitigation and valuations as interest rates rise, and inflation is seen as something that is other than temporal, and we would welcome that. And so that\u2019s kind of where we are. We wouldn\u2019t expect to be an aggressive player at these historic high valuations, which seem to be persisting now in the face of significant raw material costs. I can tell you, Rusty, Matt Ratajczak, Michael Laroche, Rusty\u2019s team did a 10-year bond at the end of January and we\u2019re able to capture a 2.95% coupon. And if we turned around and do that bond today, it would cost us 4.25% or more. And so, I don\u2019t know how well the rise in interest rates and its impact on incremental cost of capital is being reflected in the markets yet but eventually it will be.\nArun Viswanathan: Thanks.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Spector from UBS. Your line is now open.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning.\nJosh Spector: Yes. Hi guys. Thanks Michael and Frank. Thanks for taking my question. Just a clarification, first off, just on the raws inflation, make sure I heard it right. When you talked about the 40% increase, was that total company or Consumer? And I guess when you think about that in terms of total variable cost inflation in COGS, what would that number look like?\nFrank Sullivan: So, I\u2019m not sure I can answer the last part of your question, but yes, the 40% is total company and that\u2019s materials and packaging. It does not incorporate freight or labor, which are also well, although certainly not to the same extent. And Consumer is somewhat higher in particular, in relationship to its exposure on things like acrylic resins, which again, year-over-year are up 113% or alkyd resin 113%. Aerosol cans are up 66%, so that\u2019s really specific to Rust-Oleum. And so, they have some higher outliers in relationship to their -- the small packaging nature of our Consumer businesses and the disproportionate impact of acrylic resins on Consumer versus the rest of our businesses.\nJosh Spector: Okay. Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And just a specific question on Europe and specifically the performance segment, an epoxy producer earlier shut down some capacity in the region. And part of that decision was related with lower demand. That seems a bit counter in terms of what you guys are seeing in terms of that segment. So, I am curious, if you have any thoughts or comments around that. Thanks.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So first of all, epoxy resin costs for us are up 70% year-over-year. So, that\u2019s not been a good thing. We have been able to pass on price. There was a reference earlier to our ability to provide supply and apply which is benefiting us both in a lot of our roofing businesses as well as the Stonhard flooring business, and so that\u2019s been an advantage for us. Epoxy resins and some of the intermediate chemicals in the new epoxies had some availability challenges are -- earlier in the year. As we sit here today, we\u2019re in pretty good shape.\nJosh Spector: Okay. Thank you.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Silke Kueck from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Silke.\nSilke Kueck: Good morning. How are you?\nFrank Sullivan: Good. Thank you.\nSilke Kueck: Last quarter, you said that you had a $200 million headwind from lost sales due to the raw material shortages and maybe $100 million of that was in the Consumer segment. Can you tell how much it was in this quarter, how much it was on Consumer and what -- would you think you might experience in the fourth quarter and how do you think about \u201823?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I don\u2019t think we had much in the way of discernible lost revenue in Q3, and it had as much to do with the seasonal nature of our business, where as our third quarter is meaningfully lower than our other three quarters. And so, we haven\u2019t seen as much of an impact that we can point to. It is possible that it would be an impact in Q4 equal to what we saw in Q1 and Q2 just because Q4 is a significantly large quarter for us, as we build into a construction season and we build into a Consumer DIY season, particularly for exterior use products. So -- but there\u2019s the short answer is it did not have a noticeable or a measurable impact in Q3 like it did in the prior quarters.\nSilke Kueck: Okay. And for the fourth quarter, if I understood it right, you think maybe it\u2019s like order of magnitude like in the $200 million range, something like that?\nFrank Sullivan: I would think it would be half of that and it would be predominantly in Consumer. Unless, there are raw material disruptions as a result of the Russian war on Ukraine that we don\u2019t anticipate sitting here today. But we don\u2019t have the raw material disruptions in our industrial businesses that we had for the first half of the year, I mean, for the first half of the year, we had enough significant raw material disruptions, either of direct raw materials or ingredients that went into the chemical raw materials we purchased, that we had stopped production in numerous places. That is not occurring as we sit here today. And on the Consumer side, the disruptions that we had, both from a raw material availability perspective and just the normal throughput is improving again as we sit here today. So, if we have an impact in Q4, I would bet it would be closer to $100 million across the whole business, but we\u2019ll give you the details of that in July.\nSilke Kueck: And my second question is just on the -- on resins, what percentage of your cost of goods sold baskets are epoxy resins, alkyd resins, acrylic resins, like, if you add it all together, like, third of your material costs, is it bigger than that? And what percentage can you make in-house now or maybe like, what percentage can you make next year, given the manufacturing capabilities you acquired?\nRussell Gordon: Sure. Yes. In terms of resins, there\u2019s not 1 resin that\u2019s even 5% of RPM\u2019s total raw material basket. You mentioned some of the bigger ones we do buy, acrylic resins, alkyd resins, epoxy resins. They are meaningful to different product lines. In terms of in-house production, we are supplementing, as we\u2019ve talked about, in alkyd resins. That\u2019s a nice facility in Texas to absorb shocks and supply like we\u2019ve had over the last 12 months. But we continue to do business with a number of suppliers of alkyd resins and expect to continue that in the future.\nFrank Sullivan: Our expectation would be that the in-house production on alkyd resins would be somewhere in the 20% or 25% range. As I said, we were moving in the right direction and then another long-term supplier withdrew their capacity from the market in the last couple of months as well, which was unexpected and something we\u2019re adjusting to.\nSilke Kueck: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. In terms of your savings program, are there any measurable savings from the last bit of like the MAP program that you saw in the quarter or was all of that is now apply, some of it is obviously the procurement of raw materials. So, was there any measurable savings you can quantify that you\u2019ve gotten from the MAP program like incremental year-over-year?\nFrank Sullivan: All right. As best we can calculate in the quarter roughly about $15 million.\nSilke Kueck: 15?\nFrank Sullivan: And I will -- yes. And I\u2019ll tell you that the ability of the Construction Products Group and Performance Coatings Group to recover in this environment to record levels of EBIT and EBIT margin has got as much to do with the efficiencies from our MAP operating improvement program as they do from a cost price mix -- so it\u2019s been hugely -- the timing was lucky. It\u2019s been hugely beneficial for us as we faced the disruptions over the last year.\nSilke Kueck: Okay. And my last question is on the Consumer business. So, PPG expanded its relationship with Home Depot and like, in primers and sealers and concrete paint and stains. And when you look at your market share at Home Depot or generally your big-box retail business, do you think your share is like flat or up or down? Can you tell?\nFrank Sullivan: I don\u2019t think we have lost any market share and there\u2019s no area where we can point to. The biggest challenge for us and for most people in the Consumer markets, as well as some of the basic architectural paint business is supply. And so, we prided ourselves on fill rates of 98%, 99%, it\u2019s where we operated for a long time. And as a result of both the COVID disruption and supply chain challenges, fill rates have been significantly lower. And that\u2019s been a challenge for us, for others in our industry and, quite candidly, when you go to one of the big retailers, for people in a lot of places. So, the challenge is supply relative to raw material availability and costs and COVID-related disruptions much more so than market share challenges at this point. So, our -- and we are expanding capacity in our Consumer businesses to make sure as we put these disruptions behind us, so we can get back to those high fill rates and maintain market share and grow.\nSilke Kueck: Okay. Thanks very much.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Sison from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Mike.\nMike Sison: Hi, this is actually Richard on for Mike. So your first question, you did mention that the Russian invasion had a meaningful impact on the supply chain, obviously. Is that comment based on just the higher derivative price for oil and products or is there specific products which may not be available in terms of supply chain, such as CIO2 or other ones?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes. We have not seen availability issues directly, but we saw a pretty quick reversal in what seemed like stabilizing prices in some basic commodity chemicals, some trends that were moving in the right direction that would suggest that maybe our raws would be stabilizing or perhaps, over time, going down and that reversed very quickly. And so it\u2019s, obviously, oil and directly oil and solvents and things like that but it impacted all of our resins. And then as I mentioned earlier, some of the bio-based resins, soy-based resins, soybeans, stuff like that, there are some availability challenges there and whether those become big problems or get corrected here in the coming weeks and months, time will tell.\nMike Sison: Okay. Thanks. And then, just a follow-up on the EBIT guidance, low teens across the board, I mean, basically, can you give us some color in terms of where you see the most growth on the EBIT side? And obviously, for Consumer, are you -- do you expect sequential improvement as part of that?\nOperator: [Technical Difficulty] Excuse me. This is the operator. I apologize but there will be a slight delay in today\u2019s conference. Please hold and the conference will resume shortly. Thank you for your patience.\nFrank Sullivan: We appear to have disconnected and I believe we\u2019re back live on the conference call. And so operator, if there are any additional questions, we would be happy to take them.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison from Seaport Research. Your line is now open.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Mike.\nMike Harrison: Good morning. Maybe just I guess, close the loop out on the last question that was asked. I didn\u2019t hear the response, but do you see particular segments with that low teens EBIT guidance for next quarter, particular segments exceeding that? And then, I think my question would be if the Consumer business, do you expect EBIT there to be up on a year-over-year basis?\nFrank Sullivan: So, I would tell you that our Construction Products Group, Performance Coatings Group have an opportunity to outperform that low teens between price and unit volume. It will be somewhat mitigated by FX, given the strength of the dollar. But we see good momentum there continuing in both. They are generating record results on top of really strong results a year ago in Q4. Our Consumer business will be moving in the right direction. And we\u2019re seeing that, we\u2019re taking actions to move it there, so you\u2019ll see a sequential quarter-by-quarter improvement. I would expect positive unit volume growth modestly there, and we\u2019ve suffered some negative unit volume growth in the last couple of quarters, so you\u2019ll see good progress there. And you\u2019ll see improvement sequentially in our margins. I don\u2019t think we get back to a positive EBIT and stronger margins in year-over-year in Consumer until the first quarter of our new fiscal year, which starts on June one.\nMike Harrison: Great. And then in terms of the Consumer business, you mentioned that your fill rates, I think last quarter, you said fill rates were in the 50% to 70% range. You said they continue to be still a little bit low. But I think we\u2019re trying to get a sense of how much seasonal demand you\u2019re going to be able to meet and kind of where those inventory levels are as we head into the spring season.\nFrank Sullivan: So, our -- without getting into specifics, because it\u2019s different by product line and different by customer, but our fill rates are improving meaningfully week-by-week. And a lot of that has to do -- the fill rate challenges we had in Q3 were related, as we talked about earlier, with the Omicron impact, particularly in our Rust-Oleum manufacturing facility and D.C. They\u2019re separate but very large facilities in Wisconsin and the availability of raw materials and packaging. There were also freight disruptions over the last two quarters that impacted fill rates as well. All of that is improving, and we\u2019re not going to be back to the levels that we want to be in Q4, but we\u2019re going to be meaningfully better than we\u2019ve been in the last couple of quarters. And I think that will be part of the sequential improvement that we expect to experience in our Consumer Group.\nMike Harrison: All right. And then, last question for me is you mentioned in the press release that inflation and higher interest rates could be impacting consumer demand. Have you seen any evidence of that yet or is that just kind of what ECON 101 tells you?\nFrank Sullivan: No. My comment was really an impact on M&A valuations. It\u2019s hard we compare the Consumer demand, both sequentially and year-over-year, but we\u2019re also looking back to some of the pre-COVID periods. And so it\u2019s somewhat of a challenge to get a good gauge on where the appropriate consumer demand is relative to the literally 30% or 35% unit volume increases we saw for about three quarters in a row during the COVID period because of the stay at home orders. And so, Consumer takeaway is solid, and we think that\u2019s continuing and will continue into the summer. I think we and our large customers believe that through COVID, we expanded the base of confident DIYers, so we\u2019ve got a larger base of regular consumers that we\u2019re excited about. Our problem has been supply. It\u2019s been raw material supply and a related product supply that\u2019s reflected in fill rates that are -- that have been below where they need to be.\nMike Harrison: All right. Thanks very much.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Frank Sullivan for closing remarks.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you. Thank you very much for your participation on our conference call this morning. We are looking forward to continuing to build momentum and positive growth into our fourth quarter of fiscal \u201822 and to a really strong start to our new fiscal year. We look forward to providing you details of our fourth quarter results in July when those are released as well as an outlook both for fiscal \u201823 and some longer-term goals that we\u2019ve been working on for quite some time. I\u2019m grateful to the RPM associates who have generated a return to record sales and record earnings despite all the challenges that we faced. And we appreciate everybody\u2019s investment in RPM. Thank you, and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Mike Laroche",
            "content": "Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. During the third quarter, we generated consolidated net sales of $1.43 billion, an increase of 13%, compared to the $1.27 billion reported during the same quarter of fiscal 2021. Organic sales growth was 13.4% or $170.1 million. Acquisitions contributed 1.4% of sales or $17.8 million, while exchange was a headwind that decrease sales by 1.8% or $23.4 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.38, which was unchanged compared to the year ago quarter. Our consolidated adjusted EBIT was up 0.8% to a record $80.6 million, compared to the $79.9 million reported in the fiscal 2021 third quarter. On a double-stack basis, comparing fiscal Q3 2022 to pre-pandemic Q3 of FY 2020, sales, EBIT, adjusted EBIT, net income, diluted EPS and adjusted diluted EPS, all achieved double- or triple-digit growth. Similar to the first and second quarters of fiscal 2022, our third quarter performance reflects the benefits of our balanced business portfolio, where softness in one segment is generally offset by strength in the others. During the third quarter of fiscal 2022, three of our four operating segments, Construction Products Group, Performance Coatings Group and Specialty Products Group generated strong double-digit sales growth. Combined sales in these three segments increased 19%, while sales in the Consumer segment were up modestly. Again, after removing Consumer, the remainder of RPM produced exceptional adjusted EBIT growth of 97%. Our Consumer Group continued to be disproportionately impacted by inflation, as well as by overtime related labor and supply chain disruption, particularly during December and January. This instability in supply caused inefficiencies and continued to negatively impact conversion costs, resulting in a decline in adjusted EBIT at our Consumer Group for the fourth consecutive quarter. Later in the call, we'll discuss the actions we're taking to address these challenges affecting this segment. Our Construction Products Group generated third quarter record net sales of $482 million, up 21.7% compared to the fiscal 2021 third quarter. Organic sales growth was 23.2% and acquisitions contributed 2.2%. Foreign currency translation headwinds reduced sales by 3.7%. CPG record revenue growth was largely due to the segments ongoing success in promoting its differentiated restoration solutions, which offer particular advantages versus new construction given the current raw materials and labor shortages. These same challenges have continued to help speed the adoption of the segment's innovative building envelopes products. CPG's fastest growing businesses are those providing roofing systems, insulated concrete forms, commercial sealants, as well as concrete admixtures and repair products. The segment's international operations generated strong topline growth in local currencies, which was muted by the strengthening U.S. dollar. CPG fiscal 2022 third quarter adjusted EBIT increased 89.7% to a record $35.1 million. Despite a difficult prior year comparison, CPG was able to dramatically increase adjusted EBIT and EBIT margin to third quarter records due to improve product mix, volume growth and operational improvements. All of these factors combined with selling price increases helped to offset higher raw material inflation. Our Performance Coatings Group's fiscal 2022 third quarter net sales were record $270.9 million, an increase of 19.6% over the year ago period. Organic sales increased 17.8% and acquisitions contributed 3.4%, which was partially offset by foreign currency translation headwind of 1.6%. PCG continued its momentum with all of its North American businesses generating double-digit organic sales growth. PCG's businesses serving emerging markets generated explosive growth and its European companies continued their steady rebound. Driving its strong topline or increased in industrial maintenance spending, recovery in energy markets and price increases. PCG's best performing businesses were those providing polymer flooring systems, corrosion control coatings and raised flooring systems. Adjusted EBIT increased 89.9% to a record of $26.8 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Adjusted EBIT increase as a result of volume growth, operational improvements and a more favorable product mix. Additionally, adjusted EBIT margin was a third quarter record. Specialty Products Group reported record net sales of $189.4 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2022, an increase of 11.9% compared to the fiscal 2021 third quarters. Organic sales increased 11.9% and acquisitions added 0.8%, which were offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation of 0.8%. SPG generated record sales as a result of strong performance at nearly all of its businesses, with the highest growth coming from those serving OEM and food additive markets. In addition, these segment sales of disaster restoration equipment rebounded after securing a supply of semiconductor chips and reconfiguring its products to accommodate. This is example of how our businesses quickly adjust to challenges demonstrating a key advantage to RPM's entrepreneurial culture. This business did face a tough comparison to the prior year period, when demand for its restoration equipment was inflated because of winter storm Uri. Adjusted EBIT was a record $26.6 million in fiscal 2022 third quarter, an increase of 5.4%, compared to adjusted EBIT of $25.3 million in the last year's quarter. This record adjusted EBIT was largely due to operational improvements. Our Consumer Group achieved record net sales of $491.6 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2022, an increase of 2.9% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2021. Organic sales increased 3.6%, which was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation of 0.7%. As we anticipated, the segment grew revenue in part due to its ability to mitigate the severe alkyd resin shortages it had experienced by leveraging the new Texas manufacturing facility we acquired in September. During the third quarter sales and productivity were challenged by unreliable shipping and supply, resulting from labor shortages caused by the Omicron variant, particularly in December and January. Speaking of challenges, the Consumer Group also faced a difficult comparison to the prior year period when sales increased 19.8% and adjusted EBIT increased 48.6% due to elevated demand for its home improvement products during the pandemic's first phase. Fiscal 2022 third quarter adjusted EBIT was $17.2 million, a decrease of 63.9%, compared to adjusted EBIT of $47.8 million reported during the prior year period. Due to the nature of its products and the markets it serves, inflation has been more impactful on the Consumer Group than RPMs other segments, and raw material inflation in particular, has had the most significant impact on EBIT. Partially offsetting these factors were price increases and operational improvements, as a Consumer Group is currently investing in capacity and process improvements to meet customer demand, as well as build resilience in its supply chain. The Consumer Group is continuing to implement price increases to catch up with the inflation this segment has experienced over the last four quarters. Lastly, I'd like to note that we have significant liquidity, which enables us to fund internal growth initiatives, make acquisitions, reward our investors with cash dividend payments and repurchase our shares, helping to keep our liquidity strong as a $300 million bond offering we completed in January. Also during the third quarter we repurchase $15 million of our common stock. Now I'll turn the call over to Rusty to discuss our outlook. Sure. You're absolutely right. Operating cash flows were negatively impacted by working capital, largely driven by supply chain issues we've been discussing and inflation, quite honestly. We expect that inflation is going to continue and we're going to continue to purchase opportunistically where we can to help lock in availability and price. So it -- you may see some unusual relationships in working capital as it relates to cash flows for the next few quarters."

            "content": "Thanks, Mike. For the fiscal 2022 fourth quarter, our operations and those of our suppliers are expected to be impacted by ongoing supply chain challenges and raw materials shortages, which will exert pressure on revenues and productivity. The strengthening U.S. dollar will also unfavorably impact the translation of our results in international markets. In addition the war in Ukraine is creating some supply and inflationary pressures, which Frank will address in a little bit. While it's too soon to tell, rising interest rates may slow business and Consumer spending in the coming months. Despite these challenges, we expect to generate fiscal 2022 fourth quarter consolidated sales growth in the low teens versus a difficult comparison to last year's fourth quarter sales, which grew 19.6%. On a segment basis, we anticipate sales growth in the low teens in all four of our operating groups, as a result of strategic investments we are making to capitalize on market opportunities and industry trends. We anticipate that consolidated adjusted EBIT for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 will increase in the low teens versus the same period last year when adjusted EBIT was up 10.6%. We expect that earnings will continue to be affected by raw material, freight and wage inflation, as well as by the impact on sales volumes from operational disruptions caused by raw material shortages. Our Consumer Group will be disproportionately impacted by these issues. Its EBIT margins have eroded all three quarters of this fiscal year due to inflationary pressures, which have a greater impact on the Consumer Group than RPM's other segments. We continue to work to neutralize these factors by improving operational efficiencies, employing additional price increases to catch up with inflation and adding manufacturing capacity to improve resiliency. This concludes our prepared comments. We are now pleased to take your questions."

            "name": "Frank Sullivan",
            "content": "Good morning. Welcome to the RPM International Inc. investor call for our fiscal 2022 third quarter. Joining me on today's call is Rusty Gordon, RPM's Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Mike Laroche, our Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. I'll share a broad commentary on our consolidated performance for the quarter, Mike will provide details on our financial results and Rusty will conclude with our formal remarks and our outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, after which we'll take your questions. Please note that our comments will be on an as adjusted basis and all comparisons are to the third quarter of fiscal 2021 unless otherwise indicated. We provided a supplemental slide presentation to support our comments on this call. It can be accessed in the Presentations and Webcasts section of the RPM website at www.rpminc.com. For the third quarter of our fiscal 2022 RPM generated record consolidated EBIT and sales despite a difficult comparison to the prior year. These results were driven by our associates worldwide who persevere despite an extremely challenging operating environment, including ongoing raw material and labor shortages, Omicron-related disruptions that were particularly acute in the third quarter, as well as material, wage and freight cost inflation. Our consolidated adjusted EBIT growth was driven by three of our four segments, Construction Products, Performance Coatings and Specialty Products, which leveraged selling price adjustments and operational improvements to the bottomline. Our Consumer Group is the outlier. Mike will discuss this in more detail when he presents our segment results. With our primary real -- raw material costs up more than 40% on average versus a year ago, our Consumer Group will need to catch up with significant selling price increases, which will be instituted at the end of this month. We have been fast to respond to supply chain challenges by quickly scaling up in-house resin production at manufacturing facility we acquired in September. Additionally, due to our ongoing investments in the fastest growing areas of our business, our high performance building, construction and coding systems have generated accelerated growth. Construction and industrial maintenance activity is robust, and energy markets have recovered, while Consumer takeaway remained strong. Due to three years of extraordinary work for our associates to implement our math to growth operating improvement program, we have made structural improvements to RPM, while maintaining our entrepreneurial culture, which is a core strength of RPM. As a result, our Performance Coatings Group and Construction Products Group are operating not only at record sales and EBIT, but at record margins in the third quarter. Our Specialty Products Group is trending towards this same performance with record results in sales and EBIT and improving margin performance. And we are making good progress in our Consumer business. In short, we are playing on offense almost everywhere investing in accelerating organic growth, significant increases in capital expansion, particularly in the areas of Nudura ICF, roof restoration coatings and a number of our Consumer Products areas, all of which are building positive momentum as we go into the fourth quarter and we roll into fiscal 2023. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mike Laroche to discuss our financial results in more detail. Good morning, Frank. Sure. I can give you some examples I think Frank. First of all, we were starting to see some flattening out of raw material prices in certain resins and other categories of oil-related items until the onset of the Russian war on Ukraine. And that flattening out has changed and things are once again for geopolitical reasons now looking like they might be heading up. So it's anybody's guess as to where we'll be in the fourth quarter, I can give you some specifics, just to put things in context. For instance, in Consumer, aerosol cans year-over-year up 66%, alkyd resins are up 113%, acrylic latex is up 41%, monomers are up 86. More appropriately to our industrial product lines, epoxy resins year-over-year are up 72% and DIs [ph] up 106%. And so it's a litany of sad higher increases in critical raw materials. We had seen a significant improvement in availability. Most of the force, not all, but most of the force measures that had been announced over the last 15 months to -- 12 months to 15 months had been rescinded. But once again we're anticipating some challenges in certain resins particularly some bio-based resins that we source in Europe and from India as a result of the disruptions from the Ukraine war. Sure. On average in the quarter price was up 12.5%. And so you can see when you look at the organic growth, we had tremendous organic growth in our Construction Products Group and our Performance Coatings Group, a modest mix of -- would appear flat in Specialty Products Group, but it was a mix of some organic growth in certain units and others not. And when you do the math, you'll see that we had actually unit declines in the quarter in Consumer. That was as much a result of the manufacturing and operating disruptions, raw material challenges, as demand remains pretty solid there. As we think about the fourth quarter, as Rusty indicated. We've got really good momentum going into Q4. We would expect to continue to operate at record levels of sales, EBIT and EBIT margins in our Construction Products Group, Performance Coatings Group, and at this point, we believe in our Specialty Products Group. And so on a consolidated basis, I think, we have a shot at having record results, it really depends on where we finish the quarter in Consumer. As we sit here today in Q4, price will add about 12.5% in terms of revenues. But as Rusty indicated, we're going out with another round of price increases across a number of product lines in RPM where appropriate. But in particular in our Consumer Group at the end of this month in relationship to both being impacted the most directly by raw material costs and packaging costs, being small project driven in paints and patch, repair and coats and sealants. We have a disproportionate packaging impact there as well and so we will report results in July. I would anticipate that we will be somewhat higher in the fourth quarter than the 12.5% based on our current pricing situation across RPM today. Thank you. Hi, John. Sure. Since the fall, we have added internal capacity with the addition of the Corsicana, Texas plant. And the team, there's ability to ramp up successfully in producing alkyd resins, which they had not done before. That was part of the reason for the acquisition. There was another supplier during that timeframe that withdrew supply from the marketplace. So it remains a challenging environment, let's say, and the alkyd situation is a particularly critical raw material for our Consumer Group. That's correct. So I would tell you that the line of sight anywhere isn't very good relative to all the dynamics in the marketplace. As we roll into Q1, I would expect us to have record results in sales, earnings and margins everywhere, that includes Consumer based on the actions that we're taking and also rounding finally some easier comps after the extraordinary kind of stay-at-home driven boom and DIY products that we're rounding now. I think that organic growth that we're seeing in a Construction Products Group for the foreseeable few quarters, as far as we can tell, will remain in the mid-to-high single digits on an organic growth basis. You can add about 12% in terms of sale price impact to that. So, again, without getting too far over ski tips, just because it's difficult to predict the future in this environment. The momentum going into the next couple of quarters is really strong and it doesn't seem like there's anything that will interrupt that at this point. Yeah. I would add one more thing to that, John, we're -- whether it's in our Nudura ICF or roof restoration coatings, as we sit here today, we could be selling more, but we are out of capacity in a few of these product areas. And we have a significant capacity expansion program to Nudura, the first elements of which will go into effect at the end of the fourth quarter and through the summer. And we have a significant capital expansion in our roof restoration coatings, which should roll out throughout the balance of this calendar year. I can tell you in roof restoration coatings, probably another $50 million or $100 million and in Nudura, we hope to realize another $40 million or $50 million of capacity by the end of this calendar year, and as much as another $100 million of capacity by the end of the summer of 2023. Thank you. Good morning, Ghansham. Sure. Our business -- first of all, I'll tackle Asia, our business in Asia is relatively modest compared to some of our peers. We're not seeing much of an impact, but mostly because we don't have a big slug of business there and the business that we do have is driven by our industrial product lines and so at this point, it's relatively stable. We're not seeing much negative impact. As it relates to Europe, Europe was recovering more slowly than North America for sure. And that recovery seems to be okay today. Although, we certainly anticipate -- we have not seen any meaningful disruption to our business activities as of yet, although, we're certainly heightened to that. As it relates to the Ukraine situation, we were very quick and early to discontinue any and all business activities in Russia. We don't have any manufacturing business there. The business we do have is relatively modest. So it's about $5 million or $6 million on an annualized basis. And we both felt it was the right thing to do. And certainly wanted to respond to concerns that a significant number of our workforce in European manufacturing and distribution of Ukrainian descent. And so that's the impact on Russia -- and the Russian war in Ukraine. But, in general, we're heightened of kind of anticipating impacts, but we haven't seen it yet. Sure. Our energy exposure is mostly in our Performance Coatings Group, and mostly in Carboline of the Performance Coatings Group, let's say, is about $1.1 billion and Carboline and Stonhard are by far and away the two largest business units there. I would guess directly and indirectly now you're talking broadly, oil and gas, and refinery and pipelines and things like that, probably, $300 million or so of exposure to oil and gas markets broadly. The -- again as you can see, we got high-teens organic growth, high single-digit unit volume and there's somewhat higher growth in that business than average in those businesses or product lines that are exposed to energy markets and we see that continuing. So there's a little bit of a double edged sword in that. It is driving a significant increase in capital spending and business for us in our Industrial segments. It's also driving a significant increase in our raw material costs as well, so. Thanks, Ghansham. Good morning, Steve. Yes. There is typically a delay, and yes, it is a negotiation, particularly across our large customers. We've announced three price increases over the last 12 months and the timing of those being instituted across large customers varies a little bit, not a lot. And we are both disproportionately being impacted by raw material costs both direct chemical raw material costs, as well as packaging costs in our Consumer business. And as our numbers reflect somewhat behind the curve in terms of addressing cost price mix, which is necessitating a fourth price increase, it will be announced at the end of this month. It was really in two areas, the biggest area, our largest plants are our Consumer plants. And we had in a number of Rust-Oleum plants, both our largest DC which is in Wisconsin, in our largest manufacturing facility, which is in Wisconsin, a meaningful impact of Omicron in terms of either people that were out infected and/or people that were quarantined because of exposure. And so it had a disproportionate impact on our Consumer business, particularly Rust-Oleum. We also saw it in our Consumer business with the just in time -- traditionally, just in time, freight delivery of raws into our plants and then distribution where some of our customers pick up, and in some cases, we handle freight. And there was a disproportionate impact over that period of time, we believe because of Omicron and freight availability and truckers and so that impacted the segment as well. Yes. We are. In that category we're seeing things improve and so the flow through our plants is significantly better. That will help profitability and margins as we go into the fourth quarter. So the Omicron spike both across RPM we track. We've been tracking quarantine and infections in COVID literally from March of 2020 every week. The Omicron spike was shockingly quick, high and then dissipated pretty quickly. And so we're back to a much more normal pace in terms of not having that same disruption at the end of February and March, and we're hopeful that the worst of COVID is behind us. It seems like if COVID isn't done with America, America's done with COVID, so. Thank you Good morning, Vincent. Sure. If you look at our EBIT margin, in general, quarter-by-quarter, and in particular, for instance this quarter where we're suffering the worst in Consumer. The vast majority of that EBIT margin decline is a gross margin decline, though we don't disclose gross margins by segment. And an of that, I would tell you, about two-thirds are, maybe a little bit more are material related and about one-third is operating efficiency and throughput in the plants. And so we fully expect in all of our businesses, as we get back to normal, the workforce disruptions are mitigated or eliminated and put behind us and we have normal flow through in our plants to where we were just a couple years ago, that that one-third impact on our margins would be recovered. The balance is literally a cost price mix dynamic, which we are managing better in our Industrial businesses than we have in our Consumer businesses year-to-date. Good morning, Kevin. Good. Sure. It's more organic in nature and we've taken a broader RPM platform approach to some of the developing markets and so there's a really good both cooperation between our Performance Coatings Group and our Construction Products Group, the two groups of RPM that had the greatest international exposure and the greatest developing world exposure and a real focus on driving organic growth and investing. So we're seeing significant growth in India, significant growth in Africa, in the Middle East, in Latin America. And I would tell you, some of it is recovery from COVID, for instance, in Latin America. Some of it is a result of a more intense focus on our more RPM platform basis and putting these regions under leaders who are responsible for a broader swath -- proven leaders who are responsible for a broader swath of RPM businesses and products and it's working. The last thing I would notice it's explosive on a relatively small base, but if we keep growing that base will keep getting bigger and become a more meaningful part of our business. So I think two comments on that, Kevin. One is, I think the furthest out we can really see is a quarter or two so, as I mentioned earlier, I -- as we sit here today, I would expect every one of our segments including Consumer to be generating solid sales and earnings growth in Q1. And the momentum that we are seeing in our Performance Coatings Group and Construction Products Group will continue. The Specialty Products Group should be back to record margins, not just higher sales and earnings. And we'll see solid recovery in Consumer, both on the top line and bottom line in part because the actions we're taking are taking hold, in part because of disruptions of COVID are being put behind us. And in part because we'll be rounding some easier comps in Consumer. So, you ought to see record results in Q1 for RPM on a consolidated business in each of our segments. I think this outlook really is a continuation of what we're experiencing in our three more industrial segments and an expectation that we're finally going to see positive results out of Consumer. Longer term, again, unless the dynamics change, we would expect to have a solid fiscal \u201823, and we'll provide pretty good details on that in July. And we also hope to be able to provide some longer-term perspective on where we're going with a map to growth 2.0, something that many of you know we've been working on for a while. But our willingness to get out there and make longer-term commitments has been disrupted by COVID and supply chain challenges that were working their way into something more normal and stable until the Russian war on Ukraine. And so, I think that's the caveat here. We're not seeing much of an impact on our European business yet. But time will tell in the coming months as to what impact there might be and to what extent. Thanks, Kevin. Good morning, Arun. Sure. I think particularly in Performance Coatings and Construction Products, we're expecting a mid-upper unit volume growth and the continuation of what's been about a 12%, 12.5%, on average price increase. So, you could see results on an organic basis in the mid-high teens. That's going to be knocked down a little bit by the strengthening U.S. dollar, which will take a couple of points off our results. So I think, in overall mix it's certainly possible that we'll continue mid-teen performance in some of the industrial businesses and would expect to see kind of a low teens kind of 10%, 12%-ish in Consumer. And so that's where we are, it will be a mix of both. But I think we feel pretty comfortable with this guidance. And as I said, I think we'll be in the fourth quarter at record EBIT on a consolidated basis and hopefully, record EBIT margins. It just depends on how quickly the actions we're taking in Consumer affect a stronger recovery there. It's hard to say right now. Again, we were seeing some underlying positive trends in things like ethylene, propylene and even some of our direct purchase raw materials. And all of that reversed with the Russian war in Ukraine. And I -- really who knows? And I'm not trying to be cagey here, if this thing is resolved, which I think the world is praying for relatively quickly, then, I do think we could see some stability. If this thing expands and has greater impact on oil and gas prices as well as some of the organic resins that are impacting that we purchase principally from India, but they've spiked up for reasons that I don't -- some people do, I don't directly understand other than they've spiked up because of the impact of the Russian war. It's hard to know how this will expand and what impact that will have on raws. And so, we are paying attention to both its impact on our European business, which so far thankfully, has not been much. And its impact on raw material costs, which at least in the near term have reversed an otherwise positive trend. Sure. So, the pipeline of the typical RPM, small to medium sized product lines is pretty good. And we would expect to be able to just generally complete, let's say, $100 million or $200 million on an annualized basis of product line or business acquisitions. That's been our bread and butter. Large transactions have been in extraordinary prices. And I think that you're going to see some mitigation and valuations as interest rates rise, and inflation is seen as something that is other than temporal, and we would welcome that. And so that's kind of where we are. We wouldn't expect to be an aggressive player at these historic high valuations, which seem to be persisting now in the face of significant raw material costs. I can tell you, Rusty, Matt Ratajczak, Michael Laroche, Rusty's team did a 10-year bond at the end of January and we're able to capture a 2.95% coupon. And if we turned around and do that bond today, it would cost us 4.25% or more. And so, I don't know how well the rise in interest rates and its impact on incremental cost of capital is being reflected in the markets yet but eventually it will be. Thank you. Good morning. So, I'm not sure I can answer the last part of your question, but yes, the 40% is total company and that's materials and packaging. It does not incorporate freight or labor, which are also well, although certainly not to the same extent. And Consumer is somewhat higher in particular, in relationship to its exposure on things like acrylic resins, which again, year-over-year are up 113% or alkyd resin 113%. Aerosol cans are up 66%, so that's really specific to Rust-Oleum. And so, they have some higher outliers in relationship to their -- the small packaging nature of our Consumer businesses and the disproportionate impact of acrylic resins on Consumer versus the rest of our businesses. Sure. So first of all, epoxy resin costs for us are up 70% year-over-year. So, that's not been a good thing. We have been able to pass on price. There was a reference earlier to our ability to provide supply and apply which is benefiting us both in a lot of our roofing businesses as well as the Stonhard flooring business, and so that's been an advantage for us. Epoxy resins and some of the intermediate chemicals in the new epoxies had some availability challenges are -- earlier in the year. As we sit here today, we're in pretty good shape. Thank you. Good morning, Silke. Good. Thank you. Sure. I don't think we had much in the way of discernible lost revenue in Q3, and it had as much to do with the seasonal nature of our business, where as our third quarter is meaningfully lower than our other three quarters. And so, we haven't seen as much of an impact that we can point to. It is possible that it would be an impact in Q4 equal to what we saw in Q1 and Q2 just because Q4 is a significantly large quarter for us, as we build into a construction season and we build into a Consumer DIY season, particularly for exterior use products. So -- but there's the short answer is it did not have a noticeable or a measurable impact in Q3 like it did in the prior quarters. I would think it would be half of that and it would be predominantly in Consumer. Unless, there are raw material disruptions as a result of the Russian war on Ukraine that we don't anticipate sitting here today. But we don't have the raw material disruptions in our industrial businesses that we had for the first half of the year, I mean, for the first half of the year, we had enough significant raw material disruptions, either of direct raw materials or ingredients that went into the chemical raw materials we purchased, that we had stopped production in numerous places. That is not occurring as we sit here today. And on the Consumer side, the disruptions that we had, both from a raw material availability perspective and just the normal throughput is improving again as we sit here today. So, if we have an impact in Q4, I would bet it would be closer to $100 million across the whole business, but we'll give you the details of that in July. Our expectation would be that the in-house production on alkyd resins would be somewhere in the 20% or 25% range. As I said, we were moving in the right direction and then another long-term supplier withdrew their capacity from the market in the last couple of months as well, which was unexpected and something we're adjusting to. All right. As best we can calculate in the quarter roughly about $15 million. And I will -- yes. And I'll tell you that the ability of the Construction Products Group and Performance Coatings Group to recover in this environment to record levels of EBIT and EBIT margin has got as much to do with the efficiencies from our MAP operating improvement program as they do from a cost price mix -- so it's been hugely -- the timing was lucky. It's been hugely beneficial for us as we faced the disruptions over the last year. I don't think we have lost any market share and there's no area where we can point to. The biggest challenge for us and for most people in the Consumer markets, as well as some of the basic architectural paint business is supply. And so, we prided ourselves on fill rates of 98%, 99%, it's where we operated for a long time. And as a result of both the COVID disruption and supply chain challenges, fill rates have been significantly lower. And that's been a challenge for us, for others in our industry and, quite candidly, when you go to one of the big retailers, for people in a lot of places. So, the challenge is supply relative to raw material availability and costs and COVID-related disruptions much more so than market share challenges at this point. So, our -- and we are expanding capacity in our Consumer businesses to make sure as we put these disruptions behind us, so we can get back to those high fill rates and maintain market share and grow. Thank you. Good morning, Mike. Yes. We have not seen availability issues directly, but we saw a pretty quick reversal in what seemed like stabilizing prices in some basic commodity chemicals, some trends that were moving in the right direction that would suggest that maybe our raws would be stabilizing or perhaps, over time, going down and that reversed very quickly. And so it's, obviously, oil and directly oil and solvents and things like that but it impacted all of our resins. And then as I mentioned earlier, some of the bio-based resins, soy-based resins, soybeans, stuff like that, there are some availability challenges there and whether those become big problems or get corrected here in the coming weeks and months, time will tell. We appear to have disconnected and I believe we're back live on the conference call. And so operator, if there are any additional questions, we would be happy to take them. Good morning, Mike. So, I would tell you that our Construction Products Group, Performance Coatings Group have an opportunity to outperform that low teens between price and unit volume. It will be somewhat mitigated by FX, given the strength of the dollar. But we see good momentum there continuing in both. They are generating record results on top of really strong results a year ago in Q4. Our Consumer business will be moving in the right direction. And we're seeing that, we're taking actions to move it there, so you'll see a sequential quarter-by-quarter improvement. I would expect positive unit volume growth modestly there, and we've suffered some negative unit volume growth in the last couple of quarters, so you'll see good progress there. And you'll see improvement sequentially in our margins. I don't think we get back to a positive EBIT and stronger margins in year-over-year in Consumer until the first quarter of our new fiscal year, which starts on June one. So, our -- without getting into specifics, because it's different by product line and different by customer, but our fill rates are improving meaningfully week-by-week. And a lot of that has to do -- the fill rate challenges we had in Q3 were related, as we talked about earlier, with the Omicron impact, particularly in our Rust-Oleum manufacturing facility and D.C. They're separate but very large facilities in Wisconsin and the availability of raw materials and packaging. There were also freight disruptions over the last two quarters that impacted fill rates as well. All of that is improving, and we're not going to be back to the levels that we want to be in Q4, but we're going to be meaningfully better than we've been in the last couple of quarters. And I think that will be part of the sequential improvement that we expect to experience in our Consumer Group. No. My comment was really an impact on M&A valuations. It's hard we compare the Consumer demand, both sequentially and year-over-year, but we're also looking back to some of the pre-COVID periods. And so it's somewhat of a challenge to get a good gauge on where the appropriate consumer demand is relative to the literally 30% or 35% unit volume increases we saw for about three quarters in a row during the COVID period because of the stay at home orders. And so, Consumer takeaway is solid, and we think that's continuing and will continue into the summer. I think we and our large customers believe that through COVID, we expanded the base of confident DIYers, so we've got a larger base of regular consumers that we're excited about. Our problem has been supply. It's been raw material supply and a related product supply that's reflected in fill rates that are -- that have been below where they need to be. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much for your participation on our conference call this morning. We are looking forward to continuing to build momentum and positive growth into our fourth quarter of fiscal \u201822 and to a really strong start to our new fiscal year. We look forward to providing you details of our fourth quarter results in July when those are released as well as an outlook both for fiscal \u201823 and some longer-term goals that we've been working on for quite some time. I'm grateful to the RPM associates who have generated a return to record sales and record earnings despite all the challenges that we faced. And we appreciate everybody's investment in RPM. Thank you, and have a great day."

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to RPM's Chairman and CEO, Mr. Frank Sullivan, for opening remarks. Please go ahead, sir.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you, Dee [ph]. Good morning and Happy New Year. Welcome to the RPM International Inc. investor call for our fiscal 2022 second quarter. Joining me on the call today is Rusty Gordon, our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Mike Laroche, Vice President, Controller, and Chief Accounting Officer. I'll begin by sharing broad commentary on our consolidated performance for the quarter. Mike will provide details on our segment results and Rusty will conclude our formal comments with our outlook for the fiscal 2022 third quarter. Our comments will be on an as adjusted basis and all comparisons are to the second quarter of fiscal 2021 unless otherwise indicated. Please note that we provided a supplemental slide presentation to support our comments on this call. These can be assessed in the presentations and webcasts section of the RPM website at www.rpminc.com. After our formal remarks, we'll be pleased to take your questions. I'll start with comments related to the third slide in the presentation material. For the fiscal 2022 second quarter, consolidated sales increased 10.3% to $1.64 billion driven by continued robust demand for paints, coatings, sealants, and other building materials. This top line performance was slightly ahead of the outlook we provided last quarter. Our second quarter sales growth could have been even stronger, if not for continuing supply chain challenges that limited access to certain raw materials and cost us roughly $200 million of loss to deferred sales in the quarter. Organic sales growth was 8.6%, foreign currency translation provided a tailwind of 0.4%, and acquisitions contributed 1.3%. Adjusted EPS was $0.79 decreasing 26% compared to the strong adjusted diluted EPS growth of nearly 40% in the prior-year period. Consolidated adjusted EBIT for the quarter was $157.3 million, a decrease of 21%, which was in line with our outlook and was a result of continued material, wage, and freight inflation, as well as supply chain disruptions that were exacerbated by Hurricane Ida at the beginning of the second quarter, and increased our conversion costs. Because of this supply disruption, we lost the equivalent of nearly 300 production days across RPM facilities globally during the second quarter, which was similar to our lost production days in the first quarter. We partially offset these challenges with price increases, which average in the high single digits across RPM, and continued operational improvements from our map to growth program which provided $19 million in incremental cost savings. It's also worth noting that we faced a difficult comparison to the prior year when consolidated adjusted EBIT increased nearly 30%, largely due to higher sales volumes driven by extraordinary demand for our home improvement products in our consumer group during the pandemic. To recover lost margin from in place inflation we are implementing an additional round of price increases this quarter across our business segments as appropriate. In many instances, this will be the third round of price increases in a 12-month period. The next slide provides high level results by segment. Much like last quarter, our performance reflects the benefits of our balanced business portfolio, where softness in one segment is generally offset by strength in others. During the second quarter of fiscal 2022, three of our four operating segments Construction Products Group, Performance Coatings Group, and Specialty Products Group generated strong double digit sales growth. Combined sales in these three segments increased more than 18% with roughly 10% being unit volume growth year-over-year. While our Construction Products and Performance Coating Group generated strong adjusted EBIT growth, the Specialty Products and Consumer group faced extreme supply chain constraints that put pressure on their earnings. In particular, the Specialty Products Group restoration equipment business was affected by worldwide semiconductor chip shortages that delayed sales to a growing backlog and unfavorably drove product mix. The consumer group continued to experience inflationary pressures, as well as shortages of key raw materials driven largely by last year's production outage at a key resin supplier that negatively impacted conversion costs. In addition, the consumer group faced a difficult comparison to the prior year period when sales increased more than 21% and adjusted EBIT was up 66%. These growth rates in the prior year period were largely due to the extraordinary DIY demand during the pandemic. All indicators suggest that the underlying demand for our consumer products remain strong and is continuing to grow in our third quarter. Before we move to the details on our segment results, I\u2019d like to touch on two larger trends that RPM is well positioned to capitalize on. First as you know, the U.S. government has passed a number of bills over the last two years that would direct billions and potentially trillions of dollars towards construction in infrastructure-end markets. Based on our strong position with these markets with well recognized, highly regarded brands such as Tremco roofing systems and commercial sealants, Carboline corrosion-control coatings, Euclid concrete admixtures, and Nudura insulated concrete forms all of which have been gaining market share in this fiscal year. We are well positioned for continuing meaningful growth in North America and globally. Two years ago, we introduced the tagline, building a better world in a number of our communications. It certainly represents our products and services, which literally contribute to making structures better through beautification protection, restoration, and sustainability. But it's also meant to be aspirational as we strive to make the world a better place for those we serve, including our customers, entrepreneurs, associates, shareholders in the communities in which we operate. As we all continue to manage the global pandemic, we remain focused on coming together to make the world a better place for everyone. There are many examples where RPM is doing so. Some of the ways RPM is building a better world include the development of sustainable products such as our AlphaGuard Liquid Applied Roofing products, which are gaining market share and allow roofs to be restored and eliminate the need for tear-off replacement and significant contributions to waste sites. In addition, our Tremco roofing business has been named a BioPreferred Program Pioneer by the USDA because of our early adoption of sustainable product solutions within our roofing division and the industry. Talent Development, which includes the right [ph] education and training initiative that is part of our WTI business and was developed in response to the shortage of qualified roofers includes an element called ELEVATE. This involves training of incarcerated individuals in roofing so that they have skills and job opportunities upon their release, at which time they are guaranteed a job at our Tremco roofing business, and sustainability practices across our operations such as initiatives to reduce water usage that are saving millions of gallons a year to Day-Glow, Rust-Oleum and other businesses. You can learn more about how RPM is building a better world on our website and in our ESG report at www dot rpminc.com/esg. We have a great story to tell and we will be organized to tell it better in the coming quarters and years. We remain focused on long term growth and despite COVID related challenges, especially in supply chains continue to invest in initiatives that will drive our business forward in the coming years. This includes operational improvements development of innovative new products, acquisitions, and manufacturing capacity expansions. A case in point is the 178,000 square foot plant we purchased in September, which is located on 120 acres in Texas. This will serve as a manufacturing center of excellence for multiple RPM businesses. In just two months, it is already improving the resiliency of our supply chain and fill rates. During the second quarter, we began production of alkyd resins which are important raw material for a number of our products, particularly in our consumer group. In the coming quarters the plant expansion, expanding production of a number of our high growth product lines. I'll now turn the call over to Mike to discuss our segment financial results in more detail.\nMichael Laroche: Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. Turning to the next slide, our construction products group generated all time record sales of $614.2 million. Sales grew 22% for the quarter, the highest rate among our four segments. 90.9% was organic, foreign currency translation provided a 0.3% tailwind, and acquisitions contributed 1.8%. CPGs market leading top line growth and positive mix were primarily driven by innovation and its high performance building solutions, market share gains in strong demand in North America for its construction and maintenance products. The businesses that generated the highest growth included those providing insulated concrete forms, roofing systems, concrete admixture and repair products and commercial sealants  Sales of our Nudura ICS [ph] have been particularly robust because they offer an alternative to lumber which is in short supply and experiencing skyrocketing costs. And because Nudura\u2019s ICS provides structural, insulation and labor benefits. Performance in international markets was mixed with Europe fairly flat, while emerging markets showed signs of recovery. The segment's adjusted EBIT increased 16.5% to a record level due to volume growth, operational improvements and selling price increases, which helped offset material inflation. Moving to the next slide, positive trends from the first quarter carried over into the second for our Performance Coatings Group. Sales grew 16.9% to a record level, reflecting organic growth of 12.2% of foreign currency translation tailwind of 0.8% and a 3.9% contribution from acquisitions. Nearly all the PCGs major business units contribute to the positive growth largely due to the catch up of maintenance projects previously deferred by industrial customers, particularly as COVID restrictions relaxed and contractor access to construction sites improved. Sales growth was also facilitated by price increases and improved product mix driven by new decision support tools that helped improve Salesforce efficiencies and product mix. Leading the way were the segment's largest businesses providing polymer flooring systems and corrosion control coatings, serving growing end markets including electric vehicles, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals. Sales also remained strong at its recently acquired Bison raised flooring business and in emerging markets. Adjusted EBIT increased 41.3% to a record level as a result of pricing, volume growth, operational improvements and product mix. Advancing to the next slide, our specialty products group reported a sales increase of 10% to a record level as its businesses capitalize on the strong demand in the outdoor recreation, furniture and OEM markets they serve. The segments fluorescent pigments business also generated good top line growth. Organic sales increased 9%, recent acquisitions added 0.4% and foreign currency translation increased sales by 0.6%. Adjusted EBIT decreased 29.4% due to higher raw material and conversion costs from supply disruptions as well as unfavorable product mix, particularly in our disaster restoration equipment business, which has been hindered by the semiconductor chip shortage as Frank had mentioned. In addition, the segment experienced higher expenses resulting from investment, investments and future growth initiatives plus higher legal expenses. These factors were partially offset by operational improvements. On the next slide, you'll see that the severe raw material shortages that consumer group experienced during the fiscal 2022 first quarter persisted during the second quarter. The resulting production outages negatively impacted segment sales by approximately $100 million. Segment sales decreased 3.3% with organic sales down 3.5% in foreign currency translation up 0.2%. Despite raw material shortages, the segments fiscal 2022 second quarter sales were still 17.4% above the pre pandemic levels of the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Demand for its products remained high and inventories and many of its channels are low. We expect to recover the sales when raw material and supply conditions stabilize. As Rick mentioned in his opening comments, the consumer group also faced a challenging comparison to the prior year period when sales increased 21.4% and adjusted EBIT increased 65.8% due to extraordinarily high demand for its home improvement products during the first phase of the pandemic. Earnings declined during the fiscal 2022 second quarter from inflation on materials, freight and labor, as well as the unfavorable impact of supply shortages on productivity. These factors were partially offset by price increases and operational improvements. The segment continues to add capacity to meet demand and build resiliency in its supply chain to secure the raw materials it requires. In order to meet customer demand, it is using contract manufacturing at higher cost until it can bring new manufacturing capacity online. It is also qualifying new sources for raw materials including our new manufacturing plant in Texas. Now I'll turn the call over to Rusty to discuss our outlook.\nRusty Gordon: Thanks Mike. Looking ahead to our fiscal 2022 third quarter, we expect that the strong demand for our paints, coatings, sealants, and other building materials will continue. Supply chain challenges and raw material shortages have persisted in December further compounded by disruptions from the Omicron variant on RPMs operations, and those of our supplier base. These factors are expected to put pressure on our top line and productivity. In spite of these challenges, we expect to generate double digit consolidated sales growth in the fiscal 2022 third quarter versus last year's record third quarter sales, which increased 8.1%. We anticipate high double digit sales growth, along with margin accretion in our construction products group and Performance Coatings Group. SPG sales are expected to be up low double digits as compared to last year's third quarter. The consumer group faces a tough comparison to the prior year period when it sales increased 19.8% and as a result, its sales are anticipated to increase by low single digit. Consolidated adjusted EBIT for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 is expected to decrease 5% to 15% versus the same period last year when adjusted EBIT was up 29.7%. We anticipate that earnings will be affected by on-going raw material, freight and wage inflation, as well as the impact of raw material shortages on sales volumes, plus the renewed COVID disruption from the surging Omicron variant. These challenges will disproportionately impact our consumer segment. We continue to work to offset these challenges by implementing price increases, improving operational efficiencies, and bringing on additional manufacturing capacity. Finally, I'd like to note that we remain laser focused on executing our strategies for sustained growth. We remain vigilant about protecting the health of our employees, their families and the communities in which we operate. With the rise in COVID cases worldwide, we remain focused on processes and procedures to maintain safe and productive working environments for our associates. We continue to be agile in our management of the business, allowing us to navigate supply chain issues and meet customer needs. We expect that margins will recover towards pre pandemic levels once supply challenges abate. Lastly, we are investing in employee training and other initiatives that will drive long term growth including operational improvements, innovation, acquisitions, capacity expansions, and information technology. These actions will optimally position RPM to deliver long term growth and increased value for our stakeholders. This concludes our formal comments. We will now be pleased to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you sir.[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch of Fermium Research.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Frank.\nFrank Mitsch: Hey, good morning, Frank, and Happy New Year to you. Hey, obviously a lot of comments regarding price, you indicated that that price was up in the high single digits here in the fiscal second quarter. And you announced another round of price increases. What are your expectations for pricing in the back half of the fiscal year and where do we stand in terms of the raw material inflation? Can you give us some color as to you know, what you were facing in the fiscal second quarter? What your outlook is on the raw side for the fiscal third quarter?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. In the second quarter, on a consolidated basis price was up 7.5%. And with the price that's already been announced and enacted in fiscal 22, we expect price to have an 11.5% impact in Q3. Our raw materials are up pretty significantly in terms of where we are year-over-year. We're up about 30% in total. We're up 40% to 50% on our top 20 raw materials, we\u2019re up in a couple categories year-over-year like epoxy resins, alkyd resins, over 100%. And so that's some of the color you're seeing. I can tell you in general that the supply chain situation is still very stressed, but as we sit here today, it seems to be improving. Feedstocks are improving, although we're not seeing that yet translated into the intermediates and specialties which we buy, availability of raw materials is improving in most -- in most areas. But I will tell you, the whole supply chain is still very susceptible to unexpected shocks, so it doesn't seem to be much pushing our resiliency in this improving environment. The last comment I'll make on that is freight is a kind of uniquely growing problem. Freight costs have been rising across all categories as we have commented in the past, particularly for truck transportation and most probably related to COVID infections or quarantines. Literally, the availability of freight to move goods has become a challenge in the first part of Q3.\nFrank Mitsch: Got you. Got you. And, and feeding off of that supply chain issue that you mentioned, that's obviously part of the reason why you decided to increase your inventories here in the fiscal second quarter to try and get ahead of that, of that where you can. And so it kind of begs the question, as you look at your customers, you assume that your customers are probably doing the same. So, yourself and Rusty mentioned from time to again the robust demand that you're seeing out there, which is obviously very positive, but to what extent might that be a little bit of double counting as customers are also seeking to raise their inventory levels? Do you have any good feel as to how that interplay is playing out?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure, well, I can, I can assure you that our inventory levels are lower than they normally would be and provide tons of examples, but our fill rates are not at the 98%, 99% levels that have been the norm for decades. And there is a meaningful backlog in consumer. So, the supply chains there are very tight on the finished goods side. In most of our product categories, the hundreds of millions of dollars per quarter that were missing in revenue is in part due to supply chain disruptions in our ability, production wise just to get products out. And so, I don't think there's much cushion Frank in the inventory of our customer base, and we are working hard to get some cushion back in there. And I suspect our customers would appreciate getting back to normal levels, but we've had to defer revenues across multiple businesses and product lines because of the supply chain and production disruptions.\nFrank Mitsch: Very helpful. Thank you.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John McNulty of BMO Capital Markets.\nJohn McNulty: Thanks for taking my question, Frank. Good Morning. So when I look at the various businesses, with regard to some of the inflationary pressures, construction managed it pretty well over the last couple quarters performance as well, consumer seems to be taking it on the chin a lot harder, and I assume that's largely tied to the alkyd outage that you referenced earlier. I guess can you help us understand how long before you feel like things are back to a steady state in terms of alkyd supply, whether it's from the capacity that you're bringing on yourself or from other suppliers that you may be able to, to be able to procure it from? Can you give us a little bit of color on that?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. Yes, I appreciate your comments broadly. We anticipate in Q3 continuing really strong growth in our construction products group and Performance Coatings Group, including a return to some meaningful margin improvement, so you'll see nice leverage to the bottom line there as we've managed cost price mix in those businesses and continue to take market share. You'll see improvement in our specialty segment. And I think as we sit here today, unless the COVID Omicron disruptions continue to get worse, we anticipate although the quarter is not over that it will be the first quarter in three where you'll have all four of our segments positive from a revenue perspective. The consumer group is the principal challenge in Q3 will be nicely positive in terms of EBIT across all our other businesses. And it's really related to a couple things. It is related to alkyd resins, our primary supplier, as you know, had an outage that negatively impacted us. We've been scrambling both in terms of getting product and then also outsourcing production. That's been an 18 month issue that we're working to resolve and we'll start making headway this spring. We are packaging intensive, not only within RPM, but within the consumer paint industry, within RPMs consumer group. We are small project paints, we are a small project passion repair, we are clocks and sealants. So packaging has been both a disproportionally bigger challenge in terms of cost and also in terms of the availability, I think the last straw to drop there is an anticipation of another significant increase this spring in tinplate costs, which will impact metal packaging across the whole industry. Last comment I'll make is that we've had significant COVID disruptions within our consumer group. And I can give you just some statistics. Broadly speaking, this is what the world is seeing. First, from a corporate campus of 100 people, we had 20 cases over the 18 month period of March 2020. through November, on our corporate campus. We've had 14 cases in the last two weeks. And most of those have been breakthrough. And most of those as far as we can tell, have been at home. In our consumer segment, we had 108 cases in our operations alone, that's manufacturing and distribution sites. Over the last six months, we've had 97 cases in December. And so those are also disproportionately happening because we're pretty intensive in distribution, and manufacturing and consumer, freights been another issue. So sorry, for the long litany of challenges, we're going to be positive in terms of sales growth year-over-year and consumer for the first time in three quarters. And you're going to see significantly better resin flow, as we continue to ramp up the Texas facility that we acquired in September that's going as well or better than we anticipated.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. That\u2019s helpful color. And I guess maybe a question on the longer term. I know, in the past, you've cited, a margin target of 16% in the long term. And I think that, that was that was still kind of the goal, even though map to grow, maybe gotten put, held back a little bit. So maybe the timing was off. I guess when you think about the huge pricing that you're pushing through and volumes that you're seeing now, but also the higher costs, I guess, how should we think about that as still kind of a longer term target. Has the bogey changed at all? Is it either a little bit lower just given everything so inflationary? Is it a little bit higher because the pricing goes up? And maybe eventually the raw is stabilized? Like I guess how should we be thinking about that?\nFrank Sullivan: Great question. And we still very much have in mind a 16% EBIT margin to get there. We're going to have to drive gross margins on a consolidated basis towards 42%. And we have a lot of work to do there. Having said that, we anticipate this spring that you will see a return to record margins in our Construction Products Group and our Performance Coatings Group, you'll see good progress in our Specialty Products Group. And the area, again, that has had this most significant margin deterioration, roughly half of which has been a cost price mix issue. And the other half of which has been just the incredible disruption to production throughput is in the consumer group. And that a part of our business is getting a lot of attention.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. Thanks very much for the call. Frank.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi of Baird.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Ghansham\nGhansham Panjabi: Good morning. Morning, Frank, Happy New Year to you, as well. On the Construction Products Group, just in terms of the regional breakdown that you cited in your press release, you pointed towards Europe being relatively flat and fairly strength in North America. Can you just give us a little bit more color in terms of what specifically is going on in Europe? Is that just deferred sort of activity and how you see that evolving as the year unfolds calendar year?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So a couple things going on in Europe. Number one over the last two years, we have been intensely focused on margin improvement there even to the extent of shedding some lower margin business deliberately. And so there has been a focus on profitability because the profit levels in our European construction products group are not up to where we are in North America or for that matter in Latin America. And then the other issue is I think that the reaction to this new surge in every case to the surges of Coronavirus have caused more market and customer facing disruptions, which is inhibited some of the growth there versus what we're seeing in North America. I think our experience mirrors the headlines, which is the U.S. economy has been growing through the Coronavirus circumstances in calendar 21 quite well. And that has not been as true in Europe.\nGhansham Panjabi: Got it. And the 100 million in lost sales specific to consumer for 2Q that you call that if I if I read that correctly, that that would imply quite an increase of, quite a bit an increase of 40% relative to the 2Q fiscal year 20 baseline. Can you just give us a bit more color on the bridge between the two periods? And pricing is a piece of that, obviously volume and share gains. But, how should we think about the sustainability of that that improvement? It seems like a very large number.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. And I'll turn that over to Rusty. I think he can give you the balance between broadly, I think it was more like 200 million. And the bigger chunk of that is consumer. Rusty, do you want to add some color to that?\nRusty Gordon: Sure. Yes. Ghansham, in the second quarter, consumer sales are down 18 million, but like we said, the sales could have been 100 million or maybe more higher had it not been for supply chain disruptions. In terms of price increases, they are going through the third round of price increases here in Q3, but they have had two significant price increases in the fall and spring, that's contributing to that. The market is still good. We're just losing out on opportunity temporarily, to meet the extraordinary demand that's out there. We think that will come back to us through the revenue line as we increase capacity as supply chain disruptions settle down. You know, there's a lot of reasons why the business long term looks fantastic. They are well positioned, they have great market share, and market leading brands. But temporarily, they faced the most acute situation due to the alkyd resin supplier outage last spring. And that's why they're suffering more on the lost sales.\nFrank Sullivan: I will add to that. It's our anticipation that the resin availability issue will be back to normal sometime this spring. And the plant that we acquired in September is going to supply probably 30% of our previously purchased alkyd resin production. So that's been a big help for us as we ramped that up. And we would anticipate fourth quarter that looks good across all four of our segments.\nGhansham Panjabi: Thanks so much, Frank and Rusty.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne of Bank of America.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Steve\nSteve Byrne: Morning Frank. Perhaps you can help us better understand the differential performance between consumer product or construction and Performance Coatings; you had higher organic growth in the construction products, which your EBIT performance was so much stronger in Performance Coatings. Was there was there just more of the price you referenced the 7.5% kind of price up was, was that much higher than that in Performance Coatings or was there something was it was just a maybe less of a raw material cost drag in that segment. Help us better understand how we how we can look at going forward from here.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So the Performance Coatings Group lagged some of the map to growth, strong performance and other parts of RPM because of some cyclical challenges, particularly in the oil and gas industry, as you'll recall. So part of the stronger performance in our Performance Coatings Group is easier comparison to prior year periods and their underlying execution in math to growth was as good as anywhere else. It was just muted by top line challenges. With a top line growing again you're seeing a an extra boost as the map to growth benefits in the Performance Coatings Group are being started and are starting to be realized, as our revenues are growing again, particularly in relationship to the recovery in some of the more cyclical oil and gas and industrial capital spending markets, the Performance Coatings Group serves. That's the first part. Construction products has really been showing strength on strength. While we've lost a little margin there in the last couple of quarters, and you'll see that turnaround in Q3, we are generating really strong performance on what were prior period record results. We are well positioned in product categories in general. And in certain instances, the COVID disruptions are actually helping us whether that's in the Nudura build out which we expect to have expanded capacity by the end of the summer, or whether it's the roof restoration coatings. The other thing I'll say about both Stonhard and in flooring and our Tremco roofing division is that both cases were uniquely a supply and apply house. And so while labor issues are a challenge everywhere, including in the construction markets, our ability with dedicated crews to provide installations where perhaps others can't as also helped us.\nSteve Byrne: Thank you for that. And wanted to ask a little bit about this plant that you acquired back in September in the last quarter was referred to as a Tremco purchase. And so is the alkyd resins being produced at this plant, will that only be through that only flow through construction products? Or will consumer benefit from that and what other, what other chemistries are you likely to pursue at this facility down the road?\nFrank Sullivan: So that's a great question. And we'll keep that in mind and have a better answer for you in our April conference call broadly. It is part of our Construction Products Group because we are making various intermediate chemicals for numerous RPM companies. It's also in our Construction Product Group. Because as you know, from an RPM perspective, there are no RPM owned and operated plants. Our plants are owned and operated by our subsidiaries. And so we had to choose a subsidiary that was in a good position, both from a operations leadership perspective, and the ability to coordinate throughout RPM. And our performance, I'm sorry our Construction Products Group was the right home for that business. Initially, the biggest chunk of focus is producing alkyd resins for our consumer group. But we expect strong resin supply and other unique intermediate chemical supplies for other RPM companies. And I'll have a better answer in more detail for you in April.\nSteve Byrne: Very good. Thank you, Frank.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley.\nVincent Andrews: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Can we just talk maybe about SGA a little bit. It\u2019s up about $60 million year-to-date. I know you called out in the release that there's higher incentive compensation this year. But we have other buckets that have caused that increase? And should we be annualising that year-to-date increase for the entire fiscal year?\nFrank Sullivan: Rusty, you want to handle that with some detail?\nRusty Gordon: Sure, I'd be happy to have one of the main sources of increase year-over-year is commissions. We are increasing sales rapidly and some of our higher commission Construction and Industrial product line areas Vincent. So commissions is a big chunk of that. TNE is back, I wouldn't say anywhere close to back, maybe it's getting close to halfway back to what it used to be. But TNE you know, basically was zeroed out last year, we've also added some modest SG&A from acquisitions. We have, of course pay increases, and some growth initiatives that we're pursuing at specialty products and a lot of Construction Products Group as well. So those are the main sources for that.\nVincent Andrews: Okay, and then just in the non-consumer segments, there were some call outs about some of the revenue that was deferred during the heart of the pandemic, coming back now, which is obviously great. I just want to make sure that we're thinking about the go-forward properly, are these new base levels of revenue growth that you can grow off of, or should we be thinking about having difficult comparisons maybe a year from now because just as last year's revenue was understated, because revenue is being deferred. Is this year's revenue a little overstated because you made some of that up? Or how should we think about that continuum?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure, I think we'll have some difficult comparisons. So I don't know how likely we are to be showing the 8% or 10% unit volume growth in the 20% revenue growth and growing, but certainly for the next couple of quarters, you'll see out of the non-consumer segments, which you referenced, the same type of strength that we've seen that with better leverage the bottom line. And in general, we are in construction products, it's new product categories. I think there's more growth to come out of Europe, once we get the margin profile where we want it. I think the categories like Nudura, the roof restoration coatings, some of the potential there is being quite candidly impacted by capacity, which we're addressing and should have fully addressed in both cases by the end of the summer. So there's really good strength there. And I don't anticipate anything but positive sales and earnings growth as we get into fiscal 2023 that starts in June. The big recovery in terms of year-over-year performance not surprisingly, will come out of our consumer group because we anticipate finally addressing some of these supply disruptions and COVID disruptions by the spring through our fourth quarter. And as we get into next year, hopefully you'll be seeing better flow through improved supply chains and in that case, pretty significantly disrupted performance results in the quarters in fiscal 22 and consumer.\nVincent Andrews: Makes sense. Thanks very much.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy of Vertical Research.\nKevin McCarthy: Good morning and Happy New Year to you. Frank with Specialty Products segment had been tracking quite well under new management, but margins came in a little bit less than we would have expected this quarter. In your commentary, you said it a number of different issues in terms of investments, conversion costs, I mean, chips, legal, etcetera. Can you give us a feel for how many of those issues might persist in the third quarter of beyond versus, other ones that could be fleeting? And more broadly, when do you think you might start to compare positively on the segment margin and specialty?\nFrank Sullivan: I think that we have a good shot. First of all like you'll see performance in Q3. And we have a good shot at seeing not only sales growth, but you know, EBIT year-over-year looking positive. The biggest challenge there as Rusty and Mike have alluded to is in our legend brands business. That is a business that is a leader in restoration equipment, dehumidification equipment, air filtering equipment, air moving in high performance fans, and from 10 years ago, where this was all manual equipment, this is all stuff for industrial and commercial settings that can be run off your iPhone. They have significantly more sophistication in terms of boards and chips, and we can't get them. And that's a business that didn't run on a big backlog and now has a $40 million or $50 million backlog. We haven't lost market share. And we hope to see that being resolved. Performance in Q3 will look better or worse based on that one business units ability to get supply. Back to an earlier question, and this is the most extreme example. But it's true in other parts of RPM about inventory. We typically don't operate with much whip work in process. And we got a ton of whip at our legends brands business because we have bought all the steel and all the components to put together all of this equipment. And we literally have a fair amount of inventory sitting waiting for chips, which once installed, kind of like the challenges in the automotive industry should lead to significant improvements in revenues and earnings.\nKevin McCarthy: I see that that's good to know. And secondly, Frank, you've talked in the past about potential map 2.0 program. What are your latest thoughts on timing and potential savings continue to flush that out.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. A year ago, we had hoped to be in a position to provide some details now. I think it now appears that that's more likely to be this summer so we'll get through this fiscal year. I think, we anticipate a return to more normal see across all our businesses in Q4. And so, we'll have a better base of business and more normal flow through. And hopefully the Omicron surge is kind of the beginning of the end for COVID. That would be a nice new year gift to the world. So we have been continuing to work on that. As I commented earlier to John in all of these question, we are intensely focused on achieving a 60% EBIT margin. All of our businesses know it, we were making great progress there. We're back on track in two of our three businesses already, which is Construction Products and Performance Coatings, and which need to get through these supply disruptions and supply chain challenges. And then we will be providing I hope, this summer, in some detail what a map to grow. 2.0 looks like.\nKevin McCarthy: Great, so much.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Spector of UBS.\nJoshua Spector: Hey, good morning. Good morning. Just a follow up on the last sales and specifically consumer just wanted to get your view there? Do you need a continued supportive demand environment to get those sales back? Or is getting those sales back just an inventory function of customers restocking?\nFrank Sullivan: I think it's a combination of both. When you look at the charts that we supply, we've been relatively I think, good comparison, when you go back to our fiscal 20 results versus where we are in fiscal 22. So we feel like there's an expanded user base because of the pandemic situations. Quite candidly, all you need to do is go to the shelves in our big customers. And it's not only in our categories, it's other categories. But you're looking at fill rates, from one week to the next that are 50% to 70% in an industry and in the case of RPM, where our fill rates have been 99%, 98%. And it's just been a massive chunk of disruption. You know, whether it's having stuff ready and no trucks to pick it up, whether it's being able to produce for three days, but having to pay your workforce, obviously full time because you can't lose people. And it's been, and we were making actually good progress. And we're anticipating a better Q3 than we're forecasting now. And I just provided some of the details on the Coronavirus cases and the operation center consumer group and it's just another unanticipated setback that we will overcome.\nJoshua Spector: Okay, thanks. That's, that's helpful. And if I could just ask on Performance Coatings, I guess two things there first, I mean, you talk about maintenance spending coming back. Can you comment on your backlog in that business? Is it multiple times higher than perhaps you've ran in the past, which gives you visibility there. And then in your slides, you talked about decision support tools, improving Salesforce efficiencies and mix, can you just kind of explain what exactly that is and how that's helping.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So first, on that last comment, and we had commented over the last year or so out of our map to growth program, and it was really not originally a part of it. We had hired a consulting firm, to help a number of our businesses look at their cost, price and mix situation. And it's literally it's not a go raise your prices assessment. It's a better analysis of mix. It\u2019s helped us make decisions like I referenced in Europe, about product lines, that when you look at from a long term basis, you make decisions as to whether or not they're worth our investment, our time and our capacity. And they're also trying to get us to the point where we can utilize a better understanding of mix to proactively and offensively incentive a incentivize our salesforce in the market place, versus just using mix as a retro prospective analysis of performance. And so we're doing a lot of work there. And some of that is looking at commission structures in relationship to product margin profiles and things like that. I guess Rusty had commented and Mike commented earlier, that the billions and trillions of dollars that have been allocated in the United States alone towards infrastructure will benefit our Construction Products Group and Performance Coatings Group. We are well positioned in terms of public and private infrastructure spending. What's going into hospitals, what's going into schools, those are markets that we serve. The on-shoring and technology we continue to be the leader, for instance, in floors for all the major tech companies with static dissipating floors as an example. So the and shoring of a lot of that is leading to upticks in our business. So I think the next couple of years in those two business segments look very bright.\nJoshua Spector: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Jeff\nJeff Zekauskas: Hi, good morning, thanks very much. When you think about the Board's compensation targets for management, it's very difficult to understand whether management is meeting the targets is a little bit behind is the head. Given that there are so many raw material factors and disruption factors? Can you give us a hand and understanding what the board wants from management? And if you're ahead or behind their targets, their based targets?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I guess the specifics; I would direct you to our proxy, where I think we do a pretty good job of outlining in retrospect, for a particular year, what the targets were and what our achievement level were to those targets. We have actually very good discipline in relationship to compensation. We have never repriced options. We did not make specific compensation changes or adjustments in relationship to COVID situations. And so I'd say we have good discipline there and the details outlined in our proxy. The board has used discretion last year and this year in some areas in relationship to making sure that we are focused on market share gains in advancing our businesses. And then also, at least through fiscal 2021, our progress on a relative basis to our peers and our prior year performance in relationship to the map to growth program, which was very effective, but obviously disrupted by COVID and now supply chain issues. Compensation this year will be a tough a tough issue, because like everybody knows everybody's working twice as hard. Everybody's dealing with a VUCA environment, the likes of which nobody's really seen. And the impact and compensation relative to performance won't look particularly great. Because in a number of our businesses, our bottom line targets aren't meeting what our original expectations were, may not be fair, but that's life. And again, I would refer you to the details for past comp to our proxy, and you'll see the same type of detail on the proxy we put out in August of 22.\nJeff Zekauskas: Okay. And secondly, were volumes in the quarter up on a consolidated basis, up low single digit. And if you were on LIFO, instead of FIFO, would your cost of goods sold have been very different?\nFrank Sullivan: Well, I'll have to defer that question to Rusty. I don't know the LIFO, FIFO difference. And again, he can provide maybe the details of Unify and I can tell you in Performance Coatings and construction products, unit volume was high single digits or even at a 10% range. And in some of our specialty products groups, we had good unit volume growth, except for legend brands. And obviously, we've had negative unit volume growth and consumer but Rusty could provide better color, perhaps has an answer for the LIFO FIFO question because I could not.\nRusty Gordon: Okay, well, it's been a while since I cracked open my accounting books, but in a rising cost environment LIFO would generally give you the higher more current costs as compared to FIFO. Mike, is there anything you want to add to that?\nMichael Laroche: No I mean, we haven't done the math on it, but I would agree with what you said.\nJeff Zekauskas: How about volume? How about consolidated volume for the quarter? What was that, was it up a little bit or no?\nRusty Gordon: Yes, it was up low single digit like Frank mentioned.\nJeff Zekauskas: Okay, great. Thank you so much.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning.\nArun Viswanathan: Good morning, Frank, thanks for taking my question. Morning, Rusty as well. Happy New Year to all of you. I guess my question is around the guidance. So if you look at the next quarter, you do expect range for EBIT in that 5% to 15% range down. I guess, when you when you think about the cadence through the year, this is typically your weakest quarter just given winter seasonality. So do you expect that range to kind of improve? Also in light of improving raw material availability, as you move through the year? And set another way, do you expect kind of this, this quarter be the worst as far as supply chain and disruptions and raw material availability?\nFrank Sullivan: I think in general, that's the right way to think about it. Our resin flow for our consumer business is improving. The Texas plant, and we will provide more detail on April, broadly on that, but the Texas plant, ramp up and alkyd resins is helping significantly. And so I think you're going to see improvement in each of our segments. The Specialty Products Group will be particularly related to recovery in our legend brands business or not. And so you'll see -- that's a big part of the swing there. And then the throughput on consumer, I think the biggest variability here that we're not certain about is this Omicron, significant disruption in December, it actually changed what we thought a month or so ago, would be more positive results in consumer to another quarter of declines in EBIT and our consumer segment. You will see for the first time in three quarters positive year-over-year sales, growth and consumer. And if trends continue, and there's no shocks that we don't anticipate, you're going to see a significant improvement across all four segments as we get into the spring.\nArun Viswanathan: Thanks for that. And if I could just go back to the demand question. So as you noted, demand appears relatively robust across many of your verticals. Where would you say demand is the weakest? I guess, and is that -- would you say that you still haven't seen a recovery because of COVID? Or is it? Is it something else? And then, I guess furthermore, as you implement these price increases, is there amongst your customer base, is there a willingness to kind of pass on these price increases to their customers? And is that what is keeping demand so robust? Or do you see any risk of this demand kind of slowing down because of price increases, crowding out that demands? Thanks.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. As we commented earlier, I think our geographically our weakest area performance is in Europe. And, we would hope to see European economies pick up more along the lines of the U.S. In our product categories, we don't see a lot of weakness right now. I do think it will be interesting as we get into calendar 22, throughout this calendar year, the balance between consumer demand and getting a supply chain and inventory levels back to normal, which they're really not close to right now. And so, seeing where that settles out in terms of demand, and consumer is the area where I think we have the least visibility, just because once we can get the supply chain disruptions in place, we should have really strong performance for a period of time if for no other reason to get inventory levels at our customers in our own shop, back to normal levels.\nArun Viswanathan: Great, thank you.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Sison of Wells Fargo.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Michael.\nMichael Sison: Hey guys, Happy New Year. It sounds like the sales momentum will continue into the fourth quarter. Just curious, I know it's early given all the headwinds, but if you think about the potential scenarios for EBIT growth or decline in the fourth quarter, what do you think they are given are they raw material headwinds? The Omicron so on so forth, could be for the fourth, particularly if you have positive sales growth again.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. When you see where our consumer, I'm sorry, where our construction products group is going, where our Performance Coatings Group is going. We see that strength continuing in the second half of fiscal 22. So that strong top line in for the second half, in particular really good leverage to the bottom line. We anticipate but it's literally month to month recovery in our specialty products group and we've talked about legend brands. Our expectation is for recovery consumer nicely in Q4. But we have been providing guidance one quarter at a time because the visibility of what's happening and the impact of disruptions in light of stress supply chains just made it really difficult to forecast forward with much accuracy. But if the current trends of a stabilizing raw material supply base cost wise, improving base chemicals which are moving in the right direction, and if Omicron is kind of the last gasp of COVID, which would sure be a blessing that we should have it bang up fourth quarter. And, and that's, that is easy to calculate if we can get some of the supply chain issues behind us. And we can see a raw material environment that it doesn't even have to be declining. It just needs to stabilize.\nMichael Sison: Got it. And then just on that you mentioned, I think in the slides, or in the opening comments that you're looking to expand your supplier base, can you give us a little bit of color on that what you're doing and how you're doing that to maybe improve availability longer term?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure, we -- I think that notwithstanding the disruptions and supply chains, there's always a battle. The communications with us and our major suppliers have been really good through this whole COVID thing and understanding how to deal through force measures, which are down two thirds where they were in the mid-teens on force measures [Ph] is now across a couple 100 product categories. We were in the 50s plus across five or 600, product categories, so that's improved. So there's been good communication there. There, have been one or two instances where suppliers have acted in circumstances that have broken contracts and very transactionally. And, and so we have opportunities to particularly with a more consolidated procurement activity, to make changes where appropriate. And then the Corsicana, Texas plant also improves our internal production, we don't intend to be a king of any raw material. The area that will probably have the biggest capacity is in that alkyd resins, and sometime this spring, we should be up and running to the tune of 30% of our internal needs. And so those are the areas that we think about when we reference supply.\nMichael Sison: Got it? Thank you.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you, Mike.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison of Seaport Research.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Mike.\nMichael Harrison: Good morning, Happy New Year. Wanting to ask a question about the Pure Air acquisition, you did this back in August, it seems like it's kind of the right product at the right time, as people are starting to return to office buildings, return to other institutions and wanting to be more competent around their indoor air quality. You said in the press release that that was running at a $10 million annual sales rate when you acquired it was wondering if you could talk about where the backlog is for that Pure Air deal, and maybe are Pure Air business, I should say, and where you think you can take sales over the next couple of years?\nFrank Sullivan: So I'd say a great question, I appreciate that you're paying attention to that. Our M&A activity has been successful in the small to medium size range. And the real homeruns are where we can buy a unique business or product line. And through our distribution or sales force or market presence expanded. And I think Pure Air is going to be a great example of that. That's a $10 million or $15 million business that we acquired this year. I would anticipate that in fiscal 2023, we'll do north of 50 million bucks. And if we can expand that, in the coming years to what we believe is possible. That could be $100 million of products and services. That's part of our WTI business. And so, boy, if we can find more and more $10 million or $15 million product lines, that we think 18 or 24 months later, or 40 or 50. And with an upside of 100 million, we're, we would be excited. That's a real winner for us. And that's one example of kind of -- those who have followed RPM and I'll talk about somebody here at the end of the call. For a long time I've seen us evolve from a very decentralized holding company, to what is four groups today. And our construction products group was a collection of very decentralized different businesses, and is now been much more integrated. We're leveraging our sales forces, and that's allowing us to take advantage of product lines like period and really expanded aggressively \nMichael Harrison: Alright, just a quick one on the Specialty Group, I believe you mentioned some legal expenses. Can you give some color on what that entailed and what the magnitude of those expenses were in the quarter?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure, it was related to one of our OEM service providers around furniture coatings and furniture warranties, and a disagreement that's been on-going for a long, long time with a West Coast distributor. And that was resolved with a jury verdict. And I believe in the quarter we took a $2 million charge. Is that right, Rusty?\nRusty Gordon: Yes, that's right.\nMichael Harrison: All right. Thanks very much.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Hocevar of North Coast research.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Kevin.\nKevin Hocevar: Good morning, everybody. Happy New Year. On the supply chain issues, so $200 million headwind in the quarter, I think it was the same headwind in the first quarter. Forgive me if I've missed this, but did you quantify how much you're expecting in the fiscal third quarter? And, what's baked into the sales guidance that you provided?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes, I don't know that we've kind of quantified that. Have we Rusty?\nRusty Gordon: Yes, that's a pretty big range. I mean, if you look at December, Kevin, we\u2019re running at that same pace, of the past two quarters, because of the disruption from Omicron. And the rest of the quarter is a bit of a wildcard simply because typically, in the slow seasonal period for RPM, we can rebuild the pipeline, fill up, store shelves that have been empty during this supply chain mess. And to the extent we're able to do that we might be able to catch up on the previously deferred sales, from the past three quarters. We said 200 million in Q2, 200 million in Q1, 100 million back in the fourth quarter of F '21. So that would be the hope. But so far, December isn't panning out. So I'm not giving you numbers. Kevin, for that reason, it's highly uncertain whether that trend will ship.\nKevin Hocevar: Yes. Yes. Makes sense. And just a quick clarification on the guidance you, you mentioned, high double growth, expectations out of construction products and Performance Coatings in the third quarter. Could you maybe give what that means? Does that mean like high teams? Or if you can maybe give a little bit more color on what you mean by high double digit growth out of those segments?\nFrank Sullivan: Russ, do you want to address the outlook for the quarter?\nRusty Gordon: Sure. Yes. When we say high double digit, we meant high teens so -- Kevin.\nKevin Hocevar: Okay. Yes, that's probably that's just that's what I was looking for. Thank you very much.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli of Gabelli and Company.\nRosemarie Morbelli: Good morning, everyone, and Happy New Year. I was just wondering if PPGs announcement today that they are expanding their relationship with Home Depot would affect your business with Home Depot or they are mostly sticking to propane. And you are not, you are not in that particular side of the business.\nFrank Sullivan: Yes, I have not seen that release this morning, Rosemarie, I will look at it. But we do not compete directly at Home Depot with PPG. They're principally an architectural paint. And they are not actively involved in any direct way in the small project paint or clocks and sealants or patch repair product categories that we are the leaders in. So we will look at that. But as of today, they're principally a architectural paint supplier and a second tier third tier to the bare products.\nRosemarie Morbelli: Okay, and then if I, if I may follow up on that architectural paint, I seem to recall that in the past you have mentioned being eventually interested in that, would it be mostly in terms of buying an architectural paint regional manufacturer, just mostly focusing on one particular niche?\nFrank Sullivan: No, it's really organically grown in relationship to customer inquiries. So we gone from a 500 store test maybe smaller with Walmart and that is expanded to 1500 stores. It's principally a pre color so a, a color product for exterior and interior. And we would hope to be able to see that grow significantly in the spring. But we've had nice trajectory there. And then we have had some e-commerce online architectural paid programs that are in their very initial phases with Menards and with the Home Depot.\nRosemarie Morbelli: Thank you.\nFrank Sullivan: All organic.\nRosemarie Morbelli: Okay, great, thanks.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's Q&A session. I will now turn the call back over to Frank Sullivan. \nFrank Sullivan: Good thank you, Dee. And I think it was fitting that Rosemarie Morbelli had the final question. Almost 30 years of covering RPM and being a champion for us in some periods and challenging us and others. She has had an extraordinary career of being an equity analyst, and a research analyst in the paints and coatings, especially chemical space. And Rosemarie, I want to say heartfelt thank you on behalf of me, of course my father Tom who you knew for many, many years, and all that RPM for good, your good work. And we wish you well and your retirement that was announced last year, and wish you well as you continue Rosemarie Morbelli\u2019s excellent adventure. And I'd like to thank everybody on the call for your participation today. Certainly the environment that we've all operated in in the last two years has been extraordinary. And as I mentioned earlier, supply base analyst base shareholders I think the candid communication and goodwill that has been generated in this period of time has been extraordinary, and it's something we would hope to continue. I wish you all a happy and healthy New Year. And we look forward to updating you on our results and our progress when we meet again next iterate Bruhl investor call. Thank you have a great day. Rosemarie, thank you very much and happy new year to all.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Rusty Gordon",
            "content": "Thanks Mike. Looking ahead to our fiscal 2022 third quarter, we expect that the strong demand for our paints, coatings, sealants, and other building materials will continue. Supply chain challenges and raw material shortages have persisted in December further compounded by disruptions from the Omicron variant on RPMs operations, and those of our supplier base. These factors are expected to put pressure on our top line and productivity. In spite of these challenges, we expect to generate double digit consolidated sales growth in the fiscal 2022 third quarter versus last year's record third quarter sales, which increased 8.1%. We anticipate high double digit sales growth, along with margin accretion in our construction products group and Performance Coatings Group. SPG sales are expected to be up low double digits as compared to last year's third quarter. The consumer group faces a tough comparison to the prior year period when it sales increased 19.8% and as a result, its sales are anticipated to increase by low single digit. Consolidated adjusted EBIT for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 is expected to decrease 5% to 15% versus the same period last year when adjusted EBIT was up 29.7%. We anticipate that earnings will be affected by on-going raw material, freight and wage inflation, as well as the impact of raw material shortages on sales volumes, plus the renewed COVID disruption from the surging Omicron variant. These challenges will disproportionately impact our consumer segment. We continue to work to offset these challenges by implementing price increases, improving operational efficiencies, and bringing on additional manufacturing capacity. Finally, I'd like to note that we remain laser focused on executing our strategies for sustained growth. We remain vigilant about protecting the health of our employees, their families and the communities in which we operate. With the rise in COVID cases worldwide, we remain focused on processes and procedures to maintain safe and productive working environments for our associates. We continue to be agile in our management of the business, allowing us to navigate supply chain issues and meet customer needs. We expect that margins will recover towards pre pandemic levels once supply challenges abate. Lastly, we are investing in employee training and other initiatives that will drive long term growth including operational improvements, innovation, acquisitions, capacity expansions, and information technology. These actions will optimally position RPM to deliver long term growth and increased value for our stakeholders. This concludes our formal comments. We will now be pleased to take your questions. Sure. Yes. Ghansham, in the second quarter, consumer sales are down 18 million, but like we said, the sales could have been 100 million or maybe more higher had it not been for supply chain disruptions. In terms of price increases, they are going through the third round of price increases here in Q3, but they have had two significant price increases in the fall and spring, that's contributing to that. The market is still good. We're just losing out on opportunity temporarily, to meet the extraordinary demand that's out there. We think that will come back to us through the revenue line as we increase capacity as supply chain disruptions settle down. You know, there's a lot of reasons why the business long term looks fantastic. They are well positioned, they have great market share, and market leading brands. But temporarily, they faced the most acute situation due to the alkyd resin supplier outage last spring. And that's why they're suffering more on the lost sales. Sure, I'd be happy to have one of the main sources of increase year-over-year is commissions. We are increasing sales rapidly and some of our higher commission Construction and Industrial product line areas Vincent. So commissions is a big chunk of that. TNE is back, I wouldn't say anywhere close to back, maybe it's getting close to halfway back to what it used to be. But TNE you know, basically was zeroed out last year, we've also added some modest SG&A from acquisitions. We have, of course pay increases, and some growth initiatives that we're pursuing at specialty products and a lot of Construction Products Group as well. So those are the main sources for that. Okay, well, it's been a while since I cracked open my accounting books, but in a rising cost environment LIFO would generally give you the higher more current costs as compared to FIFO. Mike, is there anything you want to add to that? Yes, it was up low single digit like Frank mentioned. Yes, that's right. Yes, that's a pretty big range. I mean, if you look at December, Kevin, we're running at that same pace, of the past two quarters, because of the disruption from Omicron. And the rest of the quarter is a bit of a wildcard simply because typically, in the slow seasonal period for RPM, we can rebuild the pipeline, fill up, store shelves that have been empty during this supply chain mess. And to the extent we're able to do that we might be able to catch up on the previously deferred sales, from the past three quarters. We said 200 million in Q2, 200 million in Q1, 100 million back in the fourth quarter of F '21. So that would be the hope. But so far, December isn't panning out. So I'm not giving you numbers. Kevin, for that reason, it's highly uncertain whether that trend will ship. Sure. Yes. When we say high double digit, we meant high teens so -- Kevin."

            "content": "Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. Turning to the next slide, our construction products group generated all time record sales of $614.2 million. Sales grew 22% for the quarter, the highest rate among our four segments. 90.9% was organic, foreign currency translation provided a 0.3% tailwind, and acquisitions contributed 1.8%. CPGs market leading top line growth and positive mix were primarily driven by innovation and its high performance building solutions, market share gains in strong demand in North America for its construction and maintenance products. The businesses that generated the highest growth included those providing insulated concrete forms, roofing systems, concrete admixture and repair products and commercial sealants  Sales of our Nudura ICS [ph] have been particularly robust because they offer an alternative to lumber which is in short supply and experiencing skyrocketing costs. And because Nudura's ICS provides structural, insulation and labor benefits. Performance in international markets was mixed with Europe fairly flat, while emerging markets showed signs of recovery. The segment's adjusted EBIT increased 16.5% to a record level due to volume growth, operational improvements and selling price increases, which helped offset material inflation. Moving to the next slide, positive trends from the first quarter carried over into the second for our Performance Coatings Group. Sales grew 16.9% to a record level, reflecting organic growth of 12.2% of foreign currency translation tailwind of 0.8% and a 3.9% contribution from acquisitions. Nearly all the PCGs major business units contribute to the positive growth largely due to the catch up of maintenance projects previously deferred by industrial customers, particularly as COVID restrictions relaxed and contractor access to construction sites improved. Sales growth was also facilitated by price increases and improved product mix driven by new decision support tools that helped improve Salesforce efficiencies and product mix. Leading the way were the segment's largest businesses providing polymer flooring systems and corrosion control coatings, serving growing end markets including electric vehicles, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals. Sales also remained strong at its recently acquired Bison raised flooring business and in emerging markets. Adjusted EBIT increased 41.3% to a record level as a result of pricing, volume growth, operational improvements and product mix. Advancing to the next slide, our specialty products group reported a sales increase of 10% to a record level as its businesses capitalize on the strong demand in the outdoor recreation, furniture and OEM markets they serve. The segments fluorescent pigments business also generated good top line growth. Organic sales increased 9%, recent acquisitions added 0.4% and foreign currency translation increased sales by 0.6%. Adjusted EBIT decreased 29.4% due to higher raw material and conversion costs from supply disruptions as well as unfavorable product mix, particularly in our disaster restoration equipment business, which has been hindered by the semiconductor chip shortage as Frank had mentioned. In addition, the segment experienced higher expenses resulting from investment, investments and future growth initiatives plus higher legal expenses. These factors were partially offset by operational improvements. On the next slide, you'll see that the severe raw material shortages that consumer group experienced during the fiscal 2022 first quarter persisted during the second quarter. The resulting production outages negatively impacted segment sales by approximately $100 million. Segment sales decreased 3.3% with organic sales down 3.5% in foreign currency translation up 0.2%. Despite raw material shortages, the segments fiscal 2022 second quarter sales were still 17.4% above the pre pandemic levels of the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Demand for its products remained high and inventories and many of its channels are low. We expect to recover the sales when raw material and supply conditions stabilize. As Rick mentioned in his opening comments, the consumer group also faced a challenging comparison to the prior year period when sales increased 21.4% and adjusted EBIT increased 65.8% due to extraordinarily high demand for its home improvement products during the first phase of the pandemic. Earnings declined during the fiscal 2022 second quarter from inflation on materials, freight and labor, as well as the unfavorable impact of supply shortages on productivity. These factors were partially offset by price increases and operational improvements. The segment continues to add capacity to meet demand and build resiliency in its supply chain to secure the raw materials it requires. In order to meet customer demand, it is using contract manufacturing at higher cost until it can bring new manufacturing capacity online. It is also qualifying new sources for raw materials including our new manufacturing plant in Texas. Now I'll turn the call over to Rusty to discuss our outlook. No I mean, we haven't done the math on it, but I would agree with what you said."

            "name": "Frank Sullivan",
            "content": "Thank you, Dee [ph]. Good morning and Happy New Year. Welcome to the RPM International Inc. investor call for our fiscal 2022 second quarter. Joining me on the call today is Rusty Gordon, our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Mike Laroche, Vice President, Controller, and Chief Accounting Officer. I'll begin by sharing broad commentary on our consolidated performance for the quarter. Mike will provide details on our segment results and Rusty will conclude our formal comments with our outlook for the fiscal 2022 third quarter. Our comments will be on an as adjusted basis and all comparisons are to the second quarter of fiscal 2021 unless otherwise indicated. Please note that we provided a supplemental slide presentation to support our comments on this call. These can be assessed in the presentations and webcasts section of the RPM website at www.rpminc.com. After our formal remarks, we'll be pleased to take your questions. I'll start with comments related to the third slide in the presentation material. For the fiscal 2022 second quarter, consolidated sales increased 10.3% to $1.64 billion driven by continued robust demand for paints, coatings, sealants, and other building materials. This top line performance was slightly ahead of the outlook we provided last quarter. Our second quarter sales growth could have been even stronger, if not for continuing supply chain challenges that limited access to certain raw materials and cost us roughly $200 million of loss to deferred sales in the quarter. Organic sales growth was 8.6%, foreign currency translation provided a tailwind of 0.4%, and acquisitions contributed 1.3%. Adjusted EPS was $0.79 decreasing 26% compared to the strong adjusted diluted EPS growth of nearly 40% in the prior-year period. Consolidated adjusted EBIT for the quarter was $157.3 million, a decrease of 21%, which was in line with our outlook and was a result of continued material, wage, and freight inflation, as well as supply chain disruptions that were exacerbated by Hurricane Ida at the beginning of the second quarter, and increased our conversion costs. Because of this supply disruption, we lost the equivalent of nearly 300 production days across RPM facilities globally during the second quarter, which was similar to our lost production days in the first quarter. We partially offset these challenges with price increases, which average in the high single digits across RPM, and continued operational improvements from our map to growth program which provided $19 million in incremental cost savings. It's also worth noting that we faced a difficult comparison to the prior year when consolidated adjusted EBIT increased nearly 30%, largely due to higher sales volumes driven by extraordinary demand for our home improvement products in our consumer group during the pandemic. To recover lost margin from in place inflation we are implementing an additional round of price increases this quarter across our business segments as appropriate. In many instances, this will be the third round of price increases in a 12-month period. The next slide provides high level results by segment. Much like last quarter, our performance reflects the benefits of our balanced business portfolio, where softness in one segment is generally offset by strength in others. During the second quarter of fiscal 2022, three of our four operating segments Construction Products Group, Performance Coatings Group, and Specialty Products Group generated strong double digit sales growth. Combined sales in these three segments increased more than 18% with roughly 10% being unit volume growth year-over-year. While our Construction Products and Performance Coating Group generated strong adjusted EBIT growth, the Specialty Products and Consumer group faced extreme supply chain constraints that put pressure on their earnings. In particular, the Specialty Products Group restoration equipment business was affected by worldwide semiconductor chip shortages that delayed sales to a growing backlog and unfavorably drove product mix. The consumer group continued to experience inflationary pressures, as well as shortages of key raw materials driven largely by last year's production outage at a key resin supplier that negatively impacted conversion costs. In addition, the consumer group faced a difficult comparison to the prior year period when sales increased more than 21% and adjusted EBIT was up 66%. These growth rates in the prior year period were largely due to the extraordinary DIY demand during the pandemic. All indicators suggest that the underlying demand for our consumer products remain strong and is continuing to grow in our third quarter. Before we move to the details on our segment results, I'd like to touch on two larger trends that RPM is well positioned to capitalize on. First as you know, the U.S. government has passed a number of bills over the last two years that would direct billions and potentially trillions of dollars towards construction in infrastructure-end markets. Based on our strong position with these markets with well recognized, highly regarded brands such as Tremco roofing systems and commercial sealants, Carboline corrosion-control coatings, Euclid concrete admixtures, and Nudura insulated concrete forms all of which have been gaining market share in this fiscal year. We are well positioned for continuing meaningful growth in North America and globally. Two years ago, we introduced the tagline, building a better world in a number of our communications. It certainly represents our products and services, which literally contribute to making structures better through beautification protection, restoration, and sustainability. But it's also meant to be aspirational as we strive to make the world a better place for those we serve, including our customers, entrepreneurs, associates, shareholders in the communities in which we operate. As we all continue to manage the global pandemic, we remain focused on coming together to make the world a better place for everyone. There are many examples where RPM is doing so. Some of the ways RPM is building a better world include the development of sustainable products such as our AlphaGuard Liquid Applied Roofing products, which are gaining market share and allow roofs to be restored and eliminate the need for tear-off replacement and significant contributions to waste sites. In addition, our Tremco roofing business has been named a BioPreferred Program Pioneer by the USDA because of our early adoption of sustainable product solutions within our roofing division and the industry. Talent Development, which includes the right [ph] education and training initiative that is part of our WTI business and was developed in response to the shortage of qualified roofers includes an element called ELEVATE. This involves training of incarcerated individuals in roofing so that they have skills and job opportunities upon their release, at which time they are guaranteed a job at our Tremco roofing business, and sustainability practices across our operations such as initiatives to reduce water usage that are saving millions of gallons a year to Day-Glow, Rust-Oleum and other businesses. You can learn more about how RPM is building a better world on our website and in our ESG report at www dot rpminc.com/esg. We have a great story to tell and we will be organized to tell it better in the coming quarters and years. We remain focused on long term growth and despite COVID related challenges, especially in supply chains continue to invest in initiatives that will drive our business forward in the coming years. This includes operational improvements development of innovative new products, acquisitions, and manufacturing capacity expansions. A case in point is the 178,000 square foot plant we purchased in September, which is located on 120 acres in Texas. This will serve as a manufacturing center of excellence for multiple RPM businesses. In just two months, it is already improving the resiliency of our supply chain and fill rates. During the second quarter, we began production of alkyd resins which are important raw material for a number of our products, particularly in our consumer group. In the coming quarters the plant expansion, expanding production of a number of our high growth product lines. I'll now turn the call over to Mike to discuss our segment financial results in more detail. Good morning, Frank. Sure. In the second quarter, on a consolidated basis price was up 7.5%. And with the price that's already been announced and enacted in fiscal 22, we expect price to have an 11.5% impact in Q3. Our raw materials are up pretty significantly in terms of where we are year-over-year. We're up about 30% in total. We're up 40% to 50% on our top 20 raw materials, we're up in a couple categories year-over-year like epoxy resins, alkyd resins, over 100%. And so that's some of the color you're seeing. I can tell you in general that the supply chain situation is still very stressed, but as we sit here today, it seems to be improving. Feedstocks are improving, although we're not seeing that yet translated into the intermediates and specialties which we buy, availability of raw materials is improving in most -- in most areas. But I will tell you, the whole supply chain is still very susceptible to unexpected shocks, so it doesn't seem to be much pushing our resiliency in this improving environment. The last comment I'll make on that is freight is a kind of uniquely growing problem. Freight costs have been rising across all categories as we have commented in the past, particularly for truck transportation and most probably related to COVID infections or quarantines. Literally, the availability of freight to move goods has become a challenge in the first part of Q3. Sure, well, I can, I can assure you that our inventory levels are lower than they normally would be and provide tons of examples, but our fill rates are not at the 98%, 99% levels that have been the norm for decades. And there is a meaningful backlog in consumer. So, the supply chains there are very tight on the finished goods side. In most of our product categories, the hundreds of millions of dollars per quarter that were missing in revenue is in part due to supply chain disruptions in our ability, production wise just to get products out. And so, I don't think there's much cushion Frank in the inventory of our customer base, and we are working hard to get some cushion back in there. And I suspect our customers would appreciate getting back to normal levels, but we've had to defer revenues across multiple businesses and product lines because of the supply chain and production disruptions. Thank you. Sure. Yes, I appreciate your comments broadly. We anticipate in Q3 continuing really strong growth in our construction products group and Performance Coatings Group, including a return to some meaningful margin improvement, so you'll see nice leverage to the bottom line there as we've managed cost price mix in those businesses and continue to take market share. You'll see improvement in our specialty segment. And I think as we sit here today, unless the COVID Omicron disruptions continue to get worse, we anticipate although the quarter is not over that it will be the first quarter in three where you'll have all four of our segments positive from a revenue perspective. The consumer group is the principal challenge in Q3 will be nicely positive in terms of EBIT across all our other businesses. And it's really related to a couple things. It is related to alkyd resins, our primary supplier, as you know, had an outage that negatively impacted us. We've been scrambling both in terms of getting product and then also outsourcing production. That's been an 18 month issue that we're working to resolve and we'll start making headway this spring. We are packaging intensive, not only within RPM, but within the consumer paint industry, within RPMs consumer group. We are small project paints, we are a small project passion repair, we are clocks and sealants. So packaging has been both a disproportionally bigger challenge in terms of cost and also in terms of the availability, I think the last straw to drop there is an anticipation of another significant increase this spring in tinplate costs, which will impact metal packaging across the whole industry. Last comment I'll make is that we've had significant COVID disruptions within our consumer group. And I can give you just some statistics. Broadly speaking, this is what the world is seeing. First, from a corporate campus of 100 people, we had 20 cases over the 18 month period of March 2020. through November, on our corporate campus. We've had 14 cases in the last two weeks. And most of those have been breakthrough. And most of those as far as we can tell, have been at home. In our consumer segment, we had 108 cases in our operations alone, that's manufacturing and distribution sites. Over the last six months, we've had 97 cases in December. And so those are also disproportionately happening because we're pretty intensive in distribution, and manufacturing and consumer, freights been another issue. So sorry, for the long litany of challenges, we're going to be positive in terms of sales growth year-over-year and consumer for the first time in three quarters. And you're going to see significantly better resin flow, as we continue to ramp up the Texas facility that we acquired in September that's going as well or better than we anticipated. Great question. And we still very much have in mind a 16% EBIT margin to get there. We're going to have to drive gross margins on a consolidated basis towards 42%. And we have a lot of work to do there. Having said that, we anticipate this spring that you will see a return to record margins in our Construction Products Group and our Performance Coatings Group, you'll see good progress in our Specialty Products Group. And the area, again, that has had this most significant margin deterioration, roughly half of which has been a cost price mix issue. And the other half of which has been just the incredible disruption to production throughput is in the consumer group. And that a part of our business is getting a lot of attention. Thank you. Good morning, Ghansham Sure. So a couple things going on in Europe. Number one over the last two years, we have been intensely focused on margin improvement there even to the extent of shedding some lower margin business deliberately. And so there has been a focus on profitability because the profit levels in our European construction products group are not up to where we are in North America or for that matter in Latin America. And then the other issue is I think that the reaction to this new surge in every case to the surges of Coronavirus have caused more market and customer facing disruptions, which is inhibited some of the growth there versus what we're seeing in North America. I think our experience mirrors the headlines, which is the U.S. economy has been growing through the Coronavirus circumstances in calendar 21 quite well. And that has not been as true in Europe. Sure. And I'll turn that over to Rusty. I think he can give you the balance between broadly, I think it was more like 200 million. And the bigger chunk of that is consumer. Rusty, do you want to add some color to that? I will add to that. It's our anticipation that the resin availability issue will be back to normal sometime this spring. And the plant that we acquired in September is going to supply probably 30% of our previously purchased alkyd resin production. So that's been a big help for us as we ramped that up. And we would anticipate fourth quarter that looks good across all four of our segments. Thank you. Good morning, Steve Sure. So the Performance Coatings Group lagged some of the map to growth, strong performance and other parts of RPM because of some cyclical challenges, particularly in the oil and gas industry, as you'll recall. So part of the stronger performance in our Performance Coatings Group is easier comparison to prior year periods and their underlying execution in math to growth was as good as anywhere else. It was just muted by top line challenges. With a top line growing again you're seeing a an extra boost as the map to growth benefits in the Performance Coatings Group are being started and are starting to be realized, as our revenues are growing again, particularly in relationship to the recovery in some of the more cyclical oil and gas and industrial capital spending markets, the Performance Coatings Group serves. That's the first part. Construction products has really been showing strength on strength. While we've lost a little margin there in the last couple of quarters, and you'll see that turnaround in Q3, we are generating really strong performance on what were prior period record results. We are well positioned in product categories in general. And in certain instances, the COVID disruptions are actually helping us whether that's in the Nudura build out which we expect to have expanded capacity by the end of the summer, or whether it's the roof restoration coatings. The other thing I'll say about both Stonhard and in flooring and our Tremco roofing division is that both cases were uniquely a supply and apply house. And so while labor issues are a challenge everywhere, including in the construction markets, our ability with dedicated crews to provide installations where perhaps others can't as also helped us. So that's a great question. And we'll keep that in mind and have a better answer for you in our April conference call broadly. It is part of our Construction Products Group because we are making various intermediate chemicals for numerous RPM companies. It's also in our Construction Product Group. Because as you know, from an RPM perspective, there are no RPM owned and operated plants. Our plants are owned and operated by our subsidiaries. And so we had to choose a subsidiary that was in a good position, both from a operations leadership perspective, and the ability to coordinate throughout RPM. And our performance, I'm sorry our Construction Products Group was the right home for that business. Initially, the biggest chunk of focus is producing alkyd resins for our consumer group. But we expect strong resin supply and other unique intermediate chemical supplies for other RPM companies. And I'll have a better answer in more detail for you in April. Thank you. Rusty, you want to handle that with some detail? Sure, I think we'll have some difficult comparisons. So I don't know how likely we are to be showing the 8% or 10% unit volume growth in the 20% revenue growth and growing, but certainly for the next couple of quarters, you'll see out of the non-consumer segments, which you referenced, the same type of strength that we've seen that with better leverage the bottom line. And in general, we are in construction products, it's new product categories. I think there's more growth to come out of Europe, once we get the margin profile where we want it. I think the categories like Nudura, the roof restoration coatings, some of the potential there is being quite candidly impacted by capacity, which we're addressing and should have fully addressed in both cases by the end of the summer. So there's really good strength there. And I don't anticipate anything but positive sales and earnings growth as we get into fiscal 2023 that starts in June. The big recovery in terms of year-over-year performance not surprisingly, will come out of our consumer group because we anticipate finally addressing some of these supply disruptions and COVID disruptions by the spring through our fourth quarter. And as we get into next year, hopefully you'll be seeing better flow through improved supply chains and in that case, pretty significantly disrupted performance results in the quarters in fiscal 22 and consumer. Thank you. I think that we have a good shot. First of all like you'll see performance in Q3. And we have a good shot at seeing not only sales growth, but you know, EBIT year-over-year looking positive. The biggest challenge there as Rusty and Mike have alluded to is in our legend brands business. That is a business that is a leader in restoration equipment, dehumidification equipment, air filtering equipment, air moving in high performance fans, and from 10 years ago, where this was all manual equipment, this is all stuff for industrial and commercial settings that can be run off your iPhone. They have significantly more sophistication in terms of boards and chips, and we can't get them. And that's a business that didn't run on a big backlog and now has a $40 million or $50 million backlog. We haven't lost market share. And we hope to see that being resolved. Performance in Q3 will look better or worse based on that one business units ability to get supply. Back to an earlier question, and this is the most extreme example. But it's true in other parts of RPM about inventory. We typically don't operate with much whip work in process. And we got a ton of whip at our legends brands business because we have bought all the steel and all the components to put together all of this equipment. And we literally have a fair amount of inventory sitting waiting for chips, which once installed, kind of like the challenges in the automotive industry should lead to significant improvements in revenues and earnings. Sure. A year ago, we had hoped to be in a position to provide some details now. I think it now appears that that's more likely to be this summer so we'll get through this fiscal year. I think, we anticipate a return to more normal see across all our businesses in Q4. And so, we'll have a better base of business and more normal flow through. And hopefully the Omicron surge is kind of the beginning of the end for COVID. That would be a nice new year gift to the world. So we have been continuing to work on that. As I commented earlier to John in all of these question, we are intensely focused on achieving a 60% EBIT margin. All of our businesses know it, we were making great progress there. We're back on track in two of our three businesses already, which is Construction Products and Performance Coatings, and which need to get through these supply disruptions and supply chain challenges. And then we will be providing I hope, this summer, in some detail what a map to grow. 2.0 looks like. Thank you. I think it's a combination of both. When you look at the charts that we supply, we've been relatively I think, good comparison, when you go back to our fiscal 20 results versus where we are in fiscal 22. So we feel like there's an expanded user base because of the pandemic situations. Quite candidly, all you need to do is go to the shelves in our big customers. And it's not only in our categories, it's other categories. But you're looking at fill rates, from one week to the next that are 50% to 70% in an industry and in the case of RPM, where our fill rates have been 99%, 98%. And it's just been a massive chunk of disruption. You know, whether it's having stuff ready and no trucks to pick it up, whether it's being able to produce for three days, but having to pay your workforce, obviously full time because you can't lose people. And it's been, and we were making actually good progress. And we're anticipating a better Q3 than we're forecasting now. And I just provided some of the details on the Coronavirus cases and the operation center consumer group and it's just another unanticipated setback that we will overcome. Sure. So first, on that last comment, and we had commented over the last year or so out of our map to growth program, and it was really not originally a part of it. We had hired a consulting firm, to help a number of our businesses look at their cost, price and mix situation. And it's literally it's not a go raise your prices assessment. It's a better analysis of mix. It's helped us make decisions like I referenced in Europe, about product lines, that when you look at from a long term basis, you make decisions as to whether or not they're worth our investment, our time and our capacity. And they're also trying to get us to the point where we can utilize a better understanding of mix to proactively and offensively incentive a incentivize our salesforce in the market place, versus just using mix as a retro prospective analysis of performance. And so we're doing a lot of work there. And some of that is looking at commission structures in relationship to product margin profiles and things like that. I guess Rusty had commented and Mike commented earlier, that the billions and trillions of dollars that have been allocated in the United States alone towards infrastructure will benefit our Construction Products Group and Performance Coatings Group. We are well positioned in terms of public and private infrastructure spending. What's going into hospitals, what's going into schools, those are markets that we serve. The on-shoring and technology we continue to be the leader, for instance, in floors for all the major tech companies with static dissipating floors as an example. So the and shoring of a lot of that is leading to upticks in our business. So I think the next couple of years in those two business segments look very bright. Good morning, Jeff Sure. I guess the specifics; I would direct you to our proxy, where I think we do a pretty good job of outlining in retrospect, for a particular year, what the targets were and what our achievement level were to those targets. We have actually very good discipline in relationship to compensation. We have never repriced options. We did not make specific compensation changes or adjustments in relationship to COVID situations. And so I'd say we have good discipline there and the details outlined in our proxy. The board has used discretion last year and this year in some areas in relationship to making sure that we are focused on market share gains in advancing our businesses. And then also, at least through fiscal 2021, our progress on a relative basis to our peers and our prior year performance in relationship to the map to growth program, which was very effective, but obviously disrupted by COVID and now supply chain issues. Compensation this year will be a tough a tough issue, because like everybody knows everybody's working twice as hard. Everybody's dealing with a VUCA environment, the likes of which nobody's really seen. And the impact and compensation relative to performance won't look particularly great. Because in a number of our businesses, our bottom line targets aren't meeting what our original expectations were, may not be fair, but that's life. And again, I would refer you to the details for past comp to our proxy, and you'll see the same type of detail on the proxy we put out in August of 22. Well, I'll have to defer that question to Rusty. I don't know the LIFO, FIFO difference. And again, he can provide maybe the details of Unify and I can tell you in Performance Coatings and construction products, unit volume was high single digits or even at a 10% range. And in some of our specialty products groups, we had good unit volume growth, except for legend brands. And obviously, we've had negative unit volume growth and consumer but Rusty could provide better color, perhaps has an answer for the LIFO FIFO question because I could not. Thank you. Good morning. I think in general, that's the right way to think about it. Our resin flow for our consumer business is improving. The Texas plant, and we will provide more detail on April, broadly on that, but the Texas plant, ramp up and alkyd resins is helping significantly. And so I think you're going to see improvement in each of our segments. The Specialty Products Group will be particularly related to recovery in our legend brands business or not. And so you'll see -- that's a big part of the swing there. And then the throughput on consumer, I think the biggest variability here that we're not certain about is this Omicron, significant disruption in December, it actually changed what we thought a month or so ago, would be more positive results in consumer to another quarter of declines in EBIT and our consumer segment. You will see for the first time in three quarters positive year-over-year sales, growth and consumer. And if trends continue, and there's no shocks that we don't anticipate, you're going to see a significant improvement across all four segments as we get into the spring. Sure. As we commented earlier, I think our geographically our weakest area performance is in Europe. And, we would hope to see European economies pick up more along the lines of the U.S. In our product categories, we don't see a lot of weakness right now. I do think it will be interesting as we get into calendar 22, throughout this calendar year, the balance between consumer demand and getting a supply chain and inventory levels back to normal, which they're really not close to right now. And so, seeing where that settles out in terms of demand, and consumer is the area where I think we have the least visibility, just because once we can get the supply chain disruptions in place, we should have really strong performance for a period of time if for no other reason to get inventory levels at our customers in our own shop, back to normal levels. Thank you. Good morning, Michael. Sure. When you see where our consumer, I'm sorry, where our construction products group is going, where our Performance Coatings Group is going. We see that strength continuing in the second half of fiscal 22. So that strong top line in for the second half, in particular really good leverage to the bottom line. We anticipate but it's literally month to month recovery in our specialty products group and we've talked about legend brands. Our expectation is for recovery consumer nicely in Q4. But we have been providing guidance one quarter at a time because the visibility of what's happening and the impact of disruptions in light of stress supply chains just made it really difficult to forecast forward with much accuracy. But if the current trends of a stabilizing raw material supply base cost wise, improving base chemicals which are moving in the right direction, and if Omicron is kind of the last gasp of COVID, which would sure be a blessing that we should have it bang up fourth quarter. And, and that's, that is easy to calculate if we can get some of the supply chain issues behind us. And we can see a raw material environment that it doesn't even have to be declining. It just needs to stabilize. Sure, we -- I think that notwithstanding the disruptions and supply chains, there's always a battle. The communications with us and our major suppliers have been really good through this whole COVID thing and understanding how to deal through force measures, which are down two thirds where they were in the mid-teens on force measures [Ph] is now across a couple 100 product categories. We were in the 50s plus across five or 600, product categories, so that's improved. So there's been good communication there. There, have been one or two instances where suppliers have acted in circumstances that have broken contracts and very transactionally. And, and so we have opportunities to particularly with a more consolidated procurement activity, to make changes where appropriate. And then the Corsicana, Texas plant also improves our internal production, we don't intend to be a king of any raw material. The area that will probably have the biggest capacity is in that alkyd resins, and sometime this spring, we should be up and running to the tune of 30% of our internal needs. And so those are the areas that we think about when we reference supply. Thank you, Mike. Good morning, Mike. So I'd say a great question, I appreciate that you're paying attention to that. Our M&A activity has been successful in the small to medium size range. And the real homeruns are where we can buy a unique business or product line. And through our distribution or sales force or market presence expanded. And I think Pure Air is going to be a great example of that. That's a $10 million or $15 million business that we acquired this year. I would anticipate that in fiscal 2023, we'll do north of 50 million bucks. And if we can expand that, in the coming years to what we believe is possible. That could be $100 million of products and services. That's part of our WTI business. And so, boy, if we can find more and more $10 million or $15 million product lines, that we think 18 or 24 months later, or 40 or 50. And with an upside of 100 million, we're, we would be excited. That's a real winner for us. And that's one example of kind of -- those who have followed RPM and I'll talk about somebody here at the end of the call. For a long time I've seen us evolve from a very decentralized holding company, to what is four groups today. And our construction products group was a collection of very decentralized different businesses, and is now been much more integrated. We're leveraging our sales forces, and that's allowing us to take advantage of product lines like period and really expanded aggressively Sure, it was related to one of our OEM service providers around furniture coatings and furniture warranties, and a disagreement that's been on-going for a long, long time with a West Coast distributor. And that was resolved with a jury verdict. And I believe in the quarter we took a $2 million charge. Is that right, Rusty? Thank you. Good morning, Kevin. Yes, I don't know that we've kind of quantified that. Have we Rusty? Russ, do you want to address the outlook for the quarter? Thank you. Yes, I have not seen that release this morning, Rosemarie, I will look at it. But we do not compete directly at Home Depot with PPG. They're principally an architectural paint. And they are not actively involved in any direct way in the small project paint or clocks and sealants or patch repair product categories that we are the leaders in. So we will look at that. But as of today, they're principally a architectural paint supplier and a second tier third tier to the bare products. No, it's really organically grown in relationship to customer inquiries. So we gone from a 500 store test maybe smaller with Walmart and that is expanded to 1500 stores. It's principally a pre color so a, a color product for exterior and interior. And we would hope to be able to see that grow significantly in the spring. But we've had nice trajectory there. And then we have had some e-commerce online architectural paid programs that are in their very initial phases with Menards and with the Home Depot. All organic. Thank you. Good thank you, Dee. And I think it was fitting that Rosemarie Morbelli had the final question. Almost 30 years of covering RPM and being a champion for us in some periods and challenging us and others. She has had an extraordinary career of being an equity analyst, and a research analyst in the paints and coatings, especially chemical space. And Rosemarie, I want to say heartfelt thank you on behalf of me, of course my father Tom who you knew for many, many years, and all that RPM for good, your good work. And we wish you well and your retirement that was announced last year, and wish you well as you continue Rosemarie Morbelli's excellent adventure. And I'd like to thank everybody on the call for your participation today. Certainly the environment that we've all operated in in the last two years has been extraordinary. And as I mentioned earlier, supply base analyst base shareholders I think the candid communication and goodwill that has been generated in this period of time has been extraordinary, and it's something we would hope to continue. I wish you all a happy and healthy New Year. And we look forward to updating you on our results and our progress when we meet again next iterate Bruhl investor call. Thank you have a great day. Rosemarie, thank you very much and happy new year to all."

This call is also being webcast and can be accessed live or replayed on the RPM website at www.rpminc.com. Comments made on this call may include forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to be materially different. For more information on these risks and uncertainties, please review RPM's reports filed with the SEC.  During this conference call, references may be made to non-GAAP financial measures. To assist you in understanding these non-GAAP terms, RPM has posted reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures on the RPM website. Following today's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please note that only financial analysts will be permitted to ask questions. At this time, I would now like to turn the call over to RPM's Chairman and CEO, Mr. Frank Sullivan, for opening remarks. Please go ahead, sir.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you, Tammy. Good morning, and welcome to the RPM International Inc. investor call for our fiscal 2022 first quarter. Joining me on today's call is Rusty Gordon, RPM's Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Mike Laroche, who will become our Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer effective November 1. Mike was previously the CFO of our Specialty Products operating -- Specialty Products Group operating segment. He succeeds Keith Smiley who will be retiring at the end of the month after nearly 30 years of distinguished service to RPM. I'll begin by sharing broad commentary on our performance for the quarter. Mike will then provide details on our financial results, and Rusty will conclude our formal remarks with comments on our outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Our comments will be on an as-adjusted basis, unless otherwise indicated. Please note that we provided a supplemental slide presentation to support our comments on this call. It can be accessed in the Presentations and Webcast section of the RPM website at www.rpminc.com. After our formal remarks, we'll be pleased to take your questions. As you can see on the third slide of the presentation, our results this quarter demonstrate the benefits of our balanced business portfolio, where softness in one segment is typically offset by strength in others. For the first quarter of fiscal '22, 3 of our 4 operating segments, our Construction Products Group, Performance Coatings Group and Specialty Products Group generated solid sales and adjusted EBIT growth. Combined sales in these 3 segments increased more than 15%, and their adjusted EBIT was up more than 14%. This performance was especially notable in light of the raw material shortages, supply chain disruptions and inflation all of our segments and businesses are facing. Due to the supply disruption, we lost the equivalent of nearly 300 production days across RPM facilities around the globe during the 2022 first quarter, more days that were lost due to COVID-related shutdowns in last year's first quarter. We estimate the negative impact on consolidated sales during this first quarter was about $200 million due to these challenges and disruptions, over half of which occurred in our Consumer segment. This was about double the negative sales impact we experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21. Sales and earnings for our Consumer Group decreased during the quarter as a result of these factors as well as a difficult comparison to the prior year period when sales increased on an organic basis by 34% and adjusted EBIT was up 122%. These growth rates in the prior year period were largely driven by extraordinary DIY demand during the pandemic. All indicators suggest that the underlying demand for our Consumer products is still strong and that the supply and material disruptions the segment is currently experiencing are temporary. During the first quarter and early in the second quarter, we made strategic growth investments in our businesses. And as you can see on Slide 4, among these were the recent acquisitions of Dudick, Pure Air and a recent purchase of a large manufacturing facility in Corsicana, Texas. Acquired in June, Dudic will allow our Carboline business to strengthen its position in the secondary containment linings market with an established and trusted product line while simultaneously opening the door to expanded sales and future growth opportunities around the globe. Pure Air was acquired in August and provides indoor air quality service and is complementary to our Tremco Roofing and Tremco WTI business. We intend to swiftly scale Pure Air by leveraging Tremco's North America sales force, strategic partnerships and operational infrastructure. Also on this slide, you'll see an image from the 178,000 square foot plant we purchased on 120 acres in Texas. This will serve as a manufacturing center of excellence for multiple RPM businesses. Plant is fully operational, has an experienced operating team that will allow us to add long-term resilience in our supply chain, improve fill rates and more easily expand production of a number of our high-growth product lines in the coming quarters and years. From a more long-term macro viewpoint, there are a number of market opportunities and industry trends that we are well positioned to capitalize on for continued growth and success.  Among the market opportunities on Slide 5 are the following: The increasing need for investment in infrastructure with spending estimated to be $2.8 trillion globally. Our Performance Coatings Group and Construction Products Group have a vast array of products and services to meet this need. The new DIYers born from the pandemic who continue to tackle home improvement projects with both our core product ranges and expanding sales in relatively new categories like abrasives and architectural coatings. The continued growth in more holistic connected building envelopes, such as those provided by our Construction Products Group, which make structures more airtight, weather-tight and energy efficient. And the demand for wall systems, like those that could be constructed using insulated concrete forms made by our Nudura business, they make building stronger, more energy-efficient and reduce construction cycle time and labor. Industry trends benefiting RPM include nesting by consumers who are making more home improvements, school reopenings requiring more maintenance and repair, a need for building owners and facility managers to consolidate their construction management to a single source and a greater desire for energy efficient driven by both the cost benefits as well as the desire to minimize environmental impacts. RPM is well positioned to meet and grow with all of these trends. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mike Laroche to discuss our segment's financial performance during the quarter.\nMichael Laroche : Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 6. On a consolidated basis, our sales increased to a record $1.65 billion, up 2.7% over a strong fiscal 2021 first quarter, which grew 9.1%, largely due to the unprecedented demand for our Consumer Group's home improvement products during the pandemic. The growth was 2.1% from recent acquisitions and 1.6% due to foreign currency translation tailwinds, more than offsetting an organic sales decline of 1%. Adjusted diluted EPS of $1.08, decreasing 25% compared to the prior year period\u2019s extraordinary adjusted diluted EPS growth of nearly 52%. Our consolidated adjusted EBIT of $206.8 million decreased 23.2% due to supply chain challenges, inflation and the Consumer Group's tough comparison against the prior year. If you look at our consolidated results on a double-stack basis that compares the first quarter of fiscal 2022 to the pre-pandemic first quarter of fiscal 2020, our sales, EBIT, net income and diluted EPS all show strong growth. This indicates that last year's results were a bit of an anomaly created by the pandemic that we are now getting back to a more steady level of performance across the business. Raw material shortages and inflation continue to be serious challenges. In order to protect our margins, we are continuing to implement price increases where appropriate across all our segments. We also continue to benefit from incremental cost savings resulting from our recently concluded MAP to Growth operating improvement program. It continues to pay dividends as we generate further operational efficiencies in our manufacturing, procurement and administrative business functions. Moving on to Slide 7. Our Construction Products Group was our fastest-growing segment in the first quarter, generating record sales and record adjusted EBIT. Its organic growth of 15% was particularly impressive given that non-residential construction put in place a relevant market indicator for the segment is down 11.6% this calendar year. Nearly all of the CPG businesses experienced strong top line performance, partially by focusing on growing markets such as technology and distribution. CPG businesses that performed particularly well were those that provide commercial roofing systems, concrete admixtures and repair products and insulated concrete forms. The segment's European operations generated double-digit top line growth, due in part to the comparison to last year's first quarter when shelter-in-place requirements were most severe. Earnings increased due to market share gains, operational improvements, cost controls and selling price increases, which offset production inefficiencies due to supply chain disruptions and cost increases. On Slide 8, you'll see that sales recovered at our Performance Coatings Group as they increased at nearly all of its major business units, partially aided by comparisons to last year's first quarter once pandemic restrictions did not allow contractors on work sites and poor energy market conditions led to deferrals and industrial maintenance spending. Sales were strong at the recently acquired Bison, which is a manufacturer of raised flooring systems. We also experienced strong growth in emerging markets and in industrial maintenance outside of the energy sector. It was encouraging to see EBIT growth outpacing sales in spite of inflation because CPG has been the segment that has been most heavily impacted by the pandemic. Earnings were boosted by improved pricing, incremental savings from operating improvement initiatives and 2 recent acquisitions. Turning to Slide 9. Our Specialty Products produced record top line growth, largely driven by its businesses providing marine coatings, powder coatings, wood stains and sealers and disaster restoration equipment. Earnings increased due to higher sales volumes and incremental operating improvement program savings, which were partially offset by high raw material inflation, inefficiencies associated with supply chain disruption and investment in SG&A for future growth initiatives. In response, SBD businesses are continuing to institute price increases. Next, on Slide 10, our Consumer Group faced a tough comparison to prior year for the reasons Frank mentioned earlier. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, this segment experienced a negative sales impact of roughly $100 million from production outages due to supply constraints and disruptions. However, the Consumer Group's fiscal 2022 first quarter sales were 12.3% above pre-pandemic levels of the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and in spite of the negative sales impact from supply chain challenges during the current year. There is pent-up demand for our products and inventory in many of our channels are low. We expect to recover the lost sales when conditions normalize. Earnings declined during the first quarter of fiscal '22 as a result of inflation in materials for labor as well as the unfavorable impact of supply shortages on productivity. These factors were partially offset by price increases and savings from our operating improvement program. We are proactively building resiliency in our supply chain to secure raw materials required today and in the future. In addition, we are adding manufacturing capacity to serve new DIY demand. While this additional capacity is being established, in the near term, we are using contract manufacturing at higher cost to meet customer demand. Now, I'll turn the call over to Rusty to discuss our outlook.\nRusty Gordon : Thanks, Mike. I'll now move on to Slide 11. As we look ahead to our fiscal 2022 second quarter, we anticipate that raw material, freight and wage inflation will persist as well the raw material shortages and supply chain challenges we have been experiencing. In addition, we faced another difficult comparison to the prior year when sales on a consolidated basis increased 6% and adjusted EBIT increased nearly 30%, driven by a 66% increase in the Consumer Segment's adjusted EBIT. We anticipate these factors to be partially offset by price increases, operational improvements and new manufacturing capacity. We expect our fiscal 2022 second quarter consolidated sales to increase in the mid-single digits. Our Construction Products Group, Performance Coatings Group and Specialty Products Group are anticipating double-digit sales growth. Our Consumer Group is anticipated to experience a double-digit decrease in sales due to continued raw material shortages and a difficult comparison to the prior year period when pandemic fueled demand rapidly drove organic growth up 15%. However, in a similar manner to the first quarter, we expect the Consumer segment's second quarter sales to be above its pre-pandemic level, which is a fair comparison. While underlying demand remains strong for our products and services, we still face material shortages and inflationary pressures, so adjusted EBIT is expected to be down 15% to 25%. The Q2 results will be directionally similar to Q1 with significant year-over-year declines again in our Consumer Group, which is still lapping tough comparisons, and double-digit sales and earnings increases for our other 3 segments in aggregate. Turning to Slide 12. Moving forward, we intend to maintain the positive momentum created by our operating improvement program as we complete its remaining projects, such as the one plant closure completed during Q1 of F '22, leverage resources across RPM to manage supply chain issues and meet customer demand, identify new opportunities for efficiencies through our continuous improvement culture and make investments in growth opportunities, including capacity expansions. This concludes our formal comments. We will now be pleased to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird.\nGhansham Panjabi: Good morning, Frank. In the comments on the Construction segment, you noticed that -- you noted that sales were very strong despite the indicator in terms of construction put in place being down significantly so far this year. Is that dynamic an issue as we look out over the next 6 months or so in terms of maybe an air pocket in demand? Or do you not see that at this point?\nFrank Sullivan: No, I think you're going to continue to see strong performance there, and it's really a combination of how our leadership team has positioned our Construction Products Group. And I'll just give you a couple of examples. As you know, our Tremco business has been the leader in roof restoration coatings. And these are allowing for the expansion or continuation of the useful life of an old roof by another 10, 15, 20 years and 1/3 of the cost. and to the extent that we can get resins for these roof restoration coatings and we're shifting between typical petroleum-based resins which, in some instances, are in short supply and more organic resins and bio-based resins, they're allowing us both an advantage in a growing area and also in an advantage where in today's market, tearing off a roof and waiting for all the components and in some cases, particularly foam-based insulation is a problem. So I think our position in roof restoration coatings is providing us somewhat of an advantage in this material-constrained environment. The other area is in the Tremco waterproofing and sealants business. They've been the leader in facade restoration in a manner that allows systems to be used to renovate and repair facades without pulling out windows and other construction components. And again, because of the component and supply challenges that we're facing across construction materials, we're seeing some advantage there as well. So those are just 2 examples. I would expect in the second quarter and beyond not only will we see double-digit sales growth, but you'll start to see modest margin expansion with EBIT growth at or slightly better than the sales growth in our Construction Products Group.\nGhansham Panjabi: Thank you, Frank. And then in terms of guidance, I mean, last quarter, you gave us guidance for both the first quarter and the second quarter, and the first quarter certainly came in line. And obviously, the second quarter has been rebased just based on what's occurred in cost in raw materials scarcity, et cetera. Can you help us think about the outlook for the back half of the year in terms of the cost inflation trend line, the sales loss progression from a dearth of raw materials? Just give us a high-level view in terms of what you know at this point and how we should kind of see the full year unfolds.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So for inflation today, we anticipate for the full '22 fiscal year overall inflation to be somewhere in the high teens, call it, 17%, 18%, 19%. Today, as we sit here year-over-year, inflation includes labor and freight, but mostly material-driven is 30% higher. And a lot of that's driven by materials. A couple of examples that you would be familiar with. Epoxy resins are double what they were a year ago. Acetone is up 90%. MDI is up 80%. Alkyd resins are up 50%. And that's to the extent that we can get them. As you know, there's been shortages particularly related to a plant explosion of a primary North American alkyd resin producer. So that's the environment that we see today. There's a broad range on our outlook for Q2. And I think all of these things are foreseeable. The impact is not as foreseeable. So the thing that we're focused on now the most is what's happening in China and some combination of its trade fight with Australia around coal. And I think efforts to maybe clean up air pollution in front of the winter Olympics are resulting in currently an estimated more shutdowns of industrial production and power. And so that's certainly going to have a negative impact on the downstream chemical supply as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Caleb on for John. I hope that's all right.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. Hey, Caleb.\nUnidentified Analyst: So clearly, there are some supply chain issues. And I know you had previously mentioned the $100 million impact to evolve by Consumer, I believe, total impact of $200 million. And I was just wondering if you could quantify the impact of that in Q2. And I know you had said that once the supply chain issues, there would be a snapback. But I was just wondering how quickly you're expecting that snapback in demand to occur as a 1- or 2-year timeframe or if it's a little bit longer than that?\nRusty Gordon : Yes. In terms of Q2, the way it looks now, Caleb, is it's going to be pretty similar to Q1. We would expect, again, roughly $200 million of sales loss. And they're not lost sales, I should clarify. Those are most all deferred sales on the Consumer side. If people have a paint project, they're eventually going to have to paint it even if were out of stock on a particular color in a given moment. And on our industrial-type businesses, most of these products are spec and these are projects that are moving forward. So if we have supply availability issues, most likely our competitors do and these projects will continue.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. And then can you speak to any thoughts on MAP 2.0 as the types of opportunities you're seeing in that and how you could look to scale those in the future?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I think the most obvious ones there are in the manufacturing area. We instituted the MS-168 lean manufacturing and continuous improvement measurements and disciplines. And there are still 60 small- to medium-sized manufacturing facilities that we have not gotten to because of the interruptions of COVID. It's pretty intensive hands-on on the factory floor process. And so I would expect that there'll be 10s of millions of dollars of benefits there as we can get to it. There is some more in procurement, but not nearly the extent of what we experienced in the first round of MAP to Growth. And then there'll be some elements. I will tell you that providing details on this and really quantifying this has been interrupted by this global supply chain issue. We're getting into our plants, but the literally week-to-week and month-to-month fight on supply chain is occupying our focus. We will see some easing up in some of our primary resins, we think, going into November and certainly into the spring. Some of that is finding alternative supply or tollers. Some of that will be from the Corsicana, Texas facility that we acquired where we're standing up some critical resin production. And so we're moving in the right direction there.  And so we'll have more to say on MAP to Growth 2.0, but our detailed communications on that are going to be delayed until we really feel like we've got the supply chain challenges I wouldn't say behind us, but a little better managed than they are today. I mentioned earlier in the call, the challenges in China that we're seeing. That's likely to impact silicones in a more meaningful way than silicones have already been impacted today as well as some other critical raws. So there continue to be circumstantial elements, whether it's hurricanes or winter storms or now what's coming in China that exacerbate an already global supply chain challenge that's not unique to our industry.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is [Stephen] on for Vincent. I just want to ask a quick question on pricing and if you could provide an update there as to what realization was in the quarter and kind of what you're expecting for the back half as well?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So for obvious competitive reasons, we're not going to get into pricing by segment or business. But I can tell you the numbers that we would provide here on a consolidated basis are generally accurate, plus or minus 50 basis points for most of our different businesses. And this relates to pricing that we were able to effect in the spring and then a second round of pricing across most of our businesses at the end of the summer or early fall. So on a consolidated basis, in Q1, price had an impact of about 4.5%. The effect -- and this is the effect of the pricing that we have already instituted again in the spring or in the fall, some of which is coming online. This does not anticipate the need for additional price increases, which time will tell relative to the supply issues. So Q1, 4.5% on a consolidated basis. Q2 should be about 7.5%. And all things being equal, which is a very loose statement relative to the supply chain issues, you'll see the impact in the second half of the year somewhere in the 8% to 10% range.\nUnidentified Analyst: And then just a follow-up on cash flow. I think 1Q kind of took a sizable hit year-on-year. And obviously, last year, probably it was maybe a little bit stronger than usual. So you called out inventory specifically, but there are some other working capital headwinds as well. Can you just provide some color there and how you're thinking about working capital and CapEx uses in the back half?\nRusty Gordon: Yes, sure. In terms of last year, we had strong demand in our Consumer DIY business. And we were able to meet that demand really by pulling sales out of inventory and converting inventory to cash. So we had an excellent first quarter. And if you turn to this year, it's the opposite, of course, for Consumer. We're declining in sales. And the inventory had been drawn down. Right now, we're actually trying to build inventory to try to improve fill rates and service levels. So from a working capital perspective, that's really the main driver. And that theme does apply as well across our other 3 segments. They as well are trying to build the resiliency and build inventory where possible because we seem to have supply shocks happening pretty regularly if you look at our track record of late.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS.\nJosh Spector: Just on the Consumer Products side, I mean, you guys continue to maintain the stance about demand being strong and you guys obviously are not the only ones saying that in that channel. Just curious what data you are seeing and maybe specifically what percent of your SKU is maybe there out of stock versus low stock. So if there is any stock maybe somebody will be buying? Or if that\u2019s not the data you are looking at, what are you seeing that gives you confidence there? \nFrank Sullivan: So we're in part seeing comparisons to the pre-pandemic levels in terms of units, which is still strong, up high single digits or low double digits. And I won't get into specific fill rates by customers. But historically, we've been at 98%, 99% fill rates, and neither we or any of our competitors are close to that. And if we were close to that in terms of consumer takeaway and what we're unable to supply because of the global supply chain disruptions, we have high confidence we\u2019d move off the shelfs and that\u2019s an issue. It\u2019s a problem for us. It\u2019s a problem for our customers. We are addressing it in ways that we think are competitively in a good position. And we're also confident that as we resolve some of these resin issues and can get fill rates back to closer levels, you'll see a nice pickup in revenue growth. But that's the principal reason behind the $200 million of estimated lost sales in the quarter, half of which was Consumer. It's literally not being able to meet demand and not being close to the historically excellent and expected fill rates. \nJosh Spector: And just in terms of the new Texas facility, I mean, you guys have continued to talk about the consumer need to outsource production. Curious what that cost was in this quarter and if you could just remind us maybe on the prior quarters? And does that facility address that entirely or is that a separate issue from what you are doing with that facility?\nFrank Sullivan: No, I am -- I don\u2019t have a specific answer for the cost other than, we\u2019re outsourcing a significant filling in some areas. The other issue is -- and we\u2019ve talked about this before, one of our principal suppliers had a plant explosion and they were a provider of about 30% of alkyd resins to North America and a significant supplier to us. And alkyd resins is a more meaningful resin to Rust-Oleum than it might be to some of our architectural paint competitors. So we are working with them on outside tollers. We are standing up day-by-day more capacity. We're not where we need to be yet, but we're confident we'll get there in the next month or 2, but it's at a substantially higher cost. So as we can get back to a normal supply base and as we can address a portion of that, but not the majority of it in our new plant, first and foremost, we'll get back to being able to meet demand and get back to fill rates that we all desire. And then you'll see the profitability issue addressed as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Cory on for Kevin. Going back to the $200 million impact of supply chain and raws, it sounds like the $100 million in Consumer was mostly shortage related. I was wondering if you could break out the other $100 million by segment or by what type of pressure it was, whether it was supply chain issues or shortages or just raw material availability.\nFrank Sullivan: In every case it's shortages. It is, for instance, in our Construction Products Group, as strong as their revenues were in the quarter. We certainly missed tens of millions of dollars of volume there. And you really have to trace it back to the supply chain. So there were a number of instances where a critical intermediate chemical to one of our suppliers inhibited those suppliers from providing us resins in our roof coatings business and we're overcoming this now. But in the first quarter, we literally had week long plant shutdowns, while we were waiting for raw materials. And so in that case, we are making that up, because we've solved that issue. But you're seeing rising costs and some availabilities in silicones. You've seen it in acrylic resins, you're seeing it in alkyd resins. And in some cases, it is a shortage like in alkyd resins of a direct raw material, which we purchased. In many other cases, it is a critical element of our suppliers\u2019 production that\u2019s inhibiting their ability to deliver their products timely to us. And so it impacted construction products in the first quarter. I think we've overcome most of that.  We anticipate unfortunately disruptions in silicones because of the issues on China I mentioned. That will negatively impact our Consumer and Construction Product Group, but it's incorporated in our outlook.\nUnidentified Analyst: And then you had mentioned that you'd done some contract and tolling manufacturing. Can you talk through that on a dollar margin basis and any detail you can provide?\nFrank Sullivan: No. We haven't provided the detail on that other than to say, if you look at our gross margins in Consumer or gross margin RPM in general, the biggest decline of the RPM gross margins in the quarter are driven by our Consumer Group, and you can see it in the EBIT, which is down dramatically. And a huge chunk of that is gross margins because of material. And it's not only higher material costs, but it's substantially higher conversion costs because of outside tolling and because of the disruptions in the supply chain. So the other issue that's increased substantially, particularly in Consumer is freight. And so historically where we would be shipping only truckloads of stuff, sometimes we're shipping less than truckload, there's disruptions to incoming supply on those chemicals or elements that we get from China. I think it's no secret to folks that you've got a huge backlog in the Long Beach port. So there are a multitude of reasons why the disruptions have happened that resulted in the shortfall of sales that we're talking about.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America.\nLuke Washer: This is Luke Washer on for Steve. I wanted to touch just quickly again on raw materials. It sounds like a lot of the headwind is due to raw material availability. But as you think of just rising costs generally -- and I appreciate some of the detail around MDI and proxy resins, but it's interesting because I would assume that a lot of those higher-priced commodities are going into more of your Construction Products and Performance Coatings segments where I think margins have been much more resilient. So I guess when you think about the higher cost in those segments offsetting maybe by some of your MAP to Growth initiatives and perhaps acquisitions or mix shifts, do you think that it's largely just due to that mix shift and MAP to Growth offsetting raw materials or raw materials still a big headwind in those segments?\nFrank Sullivan: So raw materials are still a big headwind in those businesses. But we hear talking about MAP to Growth savings, they're real. And I think we had talked in the spring about $50 million, Rusty, for the fiscal year?\nRusty Gordon: Oh, Yes. Absolutely, yes.\nFrank Sullivan: Follow-on savings, and they're real. It's hard to see them for exactly the reason that you're talking about. So we have follow-on MAP to Growth savings. We don't have the conversion cost disruptions in our other segments that we have in Consumer. And so we're not facing that. And we have been effective in getting price increases. And so those are the principal reasons why we don't have the same deterioration, particularly in our Construction Products Group, our Performance Coatings Group and the EBIT margin that you're seeing in Consumer.\nLuke Washer: Very helpful. And then on the supply chain, are you thinking about your supply chain a little bit more differently given the disruption that you're seeing today and also just from the pandemic? And does that impact your decisions going forward on MAP 2.0 and your Texas manufacturing plant, which it sounds like it's going to create more resilience in your supply chain. So are you thinking about your supply chain differently? And what do you expect to kind of do with that going forward?\nFrank Sullivan: On the margin, that's a great question. And on the margin, we are thinking about it differently. And so this Corsicana, Texas plant is allowing us to extend what we've been doing with Arnet Polymers, which has been a great asset for RPM in this mix there, a producer of specialty polymers for our businesses. And Corsicana gives us the same type of capacity but times 5, if you will. And so that is a part of the answer. Our core customers -- I'm sorry, our core suppliers and our supply chain isn't changing, although we are sourcing some raw materials offshore that previously we had not been. So we're learning more about global supply. And we're working hand-in-hand with a lot of our largest suppliers on how to manage our way through this. So I think the -- and this is true across the supply chains, the level of cooperation and efforts to try and solve these issues is pretty remarkable given what's happening. And so that's kind of the best answer I have for you today. And hopefully, it will be better a quarter from now, but it's pretty dynamic still.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Paige with RBC.\nDavid Paige: This is David Paige on for Arun Viswanathan at RBC. Sorry if it was asked already, but can you guys just remind us what your top use of cash is for the next 6 to 12 months and if you have any plans to return capital to shareholders?\nRusty Gordon: Sure. Yes. We have been buying back shares since we got out of the depths of COVID. We have repurchased $62 million of stock since the winter time. In terms of capital expenditures, we do have a lot of projects. Our revenues and volumes are growing in a number of our businesses. So we have a lot of capacity expansion going on. And we have increased the acquisition flow. We have had a number of small deals closed, and that has picked up as well since the pandemic. So those are probably the principal areas for capital allocation.\nFrank Sullivan: The 2 areas that will impact cash most this year we've talked about, one is CapEx, which I think year-over-year will be up, what, Rusty, 50 million?\nRusty Gordon: Yes. \nFrank Sullivan: Yes, $50 million higher than last year. And all of that's for capacity expansion. And that's in addition to the Corsicana, Texas plant acquisition, which is while it was an acquisition of manufacturing assets, it's really an extension of capital expansion. And then the other area will be working capital, both in comparison to a very strong cash flow impact, positive impact from working capital last year and building inventories where we can in key areas as one key element of addressing this global supply chain issue.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back to Frank Sullivan for closing remarks.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you. Tomorrow, at 2:00 PM Eastern Time, we will hold our Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The meeting will again be held virtually this year in order to protect the health and well-being of our shareholders and employees. It can be accessed via the RPM website at www.rpminc.com or at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/rpm2021. We are optimistic that we'll be able to return to an in-person meeting next year, so we can resume our tradition of engaging with nearly 1,000 of our shareholders and providing them samples of RPM's latest products and answering their questions in person. I'd like to thank our shareholders for their ongoing investment in RPM. We remain focused on generating long-term value for you. I'd also like to thank our associates worldwide for their continued work and dedication, particularly during these extenuating, challenging circumstances around a global pandemic and now global supply chain challenges. Speaking of dedication, I'd like to take a moment to recognize 2 retirements at RPM. Keith Smiley, RPM's Vice President of Finance and Controller, will retire this month after nearly 30 years of service. When Keith started at RPM in 1992, he was our internal audit department. He subsequently became Corporate Controller in '93 and Treasurer in 1997. He was elected Vice President, Treasurer and Assistant Secretary in 1999 and Vice President Controller in 2012. Kathie Rogers, RPM's Manager of Investor Relations, will officially retire this Friday after nearly 40 years of service to RPM. Kathie has been the voice and face to our nearly 200,000 individual shareholders throughout most of that time. When Kathie joined RPM, revenues were $154 million. When Keith joined RPM, 7 years later, revenues had grown to $550 million. Both Kathie and Keith have been integral parts of the team responsible for generating a lot of growth and a lot of value creation for our shareholders, represented by the $6 billion in revenues today and the nearly $11 billion in market cap. On behalf of RPM, I wish Keith and Kathie all the best in their well-earned retirement. To all on the call, I wish you and your families, good health. And we look forward to updating you on our fiscal 2022 second quarter results in January. Thank you for joining our call today. And have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Rusty Gordon",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. I'll now move on to Slide 11. As we look ahead to our fiscal 2022 second quarter, we anticipate that raw material, freight and wage inflation will persist as well the raw material shortages and supply chain challenges we have been experiencing. In addition, we faced another difficult comparison to the prior year when sales on a consolidated basis increased 6% and adjusted EBIT increased nearly 30%, driven by a 66% increase in the Consumer Segment's adjusted EBIT. We anticipate these factors to be partially offset by price increases, operational improvements and new manufacturing capacity. We expect our fiscal 2022 second quarter consolidated sales to increase in the mid-single digits. Our Construction Products Group, Performance Coatings Group and Specialty Products Group are anticipating double-digit sales growth. Our Consumer Group is anticipated to experience a double-digit decrease in sales due to continued raw material shortages and a difficult comparison to the prior year period when pandemic fueled demand rapidly drove organic growth up 15%. However, in a similar manner to the first quarter, we expect the Consumer segment's second quarter sales to be above its pre-pandemic level, which is a fair comparison. While underlying demand remains strong for our products and services, we still face material shortages and inflationary pressures, so adjusted EBIT is expected to be down 15% to 25%. The Q2 results will be directionally similar to Q1 with significant year-over-year declines again in our Consumer Group, which is still lapping tough comparisons, and double-digit sales and earnings increases for our other 3 segments in aggregate. Turning to Slide 12. Moving forward, we intend to maintain the positive momentum created by our operating improvement program as we complete its remaining projects, such as the one plant closure completed during Q1 of F '22, leverage resources across RPM to manage supply chain issues and meet customer demand, identify new opportunities for efficiencies through our continuous improvement culture and make investments in growth opportunities, including capacity expansions. This concludes our formal comments. We will now be pleased to take your questions. Yes. In terms of Q2, the way it looks now, Caleb, is it's going to be pretty similar to Q1. We would expect, again, roughly $200 million of sales loss. And they're not lost sales, I should clarify. Those are most all deferred sales on the Consumer side. If people have a paint project, they're eventually going to have to paint it even if were out of stock on a particular color in a given moment. And on our industrial-type businesses, most of these products are spec and these are projects that are moving forward. So if we have supply availability issues, most likely our competitors do and these projects will continue. Yes, sure. In terms of last year, we had strong demand in our Consumer DIY business. And we were able to meet that demand really by pulling sales out of inventory and converting inventory to cash. So we had an excellent first quarter. And if you turn to this year, it's the opposite, of course, for Consumer. We're declining in sales. And the inventory had been drawn down. Right now, we're actually trying to build inventory to try to improve fill rates and service levels. So from a working capital perspective, that's really the main driver. And that theme does apply as well across our other 3 segments. They as well are trying to build the resiliency and build inventory where possible because we seem to have supply shocks happening pretty regularly if you look at our track record of late. Oh, Yes. Absolutely, yes. Sure. Yes. We have been buying back shares since we got out of the depths of COVID. We have repurchased $62 million of stock since the winter time. In terms of capital expenditures, we do have a lot of projects. Our revenues and volumes are growing in a number of our businesses. So we have a lot of capacity expansion going on. And we have increased the acquisition flow. We have had a number of small deals closed, and that has picked up as well since the pandemic. So those are probably the principal areas for capital allocation. Yes."

            "name": "Michael Laroche",
            "content": "Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 6. On a consolidated basis, our sales increased to a record $1.65 billion, up 2.7% over a strong fiscal 2021 first quarter, which grew 9.1%, largely due to the unprecedented demand for our Consumer Group's home improvement products during the pandemic. The growth was 2.1% from recent acquisitions and 1.6% due to foreign currency translation tailwinds, more than offsetting an organic sales decline of 1%. Adjusted diluted EPS of $1.08, decreasing 25% compared to the prior year period's extraordinary adjusted diluted EPS growth of nearly 52%. Our consolidated adjusted EBIT of $206.8 million decreased 23.2% due to supply chain challenges, inflation and the Consumer Group's tough comparison against the prior year. If you look at our consolidated results on a double-stack basis that compares the first quarter of fiscal 2022 to the pre-pandemic first quarter of fiscal 2020, our sales, EBIT, net income and diluted EPS all show strong growth. This indicates that last year's results were a bit of an anomaly created by the pandemic that we are now getting back to a more steady level of performance across the business. Raw material shortages and inflation continue to be serious challenges. In order to protect our margins, we are continuing to implement price increases where appropriate across all our segments. We also continue to benefit from incremental cost savings resulting from our recently concluded MAP to Growth operating improvement program. It continues to pay dividends as we generate further operational efficiencies in our manufacturing, procurement and administrative business functions. Moving on to Slide 7. Our Construction Products Group was our fastest-growing segment in the first quarter, generating record sales and record adjusted EBIT. Its organic growth of 15% was particularly impressive given that non-residential construction put in place a relevant market indicator for the segment is down 11.6% this calendar year. Nearly all of the CPG businesses experienced strong top line performance, partially by focusing on growing markets such as technology and distribution. CPG businesses that performed particularly well were those that provide commercial roofing systems, concrete admixtures and repair products and insulated concrete forms. The segment's European operations generated double-digit top line growth, due in part to the comparison to last year's first quarter when shelter-in-place requirements were most severe. Earnings increased due to market share gains, operational improvements, cost controls and selling price increases, which offset production inefficiencies due to supply chain disruptions and cost increases. On Slide 8, you'll see that sales recovered at our Performance Coatings Group as they increased at nearly all of its major business units, partially aided by comparisons to last year's first quarter once pandemic restrictions did not allow contractors on work sites and poor energy market conditions led to deferrals and industrial maintenance spending. Sales were strong at the recently acquired Bison, which is a manufacturer of raised flooring systems. We also experienced strong growth in emerging markets and in industrial maintenance outside of the energy sector. It was encouraging to see EBIT growth outpacing sales in spite of inflation because CPG has been the segment that has been most heavily impacted by the pandemic. Earnings were boosted by improved pricing, incremental savings from operating improvement initiatives and 2 recent acquisitions. Turning to Slide 9. Our Specialty Products produced record top line growth, largely driven by its businesses providing marine coatings, powder coatings, wood stains and sealers and disaster restoration equipment. Earnings increased due to higher sales volumes and incremental operating improvement program savings, which were partially offset by high raw material inflation, inefficiencies associated with supply chain disruption and investment in SG&A for future growth initiatives. In response, SBD businesses are continuing to institute price increases. Next, on Slide 10, our Consumer Group faced a tough comparison to prior year for the reasons Frank mentioned earlier. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, this segment experienced a negative sales impact of roughly $100 million from production outages due to supply constraints and disruptions. However, the Consumer Group's fiscal 2022 first quarter sales were 12.3% above pre-pandemic levels of the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and in spite of the negative sales impact from supply chain challenges during the current year. There is pent-up demand for our products and inventory in many of our channels are low. We expect to recover the lost sales when conditions normalize. Earnings declined during the first quarter of fiscal '22 as a result of inflation in materials for labor as well as the unfavorable impact of supply shortages on productivity. These factors were partially offset by price increases and savings from our operating improvement program. We are proactively building resiliency in our supply chain to secure raw materials required today and in the future. In addition, we are adding manufacturing capacity to serve new DIY demand. While this additional capacity is being established, in the near term, we are using contract manufacturing at higher cost to meet customer demand. Now, I'll turn the call over to Rusty to discuss our outlook."

            "name": "Frank Sullivan",
            "content": "Thank you, Tammy. Good morning, and welcome to the RPM International Inc. investor call for our fiscal 2022 first quarter. Joining me on today's call is Rusty Gordon, RPM's Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Mike Laroche, who will become our Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer effective November 1. Mike was previously the CFO of our Specialty Products operating -- Specialty Products Group operating segment. He succeeds Keith Smiley who will be retiring at the end of the month after nearly 30 years of distinguished service to RPM. I'll begin by sharing broad commentary on our performance for the quarter. Mike will then provide details on our financial results, and Rusty will conclude our formal remarks with comments on our outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Our comments will be on an as-adjusted basis, unless otherwise indicated. Please note that we provided a supplemental slide presentation to support our comments on this call. It can be accessed in the Presentations and Webcast section of the RPM website at www.rpminc.com. After our formal remarks, we'll be pleased to take your questions. As you can see on the third slide of the presentation, our results this quarter demonstrate the benefits of our balanced business portfolio, where softness in one segment is typically offset by strength in others. For the first quarter of fiscal '22, 3 of our 4 operating segments, our Construction Products Group, Performance Coatings Group and Specialty Products Group generated solid sales and adjusted EBIT growth. Combined sales in these 3 segments increased more than 15%, and their adjusted EBIT was up more than 14%. This performance was especially notable in light of the raw material shortages, supply chain disruptions and inflation all of our segments and businesses are facing. Due to the supply disruption, we lost the equivalent of nearly 300 production days across RPM facilities around the globe during the 2022 first quarter, more days that were lost due to COVID-related shutdowns in last year's first quarter. We estimate the negative impact on consolidated sales during this first quarter was about $200 million due to these challenges and disruptions, over half of which occurred in our Consumer segment. This was about double the negative sales impact we experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21. Sales and earnings for our Consumer Group decreased during the quarter as a result of these factors as well as a difficult comparison to the prior year period when sales increased on an organic basis by 34% and adjusted EBIT was up 122%. These growth rates in the prior year period were largely driven by extraordinary DIY demand during the pandemic. All indicators suggest that the underlying demand for our Consumer products is still strong and that the supply and material disruptions the segment is currently experiencing are temporary. During the first quarter and early in the second quarter, we made strategic growth investments in our businesses. And as you can see on Slide 4, among these were the recent acquisitions of Dudick, Pure Air and a recent purchase of a large manufacturing facility in Corsicana, Texas. Acquired in June, Dudic will allow our Carboline business to strengthen its position in the secondary containment linings market with an established and trusted product line while simultaneously opening the door to expanded sales and future growth opportunities around the globe. Pure Air was acquired in August and provides indoor air quality service and is complementary to our Tremco Roofing and Tremco WTI business. We intend to swiftly scale Pure Air by leveraging Tremco's North America sales force, strategic partnerships and operational infrastructure. Also on this slide, you'll see an image from the 178,000 square foot plant we purchased on 120 acres in Texas. This will serve as a manufacturing center of excellence for multiple RPM businesses. Plant is fully operational, has an experienced operating team that will allow us to add long-term resilience in our supply chain, improve fill rates and more easily expand production of a number of our high-growth product lines in the coming quarters and years. From a more long-term macro viewpoint, there are a number of market opportunities and industry trends that we are well positioned to capitalize on for continued growth and success.  Among the market opportunities on Slide 5 are the following: The increasing need for investment in infrastructure with spending estimated to be $2.8 trillion globally. Our Performance Coatings Group and Construction Products Group have a vast array of products and services to meet this need. The new DIYers born from the pandemic who continue to tackle home improvement projects with both our core product ranges and expanding sales in relatively new categories like abrasives and architectural coatings. The continued growth in more holistic connected building envelopes, such as those provided by our Construction Products Group, which make structures more airtight, weather-tight and energy efficient. And the demand for wall systems, like those that could be constructed using insulated concrete forms made by our Nudura business, they make building stronger, more energy-efficient and reduce construction cycle time and labor. Industry trends benefiting RPM include nesting by consumers who are making more home improvements, school reopenings requiring more maintenance and repair, a need for building owners and facility managers to consolidate their construction management to a single source and a greater desire for energy efficient driven by both the cost benefits as well as the desire to minimize environmental impacts. RPM is well positioned to meet and grow with all of these trends. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mike Laroche to discuss our segment's financial performance during the quarter. No, I think you're going to continue to see strong performance there, and it's really a combination of how our leadership team has positioned our Construction Products Group. And I'll just give you a couple of examples. As you know, our Tremco business has been the leader in roof restoration coatings. And these are allowing for the expansion or continuation of the useful life of an old roof by another 10, 15, 20 years and 1/3 of the cost. and to the extent that we can get resins for these roof restoration coatings and we're shifting between typical petroleum-based resins which, in some instances, are in short supply and more organic resins and bio-based resins, they're allowing us both an advantage in a growing area and also in an advantage where in today's market, tearing off a roof and waiting for all the components and in some cases, particularly foam-based insulation is a problem. So I think our position in roof restoration coatings is providing us somewhat of an advantage in this material-constrained environment. The other area is in the Tremco waterproofing and sealants business. They've been the leader in facade restoration in a manner that allows systems to be used to renovate and repair facades without pulling out windows and other construction components. And again, because of the component and supply challenges that we're facing across construction materials, we're seeing some advantage there as well. So those are just 2 examples. I would expect in the second quarter and beyond not only will we see double-digit sales growth, but you'll start to see modest margin expansion with EBIT growth at or slightly better than the sales growth in our Construction Products Group. Sure. So for inflation today, we anticipate for the full '22 fiscal year overall inflation to be somewhere in the high teens, call it, 17%, 18%, 19%. Today, as we sit here year-over-year, inflation includes labor and freight, but mostly material-driven is 30% higher. And a lot of that's driven by materials. A couple of examples that you would be familiar with. Epoxy resins are double what they were a year ago. Acetone is up 90%. MDI is up 80%. Alkyd resins are up 50%. And that's to the extent that we can get them. As you know, there's been shortages particularly related to a plant explosion of a primary North American alkyd resin producer. So that's the environment that we see today. There's a broad range on our outlook for Q2. And I think all of these things are foreseeable. The impact is not as foreseeable. So the thing that we're focused on now the most is what's happening in China and some combination of its trade fight with Australia around coal. And I think efforts to maybe clean up air pollution in front of the winter Olympics are resulting in currently an estimated more shutdowns of industrial production and power. And so that's certainly going to have a negative impact on the downstream chemical supply as well. Sure. Hey, Caleb. Sure. I think the most obvious ones there are in the manufacturing area. We instituted the MS-168 lean manufacturing and continuous improvement measurements and disciplines. And there are still 60 small- to medium-sized manufacturing facilities that we have not gotten to because of the interruptions of COVID. It's pretty intensive hands-on on the factory floor process. And so I would expect that there'll be 10s of millions of dollars of benefits there as we can get to it. There is some more in procurement, but not nearly the extent of what we experienced in the first round of MAP to Growth. And then there'll be some elements. I will tell you that providing details on this and really quantifying this has been interrupted by this global supply chain issue. We're getting into our plants, but the literally week-to-week and month-to-month fight on supply chain is occupying our focus. We will see some easing up in some of our primary resins, we think, going into November and certainly into the spring. Some of that is finding alternative supply or tollers. Some of that will be from the Corsicana, Texas facility that we acquired where we're standing up some critical resin production. And so we're moving in the right direction there.  And so we'll have more to say on MAP to Growth 2.0, but our detailed communications on that are going to be delayed until we really feel like we've got the supply chain challenges I wouldn't say behind us, but a little better managed than they are today. I mentioned earlier in the call, the challenges in China that we're seeing. That's likely to impact silicones in a more meaningful way than silicones have already been impacted today as well as some other critical raws. So there continue to be circumstantial elements, whether it's hurricanes or winter storms or now what's coming in China that exacerbate an already global supply chain challenge that's not unique to our industry. Sure. So for obvious competitive reasons, we're not going to get into pricing by segment or business. But I can tell you the numbers that we would provide here on a consolidated basis are generally accurate, plus or minus 50 basis points for most of our different businesses. And this relates to pricing that we were able to effect in the spring and then a second round of pricing across most of our businesses at the end of the summer or early fall. So on a consolidated basis, in Q1, price had an impact of about 4.5%. The effect -- and this is the effect of the pricing that we have already instituted again in the spring or in the fall, some of which is coming online. This does not anticipate the need for additional price increases, which time will tell relative to the supply issues. So Q1, 4.5% on a consolidated basis. Q2 should be about 7.5%. And all things being equal, which is a very loose statement relative to the supply chain issues, you'll see the impact in the second half of the year somewhere in the 8% to 10% range. So we're in part seeing comparisons to the pre-pandemic levels in terms of units, which is still strong, up high single digits or low double digits. And I won't get into specific fill rates by customers. But historically, we've been at 98%, 99% fill rates, and neither we or any of our competitors are close to that. And if we were close to that in terms of consumer takeaway and what we're unable to supply because of the global supply chain disruptions, we have high confidence we'd move off the shelfs and that's an issue. It's a problem for us. It's a problem for our customers. We are addressing it in ways that we think are competitively in a good position. And we're also confident that as we resolve some of these resin issues and can get fill rates back to closer levels, you'll see a nice pickup in revenue growth. But that's the principal reason behind the $200 million of estimated lost sales in the quarter, half of which was Consumer. It's literally not being able to meet demand and not being close to the historically excellent and expected fill rates. No, I am -- I don't have a specific answer for the cost other than, we're outsourcing a significant filling in some areas. The other issue is -- and we've talked about this before, one of our principal suppliers had a plant explosion and they were a provider of about 30% of alkyd resins to North America and a significant supplier to us. And alkyd resins is a more meaningful resin to Rust-Oleum than it might be to some of our architectural paint competitors. So we are working with them on outside tollers. We are standing up day-by-day more capacity. We're not where we need to be yet, but we're confident we'll get there in the next month or 2, but it's at a substantially higher cost. So as we can get back to a normal supply base and as we can address a portion of that, but not the majority of it in our new plant, first and foremost, we'll get back to being able to meet demand and get back to fill rates that we all desire. And then you'll see the profitability issue addressed as well. In every case it's shortages. It is, for instance, in our Construction Products Group, as strong as their revenues were in the quarter. We certainly missed tens of millions of dollars of volume there. And you really have to trace it back to the supply chain. So there were a number of instances where a critical intermediate chemical to one of our suppliers inhibited those suppliers from providing us resins in our roof coatings business and we're overcoming this now. But in the first quarter, we literally had week long plant shutdowns, while we were waiting for raw materials. And so in that case, we are making that up, because we've solved that issue. But you're seeing rising costs and some availabilities in silicones. You've seen it in acrylic resins, you're seeing it in alkyd resins. And in some cases, it is a shortage like in alkyd resins of a direct raw material, which we purchased. In many other cases, it is a critical element of our suppliers' production that's inhibiting their ability to deliver their products timely to us. And so it impacted construction products in the first quarter. I think we've overcome most of that.  We anticipate unfortunately disruptions in silicones because of the issues on China I mentioned. That will negatively impact our Consumer and Construction Product Group, but it's incorporated in our outlook. No. We haven't provided the detail on that other than to say, if you look at our gross margins in Consumer or gross margin RPM in general, the biggest decline of the RPM gross margins in the quarter are driven by our Consumer Group, and you can see it in the EBIT, which is down dramatically. And a huge chunk of that is gross margins because of material. And it's not only higher material costs, but it's substantially higher conversion costs because of outside tolling and because of the disruptions in the supply chain. So the other issue that's increased substantially, particularly in Consumer is freight. And so historically where we would be shipping only truckloads of stuff, sometimes we're shipping less than truckload, there's disruptions to incoming supply on those chemicals or elements that we get from China. I think it's no secret to folks that you've got a huge backlog in the Long Beach port. So there are a multitude of reasons why the disruptions have happened that resulted in the shortfall of sales that we're talking about. So raw materials are still a big headwind in those businesses. But we hear talking about MAP to Growth savings, they're real. And I think we had talked in the spring about $50 million, Rusty, for the fiscal year? Follow-on savings, and they're real. It's hard to see them for exactly the reason that you're talking about. So we have follow-on MAP to Growth savings. We don't have the conversion cost disruptions in our other segments that we have in Consumer. And so we're not facing that. And we have been effective in getting price increases. And so those are the principal reasons why we don't have the same deterioration, particularly in our Construction Products Group, our Performance Coatings Group and the EBIT margin that you're seeing in Consumer. On the margin, that's a great question. And on the margin, we are thinking about it differently. And so this Corsicana, Texas plant is allowing us to extend what we've been doing with Arnet Polymers, which has been a great asset for RPM in this mix there, a producer of specialty polymers for our businesses. And Corsicana gives us the same type of capacity but times 5, if you will. And so that is a part of the answer. Our core customers -- I'm sorry, our core suppliers and our supply chain isn't changing, although we are sourcing some raw materials offshore that previously we had not been. So we're learning more about global supply. And we're working hand-in-hand with a lot of our largest suppliers on how to manage our way through this. So I think the -- and this is true across the supply chains, the level of cooperation and efforts to try and solve these issues is pretty remarkable given what's happening. And so that's kind of the best answer I have for you today. And hopefully, it will be better a quarter from now, but it's pretty dynamic still. The 2 areas that will impact cash most this year we've talked about, one is CapEx, which I think year-over-year will be up, what, Rusty, 50 million? Yes, $50 million higher than last year. And all of that's for capacity expansion. And that's in addition to the Corsicana, Texas plant acquisition, which is while it was an acquisition of manufacturing assets, it's really an extension of capital expansion. And then the other area will be working capital, both in comparison to a very strong cash flow impact, positive impact from working capital last year and building inventories where we can in key areas as one key element of addressing this global supply chain issue. Thank you. Tomorrow, at 2:00 PM Eastern Time, we will hold our Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The meeting will again be held virtually this year in order to protect the health and well-being of our shareholders and employees. It can be accessed via the RPM website at www.rpminc.com or at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/rpm2021. We are optimistic that we'll be able to return to an in-person meeting next year, so we can resume our tradition of engaging with nearly 1,000 of our shareholders and providing them samples of RPM's latest products and answering their questions in person. I'd like to thank our shareholders for their ongoing investment in RPM. We remain focused on generating long-term value for you. I'd also like to thank our associates worldwide for their continued work and dedication, particularly during these extenuating, challenging circumstances around a global pandemic and now global supply chain challenges. Speaking of dedication, I'd like to take a moment to recognize 2 retirements at RPM. Keith Smiley, RPM's Vice President of Finance and Controller, will retire this month after nearly 30 years of service. When Keith started at RPM in 1992, he was our internal audit department. He subsequently became Corporate Controller in '93 and Treasurer in 1997. He was elected Vice President, Treasurer and Assistant Secretary in 1999 and Vice President Controller in 2012. Kathie Rogers, RPM's Manager of Investor Relations, will officially retire this Friday after nearly 40 years of service to RPM. Kathie has been the voice and face to our nearly 200,000 individual shareholders throughout most of that time. When Kathie joined RPM, revenues were $154 million. When Keith joined RPM, 7 years later, revenues had grown to $550 million. Both Kathie and Keith have been integral parts of the team responsible for generating a lot of growth and a lot of value creation for our shareholders, represented by the $6 billion in revenues today and the nearly $11 billion in market cap. On behalf of RPM, I wish Keith and Kathie all the best in their well-earned retirement. To all on the call, I wish you and your families, good health. And we look forward to updating you on our fiscal 2022 second quarter results in January. Thank you for joining our call today. And have a great day."

We have provided a supplemental slide presentation to support our comments on this call. It can be accessed in the Presentations and Webcasts section of the RPM website at www.rpminc.com. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Frank. \nFrank Sullivan: Thanks Matt. Good morning everyone. For those following the slides I'm going to start with slide three. We'll begin by discussing our high-level performance for the fourth quarter, after which Mike will provide details on our financial results, and Matt will provide a balance sheet and business update. Finally, Rusty will conclude our prepared remarks with our outlook after which we'll be pleased to answer your questions. Starting on slide three, you can see that in the fourth quarter we generated the sixth consecutive quarter of record sales and adjusted EBIT on top of the strong growth we achieved in the fourth quarter of last year. Importantly, we achieved these record results, at the same time, we generated record fourth quarter operating cash flow. In the time of economic uncertainty, we prioritize cash flow generation over P&L management, which resulted in cash flow from operations of $314 million, primarily through initiatives to normalize inventories and benefits from our MAP 2025 initiative. The strong cash flow allowed us to reduce debt by nearly $140 million during the quarter. Moving to slide four, the agility of our businesses demonstrated played an important role in achieving these record results. As an example several of our business repositioned to focus on engineered solutions for infrastructure and reshoring projects, which are the fastest-growing sectors in the construction industry. Our strategic focus on maintenance and repair, our differentiated service model, and the agility of our sales teams to find pockets of growth helped offset a decline in other new build construction sectors where volume declines were compounded by customer destocking. We have also improved our operational agility through our MAP 2025 program so we can quickly respond to demand changes. In our consumer group, our customers were holding leaner than normal inventories heading into the warm months when demand usually picks up. As is typical there was an increase in consumer takeaway late in the quarter and we were able to quickly fill these orders. Destocking was the driver of volume declines at our Specialty Products Group particularly in businesses serving OEM manufacturing. We faced additional profitability headwinds in this segment from continued cost inflation, FX, and initiatives we put in place to normalize our inventory which had a particularly pronounced impact on the SPG profitability. Turning to slide five. Looking at sales by geography. Sales growth was strongest in emerging markets where growth range between high single digits to high teens despite foreign currency headwinds. These regions are investing significantly in infrastructure in an area that we are well-positioned to serve. Europe declined nearly 2%, but excluding FX headwinds, Europe grew in the quarter, the first sign of improving performance after more than a year of challenging economic conditions. Despite the challenging second half fiscal 2023 was a solid one for RPM with sales up 8%, driving adjusted EBITDA nearly 19%. We finished the year with improving results in our Construction Products Group and in particular the Tremco Roofing division improving performance in Europe. The challenges of supply chain disruptions and customer inventory destocking, mostly now behind us; and finally an improving cost price/mix dynamic with major raw materials cycling down from historic highs. These dynamics indicate a strong start to our new 2024 fiscal year. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mike to cover our financial results in the quarter in more detail.\nMichael Laroche: Thanks, Frank. Starting on slide 6. Consolidated sales increased 1.6% to $2.02 billion, which was a fourth quarter record. Organic sales growth was 2.6% or $51.1 million, and acquisitions net of divestitures contributed 0.4% to sales or $8.4 million. FX decreased sales by 1.4% or $27.2 million. Consolidated adjusted EBIT was a fourth quarter record and increased 1.5% to $267.8 million. The growth was driven by sales increases, MAP 2025 benefits and consumer margins recovering towards historical averages following the supply chain disruptions of the prior year. We also took cost reduction actions in the fourth quarter in businesses with declining volumes, primarily in the SPG and CPG segments. While these actions had a modest impact on Q4 profitability they will have a more pronounced impact going forward. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.36 compared to $1.42 in the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by higher interest expense. Turning to segment results on slide 7. Our Construction Products Group achieved record fourth quarter net sales of $748 million, up slightly from the prior year period. Organic sales growth was 0.8% with acquisitions contributing 1% and foreign currency translation reducing sales by 1.5%. Sales growth was led by pricing increases and strength in concrete admixture and repair products, which benefited from infrastructure and reshoring related capital spending. Demand increased for restoration systems for roofing facades and parking structures, which benefited from its strategic focus on repair and maintenance differentiated service model. Demand was weak in new residential and certain commercial construction sectors, which included the negative impact of customer destocking. Adjusted EBIT was $124.5 million, an increase of 1.7% from the prior year period. Pricing increases and MAP 2025 benefits more than offset reduced fixed cost leverage from lower volumes and internal initiatives to reduce inventory. As I mentioned we took cost reduction actions at CPG in the fourth quarter. On the next slide, the Performance Coatings Group achieved another quarter of record net sales and adjusted EBIT. Revenue increased 8.8% to $358.4 million. Organic sales grew 10.4%, acquisition added 0.9% and foreign currency translation was a 2.5% headwind. Sales were driven by strong demand for the segment's engineered solutions for infrastructure and reshoring capital projects. Increased pricing and energy demand also contributed to the segment's growth. Adjusted EBIT increased 21.5% to a fourth quarter record of $51.7 million. The growth was driven by strong sales and MAP 2025 benefits. These results are on top of a strong prior year increase when adjusted EBIT grew 37.3%. Turning to slide 9. Specialty Products Group sales declined 14.3% from the prior year period to $193.4 million. Organic sales declined 12%, divestitures net of acquisitions reduced sales by 1.8% and foreign currency translation was a headwind of 0.5%. OEM demand was weak during the quarter due to a reduction in customer manufacturing activity, which was compounded by destocking. This segment faced a challenging comparison to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, when our disaster restoration business had strong sales as it made progress in resolving its microchip supply chain issues. During that quarter, SPG sales increased 11.4%. SPG also faced more challenging comparisons from the divestiture of the non-core furniture warranty business in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. SPG adjusted EBIT was $16.3 million or a decline of 63.1% compared to the prior year period. Unfavorable product mix and lower fixed cost leverage drove the decline and a $3.4 million expense related to the resolution of a legal matter also negatively impacted adjusted EBIT. Since SPG has the highest concentration of intercompany sales, it was most impacted by RPM's inventory normalization initiatives. We also took cost actions to align resources with demand levels during the quarter. Moving to slide 10. The consumer group grew sales 4.9% to a fourth quarter record of $716.4 million. Organic sales increased 5.6%, acquisitions contributed 0.3% and foreign currency translation was a headwind of 1%. The Consumer Group sales benefited from pricing increases in response to continued inflation. Volumes declined as consumer takeaway was lower in the quarter. However, as Frank described earlier, our ability to quickly respond to increased demand at the end of the quarter helped limit the volume declines. Additionally, we had some market share wins as we return to playing offense. We gained shelf space in aerosol paints and abrasives. And over the summer, we expect to continue to offer new products and innovation to the market. Adjusted EBIT increased 30.4% to $104.7 million. The successful implementation of MAP 2025 initiatives, as well as solid sales increases were key drivers of the increase in profitability and resulted in margins approaching historical averages following the supply chain disruptions of the prior year. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Matt to go over the balance sheet and cash flow and provide a business update.\nMatt Schlarb: Thank you, Mike. As Frank mentioned earlier, we prioritized cash flow during the quarter and the progress can be seen in our results on slide 11. We continue to make progress in reducing inventory both from inventory management and also structural improvements enabled by MAP 2025. We reduced inventories by $205.8 million in the fourth quarter. This played an important role in generating record fourth quarter cash flow from operations of $314.1 million during the quarter versus $22.8 million in the prior year, and we were building inventories to add resiliency to our supply chain. We funded these investments in our supply chain with debt so as working capital improved we reduced debt by nearly $140 million during the fourth quarter. We also have continued to return cash to shareholders during the fourth quarter. We paid $54.1 million in dividends and $12.5 million in share repurchases bringing our full fiscal year total in these two areas to a combined $263.9 million. Moving to slide 12. We've spoken several times about how our businesses are well positioned to provide engineered solutions for infrastructure projects, and I'll highlight a few of them. In Europe, the continent's busiest train station the Gare du Nord in Paris selected CPG's Flowcrete flooring systems for repairs in advance of the 2024 Olympics because of its durability, easy maintenance and ability to be installed during the six hours the station is closed each day. At hydroelectric plant in Manitoba, PCG's Carboline fire protection system was chosen because there's two component epoxy intumescent fire resistant material that required specifications was able to be applied off-site and can withstand the variable weather conditions of Northern Canada. In Australia, CPG Tremco was selected to repair and waterproof the Sydney Harbor Bridge tower because of its ability to provide a membrane waterproofing system that can be installed in a variety of temperatures cure within an hour of installation and has weather resistance. This slide shows a few examples of the many projects where we have provided engineered solution to infrastructure projects. We expect to continue benefiting in fiscal year 2024 as global investments to build and maintain infrastructure growth. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Rusty to cover the outlook.\nRusty Gordon: Thanks Matt. We'll start on slide 13. As we look forward to the first quarter many of the demand trends we saw in Q4 are expected to continue. Pricing is still expected to be positive, but with a lower year-over-year impact than this past fourth quarter as we lap some of the larger pricing increases implemented last summer. From a profitability standpoint MAP 2025 benefits are expected to continue, while several Q4 headwinds including FX, customer destocking, internal inventory normalization initiatives and inflation are expected to abate. Taking all this into account for the first quarter, we expect consolidated sales to increase in the low single-digit range and adjusted EBIT to increase in the high single-digit range. This would represent the seventh consecutive quarter of record sales and adjusted EBIT and is on top of a strong prior year comparison, when sales grew 17% and adjusted EBIT increased 33%. For sales by segment in the first quarter, CPG is expected to increase in the low single-digit percentage range. PCG is expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percentage range. SPG is expected to decrease in the high single-digit percentage range and consumer is expected to increase in the low single-digit percentage range. Moving to slide 14, as we think about the full year demand visibility remains limited and volatility by end-market makes longer-term forecasting challenging. That being said, our expectation is that our focus on repair and maintenance and strong position providing engineered solutions for reshoring and infrastructure projects we'll be able to offset potential weakness if there is a downturn in commercial construction sectors. Additionally, we expect to leverage our MAP 2025 initiatives to help expand margins. Our current expectation is there will be modest economic growth and we will achieve consolidated sales growth in the mid-single-digit range and adjusted EBIT growth in the low double-digit to mid-teen percentage range. Growth is expected to be strongest in the second half of the year, aided by less challenging comparisons as much of the unfavorable impact of destocking occurred in the second half of fiscal year 2023. This outlook assumes that we will not enter a recession in that FX and inflation pressures will continue to ease. By segment, we expect the following for fiscal year 2024. At CPG we expect continued share gains in concrete admixtures, continued momentum in roofing and stabilization in the residential sector with continued uncertainty in commercial construction. Once again, we benefit from our focus on reshoring infrastructure as well as on building maintenance and restoration. At PCG, we expect continued momentum driven by strength in reshoring, infrastructure and energy markets, even as the segment faces challenging comparisons after a year of strong growth in fiscal year 2023. We expect SPG to benefit from easy comparisons in the back half of the year as destocking headwinds abate and demand stabilizes. At Consumer, we expect the volume decline from the prior year to stabilize in the second half of the year with a continued benefit from pricing, but at a lower level than fiscal year 2023. The outlook I just provided is prior to a business transfer, and we made effective at the beginning of fiscal year 2024. On June 1st 2023, a few international businesses that had previously been a part of our CPG segment transferred to the PCG segment. This impact is relatively small with about $100 million of annual revenue, shifting from CPG to PCG. In October, you'll see this change reflected in our Q1 FY 2024 reporting, and we will provide the recast prior period financials for ease of comparability, starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Again, the outlook I just provided is on the old basis. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be pleased to answer your questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from John McNulty with BMO. Please go ahead with your question.\nJohn McNulty: Good morning, Frank. Thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on some really solid results. And I guess, one of the things I wanted to dig into to maybe better understand it a bit was I guess, when you were coming into this quarter there were expectations for the construction business to be under a reasonable \u2013 factors that putting up better sales than expected and as a result a better total numbers. I guess \u2013 can you help us to think about what was different from what you expected in terms of \u2013 was it just demand was stronger in certain sectors, or was the destocking less and you got better clarity on that as things kind of progress? I guess \u2013 how would you characterize the beat in construction relative to your original expectations?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I think it has to do with things that we've been talking about starting in the second quarter and certainly experience in Q3, and the destocking that we experienced what Rusty was calling the bullwhip effect of inventory was more pronounced across more of our businesses and segments than we had ever seen including construction products. And quite honestly, I think there was some hesitation once we made significant improvements in our inventory position. There is certainly more to come in the coming years but a big chunk of it happened this spring. And as the destocking more normalized inventory levels across most of our businesses, but in this case particularly in the distribution channels of construction products. And so as weather improved and economic activity picked up and also kind of our normal seasonal pickup in the Roofing division related to schools, as schools led out in May and early June, all resulted in a stronger finish, which seems to be continuing in the early parts of the summer. So the strength in Q4 really occurred towards the end of the quarter in our Construction Products business. And I think the destocking levels to more normalized or in some cases skinnier than usual inventory, not only construction products but other parts of our business are starting to show up in a positive way.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. Okay. No that's helpful and clear. I guess the second thing I wanted to just dig into was raw material deflation. It looks like it's kind of increasing or accelerating theme across the space. I guess, you guys are on a FIFO accounting method, so it takes a little bit longer to roll through. I guess, can you help us to think about raw material deflation in your fiscal 2024 guide and how that progresses as you kind of go through the year?\nMatt Schlarb: Sure, John. Yes this is Matt. So as we think about what we expect to see in the first quarter we'll probably have a little bit of benefit on our P&L from raw material deflation. And then as we move throughout the year, we're expecting it to be down in the mid-single-digit range. Now that's just for materials. We still have rising inflation in things like labor and some of the raw materials like packaging and TiO2 are sticky but that's how we're looking at it and that's included in our forecast for the year.\nFrank Sullivan: So I would add two more elements to that, John. One is as we experienced, and this has been typical for us in our industry, there is a lag as raw materials increase particularly, as dramatically as they did between the time of the increase and when we can get price. And then as that cycle comes down, we begin to pick up lost margin. And so we are at the beginning stages of that. Just to pick on one of our segments consumer, we still aren't back to pre-COVID levels of margin activity. So there's more to come in recovering those margins. Secondly, we'll continue to see gross margin improvement not only from cost price mix relative to improving raw material costs, but also from our MAP benefits which are real and had really good benefits for fiscal 2023. We'll continue with $120-some million or more in fiscal 2024. And they were masked in the second half of the year by lower volumes and the unabsorption hits we took in the second half of fiscal 2023 by deliberate production shutdowns and inventory adjustments. And so those two things should combine to demonstrate some pretty solid gross margin improvement in fiscal 2024. \nJohn McNulty: Great. Thanks very much for the color. I will get back in queue.\nOperator: Our next question will come from David Huang with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with question.\nDavid Huang: Hey, great. Good morning. Just on commercial construction, I guess, do you think the commercial construction activities hit the bottom? And I guess when do you expect those will recover? \nFrank Sullivan: Yes. I -- we don't have really good insight into that right now and we read the same headlines that everyone else does about tightening in the banking and regional banking market which have been critical providers of credit for commercial construction projects. So the guidance we provided does not anticipate any pickup or rebound in commercial construction activity per se. As I commented and Matt commented our sales forces have been able to adjust to really focus on where the dollars are being spent and the normal maintenance and repair activity of our Construction Products Group and roofing and facade restoration is picking back up again. And that's really driven by different dollars and different decision making the commercial construction. So we don't have good insight into that but we do not anticipate a pickup in commercial construction whether it's hospitality or office space anytime soon. \nDavid Huang: Okay. And then I guess for the full year guidance I know you're not assuming a recession. But if there is a mild recession I guess there's MAP. Can you comment on if there is any additional levers that you can pull to maybe achieve the low end of your guidance? \nFrank Sullivan: Sure. We have very deliberately invested in growing SG&A in a number of our businesses in particular consumer. I know that's a concern of some folks. I can tell you just an example advertising promotion and marketing activities in Q4 was up 70% from last year. Keep in mind last year was abnormally deflated because we had some supply chain challenges and there was no point in advertising or promoting to drive people to stores or the activity that we couldn't supply sufficiently. For the full year that category is up 54%. And so we are rebuilding across a lot of our businesses and in particular consumer those promotional advertising and marketing dollars. There are other discretionary areas where as the year progresses we see economic challenges beyond what we anticipate we can cut back. And so that's certainly there. I will tell you that in certain of our businesses, commercial construction that we just talked about in OEM, particularly, the OEM businesses that we serve in doors, kitchen cabinets, things that go into the housing market last four or five months in terms of volume sure feel recessionary to us. So hopefully that hit is being mitigated and we're starting to come out of it. Contrary to commercial construction, one area of positivity as we progress throughout the year though we're not seeing it yet is a pickup in residential construction which was a headwind for us for most of 2023. \nDavid Huang: Okay. Thank you. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Mike Harrison with Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead. \nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Mike.\nMike Harrison: Hi. Good morning. Congrats on a nice finish to the year. I wanted to follow up on your comments there on the resi construction. You called out a potential stabilization in residential markets as a positive for 2024. Can you give a little bit more color on the trends that you're seeing in your residential business, I guess, as it relates to both the new resi side, as well as repair and maintenance and small projects?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So we've become somewhat more exposed to residential new construction in our construction products group in particular for instance with Nudura has a sizable share in ICF in Canada and a growing share in the US and some of the products and for facades that we put on there. And we were struggling for the entire year starting in the middle of summer last year of fiscal 2023 as residential construction declined. And it was if you -- I believe the headline is kind of a value trap where people were stuck in their homes, because of rising interest rates and concerns not only about maybe they get a higher price for their home if they sell it, but they're going to have to pay a higher price for where they went. So you saw housing turnover slow down. But in terms of long-term trends, it's a funny dynamic because we are underserved by the rate of residential construction versus demand. We see that changing. And so a combination of easier comps as we go into 2024 for product lines that are high profit like Nudura and the sealants and coatings products that follow that, and I think a stabilization and as you see in the homebuilders anticipation of a pickup in new residential starts should serve us well.\nMike Harrison: All right. And then I guess maybe if you can give a little bit more detail on what's going on in your specialty business. This is where you seem to be seeing a lot of customer destocking also where you're seeing the heaviest internal destocking and fixed cost impact. Can you maybe just help us understand when those impacts are expected to stabilize or normalize?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So, again, especially our OEM tends to serve elements that actually go into the residential housing market as well. We still manufacture wood stains and finishes that go into doors, kitchen cabins. We have a particularly nice share with Amish Woodworking, again, which tends to go into residential whether it's furniture or kitchen cabinets or specialty wood. We go into the RV sector, which was hotter in COVID and then cooled off dramatically in the last year. So all of those have been down meaningfully. DayGlo is also a part of our Specialty Products Group and is really more of a specialty chemical company supplier. And if you follow what's happening with the more commodity or specialty chemical business in this raw material deflationary environment when it's just starting we're experiencing the same negative trend there. And then lastly, we divested this spring, the Guardian furniture warranty protection business, revenues but -- annually about $20 million. It's about $20 million in revenues but very high-margin business, but not core to RPM and found a good home for that business and that will annualize next year. But that was $20 million of lost revenue at a margin that was meaningfully higher than the SPG average.\nMike Harrison: All right. Thanks very much.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Jeff.\nJeff Zekauskas: Hi, good morning. Thanks very much. When you look at the results of PPG and Sherwin-Williams their gross margins this quarter are up about 400 basis points. And when you listen to them over a longer period of time, they're always focused on what their gross margin should be. And in the case of Sherwin, I think they want to be somewhere between, I don't know 46 and 48. And with RPM, your gross margins are up maybe close to a couple of hundred basis points this quarter. And in the old days you used to be in the low 40s, I don't know 42% something like that. Now you're not exactly a coatings company. Can you talk about why your gross margin expansion isn't this great? And do you have gross margin targets in the future? Can you get back to that 42% or 43% number? How do you feel about the gross margin?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. Jeff, that's a great question and it's an area of significant focus for RPM and our MAP '25 goals. So, first of all, you have to reset gross margin profitability in 2018 and we were aware of this for a couple of years prior, we were accounting for freight out differently than most of our peers. We incorporated it in SG&A, so it raised a number of questions about how come our SG&A is so high. So, we changed the accounting for that in 2018 by incorporating all of our freight into cost of goods sold. So, on that readjusted basis, our forever peak gross margin that used to be represented and you're correct in -- I think it peaked close to 43%, the equivalent is about 39 -- 39.8%, so almost 40%. And so that's the right way to think about where our peak gross margins were on an adjusted basis for that accounting allocation change. We have set a target of 42% in our MAP 2025 initiative. Clearly, we have ways to go. We are making really good progress in the original MAP initiative and then had significant step back like the whole industry did relative to rapidly rising inflation and the discontinuity of the supply chain challenges. We are experiencing similar dynamics to our coatings peers, but versus Sherwin-Williams we're on a FIFO accounting and they're on LIFO. So typically, our benefits would show up in our P&L, 60 to 75 days later. And so, I would expect you to see that. And lastly, you made the comment here which is correct. About 35% of RPM's revenues are driven by our Construction Products business nicely profitable, but different dynamics and different economic cycles than more pure-play coatings companies.\nJeff Zekauskas: Okay. Thank you for that. And then lastly, when you think about your level of inventories, the inventories really came down and benefited working capital. Are you at the right level? Do you think your inventories a year from now will be higher or lower, or it's just too difficult to tell?\nFrank Sullivan: So you sound like you've been party to some of our strategy discussions with our Board over the last year or so in the sense that there's two areas of great focus. One is gross profits, which we just talked about, and the other is working capital. And our working capital is not where it needs to be. We are -- I can probably talk about different elements of our success versus our peers in the broader market. In working capital, we are a laggard. And so there should be 300 or 400 basis points of working capital improvement out of RPM on a consistent basis over the next three to four years. And so, the working capital improvement we experienced this quarter, I think demonstrated a different RPM than maybe three or four years ago. We were able to turn off production and turn it back on even in our consumer business. We attitudinally we're able to communicate better to the Street and internally about -- it's not that we're not concerned about, but the absorption hits that we took were the right things to do. And if we take more absorption hits by aligning our operations and the efficiency of our operations, you will see working capital continue to improve. And so, I think that's also a very smart question in an area that's gotten a lot of attention over the last 1.5 years with our Board. You're seeing the benefits of the MAP '25 program and the good cash conversion cycle in Q4, but there is significantly more to come. And again, it's an area where versus our peers, we are 300 or 400 basis points behind the curve.\nJeff Zekauskas: Great. Thank you, so much.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nVincent Andrews: Thank you. Good morning everyone. Just wanted to tie together your comments about the consumer demand picking up sort of seasonally as the quarter progressed. Can you give us a little color as you have in the past about what you're seeing in terms of point of sale versus what you're actually selling in? And just help us understand if the point of sale is improving I think last quarter you said it was still running down low to mid-single digits but sort of is that is that gap narrowing between what your customers are doing and what their customers are doing? \nFrank Sullivan: Sure. The last unit volume sales that were positive were in the first quarter of last year. And we experienced negative unit volume or negative consumer takeaway in most of our consumer product lines and businesses throughout the rest of fiscal 2023. And it was high single-digits or low double-digits this spring. Part of it was a function of consumer takeaway and changes in consumer spending patterns. Again things you can read about headlines about more experiences and less DIY stuff post COVID. Part of it was aggressive destocking and/or inventory adjustments within our supply chain relative to the supply chain disruptions and inventory challenges in all types of areas including for our consumer businesses. And so I think by the time we got into the spring a lot of that customer inventory destocking or rightsizing and a lot of our own supply chain issues were behind us. It doesn't mean we won't see those things in the future relative to supply chains that have happened in consumer. But a lot of that corrected. And while consumer takeaway was still negative in the fourth quarter it was improved from the last product from the two prior quarters. So, we're seeing the consumer week-by-week picking up and I would expect us to be positive sometime this fall in part because of what we're seeing in part because of the new products we're introducing some market share gains and also we'll be annualizing some easier comps in terms of negative consumer takeaway. \nVincent Andrews: Okay. And if I could just follow up on the 2024 fiscal 2024 sort of the shape of the year and maybe if you want to comment on specific segments it seems like that there's going to be kind of a bit of a handoff between the residual price that's in the system the residual destocking maybe in the first half of the fiscal year? And then the back half of the year it seems like you're anticipating more of a volume recovery and then less pricing and then presumably to the EBIT line you're going to see more of the deflation that we've been talking about. Is that the right way to think about the shape of the fiscal quarter? \nRusty Gordon: Yes, that's right Vincent. This is Rusty here. The first half of fiscal 2023 we obviously have more difficult comps with sales up double digits and EBIT up in mid-30% range in the first half of fiscal 2023. We did suffer of course as well in the back half of 2023 from the under-absorption as we made a conscious effort to throttle back production. So, as a result yes we do expect as fiscal 2024 goes on that we will see pickup in the growth as we face some easier comparisons. \nVincent Andrews: Thank you very much.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning Steve.\nSteve Byrne: Good morning Frank. This $100 million of sales of businesses between CPG and PCG what's the logic behind that? And maybe more broadly given both of those segments benefit from reshoring and infrastructure is there potential logic in combining them having at least at a commercial level where you could potentially drive more cross-selling between these businesses within the two segments? What do you think of that?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. And again another really kind of sharp strategic question. So, particularly, in the developed world, PCG, our Performance Coatings Group and our Construction Products Group had relatively small and needing more investment operations in places like the Middle East, elements of Africa, India, and Southeast Asia. And rather than go it alone, what we've done is taking a platform approach. We have a particularly sharp management team out of South Africa, the leader there is a gentleman named Grant Boonzaier. He is a PCG leader runs their platform group. But because of the dynamics there and his success and the success of his team, they have become the platform in South Africa for Rust-Oleum that had a business there for our construction products group so Tremco and Euclid concrete repair products. And then the original businesses that they've had there for many years which were Carboline and Stonhard. We've taken that model and again Grant is part of PCG, and we have taken the construction products group businesses in the Middle East and Africa, the Construction Products group in India and the Construction Products Group business in Southeast Asia and they are operating on a more combined basis as you're suggesting in those developing countries. We are investing in new facilities in Southeast Asia and in India that will serve multiple product lines. And all of those businesses will now report to Grant Boonzaier. So they have shifted from reporting to the Construction Products group to reporting to what we consider the developing world platform approach and that's part of our PCG. So that's the primary driver of that $100 million shift in revenues. We would expect it to drive synergies on cost, synergies in a way of expanding revenues more quickly than if they operated on their own and improving unit margins there. Last comment I would make on that, this will have no effect whatsoever on our consolidated results or guidance.\nSteve Byrne: Okay. And Frank, can you remind me on in consumer, do you still provide guidance to I believe it's Home Depot as a product category leader in and maybe aerosol paint is one of them. And I ask about this are these positions that you have with them in particular categories enabling you to have more pricing power and/or enabling more share gains?\nFrank Sullivan: So first of all, we are great partners with all of our retail customers and we are the leader in our small-project paint category in every major customer that you can think of and in every major channel. The only exception is one that you would easily gather which is Sherwin-Williams Paint Stores. And so we are a partner in understanding consumer takeaway and analyzing profitability. And so that's been true for many years and continues that really doesn't drive profitability. What drives profitability is innovation, new products and the strength of our brands. And so for example, this spring and we're just advertising it now, Rust-Oleum introduced a five in one spray cap. It's patented. It was first introduced into their primary stop thrust category. You'll see that patented five in one spray tip. So it allows a consumer to adjust the spray to get a fan spray, or a narrow spray, a light spray, fan up and down pretty unique product that will be introduced across more of the product line. DAP has introduced a number of new products taking the benefits of a two-component foam and putting it in one can and that will be a consumer -- like a heavy consumer or a Pro product. We're coming out with some other products for popcorn ceiling spray which has so far been dominated by a single supplier and we intend to become a major player in that space as well. So I think it's innovation and new product introductions and the strength of brands that allows us to maintain price levels more so than the size of our business or the relationship we have with the customers in terms of understanding consumer dynamics.\nSteve Byrne: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Ghansham.\nGhansham Panjabi: Good morning, Frank. So Frank last quarter, you basically qualify the current operating environment as a good old-fashioned recession. This was back in April. Just curious as to your updated thoughts on what your -- how you would qualify the current backdrop, you touched on new home construction or residential as a whole, but any other categories that are either better or worse relative to what you saw maybe three months ago?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. Well, three months ago and for that -- the three months prior, it was looking back and as we sat there in April, when consumer takeaway is mid to high single digits negative when you're a specialty products group and your construction products group that serve elements of the residential market in North America are negative in terms of unit volume sure felt like a recession to us. With the exception of the Specialty Products Group companies we have seen improvement in the rest of our portfolio. And so while we're still negative consumer takeaway, it's much more modest than it was for a period of five or six months. We actually saw an uptick at the end of the quarter in our Construction Products Group particularly in the Roofing division and waterproofing. And we see signs that, the challenges in the residential construction market which were driven by a bunch of different dynamics are changing for the better this summer and we anticipate going into the rest of the year. So -- we're red lights are turning into yellow lights and in a few places even green lights which is a nicer place to be than where we were how we felt just a few three or four months ago. And I guess lastly, I'd say, I credit our operating people in our MAP program because our ability to adjust to these dynamics as quickly as we did is way better than it used to be.\nGhansham Panjabi: Got it. And then as it relates to the construction segment specific to the fourth quarter and the margin upside there relative to the few quarters prior to that when they were declining year-over-year. What drove that significant increase in the fourth quarter specifically?\nFrank Sullivan: Much like my earlier comment on consumer but also here. We were within our supply chain and internally dealing with inventory challenges and destocking across our distribution for construction products and internally and that seems to have corrected itself. And I think there was some anticipation that things were moving in the right direction. The question was whether we were going to experience that in May or June. And we had a few distributors that were hinting at, a, we can boost some product if you discount. And I think we held our pricing and held our discipline. And let's say, everybody held their breath until they needed inventory and it started showing up in May. And that positive trend is continuing as we enter the first quarter.\nGhansham Panjabi: Got it. And then just one final question. So as it relates to your fiscal year 2024 construct you're basically guiding towards 3x operating leverage relative to your sales guidance, is the delta between what you're guiding towards for fiscal year 2024 versus what you would typically have in terms of operating leverage? Is the delta purely MAP, or is it also a contribution from raw materials deflation? \nFrank Sullivan: It's a combination of both as I commented earlier. When you look at our cycle and we experienced this as our industry did we're behind the curve in terms of catching up with raw material prices particularly during this cycle as quickly as they went up. And so we are experiencing deflation versus the prior period and versus now for the first time in the prior year. But we're not back to the margin profile in a few of our businesses that we were pre-COVID. And so we've got work to do there. So a part of it will be the benefits of that cost price mix moving positively and we're starting to see that as is our industry. And the other benefits and we talked about it we're talking about MAP we're doing the right things on the ground. We talked about $120 million plus of benefits in fiscal 2023. It was hard to find. We had $50 million of unabsorbed hits in our gross profit in our P&L in the second half of last year as a result of lower volume marketwise, but also the production shutdowns to right-size inventories internally. And so those MAP benefits covered a lot of that in a rising unit volume environment, which we're working hard to get back to and open for you'll start to see those MAP benefits add to that margin expansion. So those are the two dynamics, that will drive a pretty meaningful margin expansion, on what we anticipate to be relatively modest revenue growth at least for the first half of the year.\nGhansham Panjabi: Got it. Thank you, Frank\nOperator: And our next question will come from Josh Spector with UBS. Please go ahead. \nA \u2013 Frank Sullivan: Good morning., Josh.\nJosh Spector: Hi, -- Just a \u2013 Hi, good morning. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. First, can you just talk -- what was pricing in the fourth quarter? And what's your assumption for the first quarter? \nRusty Gordon : Sure. In terms of pricing in the fourth quarter, it was in between 9% and 10% for an impact. And in the first quarter, we would expect that to diminish somewhat because it will be lapping the anniversary of the major catch-up selling price increases that were done in the consumer segment, in the first quarter of 2023. We still do have price increases going up most days at RPM and various product lines, more modest of course, than we saw last year when we had the rampant inflation. But we'll continue to get selling price benefits, just more modest. \nJosh Spector: Thanks. And just on under-absorption, you made some comments I believe when talking about construction and specialty that you expect the impact to get larger into the first quarter and maybe the first half. I guess, is that just the roll-through of that cost through inventory, or are you actually ramping up efforts? And just, what's the quantum that you're baking into your guide for first half or further underabsorption impact? Thanks.\nA \u2013 Frank Sullivan: Yes, I don't expect them to be larger in fiscal 2024 than they were in 2023. In fact, they'll be smaller particularly in the second half. But we'll still have some level of unabsorption until we're positive unit volume everywhere. And we still will have some level of unabsorption, where we're continuing to adjust down inventory levels. As I commented earlier, we have more to do. But on the full year, we had $60 million or $70 million of unabsorbed costs, we would have substantially less than that in fiscal 2024, unless we bump into some unanticipated economic challenges. \nJosh Spector: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. \nMike Sison: Hi, guys.\nA \u2013 Frank Sullivan: Hi, Mike\nMike Sison: Congrats, again on a nice quarter and outlook. As I recall, Wave two is something like $160 million or so in MAP savings. And if I did the math, for your growth for 2024 versus 2023 it's kind of like all of it and then some, right? So, it doesn't seem like there's a lot of deflation in that number. It looks like you're going to have some volume growth. So, I mean am I doing the math right? Is there -- it seems like your outlook could be a little bit conservative. \nRusty Gordon: Well, in terms of the outlook, the outlook is for volume declines to be modest in Q1 and then start to turn around as we get into Q2. And as Frank mentioned, we will see MAP benefits that we didn't see last year, because they were masked by underabsorption. So for that reason, we did have an outlook where the full year is actually better in the last nine months, in total compared to the first quarter. \nA \u2013 Frank Sullivan: Sure. And Mike, I would add to that just -- and we commented on this earlier. Some of our peers have had the same type of strong performance over a period of time, but not all of them have. Our Q1 of last year sales were up 17% including a lot of unit volume growth, and EBIT was up 33%. In Q2, sales were up 9% and adjusted EBIT was up 36%. So -- and those were all-time records. So, we got some big mountains to climb, in the first half of the year. I think we're confident, with what we see that we're going to be generating sales growth and EBIT growth, but more modest for the reasons that Rusty mentioned, and the dynamics that we're slowly growing out of and more modest in comparison to the prior year where we just had big numbers. And as we -- we were all high-fiving in October of last year, because unit volume growth was solid everywhere and our MAP-driven leverage was really good. And then, boy the bottom fell out of a couple of our businesses starting in November and December, and that's what we communicated in January and in the spring. I think it's a combination of improving economics. And as I mentioned earlier, a more agile organization than maybe we were four or five years ago.\nMike Sison: Okay. Thank you.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from John Roberts with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Morning, John.\nJohn Roberts: Morning. Back to the new product comments on consumer, I think, you lost some share because of the alkyd shortage during the pandemic. Do you have any data on category growth versus your growth or something that might suggest you regained some share?\nRusty Gordon: Yeah. We have picked up small-project paint share at a major home center this spring. So, share has gone up for us in small project paint if that's what you're referring to.\nFrank Sullivan: Yeah. We -- and this is news from last year, we lost a portion of spray paint business to Baird Home Depot. In some cases it was elimination of Universal, which is one of the more high-performing products. We've been able to reposition their product in other parts of our channels and we are making up in that category for instance almost the entirety of what was lost in that transition. And as Rusty said, we picked up share on shelf with some other major retailers. So, we're back to playing offense in our consumer business. Boy, a year ago we had supply chain challenges. We had our own operating challenges that we were addressing. I think that had as much as anything to do with the market share loss at a major customer. Those issues have been corrected. We have more than enough capacity to take on more business our spending in advertising and promotion some on normal TV a lot more online. And so, we're playing offense in terms of introducing new products, going after share and having the volume to be aggressive in ways that we didn't just a year ago.\nJohn Roberts: And then, on PCG, I think you highlighted the energy customers with the lower energy prices I thought those customers probably had pulled back.\nFrank Sullivan: We're still seeing solid growth in the energy markets whether it's gas and fracking. Interestingly enough, there has been a resurgence in some offshore production. And so, while there's been some volatility in oil prices per se with slowdowns in China persisting longer than people thought, I think the geopolitical issues and where the energy companies are suggest to us at least for the next year that that will continue to be a relatively solid area for business.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Hey, Frank.\nFrank Mitsch: Hey, Frank. Hey good morning. Good morning, Frank. Hey, Rusty. Last conference call you said that your best days were ahead in terms of cash flow. And obviously this quarter delivered on that. And obviously the inventory question has been discussed at nauseam, but the net debt has come down as well. So it pegs the question you bought back $12.5 million the last couple of quarters. How are you thinking about use of cash buybacks versus M&A in the current environment?\nRusty Gordon: Yeah in terms of share repurchase, it has been modest with all the economic uncertainties over the last couple of years and with COVID of course before that. The biggest potential use will be if we run into bigger acquisitions. We've been doing smaller acquisitions over the last couple of years with multiples being out of whack. As you know we're very disciplined in the prices we pay. And as a result of the inflated expectations those acquisitions have come in light. But you are correct. If acquisitions stay relatively small, we will have the ability to enlarge from the minimal level of share repurchase.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So, I think directionally we would expect maybe $50 million of share repurchases next year and then would be somewhat opportunistic relative to market dynamics. We will be favoring debt reduction in small transactions. The M&A markets both globally for big M&A and on the smaller scale have dropped dramatically. And part of that was expectations of sellers to get multiples from a year or two ago on earnings from a year or two ago. And I think there's been good discipline on the buy side again big global deals as well as small to midsized mid-market deals. And you'll see I think a capitulation at some point relative to the interest rate environment and higher cost of capital in general, but also the higher cost of incremental capital. I think some of the M&A valuations were relatively undisciplined. Some of that came out of private equity, because for a period of time your incremental cost of capital was practically zero. That's not true anymore. And so, if we can -- we will certainly utilize free cash flow to reduce debt improve our balance sheet modestly repurchased stock. I think it's likely that when our Board meets in October, we'll increase our dividend for the 50th consecutive year that will be a nice milestone, and then position our balance sheet to take advantage of opportunities when they show up at the right price.\nFrank Mitsch: Got you. Very helpful. And Frank you indicated that Europe, ex FX was actually up a little bit in the fourth quarter, here we are seven weeks or so into the first quarter. What are you seeing in Europe? What are your expectations for that region?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. It's a great question, and I appreciate you're picking up on that. Europe hurt us in terms of sales and earnings for five or six quarters in a row. And we saw an uptick at the end of Q4 and that's continuing. It's modest, like everything that we're seeing is modest, but it's modest and it's modest in the positive direction. So we're seeing sales moving in the right direction. We're seeing margin expansion. We're also doing a -- I wouldn't call it reorganization but a focus on Europe and have one of our top executives actually moving there and take responsibility for accelerating some of the MAP programs in Europe, which is lagging the MAP initiatives that we've done in North America. And the underlying dynamic there is a positive revenue growth and some margin expansion in Europe, which we haven't seen for five or six quarters. So, there's a lot of points of light or shoots of growth that we're seeing. And the key for us and I guess my caveat to all of that would be none of us have ever experienced a more volatile period of time than we've seen over the last two or three years. Normally, I would get excited about a three-month trend and projected into the future given the whip size that we've all seen in the last two or three years, we're going to -- we'll get excited about a trend when it feels like it's five or six months in a row.\nFrank Mitsch: Got you. Thanks so much.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Aleksey Yefremov with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nAleksey Yefremov: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Hey Frank, I think you historically talked about infrastructure uplift mostly in calendar 2024, but I think you mentioned some more of the wins just on this call. Are you seeing acceleration in this end market in the US in particular?\nFrank Sullivan: We are seeing benefits from onshoring. We've long been a provider of fireproofing coatings and specialty flooring into the tech sector and there's significant investments there. We're seeing onshoring in other areas. And so that is benefiting us. You're seeing highway marine different areas where you're seeing pretty good investment. And so we participate in all those markets. And I'm a little bit hesitant, because the amount of money in a $1.2 trillion infrastructure build, it's hard to track where all that is. And over what period of time it's going to flow through, but it's certainly a positive tailwind for our Performance Coatings Group and portions of our Construction Products Group.\nAleksey Yefremov : Thanks, Frank. And then another question on pricing. How is competitive environment, especially in the areas where you have to bid on projects has it been disciplined so far?\nFrank Sullivan : Sure. Historically, we've been able to hold on to most of our price, and most of our businesses. The categories where that has not been true have been more commodity pass-throughs. So, in some areas of silicones, we had a lot of value in the more commodity space of silicones, we package it and sell it through, and silicone prices rose dramatically. We thought to kind of catch up on price, that's true in our Construction Products Group and in the silicone portion of our DAP business. And as silicone prices have dropped, our prices have moderated as well. Probably the only other area where I would tell you historically, we've seen prices go up and down is in the highway portion of infrastructure pretty highly competitive there. And so you'll see prices go up and go down based on the underlying core raw materials to some of those systems. But other than that historically, we've been able to hold on price, and that's what we're doing at this point. As I said we've got some lost margin to pick up, and I would expect that to continue for the foreseeable future.\nAleksey Yefremov: Thanks, Frank.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan : Good morning, Kevin.\nKevin McCarthy: Good morning. How are you?\nFrank Sullivan : Good. Thank you.\nKevin McCarthy: To come back to the subject of cash generation. It sounds like you have some ongoing benefit from reduction of inventory. So can you comment on the working capital that you might be able to extract in fiscal 2024 as well as your capital expenditure budget for the year? \nFrank Sullivan : The CapEx budget for the year Rusty.\nRusty Gordon : Yes, it will be in line with where we were in fiscal 2023.\nFrank Sullivan : The $250 million or so. Yes. And then on working capital, I think, I'd rather report our achievements in hindsight other than the comment I made earlier, which is we have a goal of improving our working capital as a percent of sales by 300 or 400 basis points over the next three to four years. And so if you just do the simple math call it, 100 basis points a year maybe we can do a little bit better than that. But if you apply that 300 or 400 basis points as a percent of sales, you can get a pretty good sense of the additional cash flow that we should be able to generate on top of what we would generate based on revenue growth and our profit margin profitability. And it's a function of us getting better more efficient and our team is doing a really good job on the MAP 2025 initiatives, and the fact that we are an underperformer in this area. So, versus our peers there is efficiencies that we are gaining that we have not had in the past. That's our challenge and it's something we're up for today relative to the disciplines we have and the approach we have now with MS-168 and a more center-led approach to our operations than what we had at RPM five years ago. \nKevin McCarthy: That's very helpful. I appreciate the comments. \nFrank Sullivan : Thanks, Kevin.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question here will come from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan : Good morning, Arun.\nArun Viswanathan: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the strong results and the favorable outlook here. So in listening to your comments, it sounds like there were a couple of positive drivers maybe slightly better infrastructure and reshoring activity some price holding price cost a little bit better as well. And then your own MAP gains as well. Is that accurate maybe as the top 3? And then if you were to kind of see, how that moves forward are there further improvements in each of those categories that you expect or is it maybe a recovery in commercial and some other weak parts that would be bigger drivers? Thanks.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So I think you got that right. I would add that some of the more solid or stable business activity we're seeing is a result of this bullwhip inventory effect and supply chain challenge that we saw more broadly across our businesses than we've ever seen before. And so excess inventories or having the wrong inventory in the wrong places because people overbought during a period of time where they couldn't get stuff that's been corrected. And it's been corrected perfectly? No. And is there's still adjustments here and there both at RPM and with our supply chain that will occur? Yes. But the biggest chunk of that has been corrected. So now there is a normalized demand that's serving we think an improving market in the construction area, an improving consumer takeaway although it's still modestly negative as we sit here today. And so those are the dynamics. I think that's right. So going forward improvement in the underlying dynamics. And then lastly, assuming that we avoid recession substantially easier comps for the RPM businesses and substantially better leverage capabilities if we have positive unit volume in the second half of the year. If we have a positive unit volume in the second half of the year versus what we experience this year and the internal challenges that we undertook to drive cash flow you'll see nice margin expansion. So those are the dynamics to think about for the year. \nArun Viswanathan: Great. And then sorry if you already addressed this. But on the MAP gains, did you provide an actual dollar number that will maybe flow through in fiscal '24 out of that $160 million? And if it's less than say $120 million or something and then would it be the remaining $40 million in fiscal '25 or how should we think about what actually flows to the P&L? \nFrank Sullivan: The original guide we provided on the Investor Day a little more than a year ago was $160 million for fiscal '24. And some of that's on the if come. In other words, as we realize it throughout the year it is an ongoing sustainable basis. And so we'll report on that on a quarterly basis as we get through the year. But I would expect to realize over $100 million in our P&L in fiscal '24. And on a run rate by the end of the year we will -- if we hit our targets, we'll have achieved on a run rate of $160 million. That's the plan. But again given our momentum and where we are I would expect it to at least $100 million to flow through the P&L during the year.\nArun Viswanathan: Great. Thank you.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Frank Sullivan for any closing remarks.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you, Joe and thank you to everybody for your participation on our call today. We're excited about improving business dynamics throughout RPM in combination with the effective execution of our MAP 2025 program. We look forward to updating you on our first quarter results and talking about our dividend activity and our outlook for the balance of the year, when we're together again in October. Enjoy the rest of your summer and have a great day. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you very much for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rusty Gordon",
            "content": "Thanks Matt. We'll start on slide 13. As we look forward to the first quarter many of the demand trends we saw in Q4 are expected to continue. Pricing is still expected to be positive, but with a lower year-over-year impact than this past fourth quarter as we lap some of the larger pricing increases implemented last summer. From a profitability standpoint MAP 2025 benefits are expected to continue, while several Q4 headwinds including FX, customer destocking, internal inventory normalization initiatives and inflation are expected to abate. Taking all this into account for the first quarter, we expect consolidated sales to increase in the low single-digit range and adjusted EBIT to increase in the high single-digit range. This would represent the seventh consecutive quarter of record sales and adjusted EBIT and is on top of a strong prior year comparison, when sales grew 17% and adjusted EBIT increased 33%. For sales by segment in the first quarter, CPG is expected to increase in the low single-digit percentage range. PCG is expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percentage range. SPG is expected to decrease in the high single-digit percentage range and consumer is expected to increase in the low single-digit percentage range. Moving to slide 14, as we think about the full year demand visibility remains limited and volatility by end-market makes longer-term forecasting challenging. That being said, our expectation is that our focus on repair and maintenance and strong position providing engineered solutions for reshoring and infrastructure projects we'll be able to offset potential weakness if there is a downturn in commercial construction sectors. Additionally, we expect to leverage our MAP 2025 initiatives to help expand margins. Our current expectation is there will be modest economic growth and we will achieve consolidated sales growth in the mid-single-digit range and adjusted EBIT growth in the low double-digit to mid-teen percentage range. Growth is expected to be strongest in the second half of the year, aided by less challenging comparisons as much of the unfavorable impact of destocking occurred in the second half of fiscal year 2023. This outlook assumes that we will not enter a recession in that FX and inflation pressures will continue to ease. By segment, we expect the following for fiscal year 2024. At CPG we expect continued share gains in concrete admixtures, continued momentum in roofing and stabilization in the residential sector with continued uncertainty in commercial construction. Once again, we benefit from our focus on reshoring infrastructure as well as on building maintenance and restoration. At PCG, we expect continued momentum driven by strength in reshoring, infrastructure and energy markets, even as the segment faces challenging comparisons after a year of strong growth in fiscal year 2023. We expect SPG to benefit from easy comparisons in the back half of the year as destocking headwinds abate and demand stabilizes. At Consumer, we expect the volume decline from the prior year to stabilize in the second half of the year with a continued benefit from pricing, but at a lower level than fiscal year 2023. The outlook I just provided is prior to a business transfer, and we made effective at the beginning of fiscal year 2024. On June 1st 2023, a few international businesses that had previously been a part of our CPG segment transferred to the PCG segment. This impact is relatively small with about $100 million of annual revenue, shifting from CPG to PCG. In October, you'll see this change reflected in our Q1 FY 2024 reporting, and we will provide the recast prior period financials for ease of comparability, starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Again, the outlook I just provided is on the old basis. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be pleased to answer your questions. Yes, that's right Vincent. This is Rusty here. The first half of fiscal 2023 we obviously have more difficult comps with sales up double digits and EBIT up in mid-30% range in the first half of fiscal 2023. We did suffer of course as well in the back half of 2023 from the under-absorption as we made a conscious effort to throttle back production. So, as a result yes we do expect as fiscal 2024 goes on that we will see pickup in the growth as we face some easier comparisons. Sure. In terms of pricing in the fourth quarter, it was in between 9% and 10% for an impact. And in the first quarter, we would expect that to diminish somewhat because it will be lapping the anniversary of the major catch-up selling price increases that were done in the consumer segment, in the first quarter of 2023. We still do have price increases going up most days at RPM and various product lines, more modest of course, than we saw last year when we had the rampant inflation. But we'll continue to get selling price benefits, just more modest. Well, in terms of the outlook, the outlook is for volume declines to be modest in Q1 and then start to turn around as we get into Q2. And as Frank mentioned, we will see MAP benefits that we didn't see last year, because they were masked by underabsorption. So for that reason, we did have an outlook where the full year is actually better in the last nine months, in total compared to the first quarter. \nA \u2013 Frank Sullivan: Sure. And Mike, I would add to that just -- and we commented on this earlier. Some of our peers have had the same type of strong performance over a period of time, but not all of them have. Our Q1 of last year sales were up 17% including a lot of unit volume growth, and EBIT was up 33%. In Q2, sales were up 9% and adjusted EBIT was up 36%. So -- and those were all-time records. So, we got some big mountains to climb, in the first half of the year. I think we're confident, with what we see that we're going to be generating sales growth and EBIT growth, but more modest for the reasons that Rusty mentioned, and the dynamics that we're slowly growing out of and more modest in comparison to the prior year where we just had big numbers. And as we -- we were all high-fiving in October of last year, because unit volume growth was solid everywhere and our MAP-driven leverage was really good. And then, boy the bottom fell out of a couple of our businesses starting in November and December, and that's what we communicated in January and in the spring. I think it's a combination of improving economics. And as I mentioned earlier, a more agile organization than maybe we were four or five years ago. Yeah. We have picked up small-project paint share at a major home center this spring. So, share has gone up for us in small project paint if that's what you're referring to. Yeah in terms of share repurchase, it has been modest with all the economic uncertainties over the last couple of years and with COVID of course before that. The biggest potential use will be if we run into bigger acquisitions. We've been doing smaller acquisitions over the last couple of years with multiples being out of whack. As you know we're very disciplined in the prices we pay. And as a result of the inflated expectations those acquisitions have come in light. But you are correct. If acquisitions stay relatively small, we will have the ability to enlarge from the minimal level of share repurchase. Yes, it will be in line with where we were in fiscal 2023."

            "content": "Thanks, Frank. Starting on slide 6. Consolidated sales increased 1.6% to $2.02 billion, which was a fourth quarter record. Organic sales growth was 2.6% or $51.1 million, and acquisitions net of divestitures contributed 0.4% to sales or $8.4 million. FX decreased sales by 1.4% or $27.2 million. Consolidated adjusted EBIT was a fourth quarter record and increased 1.5% to $267.8 million. The growth was driven by sales increases, MAP 2025 benefits and consumer margins recovering towards historical averages following the supply chain disruptions of the prior year. We also took cost reduction actions in the fourth quarter in businesses with declining volumes, primarily in the SPG and CPG segments. While these actions had a modest impact on Q4 profitability they will have a more pronounced impact going forward. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.36 compared to $1.42 in the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by higher interest expense. Turning to segment results on slide 7. Our Construction Products Group achieved record fourth quarter net sales of $748 million, up slightly from the prior year period. Organic sales growth was 0.8% with acquisitions contributing 1% and foreign currency translation reducing sales by 1.5%. Sales growth was led by pricing increases and strength in concrete admixture and repair products, which benefited from infrastructure and reshoring related capital spending. Demand increased for restoration systems for roofing facades and parking structures, which benefited from its strategic focus on repair and maintenance differentiated service model. Demand was weak in new residential and certain commercial construction sectors, which included the negative impact of customer destocking. Adjusted EBIT was $124.5 million, an increase of 1.7% from the prior year period. Pricing increases and MAP 2025 benefits more than offset reduced fixed cost leverage from lower volumes and internal initiatives to reduce inventory. As I mentioned we took cost reduction actions at CPG in the fourth quarter. On the next slide, the Performance Coatings Group achieved another quarter of record net sales and adjusted EBIT. Revenue increased 8.8% to $358.4 million. Organic sales grew 10.4%, acquisition added 0.9% and foreign currency translation was a 2.5% headwind. Sales were driven by strong demand for the segment's engineered solutions for infrastructure and reshoring capital projects. Increased pricing and energy demand also contributed to the segment's growth. Adjusted EBIT increased 21.5% to a fourth quarter record of $51.7 million. The growth was driven by strong sales and MAP 2025 benefits. These results are on top of a strong prior year increase when adjusted EBIT grew 37.3%. Turning to slide 9. Specialty Products Group sales declined 14.3% from the prior year period to $193.4 million. Organic sales declined 12%, divestitures net of acquisitions reduced sales by 1.8% and foreign currency translation was a headwind of 0.5%. OEM demand was weak during the quarter due to a reduction in customer manufacturing activity, which was compounded by destocking. This segment faced a challenging comparison to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, when our disaster restoration business had strong sales as it made progress in resolving its microchip supply chain issues. During that quarter, SPG sales increased 11.4%. SPG also faced more challenging comparisons from the divestiture of the non-core furniture warranty business in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. SPG adjusted EBIT was $16.3 million or a decline of 63.1% compared to the prior year period. Unfavorable product mix and lower fixed cost leverage drove the decline and a $3.4 million expense related to the resolution of a legal matter also negatively impacted adjusted EBIT. Since SPG has the highest concentration of intercompany sales, it was most impacted by RPM's inventory normalization initiatives. We also took cost actions to align resources with demand levels during the quarter. Moving to slide 10. The consumer group grew sales 4.9% to a fourth quarter record of $716.4 million. Organic sales increased 5.6%, acquisitions contributed 0.3% and foreign currency translation was a headwind of 1%. The Consumer Group sales benefited from pricing increases in response to continued inflation. Volumes declined as consumer takeaway was lower in the quarter. However, as Frank described earlier, our ability to quickly respond to increased demand at the end of the quarter helped limit the volume declines. Additionally, we had some market share wins as we return to playing offense. We gained shelf space in aerosol paints and abrasives. And over the summer, we expect to continue to offer new products and innovation to the market. Adjusted EBIT increased 30.4% to $104.7 million. The successful implementation of MAP 2025 initiatives, as well as solid sales increases were key drivers of the increase in profitability and resulted in margins approaching historical averages following the supply chain disruptions of the prior year. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Matt to go over the balance sheet and cash flow and provide a business update."

            "name": "Frank Sullivan",
            "content": "Thanks Matt. Good morning everyone. For those following the slides I'm going to start with slide three. We'll begin by discussing our high-level performance for the fourth quarter, after which Mike will provide details on our financial results, and Matt will provide a balance sheet and business update. Finally, Rusty will conclude our prepared remarks with our outlook after which we'll be pleased to answer your questions. Starting on slide three, you can see that in the fourth quarter we generated the sixth consecutive quarter of record sales and adjusted EBIT on top of the strong growth we achieved in the fourth quarter of last year. Importantly, we achieved these record results, at the same time, we generated record fourth quarter operating cash flow. In the time of economic uncertainty, we prioritize cash flow generation over P&L management, which resulted in cash flow from operations of $314 million, primarily through initiatives to normalize inventories and benefits from our MAP 2025 initiative. The strong cash flow allowed us to reduce debt by nearly $140 million during the quarter. Moving to slide four, the agility of our businesses demonstrated played an important role in achieving these record results. As an example several of our business repositioned to focus on engineered solutions for infrastructure and reshoring projects, which are the fastest-growing sectors in the construction industry. Our strategic focus on maintenance and repair, our differentiated service model, and the agility of our sales teams to find pockets of growth helped offset a decline in other new build construction sectors where volume declines were compounded by customer destocking. We have also improved our operational agility through our MAP 2025 program so we can quickly respond to demand changes. In our consumer group, our customers were holding leaner than normal inventories heading into the warm months when demand usually picks up. As is typical there was an increase in consumer takeaway late in the quarter and we were able to quickly fill these orders. Destocking was the driver of volume declines at our Specialty Products Group particularly in businesses serving OEM manufacturing. We faced additional profitability headwinds in this segment from continued cost inflation, FX, and initiatives we put in place to normalize our inventory which had a particularly pronounced impact on the SPG profitability. Turning to slide five. Looking at sales by geography. Sales growth was strongest in emerging markets where growth range between high single digits to high teens despite foreign currency headwinds. These regions are investing significantly in infrastructure in an area that we are well-positioned to serve. Europe declined nearly 2%, but excluding FX headwinds, Europe grew in the quarter, the first sign of improving performance after more than a year of challenging economic conditions. Despite the challenging second half fiscal 2023 was a solid one for RPM with sales up 8%, driving adjusted EBITDA nearly 19%. We finished the year with improving results in our Construction Products Group and in particular the Tremco Roofing division improving performance in Europe. The challenges of supply chain disruptions and customer inventory destocking, mostly now behind us; and finally an improving cost price/mix dynamic with major raw materials cycling down from historic highs. These dynamics indicate a strong start to our new 2024 fiscal year. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mike to cover our financial results in the quarter in more detail. Sure. I think it has to do with things that we've been talking about starting in the second quarter and certainly experience in Q3, and the destocking that we experienced what Rusty was calling the bullwhip effect of inventory was more pronounced across more of our businesses and segments than we had ever seen including construction products. And quite honestly, I think there was some hesitation once we made significant improvements in our inventory position. There is certainly more to come in the coming years but a big chunk of it happened this spring. And as the destocking more normalized inventory levels across most of our businesses, but in this case particularly in the distribution channels of construction products. And so as weather improved and economic activity picked up and also kind of our normal seasonal pickup in the Roofing division related to schools, as schools led out in May and early June, all resulted in a stronger finish, which seems to be continuing in the early parts of the summer. So the strength in Q4 really occurred towards the end of the quarter in our Construction Products business. And I think the destocking levels to more normalized or in some cases skinnier than usual inventory, not only construction products but other parts of our business are starting to show up in a positive way. So I would add two more elements to that, John. One is as we experienced, and this has been typical for us in our industry, there is a lag as raw materials increase particularly, as dramatically as they did between the time of the increase and when we can get price. And then as that cycle comes down, we begin to pick up lost margin. And so we are at the beginning stages of that. Just to pick on one of our segments consumer, we still aren't back to pre-COVID levels of margin activity. So there's more to come in recovering those margins. Secondly, we'll continue to see gross margin improvement not only from cost price mix relative to improving raw material costs, but also from our MAP benefits which are real and had really good benefits for fiscal 2023. We'll continue with $120-some million or more in fiscal 2024. And they were masked in the second half of the year by lower volumes and the unabsorption hits we took in the second half of fiscal 2023 by deliberate production shutdowns and inventory adjustments. And so those two things should combine to demonstrate some pretty solid gross margin improvement in fiscal 2024. Yes. I -- we don't have really good insight into that right now and we read the same headlines that everyone else does about tightening in the banking and regional banking market which have been critical providers of credit for commercial construction projects. So the guidance we provided does not anticipate any pickup or rebound in commercial construction activity per se. As I commented and Matt commented our sales forces have been able to adjust to really focus on where the dollars are being spent and the normal maintenance and repair activity of our Construction Products Group and roofing and facade restoration is picking back up again. And that's really driven by different dollars and different decision making the commercial construction. So we don't have good insight into that but we do not anticipate a pickup in commercial construction whether it's hospitality or office space anytime soon. Sure. We have very deliberately invested in growing SG&A in a number of our businesses in particular consumer. I know that's a concern of some folks. I can tell you just an example advertising promotion and marketing activities in Q4 was up 70% from last year. Keep in mind last year was abnormally deflated because we had some supply chain challenges and there was no point in advertising or promoting to drive people to stores or the activity that we couldn't supply sufficiently. For the full year that category is up 54%. And so we are rebuilding across a lot of our businesses and in particular consumer those promotional advertising and marketing dollars. There are other discretionary areas where as the year progresses we see economic challenges beyond what we anticipate we can cut back. And so that's certainly there. I will tell you that in certain of our businesses, commercial construction that we just talked about in OEM, particularly, the OEM businesses that we serve in doors, kitchen cabinets, things that go into the housing market last four or five months in terms of volume sure feel recessionary to us. So hopefully that hit is being mitigated and we're starting to come out of it. Contrary to commercial construction, one area of positivity as we progress throughout the year though we're not seeing it yet is a pickup in residential construction which was a headwind for us for most of 2023. Good morning, Mike. Sure. So we've become somewhat more exposed to residential new construction in our construction products group in particular for instance with Nudura has a sizable share in ICF in Canada and a growing share in the US and some of the products and for facades that we put on there. And we were struggling for the entire year starting in the middle of summer last year of fiscal 2023 as residential construction declined. And it was if you -- I believe the headline is kind of a value trap where people were stuck in their homes, because of rising interest rates and concerns not only about maybe they get a higher price for their home if they sell it, but they're going to have to pay a higher price for where they went. So you saw housing turnover slow down. But in terms of long-term trends, it's a funny dynamic because we are underserved by the rate of residential construction versus demand. We see that changing. And so a combination of easier comps as we go into 2024 for product lines that are high profit like Nudura and the sealants and coatings products that follow that, and I think a stabilization and as you see in the homebuilders anticipation of a pickup in new residential starts should serve us well. Sure. So, again, especially our OEM tends to serve elements that actually go into the residential housing market as well. We still manufacture wood stains and finishes that go into doors, kitchen cabins. We have a particularly nice share with Amish Woodworking, again, which tends to go into residential whether it's furniture or kitchen cabinets or specialty wood. We go into the RV sector, which was hotter in COVID and then cooled off dramatically in the last year. So all of those have been down meaningfully. DayGlo is also a part of our Specialty Products Group and is really more of a specialty chemical company supplier. And if you follow what's happening with the more commodity or specialty chemical business in this raw material deflationary environment when it's just starting we're experiencing the same negative trend there. And then lastly, we divested this spring, the Guardian furniture warranty protection business, revenues but -- annually about $20 million. It's about $20 million in revenues but very high-margin business, but not core to RPM and found a good home for that business and that will annualize next year. But that was $20 million of lost revenue at a margin that was meaningfully higher than the SPG average. Thank you. Good morning, Jeff. Sure. Jeff, that's a great question and it's an area of significant focus for RPM and our MAP '25 goals. So, first of all, you have to reset gross margin profitability in 2018 and we were aware of this for a couple of years prior, we were accounting for freight out differently than most of our peers. We incorporated it in SG&A, so it raised a number of questions about how come our SG&A is so high. So, we changed the accounting for that in 2018 by incorporating all of our freight into cost of goods sold. So, on that readjusted basis, our forever peak gross margin that used to be represented and you're correct in -- I think it peaked close to 43%, the equivalent is about 39 -- 39.8%, so almost 40%. And so that's the right way to think about where our peak gross margins were on an adjusted basis for that accounting allocation change. We have set a target of 42% in our MAP 2025 initiative. Clearly, we have ways to go. We are making really good progress in the original MAP initiative and then had significant step back like the whole industry did relative to rapidly rising inflation and the discontinuity of the supply chain challenges. We are experiencing similar dynamics to our coatings peers, but versus Sherwin-Williams we're on a FIFO accounting and they're on LIFO. So typically, our benefits would show up in our P&L, 60 to 75 days later. And so, I would expect you to see that. And lastly, you made the comment here which is correct. About 35% of RPM's revenues are driven by our Construction Products business nicely profitable, but different dynamics and different economic cycles than more pure-play coatings companies. So you sound like you've been party to some of our strategy discussions with our Board over the last year or so in the sense that there's two areas of great focus. One is gross profits, which we just talked about, and the other is working capital. And our working capital is not where it needs to be. We are -- I can probably talk about different elements of our success versus our peers in the broader market. In working capital, we are a laggard. And so there should be 300 or 400 basis points of working capital improvement out of RPM on a consistent basis over the next three to four years. And so, the working capital improvement we experienced this quarter, I think demonstrated a different RPM than maybe three or four years ago. We were able to turn off production and turn it back on even in our consumer business. We attitudinally we're able to communicate better to the Street and internally about -- it's not that we're not concerned about, but the absorption hits that we took were the right things to do. And if we take more absorption hits by aligning our operations and the efficiency of our operations, you will see working capital continue to improve. And so, I think that's also a very smart question in an area that's gotten a lot of attention over the last 1.5 years with our Board. You're seeing the benefits of the MAP '25 program and the good cash conversion cycle in Q4, but there is significantly more to come. And again, it's an area where versus our peers, we are 300 or 400 basis points behind the curve. Thank you. Sure. The last unit volume sales that were positive were in the first quarter of last year. And we experienced negative unit volume or negative consumer takeaway in most of our consumer product lines and businesses throughout the rest of fiscal 2023. And it was high single-digits or low double-digits this spring. Part of it was a function of consumer takeaway and changes in consumer spending patterns. Again things you can read about headlines about more experiences and less DIY stuff post COVID. Part of it was aggressive destocking and/or inventory adjustments within our supply chain relative to the supply chain disruptions and inventory challenges in all types of areas including for our consumer businesses. And so I think by the time we got into the spring a lot of that customer inventory destocking or rightsizing and a lot of our own supply chain issues were behind us. It doesn't mean we won't see those things in the future relative to supply chains that have happened in consumer. But a lot of that corrected. And while consumer takeaway was still negative in the fourth quarter it was improved from the last product from the two prior quarters. So, we're seeing the consumer week-by-week picking up and I would expect us to be positive sometime this fall in part because of what we're seeing in part because of the new products we're introducing some market share gains and also we'll be annualizing some easier comps in terms of negative consumer takeaway. Good morning Steve. Sure. And again another really kind of sharp strategic question. So, particularly, in the developed world, PCG, our Performance Coatings Group and our Construction Products Group had relatively small and needing more investment operations in places like the Middle East, elements of Africa, India, and Southeast Asia. And rather than go it alone, what we've done is taking a platform approach. We have a particularly sharp management team out of South Africa, the leader there is a gentleman named Grant Boonzaier. He is a PCG leader runs their platform group. But because of the dynamics there and his success and the success of his team, they have become the platform in South Africa for Rust-Oleum that had a business there for our construction products group so Tremco and Euclid concrete repair products. And then the original businesses that they've had there for many years which were Carboline and Stonhard. We've taken that model and again Grant is part of PCG, and we have taken the construction products group businesses in the Middle East and Africa, the Construction Products group in India and the Construction Products Group business in Southeast Asia and they are operating on a more combined basis as you're suggesting in those developing countries. We are investing in new facilities in Southeast Asia and in India that will serve multiple product lines. And all of those businesses will now report to Grant Boonzaier. So they have shifted from reporting to the Construction Products group to reporting to what we consider the developing world platform approach and that's part of our PCG. So that's the primary driver of that $100 million shift in revenues. We would expect it to drive synergies on cost, synergies in a way of expanding revenues more quickly than if they operated on their own and improving unit margins there. Last comment I would make on that, this will have no effect whatsoever on our consolidated results or guidance. So first of all, we are great partners with all of our retail customers and we are the leader in our small-project paint category in every major customer that you can think of and in every major channel. The only exception is one that you would easily gather which is Sherwin-Williams Paint Stores. And so we are a partner in understanding consumer takeaway and analyzing profitability. And so that's been true for many years and continues that really doesn't drive profitability. What drives profitability is innovation, new products and the strength of our brands. And so for example, this spring and we're just advertising it now, Rust-Oleum introduced a five in one spray cap. It's patented. It was first introduced into their primary stop thrust category. You'll see that patented five in one spray tip. So it allows a consumer to adjust the spray to get a fan spray, or a narrow spray, a light spray, fan up and down pretty unique product that will be introduced across more of the product line. DAP has introduced a number of new products taking the benefits of a two-component foam and putting it in one can and that will be a consumer -- like a heavy consumer or a Pro product. We're coming out with some other products for popcorn ceiling spray which has so far been dominated by a single supplier and we intend to become a major player in that space as well. So I think it's innovation and new product introductions and the strength of brands that allows us to maintain price levels more so than the size of our business or the relationship we have with the customers in terms of understanding consumer dynamics. Good morning, Ghansham. Sure. Well, three months ago and for that -- the three months prior, it was looking back and as we sat there in April, when consumer takeaway is mid to high single digits negative when you're a specialty products group and your construction products group that serve elements of the residential market in North America are negative in terms of unit volume sure felt like a recession to us. With the exception of the Specialty Products Group companies we have seen improvement in the rest of our portfolio. And so while we're still negative consumer takeaway, it's much more modest than it was for a period of five or six months. We actually saw an uptick at the end of the quarter in our Construction Products Group particularly in the Roofing division and waterproofing. And we see signs that, the challenges in the residential construction market which were driven by a bunch of different dynamics are changing for the better this summer and we anticipate going into the rest of the year. So -- we're red lights are turning into yellow lights and in a few places even green lights which is a nicer place to be than where we were how we felt just a few three or four months ago. And I guess lastly, I'd say, I credit our operating people in our MAP program because our ability to adjust to these dynamics as quickly as we did is way better than it used to be. Much like my earlier comment on consumer but also here. We were within our supply chain and internally dealing with inventory challenges and destocking across our distribution for construction products and internally and that seems to have corrected itself. And I think there was some anticipation that things were moving in the right direction. The question was whether we were going to experience that in May or June. And we had a few distributors that were hinting at, a, we can boost some product if you discount. And I think we held our pricing and held our discipline. And let's say, everybody held their breath until they needed inventory and it started showing up in May. And that positive trend is continuing as we enter the first quarter. It's a combination of both as I commented earlier. When you look at our cycle and we experienced this as our industry did we're behind the curve in terms of catching up with raw material prices particularly during this cycle as quickly as they went up. And so we are experiencing deflation versus the prior period and versus now for the first time in the prior year. But we're not back to the margin profile in a few of our businesses that we were pre-COVID. And so we've got work to do there. So a part of it will be the benefits of that cost price mix moving positively and we're starting to see that as is our industry. And the other benefits and we talked about it we're talking about MAP we're doing the right things on the ground. We talked about $120 million plus of benefits in fiscal 2023. It was hard to find. We had $50 million of unabsorbed hits in our gross profit in our P&L in the second half of last year as a result of lower volume marketwise, but also the production shutdowns to right-size inventories internally. And so those MAP benefits covered a lot of that in a rising unit volume environment, which we're working hard to get back to and open for you'll start to see those MAP benefits add to that margin expansion. So those are the two dynamics, that will drive a pretty meaningful margin expansion, on what we anticipate to be relatively modest revenue growth at least for the first half of the year. Thank you. Morning, John. Yeah. We -- and this is news from last year, we lost a portion of spray paint business to Baird Home Depot. In some cases it was elimination of Universal, which is one of the more high-performing products. We've been able to reposition their product in other parts of our channels and we are making up in that category for instance almost the entirety of what was lost in that transition. And as Rusty said, we picked up share on shelf with some other major retailers. So, we're back to playing offense in our consumer business. Boy, a year ago we had supply chain challenges. We had our own operating challenges that we were addressing. I think that had as much as anything to do with the market share loss at a major customer. Those issues have been corrected. We have more than enough capacity to take on more business our spending in advertising and promotion some on normal TV a lot more online. And so, we're playing offense in terms of introducing new products, going after share and having the volume to be aggressive in ways that we didn't just a year ago. We're still seeing solid growth in the energy markets whether it's gas and fracking. Interestingly enough, there has been a resurgence in some offshore production. And so, while there's been some volatility in oil prices per se with slowdowns in China persisting longer than people thought, I think the geopolitical issues and where the energy companies are suggest to us at least for the next year that that will continue to be a relatively solid area for business. Hey, Frank. Sure. So, I think directionally we would expect maybe $50 million of share repurchases next year and then would be somewhat opportunistic relative to market dynamics. We will be favoring debt reduction in small transactions. The M&A markets both globally for big M&A and on the smaller scale have dropped dramatically. And part of that was expectations of sellers to get multiples from a year or two ago on earnings from a year or two ago. And I think there's been good discipline on the buy side again big global deals as well as small to midsized mid-market deals. And you'll see I think a capitulation at some point relative to the interest rate environment and higher cost of capital in general, but also the higher cost of incremental capital. I think some of the M&A valuations were relatively undisciplined. Some of that came out of private equity, because for a period of time your incremental cost of capital was practically zero. That's not true anymore. And so, if we can -- we will certainly utilize free cash flow to reduce debt improve our balance sheet modestly repurchased stock. I think it's likely that when our Board meets in October, we'll increase our dividend for the 50th consecutive year that will be a nice milestone, and then position our balance sheet to take advantage of opportunities when they show up at the right price. Sure. It's a great question, and I appreciate you're picking up on that. Europe hurt us in terms of sales and earnings for five or six quarters in a row. And we saw an uptick at the end of Q4 and that's continuing. It's modest, like everything that we're seeing is modest, but it's modest and it's modest in the positive direction. So we're seeing sales moving in the right direction. We're seeing margin expansion. We're also doing a -- I wouldn't call it reorganization but a focus on Europe and have one of our top executives actually moving there and take responsibility for accelerating some of the MAP programs in Europe, which is lagging the MAP initiatives that we've done in North America. And the underlying dynamic there is a positive revenue growth and some margin expansion in Europe, which we haven't seen for five or six quarters. So, there's a lot of points of light or shoots of growth that we're seeing. And the key for us and I guess my caveat to all of that would be none of us have ever experienced a more volatile period of time than we've seen over the last two or three years. Normally, I would get excited about a three-month trend and projected into the future given the whip size that we've all seen in the last two or three years, we're going to -- we'll get excited about a trend when it feels like it's five or six months in a row. We are seeing benefits from onshoring. We've long been a provider of fireproofing coatings and specialty flooring into the tech sector and there's significant investments there. We're seeing onshoring in other areas. And so that is benefiting us. You're seeing highway marine different areas where you're seeing pretty good investment. And so we participate in all those markets. And I'm a little bit hesitant, because the amount of money in a $1.2 trillion infrastructure build, it's hard to track where all that is. And over what period of time it's going to flow through, but it's certainly a positive tailwind for our Performance Coatings Group and portions of our Construction Products Group. Sure. Historically, we've been able to hold on to most of our price, and most of our businesses. The categories where that has not been true have been more commodity pass-throughs. So, in some areas of silicones, we had a lot of value in the more commodity space of silicones, we package it and sell it through, and silicone prices rose dramatically. We thought to kind of catch up on price, that's true in our Construction Products Group and in the silicone portion of our DAP business. And as silicone prices have dropped, our prices have moderated as well. Probably the only other area where I would tell you historically, we've seen prices go up and down is in the highway portion of infrastructure pretty highly competitive there. And so you'll see prices go up and go down based on the underlying core raw materials to some of those systems. But other than that historically, we've been able to hold on price, and that's what we're doing at this point. As I said we've got some lost margin to pick up, and I would expect that to continue for the foreseeable future. Good morning, Kevin. Good. Thank you. The CapEx budget for the year Rusty. The $250 million or so. Yes. And then on working capital, I think, I'd rather report our achievements in hindsight other than the comment I made earlier, which is we have a goal of improving our working capital as a percent of sales by 300 or 400 basis points over the next three to four years. And so if you just do the simple math call it, 100 basis points a year maybe we can do a little bit better than that. But if you apply that 300 or 400 basis points as a percent of sales, you can get a pretty good sense of the additional cash flow that we should be able to generate on top of what we would generate based on revenue growth and our profit margin profitability. And it's a function of us getting better more efficient and our team is doing a really good job on the MAP 2025 initiatives, and the fact that we are an underperformer in this area. So, versus our peers there is efficiencies that we are gaining that we have not had in the past. That's our challenge and it's something we're up for today relative to the disciplines we have and the approach we have now with MS-168 and a more center-led approach to our operations than what we had at RPM five years ago. Thanks, Kevin. Good morning, Arun. Sure. So I think you got that right. I would add that some of the more solid or stable business activity we're seeing is a result of this bullwhip inventory effect and supply chain challenge that we saw more broadly across our businesses than we've ever seen before. And so excess inventories or having the wrong inventory in the wrong places because people overbought during a period of time where they couldn't get stuff that's been corrected. And it's been corrected perfectly? No. And is there's still adjustments here and there both at RPM and with our supply chain that will occur? Yes. But the biggest chunk of that has been corrected. So now there is a normalized demand that's serving we think an improving market in the construction area, an improving consumer takeaway although it's still modestly negative as we sit here today. And so those are the dynamics. I think that's right. So going forward improvement in the underlying dynamics. And then lastly, assuming that we avoid recession substantially easier comps for the RPM businesses and substantially better leverage capabilities if we have positive unit volume in the second half of the year. If we have a positive unit volume in the second half of the year versus what we experience this year and the internal challenges that we undertook to drive cash flow you'll see nice margin expansion. So those are the dynamics to think about for the year. The original guide we provided on the Investor Day a little more than a year ago was $160 million for fiscal '24. And some of that's on the if come. In other words, as we realize it throughout the year it is an ongoing sustainable basis. And so we'll report on that on a quarterly basis as we get through the year. But I would expect to realize over $100 million in our P&L in fiscal '24. And on a run rate by the end of the year we will -- if we hit our targets, we'll have achieved on a run rate of $160 million. That's the plan. But again given our momentum and where we are I would expect it to at least $100 million to flow through the P&L during the year. Thank you. Thank you, Joe and thank you to everybody for your participation on our call today. We're excited about improving business dynamics throughout RPM in combination with the effective execution of our MAP 2025 program. We look forward to updating you on our first quarter results and talking about our dividend activity and our outlook for the balance of the year, when we're together again in October. Enjoy the rest of your summer and have a great day."

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Matt Schlarb, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMatt Schlarb: Thank you, Sarah and welcome to RPM International\u2019s conference call for the fiscal 2023 third quarter. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. Joining today\u2019s call are Frank Sullivan, RPM\u2019s Chairman and CEO; Rusty Gordon, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Michael LaRoche, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. The call is also being webcast and can be accessed live or replayed on the RPM website at www.rpminc.com. Comments made on this call may include forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to be materially different. More information on these risks and uncertainties, please review RPM\u2019s reports filed with the SEC. During this conference call, references maybe made to non-GAAP financial measures. To assist you in understanding these non-GAAP terms, RPM has posted reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures on the RPM website. Also, please note that our comments will be on an as-adjusted basis and all comparisons are to the third quarter of fiscal 2022, unless otherwise indicated. We have provided a supplemental slide presentation to support our comments on this call. It can be accessed in the Presentations and Webcasts section of the RPM website at www.rpminc.com. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Frank.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you, Matt and good morning and thanks for joining us on today\u2019s call. I will begin today\u2019s call by discussing our high level performance for the third quarter, Mike will then provide details on our financial results and Matt will provide some business updates. Finally, Rusty will conclude our prepared remarks with our outlook, after which we will be pleased to answer your questions. In the third quarter, RPM associates remained focused on the execution of our MAP 2025 and other initiatives to grow both sales and adjusted EBIT to record levels for the fifth consecutive quarter. This focus on execution helped overcome several headwinds, including customer destocking and slowdowns in certain end markets. As these slowdowns are expected to continue, we began taking additional actions in the third quarter to address the changing market conditions by narrowing our investment focus to our top growth opportunities and reducing expenses where appropriate. These actions are in addition to ongoing structural improvements as part of our MAP 2025 initiative. A good example to illustrate how we are driving ongoing structural improvements is our Green Belt program. During the quarter, 58 additional associates underwent training to become Green Belts, focused on continuous improvement initiatives. To earn this certification, they must identify and execute at least two projects with savings of $100,000 each. RPM now has 200 associates who have undergone Green Belt training and are serving its internal resources to drive structural savings, both now and in the future. Before we begin discussing the segments, I\u2019d like to highlight that over the past five quarters, we have successfully navigated several challenges, including severe supply chain disruptions, war in Europe, elevated inflation and a recent demand slowdown. Our ability to generate record-setting performance in this dynamic environment demonstrates the value of our strategically balanced business model and the agility of our associates to leverage our broad product portfolio and entrepreneurial culture in a changing market condition. Turning to the segments on Slide 4, all four achieved record third quarter revenue. The primary driver of this growth was increased pricing in response to continued inflation. The strongest revenue growth was generated by our businesses providing engineered solutions targeting infrastructure and reshoring projects. These include our concrete additives and admixtures businesses, our flooring systems businesses and our protective coatings and fireproofing businesses. These businesses have positioned themselves in the highest growth sectors of the construction market, such as manufacturing facilities for electrical vehicles and microchips. Businesses that serve OEM markets and residential and commercial construction sectors experienced weak market conditions. The demand in these areas has been negatively impacted by higher interest rates, deteriorating economic conditions and customer destocking and their impact on the U.S. housing market and commercial construction activity. Additionally, in our Consumer segment, unit volume declined as retailers were cautious about increasing inventory in advance of the spring season and from reduced consumer takeaway at retail. In addition to our customer destocking their inventory, we reduced production at our facilities to continue to normalize inventory levels and improve cash flow. This resulted in lower fixed cost utilization at our plants, which offset most of the MAP 2025 benefits we generated during the third quarter. Inflation continued with material costs rising 2.5% year-over-year basis. Foreign currency also remained unfavorable during the quarter. Despite these headwinds, we achieved record adjusted EBIT in the third quarter due in large part to the successful execution of MAP 2025 profitability initiatives across the organization as well as margin recovery in our consumer group. We remain on track to exceed our year one MAP \u201825 target of $120 million in EBIT benefit. Looking at sales by geography in the next slide. North America, which represents 76% of sales in the third quarter, grew the fastest to 8%, followed by Latin America, where sales grew over 7%. These areas benefit from strong infrastructure and reshoring-related spending. Europe was again the weakest region for growth with sales declining 3.6%. Foreign exchange rates continue to be a meaningful headwind during the quarter and reduced overall sales by 2.3%. Absent these FX headwinds, sales in all regions would have increased in the mid-single to mid-teen percentage range. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Mike LaRoche to cover our financial results in more detail.\nMichael Laroche: Thanks, Frank. Consolidated sales increased 5.7% to $1.52 billion, which was a third quarter record. Organic sales growth was 7.3% or $104.3 million and acquisitions net of divestitures contributed 0.7% to sales or $10.4 million. FX decreased sales by 2.3% or $32.4 million. Consolidated adjusted EBIT grew 4.2% to a third quarter record of $83.9 million compared to $80.6 million reported in the prior year period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.37 compared to $0.38 in the third quarter of 2022. The decline was primarily driven by higher interest expense of $30.8 million compared to $22 million in the prior year period. During the third quarter of 2023, we excluded several items which are not indicative of our ongoing operations from adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS. On a pre-tax basis, these include $59.2 million of expenses related to MAP 2025 initiatives, which includes $39.2 million of non-cash impairment charges in PCG, the result of a go-to-market strategy change in Europe, a $25.8 million gain on the sale of the non-core furniture warranty business and other assets in our SPG segment and a $20 million gain from an insurance recovery in our Consumer segment. Next, we will discuss our segment results. On Slide 7, our Construction Products Group achieved record third quarter net sales of $497 million, an increase of 3.1% compared to the prior year period. Organic sales growth was 4.3% with acquisitions contributing 1.4% and foreign currency translation reducing sales by 2.6%. Sales growth was led by pricing increases and strength in our concrete admixtures and repair products, which benefited from market share gains and infrastructure and reshoring-related spending. Demand for restoration systems for flooring, facades and parking structures also contributed to CPG\u2019s revenue growth. Partially offsetting this growth, demand was weak in residential and certain commercial construction markets. This weakness included the impact of customer destocking. Sales in Europe also remain soft. Adjusted EBIT was $13.3 million, a decline of 62.1% from the prior year period when adjusted EBIT was $35.1 million. The decline was caused by unfavorable fixed cost utilization resulting from lower customer demand and internal inventory normalization initiatives that reduced production at our plants. As a reminder, CPG faced challenging comparisons to the prior year when adjusted EBIT increased 89.7%. The next slide, the Performance Coatings Group achieved record fiscal third quarter net sales and adjusted EBIT. Revenue of $299.6 million was an increase of 10.6% compared to the prior year period. Organic sales increased 13.2%, acquisitions added 0.8% and foreign currency translation was a 3.4% headwind. Sales were driven by pricing and volume growth in nearly all its businesses, fiberglass grading, protective coatings and flooring systems all achieved strong growth. These businesses are targeting fast growing vertical markets, benefiting from continued spending on reshoring and infrastructure projects. Strong energy demand also contributed to the segment\u2019s growth. Adjusted EBIT increased 16.4% to a third quarter record of $31.2 million. The growth was driven by strong sales and MAP 2025 benefits, partially offset by FX headwinds. This growth was achieved in addition to strong results in the third quarter of 2022 when adjusted EBIT increased 89.9%. PCG\u2019s adjusted EBIT excludes the impact of non-cash asset impairment charges of $39.2 million that I previously mentioned. Turning to Slide 9, the Specialty Products Group reported record third quarter sales of $191 million, an increase of 0.9% compared to the prior year period. Organic sales increased 2.2%, divestitures net of acquisitions reduced sales by 0.2%, and foreign currency translation was a headwind of 1.1%. Third quarter sales were led by strength in the disaster restoration business, which was able to quickly respond to the deep freeze in December and flooding in California, thanks to prior investments we have made to improve operational efficiency. Additionally, the Food Coatings and Additives business grew double-digits, which was driven by a strategic refocus of sales management. Price increases in response to continued inflation also contributed to sales growth. Offsetting this growth were businesses serving OEM markets, which experienced weak demand as they felt the dual impact of economic pressures and customer destocking. SPG adjusted EBIT was $16.8 million or a decline of 37% compared to the prior year period. Unfavorable mix and lower fixed cost leverage drove the decline. Adjusted EBIT excludes the $25.8 million pre-tax gain on the sale of the non-core furniture warranty business and other assets. Moving to the following slide, the Consumer Group grew sales 7.5% to $528.5 million, which was a third quarter record. Organic sales increased 8.9%, acquisitions contributed 0.3%, and foreign currency translation was a headwind of 1.7%. The Consumer Group sales growth was driven by price increases to catch up with continued cost inflation. Volumes declined as retailers were cautious about increasing inventory levels in preparation for the spring season as well as from a slowdown in consumer takeaway. Adjusted EBIT was a third quarter record at $48.3 million or an increase of 180.4% compared to the prior year period. The successful implementation of MAP 2025 initiatives as well as solid sales increases were the key drivers of the increase in profitability. As a reminder, the Consumer Group experienced extraordinary low profitability in the third quarter of 2022 as a result of an explosion at an alkyd resin suppliers plant that caused severe supply disruptions and from high material cost inflation that was not offset by commensurate price increases. This contributed to the strong year-over-year growth. Additionally, third quarter 2023 adjusted EBIT excludes the pre-tax impact of a $20 million gain associated with the receipt of a business interruption insurance recovery. This recovery was a result of lost business in the prior year caused by the explosion of the alkyd resin supplier. Turning to Slide 11, we have continued to return cash to shareholders during the third quarter. We paid $54.2 million in dividends and $12.5 million in share repurchases, bringing our fiscal year-to-date total in these two areas to combined $197.3 million. Looking at our working capital, we have spoken several times today about our initiatives to normalize inventories that have been elevated to add resiliency to our supply chain during periods of raw material shortages. While these initiatives are having a temporary unfavorable impact on our profitability, we are starting to see positive results elsewhere in our financials. Our cash flow from operations was $72 million in the third quarter of 2023 compared to a negative $3 million in the prior year period. Inventory levels declined $48 million since the end of November and we expect our inventory normalization initiatives to continue benefiting working capital in the future. I would also like to provide an update on our debt maturity schedule. As a reminder, in January 2022, we pre-funded a bond that was maturing in November 2022 at an attractive fixed rate of 2.95%. And in August 2022, we extended the maturity of a term loan to 2025 and our revolving credit facility to 2027. As a result, we have significant liquidity of over $840 million, no maturities until May 2024 and the vast amount of our debt not coming due until 2027 or later. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Matt to provide a business update.\nMatt Schlarb: Thanks Mike. Over the past several years, political events and societal changes have created transformational forces that are driving investments in new projects and renovations worldwide. A few examples of these transformational drivers are highlighted on Slide 12 along with how our businesses are supporting these events. The key area for transition is energy. From providing protective coatings to wind turbine blades to improving safety at LNG facilities with specified fireproofing solutions, our engineered products and services are helping create and protect facilities that are diversifying and ensuring the supply of energy. Additionally, we offer multiple energy savings solutions for both new and existing structures. We have spoken several times about the transitioning of manufacturing capacity closer to its customer base or reassuring. This is ongoing across several vertical markets and one of these seeing significant investments is electric vehicles. Globally, changing consumer preferences are driving significant growth for EVs and the batteries and the power dynamics. We are supporting this transformation by providing engineered solutions for the facilities that are producing the EVs and batteries to meet this growing demand. Moving to Slide 13, legislation is helping to accelerate these transformations. In addition to stimulus passed in 2020 and 2021, where we are benefiting from increased spending on infrastructure and institutions, the U.S. Congress recently passed legislation that is expected to increase the reshoring of manufacturing capacity to North America for multiple years. The first is the chipset that contains significant incentives for the manufacturing of microchips in the U.S. Several chip manufacturers, with whom we have strong relationships, have started projects or announced capacity additions in the U.S. The second is the Inflation Reduction Act, which extended the tax credit for the purchase of EVs in the U.S. with the stipulation that a percentage of the battery must be manufactured in North America. As a result, the growing number of construction projects for EV battery manufacturing plants in North America, have been announced or are underway. Now, let\u2019s take a look at the role we are playing in these facilities. On Slide 14, the construction and operation of EV battery and assembly facilities have demanding and specific requirements, which our engineered products are designed to meet. Some examples include Euclid Chemical, which provides multiple admixtures and additives that benefit the foundation of the facility. One example is a high-range water reducer that lowered the amount of both water and portland cement needed during construction. Additionally, Euclid Chemical offers TUF-STRAND patented macro synthetic fibers, which are used as a replacement for steel reinforcement providing enhanced 3D protection against cracking, improve construction times, increase worker safety and better overall durability of a facility\u2019s concrete applications. Another is Carboline\u2019s Thermo-Sorb VOC, which is applied to interior steel structures to provide up to 3 hours of passive fire protection. It has been extensively tested for outgassing for clean room environments and EV plants and can be applied quickly in the field to keep large projects on schedule. Finally, Stonhard\u2019s Stonclad GS epoxy motor floor system provides the abrasion and impact resistance necessary in the manufacturing facility. Additionally, Stonclad GS controls static electricity, which is critical in a clean room environment and is also resistant to chemicals. Importantly, Stonhard installs this system to ensure that the project is completed properly and on time. As an example of RPM\u2019s agility that Frank highlighted earlier, a couple of years ago, these businesses were serving the construction of warehouses, which was growing quickly at the time. As that area of construction slowed, we have been able to pivot to this fast growing sector because of the entrepreneurial nature of our people and strong portfolio of products and services. On the following slide, I\u2019d like to highlight another growth driver for RPM, innovation. Bringing new products to market has been integral to RPM\u2019s growth strategy for decades. In recent years, R&D has been ongoing. However, new product introductions have been limited because of supply chain disruptions. Now that these issues are largely resolved, we are back on offense. As an example, in our Consumer segment, Rust-Oleum recently introduced their biggest spray paint innovation in over a decade, the custom spray 5 in 1. With patent-pending spraying technology, the user can customize the output of the can to match the project simply by rotating the dial. These 5 spray patterns increase precision, minimize drips and reduce waste. Additionally, the stop rust advanced formula provides 30% greater corrosion resistance and color retention compared to the traditional stop rust formula. We are introducing this product with a sophisticated omnichannel marketing campaign that will reach users at all points during their shopping journey. The QR code on the slide provides an example of this. [Technical Difficulty]\nOperator: Pardon me. This is your conference operator. Thank you for holding. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Matt Schlarb.\nMatt Schlarb: Hi, everyone. Yes. We apologize for that technical interruption. I am going to turn the call back over to Rusty who will start at the beginning of the outlook section.\nRusty Gordon: Yes. Thanks, Matt. The challenging economic conditions we experienced in the third quarter have continued and in some instances, become more pronounced as elevated interest rates and tightening credit conditions have caused customers to become more cautious. While our strategically balanced portfolio of businesses and focus on repair and maintenance helps insulate us from economic slowdowns, we are not immune, and this is reflected in our outlook. For sales by segment, we are expecting CPG to decline low to mid-single digits versus prior year record sales, which increased 18.5%. Strength in concrete admixture is expected to be more than offset by continued weakness in certain sectors such as residential and office construction while distributors are holding inventory below historical averages. PCG to increase mid-single digits as the segment continues to benefit from infrastructure and reshoring project spending as well as MAP 2025 benefits. This growth is on top of prior year record results when sales grew 16.3%. SPG declined low double digits compared to prior year record results when sales increased 11.4% from OEM markets, which are economically sensitive, is expected to remain weak. Consumer increased mid-single digits as higher pricing was partially offset by lower volumes due to lower consumer takeaway as well as the fact that retailers are being cautious about building inventories heading into seasonally strong months. This sales increase is on top of prior year record results when sales grew 8.6%. Overall, we anticipate fourth quarter 2023 consolidated sales will be flat compared to prior year record results when sales increased 13.7%. Turning to EBIT. We anticipate that fourth quarter fiscal 2023 adjusted EBIT will be in a range of flat to down high single digits compared to the record results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. This range reflects the economic uncertainty in the coming months. It also includes negative impact of lower fixed cost utilization from softer customer demand and our initiatives to normalize inventories as well as increased non-service pension and insurance expenses. This guidance implies full year 2023 sales growth of 8% to a record $7.2 billion and adjusted EBIT of approximately $815 million to $835 million, which represents 15% to 18% growth over fiscal year 2022. Both of these amounts would be annual records. Given this difficult and uncertain environment, we are focusing on what we can control. This includes with MAP 2025, continued execution of data-driven initiatives to structurally improve profitability, leveraging our strong position in markets benefiting from spending on infrastructure and reshoring, introducing new products over the next several quarters including our Rust-Oleum custom spray 5 in 1 aerosol paint that Matt just mentioned, prioritizing and investing in our highest growth opportunities, reducing expenses and aligning resources with demand levels, focusing on cash flow, including initiatives to normalize inventories. As we look beyond the fourth quarter into early fiscal year 2024, economic uncertainty limits visibility. However, we expect many of the positive tailwinds that we control to continue while certain profitability headwinds will start to abate, including material cost inflation and the negative impact of underabsorption as we complete our inventory normalization initiatives. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be pleased to answer your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, John.\nJohn McNulty: Yes. Good morning, Frank. Thanks for taking my question. So on the construction markets, in particular, it seems like there is some weakness there, and that\u2019s where a lot of the destocking seems to be taking place on your side as well as the customer side. I guess, can you help us to think about when you\u2019re through that and it sounds like you may be through a lot of that come the fourth quarter, how much just the end of destocking may help the margin and profitability of that business? It\u2019s a little bit tricky. This was a quarter where you had sales that were kind of in line with where expectations were, but admittedly, the earnings came in lighter. So my hunch is a lot of that is the destocking. So I\u2019m just trying to get a better feel for what that looks like when the destocking ends.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. Our best guess in terms of just the impact of our destocking efforts is about a $20 million hit to gross profit. And we have halted production in a number of areas, where historically, we would not have and really looked to take actions that would improve our inventory levels, which have been out of whack for the last 18 months or so relative to the supply chain disruptions that manufacturing is seeing pretty much everywhere. I would expect that our destocking activity in Q4 will have the same impact, if not slightly higher as a result of the higher revenue level there. And then obviously, the other absorption hit that we took in the quarter and would expect to take a little bit, particularly in the Construction Products Group in Q4 is just related to lower unit volume.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. Okay. No, that\u2019s helpful color. And then on the raw material front, it does sound like raw materials are starting to kind of come off pretty notably across a lot of raw material baskets that I think you participate in. I guess when you think about what you\u2019re buying products for now, admittedly, it\u2019s going to take a little time to work through the P&L. But how much lower are they? How should we be thinking about what that tailwind might be as you kind of work through the higher cost inventory in your system?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. There is a couple of outliers that are still pretty big out there. Metal packaging quarter-over-quarter is up 50% plus certain resins like alkyd are still up. But on a consolidated basis, in the quarter, we were up 2.5% year-over-year. And \u2013 but sequentially, we\u2019re starting to see things move in the right direction. So Q3 versus Q2, we\u2019re seeing an improvement of about 7%.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. Okay, thanks very much. Appreciate the answers.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning.\nAleksey Yefremov: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I was going to ask you about destocking versus lower underlying demand. How do you know the difference? And how would you kind of characterize this difference in your volumes between these two categories? And also any sign of destocking at your customers abating or improving versus what you saw in early January?\nRusty Gordon: Sure. This is Rusty here. In terms of what we saw in the third quarter, there is really two pieces to it. There was the absorption hit from lower demand and our customers\u2019 destocking. There is also RPM\u2019s inventory normalization effort as we knock down our inventory balance by $48 million versus the end of the second quarter. So between those two pieces, like Frank said, there was about a $20 million hit, which is unusually high for us. It might be in the worst case in the $10 million, a little over that. So there is definitely an extraordinary impact on the P&L in Q3.\nAleksey Yefremov: And just a follow-up on this, I guess my question was more along the lines of the trends in destocking itself. Do you see anything that signals your customers are closer to the end of their destocking efforts?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes, I think you\u2019re going to see from us and also supply chains in general work their way back to normal this late spring and summer. So I would anticipate a lot of these levels of destocking, the things that we\u2019re doing and that we\u2019re seeing at customers, both in our industrial businesses and consumer businesses to be kind of right-sized or normalized by this summer. Then the unit volume issue is separate. And where we\u2019re seeing the greatest weakness is our \u2013 in our construction product and construction chemical space.\nAleksey Yefremov: Thank you very much.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Josh Spector with UBS. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Josh.\nJosh Spector: Hey, good morning, thanks for taking my question. So just in your comments in your slide for your outlook, you had comments about tightening credit pressures and interest rates as well. Obviously, we know about the pressure in resi. I guess, can you comment on, if you\u2019re actually seeing some impacts there, on the commercial side different now versus a month or so ago? And is that impacting your order book and visibility in any way?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So I would highlight kind of separate coatings from construction. Our coatings businesses are housed principally in our Consumer Group and our Performance Coatings Group. And if you look at them, I think we\u2019re performing quite well versus our more comparable coatings peers. We were up 7.5% on sales in consumer on top of a record quarter last year and really strong EBIT margins and margin recovery. Our Performance Coatings Group, and I would differentiate their markets are infrastructure and really driven by industrial capital spending. Their revenues were up 10.5% and their EBIT was up 16.4%. We see those businesses on the coatings space in those categories continuing to be pretty strong for a number of reasons. In our Construction Products Group, we\u2019ve been hit by a slowdown in what has grown to be almost $300 million in residential new construction in North America. And we\u2019ve seen the commercial and light commercial piece of that start to go negative in January and it\u2019s been trending down for each of the months here in calendar \u201823. I would expect that those trends in the construction markets, particularly residential new construction and commercial construction, to continue for the balance of calendar \u201823.\nJosh Spector: Okay. No, that\u2019s helpful. And I guess, I mean, if I could follow up, if you can comment kind of on the same vein. Have your order books been declining there? So I mean, some percentage of your products, you apply yourself. Are you seeing any difference in demand at this point? Or is there an expectation that you\u2019ll see softening?\nFrank Sullivan: Again, I\u2019ll bifurcate that. In terms of industrial capital spending, we\u2019re seeing pretty strong order books that would be in our flooring business. Our flooring business, it does their own application and we\u2019re seeing good order flow into Carboline protective coatings into our fiber grade businesses. I think the real volatility here that would either meet our expectations or allow us to deliver some better performance than we currently anticipate is in our Tremco roofing business, where we also do a lot of the application ourselves to take the full contract. We have a really strong order book, but it seems to have been pushed later into the spring and the summer. And so back to my earlier comment, we\u2019ve seen three sequential months of deterioration in commercial construction activity. And so I think this spring will tell late spring, early summer as to whether the Tremco Roofing business backlog start to get to fill. The good news about that business is it\u2019s 95% reroofing and/or maintenance and repair as opposed to new construction. But as you can see in the results, our Construction Products Group has had a weak start to the calendar year.\nJosh Spector: Understood. Thank you.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Byrne with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\nStephen Byrne: Yes. Thank you. How much of your revenue growth in the quarter was price versus volume? How much more price would you need to offset the raw material cost inflation you\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years? How much of a delta is there to get back to where you would want to see EBIT margins?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. In the quarter, on a consolidated basis, Steve, price was about 13%. In \u2013 the only place where \u2013 segment-wise, while we don\u2019t provide price or unit volume by segment, the only place where we had strong unit volume growth pretty consistently was in our Performance Coatings Group. On the flip side, consumer POS month by month has been down in the, let\u2019s call it, low to mid-single-digit range. And again, that\u2019s another category that we\u2019re paying attention to relative to any perk up or strength this spring or summer.\nStephen Byrne: And where you need to push this price, Frank, in order to recover the raws from the last 2 years?\nFrank Sullivan: In most categories, we\u2019re where we need to be. We have taken some price in some of our roof coatings businesses and some of our other coatings businesses that are specific to certain raw materials. We still have some challenges in our consumer business, particularly related to metal packaging which is one of those outliers of 55% year-over-year. Alkyd resins prices have perked up a little bit there as TiO2. And so there are some challenges there that we will be looking to adjust to and the likelihood of what happens with price in the coming quarters is flat or up.\nStephen Byrne: Okay. Thank you, Frank. And can you just comment on how large of a customer Walmart is for you and whether you \u2013 whether any of your initiatives there are at risk given this recent agreement to have with PPG? I recall you had an e-commerce paint business, I thought, with Walmart. Maybe you can give an update on that?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. While we don\u2019t provide specific revenues by customer, I can tell you, we had talked about in prior calls, the while paint interior or exterior initiative that was relatively new 1.5 years ago at Walmart. And I saw the recent PPG announcement. We were not the net loser of that new announcement with the PPG put out yesterday. From basically zero wall paint 2 years ago in North America with Walmart, we will do more than $20 million in interior and exterior wall paint and growing. And so that\u2019s a category for us. That category is being reshuffled with the PPG announcement and the replacement of a major vendor. We are not that major vendor. And as I said, we\u2019re north of $20 million and growing from wall paint program at Walmart that 2 years ago was zero.\nStephen Byrne: Thank you.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Roberts with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, John.\nJohn Roberts: Good morning, Frank. You lost share in Rust-Oleum during the alkyd shortage. When do you think you get back to your pre-shortage share?\nFrank Sullivan: I don\u2019t have a good answer to that question. It is my understanding that the spray paint positioning of some of our competitors, and it\u2019s only at Home Depot is where it is, and it\u2019s not expanding. But as to when we would gain that share back, I don\u2019t have a good answer to that other than from a capacity and a supply chain position, we could take it all back today.\nJohn Roberts: Okay. And then excluding the impairment charge, the MAP expense was $20 million in the quarter you expect that to trend?\nFrank Sullivan: I think roughly about the same. Our MAP program is going really well. And I think we\u2019re actually in a really good position when you take into account the MAP initiatives and the $20 million gross profit hit by itself. And again, I want to make sure that\u2019s clear that the destocking that we under impacted our P&L by $20 million. So as we continue the MAP initiatives and as we get back to a normal throughput in position, our inventory levels where they should be, and we\u2019re working on that. In the right circumstances, you\u2019re going to see a really nice snapback in gross profit margins.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Jeff.\nJeff Zekauskas: Hi, good morning. Thanks very much. If you had to allocate your $120 million in MAP savings across your divisions, how would you do it or is it just ratably by sales?\nFrank Sullivan: Across the divisions, I don\u2019t know that I have a good answer for that, and we\u2019d have to look at that and don\u2019t know that we would communicate that specifically. It is generated by sales. Most of it is in areas that impact gross profit margins. So it\u2019s utilizing data to manage mix better, it\u2019s continuing to see some savings in the procurement basis on a relative basis to where prices are as we are consolidating more categories and there is a ton of MS 168 work going on in our small to medium plants. So the lion\u2019s share of MAP \u201825 work will show up in our gross profits. And so from that perspective, shows up on our gross profit when we sell something. And so it will very much go up or down with our seasonality given the seasonality of our business with strong fourth and first quarters in a somewhat weaker second and obviously a weak third quarter here.\nJeff Zekauskas: And then maybe a question for Rusty your payables were lower year-on-year by $100 million in the quarter. Do you think your payables will be lower year-on-year in the fourth quarter?\nRusty Gordon: Well, I would think our purchases, if we look back 1 year ago exactly, Jeff, we were probably buying more for the sake of resiliency due to uncertain supply and we\u2019re not in that situation today. So I would think that we would not have the same level of purchasing in the same level of payables this year versus last year.\nJeff Zekauskas: Okay, great. Thank you so much.\nRusty Gordon: You are welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Harrison with Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Mike.\nMike Harrison: Good morning, Frank. Hi, everybody. Just wanted to see if I could get you guys to talk a little bit about 2024, Rusty, I think you mentioned in your comments that visibility is limited, but you expect some of the internal actions that you\u2019re taking to continue to be a positive and expect some of these cost headwinds to abate. But as we\u2019re starting to kind of turn our attention to fiscal \u201824, any modeling guidelines that you could maybe help us with in terms of sales growth, margin improvement or earnings growth would definitely be appreciated?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So I\u2019ll give you some broad thoughts on that, Mike, and then we will be in a position to provide more detail when we release our fourth quarter in July. But I think, obviously, volume is a key area to look at. And I say that because in the second half of \u201823, we will take an absorption hit of somewhere between $40 million and $50 million associated with our own destocking and inventory leveling activities. And that is aside from the impact of lower unit volume. And so when we correct those and we see a return to more normal throughput, there should be a meaningful improvement in gross profitability, particularly in the second half of next year. So that\u2019s something to think about. As I indicated earlier, and this is really repeating, we see good backlogs and strong growth in our Performance Coatings Group, driven by infrastructure and capital spending, industrial capital spending very much in line with the comments that Matt made. We anticipate improvement in consumer takeaway. And as Rusty commented, we are playing offense in our consumer business in ways we have it in the last 2 years relative to supply chain issues and we feel pretty good about that. I believe that the residential and commercial construction markets are going to be challenging for the rest of calendar \u201823. And we\u2019re doing what we need to do to adjust to that, but we don\u2019t anticipate those underlying markets getting better probably until the spring of next year. Beyond that, I think we would provide \u2013 we will provide some more detail both on a consolidated basis and broadly by segment when we release results for our year ended July.\nMike Harrison: Alright. Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful. And then the other question I had was on the consumer business. You kind of indicated that your key retail partners are keeping inventory levels low, they are being cautious as we\u2019re heading into the busier season. Just any thoughts on kind of how you\u2019re predicting the DIY season to play out and whether we could see some pickup in inventory levels depending on \u2013 I don\u2019t know what the key variables are if it\u2019s weather or if it\u2019s \u2013 what happens with interest rates or other consumer factors?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. Again, as I indicated, we are seeing \u2013 and we have seen pretty consistently for the last, I would call it, four months or five months POS, so consumer takeaway in the negative mid \u2013 low to mid-single digits. I would anticipate for us that we will see some improvement there, both in terms of consumer takeaway. Also I think by the time we get through this spring, both we and our customers will have completed inventory adjustments. So, if there is a purchase, it will be reflected on our sales as opposed to seeing a difference between consumer purchasing and lower unit volume growth relative to internal and external inventory adjustments and we are playing offense. We have got new products, a new patented spray foam product going into a number of our retailers with DAP. We have a patented new spray nozzle that will first be introduced in Stops Rust that\u2019s going to be shipping in the coming weeks, and you will see it at retailers throughout the summer, by the end of the summer, early fall, we should be pretty much throughout our retail distribution. We are excited about that, and we are going to start a larger advertising and promotion campaign in May around that, it will carry us through the summer. So, we are hopeful for some pretty good performance there and that we will see an uptick in that area. And then the last piece is to an earlier question, the share loss, particularly at Home Depot that we experienced in the last 12 months, we believe it\u2019s over. Time will tell whether we get that business back. But we are led to believe that that position is now where it\u2019s going to be.\nMike Harrison: Great. Thanks very much.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning Ghansham.\nGhansham Panjabi: Thank you. Good morning Frank and everybody else. Hey Frank, just kind of stepping back, I mean obviously, you sell into several end markets that are sensitive towards interest rates and of course, rates are up quite a bit over the past year. Is there anything notable that you see different this go run with higher rates, or is everything essentially playing out, how you thought it would based on historical patterns? And I am sort of asking just to \u2013 in context of raw materials, which have a fair amount of stickiness\u2026\nFrank Sullivan: So yes, first of all, I think at least from a manufacturing perspective, it\u2019s not unique to us, you could it in different segments. We are in a good old fashion recession. And as I commented earlier, I think more cyclical businesses, certainly, we are seeing it in our more cyclical businesses are experiencing that and are going to do so for the rest of calendar \u201823. So, my guess at all these fancy economists to call recessions, as you will recall, they typically look, I don\u2019t know, in August or September and say, hey, we are in a recession and it started in February. So, I think we are there. I think what\u2019s different this time is what we have talked about on the past call and on this call, we have never experienced the broad destocking that we have had to address here, both with our inventory levels and with inventory levels in our industrial segments and channels. We have had sophisticated consumer, customers over time continue to figure out how to reduce inventories, and we have seen those inventories fluctuate up or down. And historically, until this period, typically when we talked about destocking, it really only related to our consumer segment. And so I think that\u2019s different. We have never experienced the type of overhead un-absorption just on our own inventory actions that we experienced in Q3 and that will impact Q4. In the grand scheme of things, I think going forward, that\u2019s good news, because when that stops, there is tens of millions of dollars of gross profit that\u2019s going to show up on our bottom line. And as I have said, I am very bullish actually about the positive impact of our MAP \u201825 activities. Knowing that when we get our inventories right, we will stop shooting ourselves in the foot in terms of these overhead absorption hits. And with the return of volume, if \u2013 as we experience a down cycle in commodities, I still think going forward, there is good potential for strong gross margin recovery in the coming years.\nGhansham Panjabi: And I am sorry, Frank, if I missed this, but what was the impact you think purely from destocking at the customer level as it relates to your volumes for 3Q, which I think were down mid-single digits?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes. So, I think it\u2019s $20 million \u2013 $40 million in total. And I think the way to think about that is $20 million of lower unit volume sales across RPM and $20 million associated with our own internal inventory adjustments, which literally in a number of our operations, including eliminating shifts and/or outright holding production for days or a week at a time, which is something I can\u2019t remember. We have eliminated shifts in certain areas in the past in light of recessions and things like that. But there is a couple of plants that we closed for a week, and that\u2019s incredibly unique to RPM in my career.\nGhansham Panjabi: Thank you, Frank.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you. Yes, simple way to reduce your inventory is to stop making it. And so that\u2019s some of what happened in the quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Please go ahead.\nFrank Mitsch: Thank you so much.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning.\nFrank Mitsch: Yes. Good morning Frank. Thank you so much. Following up on MAP 2025, which is a positive to your results. If I think about the 240 to 260 EBIT in the fourth quarter, how much do you think MAP will contribute to that? And any sort of color in terms of what you need to do to hit the low end or hit the high end of that fourth quarter EBIT range?\nFrank Sullivan: So, as I commented earlier, Frank, the biggest driver of our MAP benefits through our P&L is sales because most of the MAP benefits are in either prior margin to the extent that we are managing mix better or in our conversion costs. And in both cases, we are making good progress. Obviously, the other factor here is beginning to see, which I think you see at the end of Q4 and into the summer, some positive delta on past price increases in the last 18 months in our raw material basket that\u2019s starting to get better sequentially. So, those are the factors. It will certainly be bigger than the $20 million that we experienced in Q3 just because we will have a larger revenue base and how good it could be really depends on unit volume sales.\nFrank Mitsch: Okay. Got it. And then, Rusty, you got the working capital improvement that you are anticipating in the third quarter. Obviously, the fourth quarter is typically a use of cash in terms of working capital. I am curious if you had any thoughts on order of magnitude that, that might be for the coming quarter.\nRusty Gordon: Sure. Yes. In the third quarter, really, the improvement in inventory was offset because our payables went down year-over-year because we cut off purchases. So, I think you are going to really see the benefit in future quarters like the fourth quarter, first quarter of fiscal \u201824 because even though you see the progress on the one line called inventory, it\u2019s been offset on the payables side as we have reduced purchases. But we are going to continue to do other things as part of MAP 2025 to reduce the amount of finished goods we carry and that will lead to a structural improvement. But Frank, I think in terms of working capital, the best days are in front of us. We have started to get the ships steered at the right direction in Q3. But I think the benefit you will see it in cash flow from operations as we look forward.\nFrank Mitsch: Thank you so much.\nRusty Gordon: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning Mike.\nMike Sison: Hi guys. Good morning. Frank, you have made a lot of improvements in the business over the last couple of years, and you have noted we are in a recession. So, I am just curious, you are just maybe general thoughts on how the new portfolio and the new businesses should perform in a recession. And it should be probably more resilient than it has been in the past. And just current your thoughts there should be able to grow or holding stable, down? What kind of your thoughts of how the new RPM would perform?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I think there is two factors there. One, we have improved our conversion costs across the board. And as volume comes back, you will see that. Two, I think our performance is pretty solid given the underlying dynamics. The one negative to historic RPM that we have today that we haven\u2019t had in the past, and it\u2019s a function of the strong growth of Nudura in North America insulated concrete forms and some other aspects that, that has brought along is today, we have about a $300 million exposure in total to residential new construction. And we didn\u2019t have that much exposure to residential new construction in the past. And so that\u2019s hurting us today. I can tell you in our Specialty Products Group, the area that\u2019s hurting us the most is our OEM coatings there. And we have a very successful nicely profitable wood stains and finishes group, and it goes right into housing. We do a lot of work with domestic window manufacturers. We do a lot of work with domestic cabinet door manufacturers. Some furniture, although most of that\u2019s moved offshore. And all of that coating goes on to components that are typically involved in residential construction. So, that\u2019s probably the weakest area for us today and an exposure on a much larger RPM that albeit larger, but we didn\u2019t have in the past. Hopefully, that is helping.\nMike Sison: Yes. And just one near-term question, I am not sure if you have the data, but did March get better than February in total? And then \u2013 when I think about your guidance for the fourth quarter, normally, April gets better than March, and May is better than April. It kind of sounds like the sequential improvement throughout the quarter is not going to improve much. Is that the way to think about it?\nFrank Sullivan: Again, Mike, it\u2019s really just repeated, the comments I made earlier. In our more cyclical impacted businesses, January and February and March have not been good. And so \u2013 you can see that in the Construction Products Group and in the Specialty Coatings Group. I will tell you the Performance Coatings Group backlog is good. We expect that to continue. As Matt highlighted, big dollars in infrastructure and driving industrial capital spending. So, there is plenty of reasons to be cautious and that\u2019s why we have a wide range in Q4. I can tell you the couple of things to look at in terms of possible upside is consumer POS getting better in the spring. That could be an upside. Our Roofing division improving in the spring and the summer. Again, that as part of our construction products business has been slow versus record levels last year. And we are starting to see some sequential improvement in Europe. Some of that\u2019s just rounding easier comps. So, those are the elements that we will pay attention to in the spring and the summer as possible upsides to the guidance that we provided.\nMike Sison: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nVincent Andrews: Thank you and good morning everyone.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning.\nVincent Andrews: Two quick ones from me. First, you referenced electric vehicles and could you just talk a little bit about how incremental that is versus, I don\u2019t recall you guys having a lot of content in automobiles at all. But is there any sort of cannibalization versus an existing sale into an internal combustion engine vehicle?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So, these are not coatings that go into auto, and we are not in automotive coatings, but we have a very strong presence in industrial new construction. So, whether it\u2019s corrosion control coatings, various elements of industrial for steel or into mesh at more architectural decorative fireproofing coatings. And a really good franchise across Stonhard, Euclid, Dudick, a number of flooring businesses, whether it\u2019s concrete coatings or fibers that go into concrete in the case of Euclid or the actual polymer flooring. We have been a leader in microelectronics globally in those areas. And to the extent that we are seeing a big influx and onshoring that\u2019s partly government-subsidized, we should be the beneficiaries of that. And that includes the manufacturing \u2013 that includes the construction of these EV plants and also of battery plants. So, those are all areas of strength in terms of specification and work, but it\u2019s entirely related to industrial capital spending or construction, not automotive coatings.\nVincent Andrews: Okay. Terrific. And just getting back to the issues with the banks and sort of the credit outlook for customers, I mean if we make the assumption that credit is going to become incrementally tighter for folks over the balance of the year and potentially even more expensive. What can RPM do in terms of working with your customers on that? And are you already starting to hear that the customers are having issues or thinking about paring back just because we will have less capital to put in the markets?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. We are not seeing any impact in receivables. So, that is not a sign or an area of concern right now we pay attention to it. The broadest thing I could tell you is that the housing market has been hurt and that\u2019s continuing. And you can see that in residential new construction, which is way down and even housing turnover, which is down. And then the other area that is most impactful is commercial or light commercial, hotels, office space. The days of the mega $1 billion Apple and Amazon new headquarters buildings is over. And so that\u2019s some of \u2013 those are some examples of some big projects that are construction chemicals, sealants and products we are on. And so it\u2019s office space, hotel and hospitality and all those areas are weak. And so it\u2019s not really an issue of credit or receivable concern, it\u2019s more just a weakness in those two categories of construction, principally in North America.\nVincent Andrews: Okay. Thanks very much.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning Kevin.\nKevin McCarthy: Good morning. How are you Frank?\nFrank Sullivan: Good. Thank you.\nKevin McCarthy: Would welcome any updated thoughts you may have on near-term capital allocation in terms of what you are seeing in the M&A pipeline versus potential to just deleverage in this environment or amplify the pace of repurchases?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. Repurchases at this stage, we are in the \u2013 certainly stopping up dilution. And from time-to-time, we have gotten more aggressive. It really depends on where our stock price is relative to a grid of value that we discussed regularly with our Board. On acquisitions, I think things have slowed down. There is a fair amount of acquisition activity, but there is still some hanging on to old multiple and value expectations in the face of deteriorating results, and that tends to slow M&A down. And we are seeing that slowdown in the small to medium-sized markets that we target. And obviously, if you read the headlines, the big M&A activity for the same reasons has slowed down dramatically. Even in the private equity space, the big staple financings for the banks from private equity pretty much dried up right now. So, the M&A market is very slow, and I would expect it to stay that way. We have always had good discipline, and we are not paying the historic high multiples of a few years ago on somebody\u2019s record results of last year. And I don\u2019t think anybody else is either. So, we might get to add a small transaction here and there, but we are not anticipating M&A being a big part of our growth for fiscal \u201824.\nKevin McCarthy: That\u2019s helpful. And then secondly, if I may, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you are taking additional cost actions and I interpreted that to mean above and beyond the scope of your MAP 2025 program, which itself seems to be trending north of your target range. So, anyway to quantify the incremental or additional cost help that we might expect moving into next year?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. At this stage, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s much north of $10 million. But as circumstances dictate, it could be more, and that\u2019s in the SG&A area. And it\u2019s occurring in some of our more recession-impacted Construction Products Group businesses, particularly the ones we have been talking about, as well as our Specialty Products Group. And so, we have undertaken some expense reduction and headcount reduction actions in both of those segments. On the flip side, we are very determined to continue to spend in a couple of areas. We had talked about in the past a patented adjuvant in our KopCoat\u2019s part of our Specialty Products Group. That\u2019s a product line that is patented that provides essentially the ability for pesticides and herbicides to be used at rates as much as 40% or 50% less at the product line. And a couple of years ago, it was a few hundred thousand bucks. This year it will be $3 million or $4 million, and has got a tremendous growth rate. We are going to spend into that. That\u2019s part of our Specialty Products Group, notwithstanding deterioration in that segment. We talked about Nudura, and Nudura has got a nice, unfortunately, this year, presence in residential new construction. I will give you one example. We completed last year a new school in Kentucky and the Nudura system was a key element of allowing that new school to operate at net zero. And the Nudura ICF is one of the most durable construction methods in the market for residential and light commercial, so institutions like schools. And so we will be spending aggressively on a promotion and a specification effort notwithstanding the decline in revenues this year in Nudura in terms of energy efficiency and in terms of safety and security in a growing weather event environment, there is not a better construction product area. So, that\u2019s one of those areas. Unlike in the past, we have seen a significant decline in revenues because of the residential construction pullback. We are going to be increasing spending in that category this year to the tune of $10 million or more. And again, there will be some areas in SG&A in a Construction Products Group or Specialty Products Group, where we are spending forward in terms of building the momentum for really strong growth in greater spec and a broader distribution in \u201825 and beyond.\nKevin McCarthy: Very helpful. Thanks a lot.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning.\nArun Viswanathan: But on MAP \u201825, have you found any of your businesses that potentially compare from a margin standpoint? And would divestitures be [Technical Difficulty] in your net gains at all, or is it\u2026\nFrank Sullivan: Arun, you are breaking up a little bit, so that was hard to hear.\nArun Viswanathan: Can you hear me now?\nFrank Sullivan: That\u2019s a little bit better, yes.\nArun Viswanathan: Yes. Okay. Sorry, Frank. Yes. No, I was just curious if there is any divesture that will be part of the MAP \u201825 versus mainly the existing portfolio \u2013 MAP standpoint?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. We are taking a hard look across our portfolio in terms of MAP \u201825. And without commenting on any future activity, there is two examples, one of which \u2013 actually, both of which happened in this quarter. We had the Guardian Protective Products business, which a decade ago was actually providing fabric protecting product and then being part of the insurance around that for consumers. That business became basically an insurance business for furniture. And while it was a very profitable business and very nice, that\u2019s not an area that we felt we could be competitive in the future. And so we sold that business during the quarter, and it was sold into a joint private equity and other insurance and assurance business. So, a great home for our Guardian Protective Products people and an exit, which generated $50 million of cash in total and a nice gain in the quarter, which we obviously carved out in terms of our adjusted results. That was part of MAP \u201825. We took an impairment charge related to our USL business in the quarter. And you saw that as well. That was also adjusted out of our adjusted results. But we looked at that business and there was a contracting component of that business. It did not make money, and we are working with a couple of parties to sell that to a UK contracting business and hang on to the high-margin product lines areas there. So, the net result of that will be a reduction in revenues, but an improvement in profitability and margins. And so those are two examples that we can talk about because they have happened already of structural changes that we are looking at as part of MAP \u201825, and there certainly could be others in the future.\nArun Viswanathan: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Frank Sullivan for any closing remarks.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you to everybody for participating in our investor call today and for your questions. While we had a challenging quarter and we are being somewhat conservative about the outlook for our Q4, I think we are actually very excited about the actions that we are taking, both in our MAP 2025 initiative specifically and then also understanding the impact of the inventory in particular, but working capital adjustments that are necessary to get our inventory levels back to where they should be and get our cash flow back to where they should be. And those actions are good. They had a negative impact on gross profit and profitability in the quarter, and we will do so in Q4, but they are one-time events that we will get behind us in the next couple of months. So, we remain excited about the activities that we are taking and its impact on our margins in the coming years. And we look forward to providing you more detail on fiscal \u201824 when we release our fourth quarter results and talk about \u201823 year-end in July. Thanks again, a blessed Easter to all on the call to you and your families. And thank you for your participation and interest in RPM. Have a great day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Matt. The challenging economic conditions we experienced in the third quarter have continued and in some instances, become more pronounced as elevated interest rates and tightening credit conditions have caused customers to become more cautious. While our strategically balanced portfolio of businesses and focus on repair and maintenance helps insulate us from economic slowdowns, we are not immune, and this is reflected in our outlook. For sales by segment, we are expecting CPG to decline low to mid-single digits versus prior year record sales, which increased 18.5%. Strength in concrete admixture is expected to be more than offset by continued weakness in certain sectors such as residential and office construction while distributors are holding inventory below historical averages. PCG to increase mid-single digits as the segment continues to benefit from infrastructure and reshoring project spending as well as MAP 2025 benefits. This growth is on top of prior year record results when sales grew 16.3%. SPG declined low double digits compared to prior year record results when sales increased 11.4% from OEM markets, which are economically sensitive, is expected to remain weak. Consumer increased mid-single digits as higher pricing was partially offset by lower volumes due to lower consumer takeaway as well as the fact that retailers are being cautious about building inventories heading into seasonally strong months. This sales increase is on top of prior year record results when sales grew 8.6%. Overall, we anticipate fourth quarter 2023 consolidated sales will be flat compared to prior year record results when sales increased 13.7%. Turning to EBIT. We anticipate that fourth quarter fiscal 2023 adjusted EBIT will be in a range of flat to down high single digits compared to the record results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. This range reflects the economic uncertainty in the coming months. It also includes negative impact of lower fixed cost utilization from softer customer demand and our initiatives to normalize inventories as well as increased non-service pension and insurance expenses. This guidance implies full year 2023 sales growth of 8% to a record $7.2 billion and adjusted EBIT of approximately $815 million to $835 million, which represents 15% to 18% growth over fiscal year 2022. Both of these amounts would be annual records. Given this difficult and uncertain environment, we are focusing on what we can control. This includes with MAP 2025, continued execution of data-driven initiatives to structurally improve profitability, leveraging our strong position in markets benefiting from spending on infrastructure and reshoring, introducing new products over the next several quarters including our Rust-Oleum custom spray 5 in 1 aerosol paint that Matt just mentioned, prioritizing and investing in our highest growth opportunities, reducing expenses and aligning resources with demand levels, focusing on cash flow, including initiatives to normalize inventories. As we look beyond the fourth quarter into early fiscal year 2024, economic uncertainty limits visibility. However, we expect many of the positive tailwinds that we control to continue while certain profitability headwinds will start to abate, including material cost inflation and the negative impact of underabsorption as we complete our inventory normalization initiatives. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be pleased to answer your questions. Sure. This is Rusty here. In terms of what we saw in the third quarter, there is really two pieces to it. There was the absorption hit from lower demand and our customers' destocking. There is also RPM's inventory normalization effort as we knock down our inventory balance by $48 million versus the end of the second quarter. So between those two pieces, like Frank said, there was about a $20 million hit, which is unusually high for us. It might be in the worst case in the $10 million, a little over that. So there is definitely an extraordinary impact on the P&L in Q3. Well, I would think our purchases, if we look back 1 year ago exactly, Jeff, we were probably buying more for the sake of resiliency due to uncertain supply and we're not in that situation today. So I would think that we would not have the same level of purchasing in the same level of payables this year versus last year. You are welcome. Sure. Yes. In the third quarter, really, the improvement in inventory was offset because our payables went down year-over-year because we cut off purchases. So, I think you are going to really see the benefit in future quarters like the fourth quarter, first quarter of fiscal \u201824 because even though you see the progress on the one line called inventory, it's been offset on the payables side as we have reduced purchases. But we are going to continue to do other things as part of MAP 2025 to reduce the amount of finished goods we carry and that will lead to a structural improvement. But Frank, I think in terms of working capital, the best days are in front of us. We have started to get the ships steered at the right direction in Q3. But I think the benefit you will see it in cash flow from operations as we look forward. You're welcome."

            "content": "Thanks, Frank. Consolidated sales increased 5.7% to $1.52 billion, which was a third quarter record. Organic sales growth was 7.3% or $104.3 million and acquisitions net of divestitures contributed 0.7% to sales or $10.4 million. FX decreased sales by 2.3% or $32.4 million. Consolidated adjusted EBIT grew 4.2% to a third quarter record of $83.9 million compared to $80.6 million reported in the prior year period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.37 compared to $0.38 in the third quarter of 2022. The decline was primarily driven by higher interest expense of $30.8 million compared to $22 million in the prior year period. During the third quarter of 2023, we excluded several items which are not indicative of our ongoing operations from adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS. On a pre-tax basis, these include $59.2 million of expenses related to MAP 2025 initiatives, which includes $39.2 million of non-cash impairment charges in PCG, the result of a go-to-market strategy change in Europe, a $25.8 million gain on the sale of the non-core furniture warranty business and other assets in our SPG segment and a $20 million gain from an insurance recovery in our Consumer segment. Next, we will discuss our segment results. On Slide 7, our Construction Products Group achieved record third quarter net sales of $497 million, an increase of 3.1% compared to the prior year period. Organic sales growth was 4.3% with acquisitions contributing 1.4% and foreign currency translation reducing sales by 2.6%. Sales growth was led by pricing increases and strength in our concrete admixtures and repair products, which benefited from market share gains and infrastructure and reshoring-related spending. Demand for restoration systems for flooring, facades and parking structures also contributed to CPG's revenue growth. Partially offsetting this growth, demand was weak in residential and certain commercial construction markets. This weakness included the impact of customer destocking. Sales in Europe also remain soft. Adjusted EBIT was $13.3 million, a decline of 62.1% from the prior year period when adjusted EBIT was $35.1 million. The decline was caused by unfavorable fixed cost utilization resulting from lower customer demand and internal inventory normalization initiatives that reduced production at our plants. As a reminder, CPG faced challenging comparisons to the prior year when adjusted EBIT increased 89.7%. The next slide, the Performance Coatings Group achieved record fiscal third quarter net sales and adjusted EBIT. Revenue of $299.6 million was an increase of 10.6% compared to the prior year period. Organic sales increased 13.2%, acquisitions added 0.8% and foreign currency translation was a 3.4% headwind. Sales were driven by pricing and volume growth in nearly all its businesses, fiberglass grading, protective coatings and flooring systems all achieved strong growth. These businesses are targeting fast growing vertical markets, benefiting from continued spending on reshoring and infrastructure projects. Strong energy demand also contributed to the segment's growth. Adjusted EBIT increased 16.4% to a third quarter record of $31.2 million. The growth was driven by strong sales and MAP 2025 benefits, partially offset by FX headwinds. This growth was achieved in addition to strong results in the third quarter of 2022 when adjusted EBIT increased 89.9%. PCG's adjusted EBIT excludes the impact of non-cash asset impairment charges of $39.2 million that I previously mentioned. Turning to Slide 9, the Specialty Products Group reported record third quarter sales of $191 million, an increase of 0.9% compared to the prior year period. Organic sales increased 2.2%, divestitures net of acquisitions reduced sales by 0.2%, and foreign currency translation was a headwind of 1.1%. Third quarter sales were led by strength in the disaster restoration business, which was able to quickly respond to the deep freeze in December and flooding in California, thanks to prior investments we have made to improve operational efficiency. Additionally, the Food Coatings and Additives business grew double-digits, which was driven by a strategic refocus of sales management. Price increases in response to continued inflation also contributed to sales growth. Offsetting this growth were businesses serving OEM markets, which experienced weak demand as they felt the dual impact of economic pressures and customer destocking. SPG adjusted EBIT was $16.8 million or a decline of 37% compared to the prior year period. Unfavorable mix and lower fixed cost leverage drove the decline. Adjusted EBIT excludes the $25.8 million pre-tax gain on the sale of the non-core furniture warranty business and other assets. Moving to the following slide, the Consumer Group grew sales 7.5% to $528.5 million, which was a third quarter record. Organic sales increased 8.9%, acquisitions contributed 0.3%, and foreign currency translation was a headwind of 1.7%. The Consumer Group sales growth was driven by price increases to catch up with continued cost inflation. Volumes declined as retailers were cautious about increasing inventory levels in preparation for the spring season as well as from a slowdown in consumer takeaway. Adjusted EBIT was a third quarter record at $48.3 million or an increase of 180.4% compared to the prior year period. The successful implementation of MAP 2025 initiatives as well as solid sales increases were the key drivers of the increase in profitability. As a reminder, the Consumer Group experienced extraordinary low profitability in the third quarter of 2022 as a result of an explosion at an alkyd resin suppliers plant that caused severe supply disruptions and from high material cost inflation that was not offset by commensurate price increases. This contributed to the strong year-over-year growth. Additionally, third quarter 2023 adjusted EBIT excludes the pre-tax impact of a $20 million gain associated with the receipt of a business interruption insurance recovery. This recovery was a result of lost business in the prior year caused by the explosion of the alkyd resin supplier. Turning to Slide 11, we have continued to return cash to shareholders during the third quarter. We paid $54.2 million in dividends and $12.5 million in share repurchases, bringing our fiscal year-to-date total in these two areas to combined $197.3 million. Looking at our working capital, we have spoken several times today about our initiatives to normalize inventories that have been elevated to add resiliency to our supply chain during periods of raw material shortages. While these initiatives are having a temporary unfavorable impact on our profitability, we are starting to see positive results elsewhere in our financials. Our cash flow from operations was $72 million in the third quarter of 2023 compared to a negative $3 million in the prior year period. Inventory levels declined $48 million since the end of November and we expect our inventory normalization initiatives to continue benefiting working capital in the future. I would also like to provide an update on our debt maturity schedule. As a reminder, in January 2022, we pre-funded a bond that was maturing in November 2022 at an attractive fixed rate of 2.95%. And in August 2022, we extended the maturity of a term loan to 2025 and our revolving credit facility to 2027. As a result, we have significant liquidity of over $840 million, no maturities until May 2024 and the vast amount of our debt not coming due until 2027 or later. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Matt to provide a business update."

            "name": "Frank Sullivan",
            "content": "Thank you, Matt and good morning and thanks for joining us on today's call. I will begin today's call by discussing our high level performance for the third quarter, Mike will then provide details on our financial results and Matt will provide some business updates. Finally, Rusty will conclude our prepared remarks with our outlook, after which we will be pleased to answer your questions. In the third quarter, RPM associates remained focused on the execution of our MAP 2025 and other initiatives to grow both sales and adjusted EBIT to record levels for the fifth consecutive quarter. This focus on execution helped overcome several headwinds, including customer destocking and slowdowns in certain end markets. As these slowdowns are expected to continue, we began taking additional actions in the third quarter to address the changing market conditions by narrowing our investment focus to our top growth opportunities and reducing expenses where appropriate. These actions are in addition to ongoing structural improvements as part of our MAP 2025 initiative. A good example to illustrate how we are driving ongoing structural improvements is our Green Belt program. During the quarter, 58 additional associates underwent training to become Green Belts, focused on continuous improvement initiatives. To earn this certification, they must identify and execute at least two projects with savings of $100,000 each. RPM now has 200 associates who have undergone Green Belt training and are serving its internal resources to drive structural savings, both now and in the future. Before we begin discussing the segments, I'd like to highlight that over the past five quarters, we have successfully navigated several challenges, including severe supply chain disruptions, war in Europe, elevated inflation and a recent demand slowdown. Our ability to generate record-setting performance in this dynamic environment demonstrates the value of our strategically balanced business model and the agility of our associates to leverage our broad product portfolio and entrepreneurial culture in a changing market condition. Turning to the segments on Slide 4, all four achieved record third quarter revenue. The primary driver of this growth was increased pricing in response to continued inflation. The strongest revenue growth was generated by our businesses providing engineered solutions targeting infrastructure and reshoring projects. These include our concrete additives and admixtures businesses, our flooring systems businesses and our protective coatings and fireproofing businesses. These businesses have positioned themselves in the highest growth sectors of the construction market, such as manufacturing facilities for electrical vehicles and microchips. Businesses that serve OEM markets and residential and commercial construction sectors experienced weak market conditions. The demand in these areas has been negatively impacted by higher interest rates, deteriorating economic conditions and customer destocking and their impact on the U.S. housing market and commercial construction activity. Additionally, in our Consumer segment, unit volume declined as retailers were cautious about increasing inventory in advance of the spring season and from reduced consumer takeaway at retail. In addition to our customer destocking their inventory, we reduced production at our facilities to continue to normalize inventory levels and improve cash flow. This resulted in lower fixed cost utilization at our plants, which offset most of the MAP 2025 benefits we generated during the third quarter. Inflation continued with material costs rising 2.5% year-over-year basis. Foreign currency also remained unfavorable during the quarter. Despite these headwinds, we achieved record adjusted EBIT in the third quarter due in large part to the successful execution of MAP 2025 profitability initiatives across the organization as well as margin recovery in our consumer group. We remain on track to exceed our year one MAP \u201825 target of $120 million in EBIT benefit. Looking at sales by geography in the next slide. North America, which represents 76% of sales in the third quarter, grew the fastest to 8%, followed by Latin America, where sales grew over 7%. These areas benefit from strong infrastructure and reshoring-related spending. Europe was again the weakest region for growth with sales declining 3.6%. Foreign exchange rates continue to be a meaningful headwind during the quarter and reduced overall sales by 2.3%. Absent these FX headwinds, sales in all regions would have increased in the mid-single to mid-teen percentage range. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mike LaRoche to cover our financial results in more detail. Good morning, John. Sure. Our best guess in terms of just the impact of our destocking efforts is about a $20 million hit to gross profit. And we have halted production in a number of areas, where historically, we would not have and really looked to take actions that would improve our inventory levels, which have been out of whack for the last 18 months or so relative to the supply chain disruptions that manufacturing is seeing pretty much everywhere. I would expect that our destocking activity in Q4 will have the same impact, if not slightly higher as a result of the higher revenue level there. And then obviously, the other absorption hit that we took in the quarter and would expect to take a little bit, particularly in the Construction Products Group in Q4 is just related to lower unit volume. Sure. There is a couple of outliers that are still pretty big out there. Metal packaging quarter-over-quarter is up 50% plus certain resins like alkyd are still up. But on a consolidated basis, in the quarter, we were up 2.5% year-over-year. And \u2013 but sequentially, we're starting to see things move in the right direction. So Q3 versus Q2, we're seeing an improvement of about 7%. Thank you. Good morning. Yes, I think you're going to see from us and also supply chains in general work their way back to normal this late spring and summer. So I would anticipate a lot of these levels of destocking, the things that we're doing and that we're seeing at customers, both in our industrial businesses and consumer businesses to be kind of right-sized or normalized by this summer. Then the unit volume issue is separate. And where we're seeing the greatest weakness is our \u2013 in our construction product and construction chemical space. Thank you. Good morning, Josh. Sure. So I would highlight kind of separate coatings from construction. Our coatings businesses are housed principally in our Consumer Group and our Performance Coatings Group. And if you look at them, I think we're performing quite well versus our more comparable coatings peers. We were up 7.5% on sales in consumer on top of a record quarter last year and really strong EBIT margins and margin recovery. Our Performance Coatings Group, and I would differentiate their markets are infrastructure and really driven by industrial capital spending. Their revenues were up 10.5% and their EBIT was up 16.4%. We see those businesses on the coatings space in those categories continuing to be pretty strong for a number of reasons. In our Construction Products Group, we've been hit by a slowdown in what has grown to be almost $300 million in residential new construction in North America. And we've seen the commercial and light commercial piece of that start to go negative in January and it's been trending down for each of the months here in calendar \u201823. I would expect that those trends in the construction markets, particularly residential new construction and commercial construction, to continue for the balance of calendar \u201823. Again, I'll bifurcate that. In terms of industrial capital spending, we're seeing pretty strong order books that would be in our flooring business. Our flooring business, it does their own application and we're seeing good order flow into Carboline protective coatings into our fiber grade businesses. I think the real volatility here that would either meet our expectations or allow us to deliver some better performance than we currently anticipate is in our Tremco roofing business, where we also do a lot of the application ourselves to take the full contract. We have a really strong order book, but it seems to have been pushed later into the spring and the summer. And so back to my earlier comment, we've seen three sequential months of deterioration in commercial construction activity. And so I think this spring will tell late spring, early summer as to whether the Tremco Roofing business backlog start to get to fill. The good news about that business is it's 95% reroofing and/or maintenance and repair as opposed to new construction. But as you can see in the results, our Construction Products Group has had a weak start to the calendar year. Thank you. Sure. In the quarter, on a consolidated basis, Steve, price was about 13%. In \u2013 the only place where \u2013 segment-wise, while we don't provide price or unit volume by segment, the only place where we had strong unit volume growth pretty consistently was in our Performance Coatings Group. On the flip side, consumer POS month by month has been down in the, let's call it, low to mid-single-digit range. And again, that's another category that we're paying attention to relative to any perk up or strength this spring or summer. In most categories, we're where we need to be. We have taken some price in some of our roof coatings businesses and some of our other coatings businesses that are specific to certain raw materials. We still have some challenges in our consumer business, particularly related to metal packaging which is one of those outliers of 55% year-over-year. Alkyd resins prices have perked up a little bit there as TiO2. And so there are some challenges there that we will be looking to adjust to and the likelihood of what happens with price in the coming quarters is flat or up. Sure. While we don't provide specific revenues by customer, I can tell you, we had talked about in prior calls, the while paint interior or exterior initiative that was relatively new 1.5 years ago at Walmart. And I saw the recent PPG announcement. We were not the net loser of that new announcement with the PPG put out yesterday. From basically zero wall paint 2 years ago in North America with Walmart, we will do more than $20 million in interior and exterior wall paint and growing. And so that's a category for us. That category is being reshuffled with the PPG announcement and the replacement of a major vendor. We are not that major vendor. And as I said, we're north of $20 million and growing from wall paint program at Walmart that 2 years ago was zero. Thank you. Good morning, John. I don't have a good answer to that question. It is my understanding that the spray paint positioning of some of our competitors, and it's only at Home Depot is where it is, and it's not expanding. But as to when we would gain that share back, I don't have a good answer to that other than from a capacity and a supply chain position, we could take it all back today. I think roughly about the same. Our MAP program is going really well. And I think we're actually in a really good position when you take into account the MAP initiatives and the $20 million gross profit hit by itself. And again, I want to make sure that's clear that the destocking that we under impacted our P&L by $20 million. So as we continue the MAP initiatives and as we get back to a normal throughput in position, our inventory levels where they should be, and we're working on that. In the right circumstances, you're going to see a really nice snapback in gross profit margins. Thank you. Good morning, Jeff. Across the divisions, I don't know that I have a good answer for that, and we'd have to look at that and don't know that we would communicate that specifically. It is generated by sales. Most of it is in areas that impact gross profit margins. So it's utilizing data to manage mix better, it's continuing to see some savings in the procurement basis on a relative basis to where prices are as we are consolidating more categories and there is a ton of MS 168 work going on in our small to medium plants. So the lion's share of MAP \u201825 work will show up in our gross profits. And so from that perspective, shows up on our gross profit when we sell something. And so it will very much go up or down with our seasonality given the seasonality of our business with strong fourth and first quarters in a somewhat weaker second and obviously a weak third quarter here. Good morning, Mike. Sure. So I'll give you some broad thoughts on that, Mike, and then we will be in a position to provide more detail when we release our fourth quarter in July. But I think, obviously, volume is a key area to look at. And I say that because in the second half of \u201823, we will take an absorption hit of somewhere between $40 million and $50 million associated with our own destocking and inventory leveling activities. And that is aside from the impact of lower unit volume. And so when we correct those and we see a return to more normal throughput, there should be a meaningful improvement in gross profitability, particularly in the second half of next year. So that's something to think about. As I indicated earlier, and this is really repeating, we see good backlogs and strong growth in our Performance Coatings Group, driven by infrastructure and capital spending, industrial capital spending very much in line with the comments that Matt made. We anticipate improvement in consumer takeaway. And as Rusty commented, we are playing offense in our consumer business in ways we have it in the last 2 years relative to supply chain issues and we feel pretty good about that. I believe that the residential and commercial construction markets are going to be challenging for the rest of calendar \u201823. And we're doing what we need to do to adjust to that, but we don't anticipate those underlying markets getting better probably until the spring of next year. Beyond that, I think we would provide \u2013 we will provide some more detail both on a consolidated basis and broadly by segment when we release results for our year ended July. Sure. Again, as I indicated, we are seeing \u2013 and we have seen pretty consistently for the last, I would call it, four months or five months POS, so consumer takeaway in the negative mid \u2013 low to mid-single digits. I would anticipate for us that we will see some improvement there, both in terms of consumer takeaway. Also I think by the time we get through this spring, both we and our customers will have completed inventory adjustments. So, if there is a purchase, it will be reflected on our sales as opposed to seeing a difference between consumer purchasing and lower unit volume growth relative to internal and external inventory adjustments and we are playing offense. We have got new products, a new patented spray foam product going into a number of our retailers with DAP. We have a patented new spray nozzle that will first be introduced in Stops Rust that's going to be shipping in the coming weeks, and you will see it at retailers throughout the summer, by the end of the summer, early fall, we should be pretty much throughout our retail distribution. We are excited about that, and we are going to start a larger advertising and promotion campaign in May around that, it will carry us through the summer. So, we are hopeful for some pretty good performance there and that we will see an uptick in that area. And then the last piece is to an earlier question, the share loss, particularly at Home Depot that we experienced in the last 12 months, we believe it's over. Time will tell whether we get that business back. But we are led to believe that that position is now where it's going to be. Thank you. Good morning Ghansham. So yes, first of all, I think at least from a manufacturing perspective, it's not unique to us, you could it in different segments. We are in a good old fashion recession. And as I commented earlier, I think more cyclical businesses, certainly, we are seeing it in our more cyclical businesses are experiencing that and are going to do so for the rest of calendar \u201823. So, my guess at all these fancy economists to call recessions, as you will recall, they typically look, I don't know, in August or September and say, hey, we are in a recession and it started in February. So, I think we are there. I think what's different this time is what we have talked about on the past call and on this call, we have never experienced the broad destocking that we have had to address here, both with our inventory levels and with inventory levels in our industrial segments and channels. We have had sophisticated consumer, customers over time continue to figure out how to reduce inventories, and we have seen those inventories fluctuate up or down. And historically, until this period, typically when we talked about destocking, it really only related to our consumer segment. And so I think that's different. We have never experienced the type of overhead un-absorption just on our own inventory actions that we experienced in Q3 and that will impact Q4. In the grand scheme of things, I think going forward, that's good news, because when that stops, there is tens of millions of dollars of gross profit that's going to show up on our bottom line. And as I have said, I am very bullish actually about the positive impact of our MAP \u201825 activities. Knowing that when we get our inventories right, we will stop shooting ourselves in the foot in terms of these overhead absorption hits. And with the return of volume, if \u2013 as we experience a down cycle in commodities, I still think going forward, there is good potential for strong gross margin recovery in the coming years. Yes. So, I think it's $20 million \u2013 $40 million in total. And I think the way to think about that is $20 million of lower unit volume sales across RPM and $20 million associated with our own internal inventory adjustments, which literally in a number of our operations, including eliminating shifts and/or outright holding production for days or a week at a time, which is something I can't remember. We have eliminated shifts in certain areas in the past in light of recessions and things like that. But there is a couple of plants that we closed for a week, and that's incredibly unique to RPM in my career. Thank you. Yes, simple way to reduce your inventory is to stop making it. And so that's some of what happened in the quarter. Good morning. So, as I commented earlier, Frank, the biggest driver of our MAP benefits through our P&L is sales because most of the MAP benefits are in either prior margin to the extent that we are managing mix better or in our conversion costs. And in both cases, we are making good progress. Obviously, the other factor here is beginning to see, which I think you see at the end of Q4 and into the summer, some positive delta on past price increases in the last 18 months in our raw material basket that's starting to get better sequentially. So, those are the factors. It will certainly be bigger than the $20 million that we experienced in Q3 just because we will have a larger revenue base and how good it could be really depends on unit volume sales. Good morning Mike. Sure. I think there is two factors there. One, we have improved our conversion costs across the board. And as volume comes back, you will see that. Two, I think our performance is pretty solid given the underlying dynamics. The one negative to historic RPM that we have today that we haven't had in the past, and it's a function of the strong growth of Nudura in North America insulated concrete forms and some other aspects that, that has brought along is today, we have about a $300 million exposure in total to residential new construction. And we didn't have that much exposure to residential new construction in the past. And so that's hurting us today. I can tell you in our Specialty Products Group, the area that's hurting us the most is our OEM coatings there. And we have a very successful nicely profitable wood stains and finishes group, and it goes right into housing. We do a lot of work with domestic window manufacturers. We do a lot of work with domestic cabinet door manufacturers. Some furniture, although most of that's moved offshore. And all of that coating goes on to components that are typically involved in residential construction. So, that's probably the weakest area for us today and an exposure on a much larger RPM that albeit larger, but we didn't have in the past. Hopefully, that is helping. Again, Mike, it's really just repeated, the comments I made earlier. In our more cyclical impacted businesses, January and February and March have not been good. And so \u2013 you can see that in the Construction Products Group and in the Specialty Coatings Group. I will tell you the Performance Coatings Group backlog is good. We expect that to continue. As Matt highlighted, big dollars in infrastructure and driving industrial capital spending. So, there is plenty of reasons to be cautious and that's why we have a wide range in Q4. I can tell you the couple of things to look at in terms of possible upside is consumer POS getting better in the spring. That could be an upside. Our Roofing division improving in the spring and the summer. Again, that as part of our construction products business has been slow versus record levels last year. And we are starting to see some sequential improvement in Europe. Some of that's just rounding easier comps. So, those are the elements that we will pay attention to in the spring and the summer as possible upsides to the guidance that we provided. Good morning. Sure. So, these are not coatings that go into auto, and we are not in automotive coatings, but we have a very strong presence in industrial new construction. So, whether it's corrosion control coatings, various elements of industrial for steel or into mesh at more architectural decorative fireproofing coatings. And a really good franchise across Stonhard, Euclid, Dudick, a number of flooring businesses, whether it's concrete coatings or fibers that go into concrete in the case of Euclid or the actual polymer flooring. We have been a leader in microelectronics globally in those areas. And to the extent that we are seeing a big influx and onshoring that's partly government-subsidized, we should be the beneficiaries of that. And that includes the manufacturing \u2013 that includes the construction of these EV plants and also of battery plants. So, those are all areas of strength in terms of specification and work, but it's entirely related to industrial capital spending or construction, not automotive coatings. Sure. We are not seeing any impact in receivables. So, that is not a sign or an area of concern right now we pay attention to it. The broadest thing I could tell you is that the housing market has been hurt and that's continuing. And you can see that in residential new construction, which is way down and even housing turnover, which is down. And then the other area that is most impactful is commercial or light commercial, hotels, office space. The days of the mega $1 billion Apple and Amazon new headquarters buildings is over. And so that's some of \u2013 those are some examples of some big projects that are construction chemicals, sealants and products we are on. And so it's office space, hotel and hospitality and all those areas are weak. And so it's not really an issue of credit or receivable concern, it's more just a weakness in those two categories of construction, principally in North America. Thank you. Good morning Kevin. Good. Thank you. Sure. Repurchases at this stage, we are in the \u2013 certainly stopping up dilution. And from time-to-time, we have gotten more aggressive. It really depends on where our stock price is relative to a grid of value that we discussed regularly with our Board. On acquisitions, I think things have slowed down. There is a fair amount of acquisition activity, but there is still some hanging on to old multiple and value expectations in the face of deteriorating results, and that tends to slow M&A down. And we are seeing that slowdown in the small to medium-sized markets that we target. And obviously, if you read the headlines, the big M&A activity for the same reasons has slowed down dramatically. Even in the private equity space, the big staple financings for the banks from private equity pretty much dried up right now. So, the M&A market is very slow, and I would expect it to stay that way. We have always had good discipline, and we are not paying the historic high multiples of a few years ago on somebody's record results of last year. And I don't think anybody else is either. So, we might get to add a small transaction here and there, but we are not anticipating M&A being a big part of our growth for fiscal \u201824. Sure. At this stage, I don't know that it's much north of $10 million. But as circumstances dictate, it could be more, and that's in the SG&A area. And it's occurring in some of our more recession-impacted Construction Products Group businesses, particularly the ones we have been talking about, as well as our Specialty Products Group. And so, we have undertaken some expense reduction and headcount reduction actions in both of those segments. On the flip side, we are very determined to continue to spend in a couple of areas. We had talked about in the past a patented adjuvant in our KopCoat's part of our Specialty Products Group. That's a product line that is patented that provides essentially the ability for pesticides and herbicides to be used at rates as much as 40% or 50% less at the product line. And a couple of years ago, it was a few hundred thousand bucks. This year it will be $3 million or $4 million, and has got a tremendous growth rate. We are going to spend into that. That's part of our Specialty Products Group, notwithstanding deterioration in that segment. We talked about Nudura, and Nudura has got a nice, unfortunately, this year, presence in residential new construction. I will give you one example. We completed last year a new school in Kentucky and the Nudura system was a key element of allowing that new school to operate at net zero. And the Nudura ICF is one of the most durable construction methods in the market for residential and light commercial, so institutions like schools. And so we will be spending aggressively on a promotion and a specification effort notwithstanding the decline in revenues this year in Nudura in terms of energy efficiency and in terms of safety and security in a growing weather event environment, there is not a better construction product area. So, that's one of those areas. Unlike in the past, we have seen a significant decline in revenues because of the residential construction pullback. We are going to be increasing spending in that category this year to the tune of $10 million or more. And again, there will be some areas in SG&A in a Construction Products Group or Specialty Products Group, where we are spending forward in terms of building the momentum for really strong growth in greater spec and a broader distribution in \u201825 and beyond. Thank you. Good morning. Arun, you are breaking up a little bit, so that was hard to hear. That's a little bit better, yes. Sure. We are taking a hard look across our portfolio in terms of MAP \u201825. And without commenting on any future activity, there is two examples, one of which \u2013 actually, both of which happened in this quarter. We had the Guardian Protective Products business, which a decade ago was actually providing fabric protecting product and then being part of the insurance around that for consumers. That business became basically an insurance business for furniture. And while it was a very profitable business and very nice, that's not an area that we felt we could be competitive in the future. And so we sold that business during the quarter, and it was sold into a joint private equity and other insurance and assurance business. So, a great home for our Guardian Protective Products people and an exit, which generated $50 million of cash in total and a nice gain in the quarter, which we obviously carved out in terms of our adjusted results. That was part of MAP \u201825. We took an impairment charge related to our USL business in the quarter. And you saw that as well. That was also adjusted out of our adjusted results. But we looked at that business and there was a contracting component of that business. It did not make money, and we are working with a couple of parties to sell that to a UK contracting business and hang on to the high-margin product lines areas there. So, the net result of that will be a reduction in revenues, but an improvement in profitability and margins. And so those are two examples that we can talk about because they have happened already of structural changes that we are looking at as part of MAP \u201825, and there certainly could be others in the future. Thank you. Thank you to everybody for participating in our investor call today and for your questions. While we had a challenging quarter and we are being somewhat conservative about the outlook for our Q4, I think we are actually very excited about the actions that we are taking, both in our MAP 2025 initiative specifically and then also understanding the impact of the inventory in particular, but working capital adjustments that are necessary to get our inventory levels back to where they should be and get our cash flow back to where they should be. And those actions are good. They had a negative impact on gross profit and profitability in the quarter, and we will do so in Q4, but they are one-time events that we will get behind us in the next couple of months. So, we remain excited about the activities that we are taking and its impact on our margins in the coming years. And we look forward to providing you more detail on fiscal \u201824 when we release our fourth quarter results and talk about \u201823 year-end in July. Thanks again, a blessed Easter to all on the call to you and your families. And thank you for your participation and interest in RPM. Have a great day."

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Frank.\nFrank Sullivan: Thanks, Matt. I will begin today\u2019s call by sharing commentary on our consolidated performance for the second quarter, Mike will provide details on our financial results and then I will turn the call back over to Matt to provide some business updates, and then, finally, Rusty Gordon will conclude our prepared remarks with our outlook for Q3. After our prepared remarks, we will be pleased to answer your questions. In the second quarter, we continued to build on recent momentum to deliver both record second quarter sales and adjusted EBIT. This represents the 10th consecutive quarter of record revenue and four consecutive quarters of record adjusted EBIT, an impressive accomplishment in today\u2019s uncertain economic and volatile climate. An important factor in achieving these results is our MAP 2025 Operating Improvement Program. Across RPM, associates have embraced MAP 2025 principles of collaboration and efficiency to successfully implement initiatives and help drive top and bottomline growth and performance. MAP 2025, which officially began at the beginning of this fiscal year is off to a strong start and we are on track to meet or exceed our first year EBIT target improvement of $120 million from MAP initiatives. This hard work was evident in our second quarter results where we achieved strong revenue growth, as well as significant adjusted EBIT margin improvement. Importantly, we achieved these positive results despite meaningful macroeconomic headwinds, including intensifying weakness in Europe, FX headwinds and a slowdown in some of our end markets. Turning to the next slide. Revenue growth was broad based with all four of our segments achieving record second quarter sales. This was accomplished primarily through the implementation of pricing increases in response to continued inflation. We also generated volume growth in several of our businesses that benefited from continued reshoring and infrastructure spending, as well as from improved material availability. Importantly, we not only generated strong sales growth but also expanded margins to achieve record second quarter adjusted EBIT on a consolidated basis at three of our four segments. This was driven by the successful execution of margin enhancement initiatives across the organization. The one outlier segment that did not achieve record second quarter adjusted EBIT was the Construction Products Group, which was most acutely impacted by macroeconomic headwinds, because of its relatively outsized exposure to Europe and to new residential home construction in North America. Looking at sales by geography on the next slide, Europe is clearly the laggard among the regions we serve with sales down nearly 12% for RPM and unit volume down even at a greater rate. This was driven by weak macroeconomic conditions, including persistently high inflation, additionally FX weighed heavily on our results in Europe. FX translation also negatively impacted our sales in emerging markets, so we still achieved healthy growth in these regions. Thanks to the hard work of our associates to align our businesses and products with growing end markets, and to successfully increase prices in response to cost inflation. Demand in North America remained strong through the second quarter with growth in all of our segments, growth in the region was fueled by price increases in response to continued inflation and strengthen our businesses to serve customers who are reshoring manufacturing to the U.S. and it serve infrastructure-related activities. Better material availability also contributed to organic growth in a number of our businesses in the quarter. I will now turn the call over to Mike Laroche to discuss our consolidated and segment financial results in more detail.\nMike Laroche: Thanks, Frank. Sales increased 13.4% excluding FX, which was at 4.1% headwind. The result was a 9.3% increase in reported sales to a second quarter record of $1.79 billion, compared to $1.64 billion in the prior year period. Organic sales growth was 12.4% or $204.1 million and acquisitions contributed 1% to sales or $15.7 million. As mentioned, FX decreased sales by 4.1% or $67.6 million. Our consolidated adjusted EBIT increased 36.4% to a second quarter record of $214.7 million, compared to $157.3 million reported in the prior year period. Second quarter adjusted EBIT margins expanded 240 basis points compared to the prior year period. We achieved this expansion despite significant foreign currency translation headwinds and continued cost inflation. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were a second quarter record at $1.10, representing an increase of 39.2%, compared to the $0.79 in the prior year period. Turning to the next slide. Our Construction Products Group generated second quarter record net sales of $634.1 million, an increase of 3.2%, compared to the prior year period. Organic sales growth was 6.9%, with acquisitions contributing 1.5% and foreign currency translation reducing sales by 5.2%. Sales growth was driven by the restoration times for commercial roofing, facades and parking structures. Admixtures and repair products for concrete continued to gain share during the quarter. Price management in response to continued cost inflation also contributed to CPG\u2019s revenue growth. Partially offsetting this growth, demand was weak in Europe and new residential home construction, both areas where CPG has a higher exposure than the RPM average. Demand in these two areas was particularly weak at the end of the second quarter. These headwinds, along with the negative impact from FX, unfavorable mix and reduced fixed cost leverage at plants, including the Corsicana, Texas facility that was acquired in fiscal 2022 2nd quarter, resulted in adjusted EBIT declining 12% to $80.4 million. As a reminder, unadjusted EBIT declined 40% in the quarter versus the prior year period. That was primarily due to a $41.9 million gain from the sale of real estate assets in Q2 2022 that did not recur this quarter. This gain was excluded from adjusted EBIT in Q2 2022. As you can see on the next slide, the Performance Coatings Group achieved record fiscal second quarter net sales with revenue of $335.2 million, an increase of 10.8%, compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Organic sales increased 15.4%, acquisitions added 0.6% and foreign currency translation was a 5.2% headwind. Flooring Systems, Protective Coatings and FRP grading, all generated double-digit revenue growth. Manufacturing customers fueled the increase, including demand for those who are reshoring their production to the U.S. such as pharmaceuticals, food and beverage, EV manufacturing and electronics companies. Good demand in energy markets and price increases in response to continued inflation also contributed to the growth. Adjusted EBIT increased 16.6% to a second quarter record of $46.2 million. The growth was driven by positive volumes and price increases. Partially offsetting these positive factors, foreign exchange translation was a headwind to adjusted EBIT. Turning to the next slide. The Specialty Products Group reported record second quarter sales of $212.1 million, an increase of 9.5% compared to the prior year period. Organic sales increased 11.5%, acquisitions added 0.9% and foreign currency translation was a headwind of 2.9%. Second quarter sales were led by strength in the food coating and the additives business as a result of strategically refocusing sales management and selling efforts. In the disaster restoration business, the response of Hurricane Ian contributed to strong sales growth and its ability to quickly meet increasing demand was aided by prior operational improvement investments. Price increases in response to continued inflation also contributed to the sales growth. SPG generated record second quarter adjusted EBIT of $30 million or an increase of 43.2%, compared to adjusted EBIT of $20.9 million in the prior year period. The increase was driven by strong sales growth and benefits from MAP 2025 initiatives. Moving to the following slide. The Consumer Group grew sales 15.3% to $610.4 million, which is a record for the second quarter. Organic sales increased 17.5%, acquisitions contributed 0.4% and foreign currency translation was a headwind of 2.6%. The Consumer Group sales growth was driven by price increases to catch up with continued cost inflation and strong sales growth in North America. Adjusted EBIT increased 180.3% in the fiscal 2023 second quarter to $94.2 million, which was a second quarter record. Successful implementation of MAP 2025 initiatives, many of which were enabled by improved material supply, as well as strong sales growth were key drivers to the increase in profitability. As a reminder, the Consumer Group experienced extraordinarily low profitability in Q2 2022 as a result of an explosion at an alkyd resin suppliers plant that caused severe supply disruptions and from high material cost inflation that was not offset by commensurate price increases. This contributed to the strong second quarter of 2023 year-over-year growth. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Matt to discuss capital allocation.\nMatt Schlarb: Thanks, Mike. During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we paid cash dividends of $54.2 million or $1.68 per share on an annualized basis. On a per share basis, this represents an increase of 5% compared to fiscal 2022 and is the 49th consecutive year we have raised our dividend. Over the course of these 49 years, our strategically balanced business model has given us the ability to continually generate steadily improving cash flows and return over $3.1 billion to shareholders via dividends during this period. With regard to investments in working capital, for several quarters we have talked about increases in working capital driven by higher raw material inventories that were designed to improve supply chain resiliency. As material availability has significantly improved, we have begun normalizing our purchases of raw materials in Q2 2023 and we expect these actions to contribute to improved working capital levels in Q3 2023. On the topic of M&A, we have completed six acquisitions so far in fiscal year 2023. These have been small deals and we have remained disciplined as multiples from any potential targets have been elevated above historical levels. With the recent rise in interest rates and changes in economic forecasts, multiples appear to be normalizing and we have a strong pipeline of potential acquisition targets. We expect to continue to be active in M&A and have the financial flexibility to do so, but we will retain our disciplined approach to valuations with a sharp focus on value creation. Looking ahead, while long-term visibility remains limited, we expect economic headwinds to persist in the fiscal third quarter of 2023. Although we are not immune to economic challenges, the balanced portfolio of businesses I just referred to has historically helped us navigate economic slowdowns. Our varied businesses tend to perform differently throughout the economic cycle, which helps reduce the volatility of our results and insulate us from downturns. Additionally, several of our businesses are positioned to continue to benefit from positive reshoring and infrastructure spending trends, which we expect to continue in the future. We have also positioned our businesses to primarily focus on maintenance and restoration markets, which tend to be less economically sensitive than new construction or OEM demand. As you can see from slide 12, approximately two-thirds of our revenue is generated by demand for maintenance and restoration products and services. The reason maintenance and restoration demand tends to outperform new construction during times of economic slowdowns is demonstrated by the example on slide 13. When compared to buying or building new, our products offer a compelling value proposition during periods when budgets are in sharper focus. This is true not only for Consumers but also commercial and industrial customers as well. As an example, within our Consumer segment, Rust-Oleum offers a suite of complementary and easy-to-use products that owners can utilize to renovate their bathrooms at a fraction of the cost of a typical bathroom remodel. Rust-Oleum also offers products to renovate other areas of the house, including kitchens, garages and furniture. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Rusty to cover our guidance and outlook.\nRusty Gordon: Thanks, Matt. As Matt mentioned, we expect the headwinds that we have recently experienced to continue in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. These include slowing overall economic activity, rising interest rates, reducing construction activity and negatively impacting existing home sales, which have declined for 10 consecutive months. The bull up effect as some customers temporarily moderating purchases to normalize inventory levels as material availability has improved, a strong U.S. dollar compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2022, and lastly, continued year-over-year cost inflation. Through a combination of these headwinds, results in November and December have been meaningfully below the prior months in fiscal year 2023. At this point, it is too early to determine how much of the recent slowdown is due to weakening economic conditions versus the short-term impact of inventory normalization. Customer feedback on the reduced demand has been mixed as has recent economic data. Taking all these factors into account, we anticipate third quarter fiscal 2023 consolidated sales will increase in the low single-digit to mid single-digit percentage range compared to the prior year record results. By segment, we expect PCG to be the leader with sales up in the high single-digit to low double-digit range compared to the prior year record results. The strength is being driven by growth in businesses serving manufacturers who are reshoring their production to the U.S., including strength in energy-related markets. Additionally, PCG is expected to benefit from CS 168 initiatives, which are part of our MAP 2025 Commercial Excellence Program. Consumer sales are expected to increase in the mid single-digit range compared to prior year record results, led by pricing increases in response to year-over-year inflation Additionally, now that our material availability has increased, we have begun implementing new marketing and advertising initiatives, which we expect to benefit growth in the coming quarters. Partially offsetting this growth, we expect that the low levels of housing turnover will have a negative impact on Consumer volumes. SBG sales are expected to be flat to prior year record results. Here strength in food coatings and additives, and disaster restoration equipment in response to recent winter storms is expected to be offset by volume declines at businesses serving OEM customers, which are more economically sensitive. As an example, some OEM customers have extended shutdowns of their facilities above and beyond the usual holiday timeframe for the first time in several years. We anticipate that CPG sales will decline in the low single-digit to mid single-digit range compared to the prior year record period as it continues to be weighed down by a weak European economy and softening construction activity. With the softening macro environment, we are reducing production at some of our plants to be better balanced with expected demand. As a result, we expect to reduce inventories, which have been temporarily elevated to navigate supply chain challenges and positively impact our cash flows. We also expect that these actions will lead to lower fixed cost absorption and be a headwind to earnings. Taking all this into account, we anticipate that third quarter fiscal 2023 adjusted EBIT will be in the range of $75 million to $85 million, compared to the prior year record amount of $80.6 million. Included in this guidance are the expectations for year-over-year headwinds from FX and cost inflation. This concludes our prepared comments. We will now be pleased to answer your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, John.\nJohn McNulty: Yeah. Good morning, Frank. Thanks for taking my question. So I guess the first one would just be on the raw material environment. It looks like a lot of base chemicals coatings raw materials, construction raw materials as it started to slide. I guess can you speak to what you are seeing in the raws that you are buying today and how much they may be coming off? And then, I guess, tied to that, is it fair to assume that you don\u2019t have that in the 3Q guide just, because of your FIFO accounting and it probably doesn\u2019t impact you yet, you probably get the benefit more in the May quarter, I guess, how should we be thinking about that?\nFrank Sullivan: Yeah. I think that\u2019s correct. So in the second quarter year-over-year inflation was up about 17%. It was down sequentially in the quarter about 3%. We are experiencing better recovery on the spot market as you are suggesting today, but because of FIFO accounting, that\u2019s not going to show up until the end of the fourth quarter or into the first quarter of next year. I can give you a couple of data points. Again, we are seeing sequential improvements, but there\u2019s still some significant areas of inflation year-over-year, metal packaging is up 59% in the quarter, alkyd resin were up 30% in the quarter versus the prior year. But we are in the marketplace starting to see sequential improvements.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. Got it. Fair enough. And then I guess on the destocking side, I guess, can you help us to think about, it sounds like there\u2019s a little bit of confusion out there and even your customers aren\u2019t necessarily sure how much of its destocking versus actual demand. I guess, can you give us a little bit more color as to which channels may be seeing kind of the heaviest level of destocking and the negative impact of that and where things maybe are kind of running more hand to mouth and more kind of in line with demand, I guess, how should we be thinking about that?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure and it\u2019s a great question. Historically, when we would talk about destocking or any of our peer competitors or companies that deal in Consumer markets, it tended to be understood as a reference to inventory adjustments by major retailers, big box consumers discount. In this case, it\u2019s really inventory adjustments across the whole supply chain. So with many of our customers in industrial markets, we are in a similar fashion. Supply chains were so broken, you saw people buying what they could get. While our inventory is higher than it should be, in the quarter, we have seen a meaningful improvement from higher than usual raw materials to finished goods, which is the proper step of a cash conversion cycle. And so across our customer base, you are seeing people take actions to readjust inventory levels from kind of the extraordinary actions people had to take over the last year and a half or two years in light of supply chain disruptions. So, specifically, in the third quarter, Rusty referenced the Specialty Products Group and we have seen for the first time for the last couple of years some of our OEM customers did not take their usual shutdowns during the Christmas to New Year\u2019s timeframe. In this case, they have, and some are extending it into January and part of this is inventory level adjustments as opposed to necessarily recessionary moves. So there\u2019s some volatility there that\u2019s going to play out with more certainty in the next couple of months.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. And then maybe if I can squeeze in more [Technical Difficulty] just on just on MAP 2025, can you just give us an update where you are, I think, you were at about million run rate in the prior quarter. I guess, can you help us to understand where you are at, it sounds like you may have some upside to the $120 million target for this year?\nFrank Sullivan: I will hit that $120 million target this year. But one of the things that people have to adjust relative to original expectations in Q3 is most of the MAP 2025 programs are focused at the gross profit level. So it\u2019s greater efficiencies. It\u2019s establishing greater levels of capacity through greater efficiencies. It\u2019s a much more deliberate data usage on managing cost price mix. And it\u2019s having a good effect. The reason that\u2019s relevant to Q3 is it doesn\u2019t flow through your P&L until you sell something and given the seasonal low of our third quarter revenues, the impact in Q3 of MAP 2025 will be less than what you saw in Q1 and Q2. And then you will see a disproportionately larger impact of MAP 2025 in Q4 because of our higher sales.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. Got it. Thanks very much for the color. Appreciated, Frank.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. Yeah. Just to qualify that further. I think that\u2019s an important thing to note that the MAP 2025 benefits will, because of where we are targeting them, be driven proportionally by a revenue basis as opposed to taking our communications about for instance $120 million and dividing it by 12 or dividing it by four, it won\u2019t play out that way.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Frank.\nFrank Mitsch: Hey. Good morning, Frank, and Happy New Year to you and everybody there. The comment was made that November and December saw a significant slowdown. So I was wondering if you could kind of quantify maybe on a percentage basis or a dollar basis or what have you, the negative year-over-year impact that you have seen particularly in December. And as part of that, I\u2019d be curious as to what your -- what\u2019s being embedded in terms of recovery in January and February in the $75 million to $85 million operating income?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So I will try and address it in two ways. Number one, the biggest negative impact in Q2 and at the end going into Q3 is regional and it\u2019s Europe. Europe was down 11% in revenues. If you assume price in there, you can make some assumptions that Europe was down even greater on unit volume and while we don\u2019t disclose EBIT by region, EBIT in the European market was off by more than 50% year-over-year. And we have a disproportion, out of a $1 billion base of business, roughly half of that is in our Construction Products Group. And so that gives you a sense of the greatest challenge that we are facing, which is regional. We also saw a slowdown in residential, which today with Nudura and a few other product lines out of a $2.7 billion. Construction Products Group, we have about a $200 million exposure to residential new construction. And including some of our Consumer businesses, I\u2019d say our total exposure to residential new construction in North America is about $300 million. The last comment I will make again, which makes the performance at the end of Q2 and the beginning of Q3 difficult is, we had a weather event not dissimilar to a year ago that impacted the entire United States and so that slowed down results for us as we start off this third quarter and it will be interesting to see [Audio Gap] recessionary.\nFrank Mitsch: Got you. That\u2019s very helpful. And interestingly, there\u2019s a lot of discussion regarding destock among the customer base, et cetera, your inventory levels continue to tick higher. I am wondering how we should be thinking about that?\nFrank Sullivan: And as we sit here today, our inventory levels are being adjusted appropriately. We had more normal cash flow in the quarter and I think you will expect -- should expect to see better cash generation out of us in the coming quarters relative to focus on inventory adjustments. It\u2019s happening across the whole supply base and our customer base and not just, again, I want to make sure that people don\u2019t equate destocking to Consumer big customers. This is basically the supply chain across almost every business or industry that we serve adjusting back to normal levels of inventory. So that is circumstantial and that\u2019s playing out as we speak, because we are not the only company who\u2019s got higher levels of inventory in relationship to trying to adjust to the supply chain challenges in the last two years.\nFrank Mitsch: Understood. Thanks so much, Frank.\nFrank Sullivan: Yeah.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Josh Spector with UBS. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning.\nJosh Spector: Yeah. Hi. Thanks for -- hey. Good morning. So just curious if you could comment on pricing, one, I apologize if I missed it, but can you comment on what pricing was in the quarter, and then specifically for construction, if you are having weaker demand, I mean, given how that business is more project based pricing. Is that having any impact on your ability to get further pricing or are you having to give some of that up given some of the destocking?\nFrank Sullivan: Josh, we have not provided price detail by segment. But on a consolidated basis, price was in the 15% to 16% range on average across RPM in the second quarter and unit volume was up in some of our businesses down in the CPG and particularly in Europe. So on a total basis, unit volume in the quarter was down about 3%. We have held on to our pricing pretty much everywhere and as the supply chains adjust, typically in the past, there are very few areas where we would have to get back price. Some of it is in more commodity spaces. One example is in silicones in the Construction Products Group. There have been extraordinary spikes in silicone costs over the last year and a half, and that was a real problem for us in cost price/mix. There are significant declines in silicone prices. So you are likely to see some price adjustments in commodity -- more commodity areas like that. Other than that, historically, we have tended to hold on to our price across RPM and we intend to do that through this cycle as well.\nJosh Spector: Okay. Thanks. And then I was just wondering if you could comment on Consumer in terms of what you are seeing. I mean, you have had strong volumes in the first quarter on some restocking and supply availability improvement. I think some of your competitors have noted some destocking in that chain. Are you now seeing more of that or I mean, my assumption is you are kind of assuming negative volumes in Consumer at least for next quarter. So just curious what the driver is among that?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I think that\u2019s correct. There has been some destocking. I think that\u2019s stabilized. Consumer takeaway has still been very volatile from one week to the next. It could be down in units 10% or up 2% or 3% depending on the retailer. We have lost over the last year about $40 million in market share and I believe that that market share adjustment is over, and that\u2019s been in some categories of spray paint and wood states and finishes in a big box account. Our Consumer Group is pretty excited about the spring and we are going to be initiating a advertising and promotional initiatives in the spring, much larger than we have over the last couple of years. It\u2019s a combination of some new product introductions, some new market share opportunities. And finally, a supply chain such that we can deliver at the high fill rate levels that historically we have been able to deliver at. So we have done a lot of work, both through MAP 2025 and then specifically on the operations side at Rust-Oleum around some supply challenges and manufacturing efficiencies. Those have been addressed and we will be in a really strong position to be able to meet demand and also to drive demand in the spring selling season. So that\u2019s one area of strength for us as we look into the finish of fiscal 2023.\nJosh Spector: Got it. Thank you.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from John Roberts with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Hi, John.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you. It sounds like M&A discussions are picking up. Can you provide some color on whether it\u2019s in the weak areas like Europe or Construction Products or is it broad based across your businesses?\nFrank Sullivan: It\u2019s kind of broad based across our businesses. We have done six transactions this year, all very small product lines. But there have been some nice additions to Construction Products. Through some of the big construction product mergers, we were able to pick up pieces of concrete, I am sorry, of cement additives, which was a category that Euclid Chemical was not in. We have also invested internally and through some regional acquisitions and penalization for greater energy efficiency and wall construction. So some exciting areas for us, small acquisitions that with our distribution should be able to double or triple revenues in the coming years. So, that\u2019s pretty much what we have been seeing. As Matt commented on, we have been holding our discipline and we are seeing valuations coming down, and I suspect that we will continue to see small to medium-sized acquisition activity in the coming quarters.\nJohn Roberts: And then how much more price do you need to get to fully get caught up on alkyd silicones and metal containers?\nFrank Sullivan: I think we have the price that we need now in the marketplace. I think the final straw of margin recovery is going to come through holding on to the price that we have got as raw materials cycle back to more normal cost levels. And when you look at our Consumer Group, the year-over-year improvement in EBIT is impressive. It has as much to do with how poorly we performed a year ago as it does today. We are still not back to record EBIT levels, but we expect to get there both through some commodity cycle recovery and the benefits of the MAP 2025 Program.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Aleksey Yefremov with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning.\nAleksey Yefremov: Thanks, and good morning, Frank, and everyone. I wanted to ask about the bidding activity that you see mainly in Construction Products and Performance segments, more maybe looking over the next two, three quarters, perhaps, outside the residential projects area where you highlighted the weakness?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So the -- as you would guess and you are seeing in the numbers in our results, the residential piece has been weak and Europe has been weak. We have a very strong backlog in our roofing and waterproofing division going into the spring. And so as we sit here today, it looks like the spring and summer season for that portion of our Construction Products Group, which is the largest and most profitable will be strong, but we will see. Again, the volatility that we are seeing in different parts of our business, it\u2019s hard to understand how much of some of the underperformance here that we are expecting in Q3 is inventory destocking across customers and adjustments and/or weather related here as we start the quarter versus recessionary. As we sit here today, we have a very strong backlog and I think there\u2019s some comfort in the fact that unlike residential construction or normal commercial construction, there\u2019s been a lot of federal money and state and local money that will be going into school construction, into healthcare, and those are two very strong end-use markets for our roofing waterproofing division.\nAleksey Yefremov: Thank you. And then I understand it\u2019s hard to differentiate between demand weakness and destocking, I mean, customer side, but your intentional reduction of inventory, is it possible to estimate how much that\u2019s hurting EBIT in the third quarter?\nFrank Sullivan: Yeah. It\u2019s a good question and it\u2019s definitely a drag on EBIT. We have dropped shifts in certain places where we had previously been operating on a three-shift basis and that was not demand driven. That was inventory adjustment driven. And when you do that, your overhead absorption takes a hit and so that\u2019s temporary and you are seeing that in a number of places across RPM. So there\u2019s a deliberate effort to get inventory levels in a number of our businesses back to a normal pace and that will hurt us in the seasonally low third quarter as these actions again negatively impact overhead absorption. I\u2019d like to think, I don\u2019t know how quickly we will adjust it will be adjusted through the spring and the summer selling season, which are our strong seasons and so those temporary negative impacts on gross margin should pick back up.\nAleksey Yefremov: Got it. Thanks a lot, Frank.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nSteve Byrne: Yeah. Thank you. How much of your MAP 2025 would you say is driven by targets on the manufacturing side versus initiatives on commercial improvement? And in the former, do you expect to get more active in raw material manufacturing and in the latter view, is it more driven by cross-selling?\nFrank Sullivan: So it\u2019s mostly, Steve, focused on areas that would affect gross profit and so it is a continuation of what we call MS 168, which is driving lean manufacturing disciplines on a consistent basis across our manufacturing base. We had in our original MAP program, done so very effectively but really in our top 50 plants and there\u2019s another 75 plants out there that are more small- to medium-sized our ability to get to effectively was interrupted by COVID and so that\u2019s having an effect. There will be some modest plant consolidation, nothing to the extent of the original MAP program, but some modest plant consolidation and so those are two big areas. Then the other area is literally being in a position today to use data much more effectively to understand cost price mix better and to be able to drive a more deliberate margin profile that we want relative to really not having that data all the way down to a salesperson level such that we can really be deliberate and effective there. And so those are the primary areas that will affect principally gross profit margin.\nSteve Byrne: And I asked\u2026\nFrank Sullivan: You have other -- yeah. The last piece of that we talked about is, we do expect somewhere between $100 million and $200 million of gross margin recovery from commodity cycle improvement as well, which is consistent with the margin recovery that we have had in past commodity cycles and in reference to a response to an earlier question.\nSteve Byrne: I asked about the cross-selling, because one of the takeaways for us from the events you had in Cleveland with Construction Products was an apparent awareness that cross-selling was an opportunity there and just would like to hear your view on that, Frank. Is this an area that you think that RPM has some significant opportunity to cross-sell between businesses, and perhaps, regionally, do you have aspirations for sales ex North America to meaningfully increase above the 20% level that it\u2019s at now?\nFrank Sullivan: Yeah. Absolutely. So as you saw in the Investor Day presentation, over the last four years, our internal cross-selling efforts have increased from $60 million annually to $180 million, and certainly, the opportunity for that to double in the coming years exists. One example is, because of the success we have had with Arnette Polymers, which is a pre-polymer raw material resin division of Stonhard and then the Corsicana plant which, while it\u2019s part of our Construction Products Group, today is principally serving Consumer and Rust-Oleum. We are utilizing the leadership there to create a resin center of excellence in Europe to create the same type of stability and certainty in supply, competitive advantage in raw materials and cost selling and that\u2019s going to play out over the next 12 months or 18 months. So that\u2019s one of many concrete examples of trying to continue to accelerate what\u2019s been a pretty good story in terms of intercompany supply and/or cross-selling revenue benefits.\nSteve Byrne: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning.\nGhansham Panjabi: Hi, guys. Good morning and Happy New Year as well.\nFrank Sullivan: Thanks.\nGhansham Panjabi: I guess, Frank, on the inventory adjustment dynamic, as you kind of think about it, do you see this as sort of a multi-quarter phenomenon or one that\u2019s going to disproportionately impact one of your smaller quarters, which is 3Q and then things sort of normalize from there? And then just related to that, just given all the complexity in the current operating environment, is there any historical payrolls that you can think of that are sort of equivalent to what you are seeing at this point?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. Thank you. It will have a disproportionate negative impact on Q3 and that\u2019s certainly part of our guidance. As you trying to ramp down production in this case in a few specific areas to address inventory imbalances as opposed to absolute demand and I had commented earlier about the overhead absorption hit. It will be less in Q4 and into Q1. I think it will take another six months or nine months for us to get inventory back to where we want. It\u2019s just a slow and steady progression. But you are already seeing this. Our inventory levels quarter-over-quarter on a relative days basis haven\u2019t improved much. But there\u2019s been a significant shift from what was a higher-than-usual carrying of raw material inventory into finished goods, which is obviously the cash conversion cycle that we like to see. Now we got to sell it and turn it into cash. And I have never seen -- we have talked about destocking in the past when some of our big consumer customers would work to get to the next level of inventory stock efficiency and that certainly happened to us and people have talked about its impact circumstantially when it\u2019s happened. In my career, I have never seen the supply chain disruptions and then related inventory imbalances. And so, for instance, there were there was demand we couldn\u2019t meet in some of our Consumer businesses over the last year because of these things. So we would have certain customers order in excess more than what they probably needed because they wanted to get what they could sell. We had customers in our Construction Products Group over the last year going to the same thing. So you just had odd circumstances across multiple businesses and channels and industries in terms of order flows caused by this supply chain disruption and with a settling down of supply chains, which I think were back to normal, now you are seeing people try and modulate back into a normal inventory level and a refocus on working capital position back to something that\u2019s more normal and more stable and more predictable.\nGhansham Panjabi: I know there\u2019s a lot going on. And for my second question, in terms of your comments related to the weakening in volumes late in the quarter, which specific businesses and end markets were the most impacted, I know you called out new construction, but just more color on that?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. As we think about Q3 going into the spring, we saw solid performance from our Consumer Group and we would expect to see that continue. We saw really solid performance in our Performance Coatings Group and given their infrastructure function and focus and heavy industry focus and some of the onshoring and infrastructure dollars out there, we expect that to continue. The weakness was really in the Construction Products Group at particularly as we start Q3. I can\u2019t tell you sitting here whether it\u2019s a sustained weakness that\u2019s continuing that\u2019s more recession like or whether some of it was a result of the winter storm that impacted all North America. We saw weakness in the OEM portion of our Specialty Products Group or our Specialty Products Group is about $800 million, about half of that is OEM coatings, powder coatings, liquid metal, wood stains and finishes, and again, some of that could be circumstantial. Over the last couple of years, the normal between Christmas, New Year shutdowns that some of our cabinet maker customers, door customers, RV customers had traditionally, they did not have, well, they had those again this year and some of that is extending into January. And how much of that is in anticipation of continuing recessionary pressure as opposed to some of these inventory adjustments we won\u2019t know for another month or 2.\nGhansham Panjabi: Thanks so much, Frank.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. Your\u2026\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning.\nJeff Zekauskas: Hi. Good morning. Your corporate costs are annualizing at $132 million versus something like a little less than $100 million last year and even in 2021, maybe your corporate costs were $113 million. What\u2019s going on there? Is this a large onetime increase for this year or is it something more permanent? Why are corporate costs up so much?\nRusty Gordon: Jeff, this is Rusty here. Corporate costs are up primarily from two categories, it\u2019s pension and insurance. In terms of pension, our assets have been hit in the pension plan and that leads to higher non-service related pension costs, as well as the fact we have had pay and wage inflation higher than our actuarial assumptions. Also, in terms of insurance, as you know, there have been several property events and insurance costs are up as rolled.\nFrank Sullivan: The other thing I would add to that as a result of our MAP to Growth program, as well as MAP 2025, our corporate staff has increased by about 30%. Now it starts on a relatively low basis of, let\u2019s say, 90 people, and I\u2019d say, we are up to about 125, 130. That\u2019s in areas of IT, which we are driving center led in a number of areas. It\u2019s in a team of continuous improvement in engineering professionals that number about 12 and it\u2019s a team of corporate staff procurement people of about eight, none of which existed in the corporate payroll three years or four years ago.\nJeff Zekauskas: So your SG&A expense, I think, adjusted was up, a little bit more than 10% this quarter versus a 9% increase in sales and it sounds like volumes are not growing or not as strong as you expected. Is there anything you are going to do to reduce your SG&A levels and get them below your rate of sales growth?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. We look at SG&A levels across all our businesses on a regular basis. Some of the SG&A increases are along the lines of what Rusty talked about in terms of wage increases. It\u2019s been a challenging not -- for everybody a challenging employment environment and so inflation is not only raw material and raw material inflation is stabilizing and coming down, but wage inflation is here and it\u2019s here to stay. So that\u2019s part of it. The other issue is a return to, I don\u2019t know that we will ever get back to pre-COVID levels of travel and entertainment, but we are certainly getting back to more ordinary levels of investment in those categories than what we experienced during the COVID period, because they were damn near zero and that includes in-person sales meetings, traveling to customers and getting our people on site in front of customers more aggressively than we did, let\u2019s say, 12 months or 18 months ago.\nJeff Zekauskas: Okay. Thanks so much.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nKevin McCarthy: Yes. Good morning. Frank, just to extend the discussion on the monthly cadence and the concept of destocking, have you seen any customers following the closure of the calendar year end books that have become more liberal and their orders more willing to resume a more normal cadence of purchasing? And if so, where might you be seeing that, it didn\u2019t sound as though that\u2019s very prevalent from your remarks?\nFrank Sullivan: Yeah. I think that our third quarter is probably the wrong period of time, especially this quarter to be able to answer that question. Europe is the biggest driver of the deteriorating performance. And again, if you follow my comments, the world is not ending for RPM by any way, shape or form. I talked about in Q2, regionally, Europe was down 11% and given price increases, you can assume that unit volume was down more and then EBIT was off 50% in Europe. Gives you a sense of the strength of RPM anywhere else. We are seeing the weakness that we talked about. And Kevin, it\u2019s too soon for us to be able to say how much of it was weather related, how much of it is inventory driven shutdowns and OEM customers versus how much of it is full on recession. And so, I don\u2019t think we can answer that question today with any certainty. If you want to ask that our April call, I think, we would be in a much better position to have some clarity around that question.\nKevin McCarthy: Okay. Fair enough. And I just had maybe a couple of quick housekeeping ones. First, did you give a MAP savings number for the quarter or if not, would you comment on that? And then second, I wanted to ask about some verbiage in your press release. I think it mentioned some unfavorable mix and fixed cost leverage at Corsicana, in particular and just wondering if you could elaborate on those dynamics.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. The fixed cost leverage both at Corsicana, which is serving Consumer and some of our Construction Products businesses, also Carboline in terms of alkyd resins. It\u2019s not just Corsicana, it\u2019s knocking off some weekend activity in plants or knocking off a shift to try and make inventory adjustments. That basically to slow down production so that we can get our inventory back in line and so the overhead absorption hit as a result of that, it\u2019s going to negatively impact Q3. I don\u2019t recall the other...\nKevin McCarthy: Just MAP savings in the quarter\u2026\nFrank Sullivan: MAP saving\u2026\nKevin McCarthy: Yeah.\nFrank Sullivan: Yeah. We -- I think we have commented the conclusion of not providing MAP savings every quarter. Our target is $120 million for fiscal 2023, which we are comfortable in hitting. I think we have disclosed, Rusty or Matt, what have we disclosed year-to-date in the prior -- in the first quarter?\nRusty Gordon: It was $30 million.\nFrank Sullivan: $30 million -- yeah. $30 million in the first quarter. So I think you can extrapolate that across the quarter, particularly as it relates to understanding since most of this is being driven at the gross profit level. It will -- that $120 million will flow around that basis in proportion to our revenue growth by quarter.\nKevin McCarthy: Got it. Okay. Thank you so much, Frank.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nMike Sison: Hey, guys. Happy New Year. Yeah. Just one question, Frank.\nFrank Sullivan: Hi, Mike.\nMike Sison: If you think about the current environment and you have a lot of EBIT growth anchored with the MAP program going forward, if it started to stay this way for a while, is it challenging to grow EBIT even with the MAPs program and maybe another way to look at it is, what do you think needs to happen in the external environment to get back to the growth that you were showing prior to the third quarter?\nFrank Sullivan: So a couple of things. I think we need to be effective in the sales and marketing and promotion activities that we expect to generate consumer and we are excited about that in the spring. So you will see some new product rollouts, and again, a higher level of advertising and promotion, because we have gotten ourselves back to the point of being able to supply on a very high level efficient basis. And I think we have a number of growth initiatives around Nudura. That\u2019s just -- that\u2019s a business that grew from $40 million to $100 million. It\u2019s a big. It\u2019s got a disproportionate amount of that work in residential. We have a lot of work to do to get that specified into commercial markets, particularly schools and other areas and we are working on that and the economic circumstances are not going to change that focus. So we have a number of exciting areas for us that we are going to continue to invest in, notwithstanding what\u2019s going on with the economy. Broadly speaking, Mike, we have got to see the Fed quit raising interest rates and we have got to see some stability in housing and things like that. And so those are the macro issues that are not only affecting us, but I think they are affecting everybody and so that\u2019s -- I guess that\u2019s the best answer I would have. We -- to an earlier question, we manage our SG&A unit-by-unit. We will continue to do that where appropriate. But we are not in a position where we see any need to come out with any broad based expense reduction program. We are still focused on executing our MAP program and selectively investing aggressively in a number of growth initiatives.\nMike Sison: Got it. Thank you.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nVincent Andrews: Thanks. Just two\u2026\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning.\nVincent Andrews: Good morning. Just two quick ones for me. Frank, I just wanted to clarify, you -- the $40 million of market share in spray paint and wood stains. Did you gain that or did you lose that? I just didn\u2019t follow it.\nFrank Sullivan: We have lost that over the last 12 months and I think that\u2019s in relationship to, it wasn\u2019t unique to us, but the challenges that we faced in meeting demand because of supply disruptions. And so that was a between spray paint, where we have had a bare gain, a modest amount of spray paint in Home Depot and also some wood stains and finishes, about $30 million or $40 million of market share loss and I believe that\u2019s over.\nVincent Andrews: Okay. Thank you. And then, Rusty, you mentioned increasing marketing ad spend and I just wanted to clarify whether that was an actual increase versus, say, 2019 levels or whether it\u2019s a just sort of normalization, because you took it down when you didn\u2019t have sufficient raw materials to actually make the product. So why would you advertise? So can you just clarify what\u2019s going on there?\nFrank Sullivan: Yeah. This is Frank. It\u2019s a little bit of both. It will be up year-over-year just because we didn\u2019t spend a lot in the face of the supply chain challenges. But we are working to get back to normal levels pretty quickly and we have got some exciting new product introductions that we will talk about in the spring. And we have some exciting new products, we have some new market share opportunities and we have our operations in a position to lean in hard to support all of that. So we are going to get back to an advertising and promotion level that\u2019s more consistent with the past and there will be necessary to support that growth.\nVincent Andrews: Okay. Is there any quantification of that just in terms of, I assume that will fall into SG&A as well or is that already in there\u2026\nFrank Sullivan: That -- it falls in SG&A and we will be in a better position to provide details on that in April.\nVincent Andrews: Okay. Very good. Thanks so much, guys.\nFrank Sullivan: Yeah.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Arun.\nArun Viswanathan: Great. Good morning, Frank. Happy New Year. Thanks for taking my question. A lot of my questions have been answered, but I think maybe I will try this in a slightly different way. So, it sounded like the Construction Products sales cadence really slowed down in November, December and it sounded like, I don\u2019t know if that was surprising. So would you say that we are still in early innings of this slowdown and you noted that maybe it will take six months to nine months for inventories to be worked off. Is that kind of how you feel about the demand trends as well and maybe you can just comment on if that\u2019s the case for some of your other businesses as well? Thanks.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So, at some point, we are going to be rounding easier comps in Europe, because Europe, we have been talking about since last spring has been deteriorating. And so I don\u2019t -- we are not in early innings there at all, we are in the teeth of a pretty good recession in demand destruction. And so, I think, boy, six months from now, nine months from now, at the very least, we will be stabilizing and moving in the right direction there. Part of that is geopolitical circumstantial in terms of the Russian war in Ukraine, in terms of energy markets in Europe and those things. The one area, and again, it\u2019s about $300 million, about $200 million in Construction Products and $100 million in Consumer, is our exposure to residential, new construction. And I wouldn\u2019t say it surprised us, but data has slowed down significantly and profitable business there. And I think you need to see stabilization of what the Fed is doing on interest rates before you are going to see stabilization both in the new home construction space and better housing turnover, which also drives a nice chunk of our [Audio Gap]\nArun Viswanathan: \u2026 potentially sluggish demand trends and destocking that\u2019s going on, do you expect to give back some of the price initiatives that you have achieved in a little bit more rapid fashion? How do you kind of plan to maintain the margin trajectory and recovery that you kind of had hoped for and experienced through the last couple of years? Is there -- are there other measures other than pricing like mix or anything else that we should think about or, yeah, how do you plan to keep some of that margin recovery?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. In the past cycles, we have been able to maintain the vast majority of the price increases that we have initiated and we would expect to do exactly the same thing here. If you look at our performance in past commodity cycles, on the down cycle we should pick up $100 million to $200 million of margin benefit and we are working hard to do that and we intend to do it. And as I said, even Consumer with the very strong recoveries are showing there, and certainly, some of that is price driven, while the year-over-year performance is really strong. We are not yet back at record margins and we intend to get there through a combination of maintaining price where it\u2019s appropriate and the benefits of the MAP 2025 program.\nArun Viswanathan: Thanks.\nOperator: And this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Frank Sullivan for any closing remarks.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you, Cole. Thanks to all of you for your participation in our investor call today. We are pleased with our second quarter results, which reflect the resiliency of our balanced business model and the extraordinary efforts of our associates around the globe. We are carefully monitoring early signs of economic slowing, but are confident in our ability to manage effectively through the entire business cycle. We look forward to providing you with details of our results in April. We will have a much better sense of where we are headed in terms of what seems to be an exciting opportunity for continuing growth in our Consumer Group and Performance Coatings Group, and hopefully, some improving performance out of Construction Products and Specialty Products as well. Thanks again for your time on today\u2019s call and best wishes for a happy, healthy and successful new year.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded.

            "content": "Thanks, Frank. Sales increased 13.4% excluding FX, which was at 4.1% headwind. The result was a 9.3% increase in reported sales to a second quarter record of $1.79 billion, compared to $1.64 billion in the prior year period. Organic sales growth was 12.4% or $204.1 million and acquisitions contributed 1% to sales or $15.7 million. As mentioned, FX decreased sales by 4.1% or $67.6 million. Our consolidated adjusted EBIT increased 36.4% to a second quarter record of $214.7 million, compared to $157.3 million reported in the prior year period. Second quarter adjusted EBIT margins expanded 240 basis points compared to the prior year period. We achieved this expansion despite significant foreign currency translation headwinds and continued cost inflation. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were a second quarter record at $1.10, representing an increase of 39.2%, compared to the $0.79 in the prior year period. Turning to the next slide. Our Construction Products Group generated second quarter record net sales of $634.1 million, an increase of 3.2%, compared to the prior year period. Organic sales growth was 6.9%, with acquisitions contributing 1.5% and foreign currency translation reducing sales by 5.2%. Sales growth was driven by the restoration times for commercial roofing, facades and parking structures. Admixtures and repair products for concrete continued to gain share during the quarter. Price management in response to continued cost inflation also contributed to CPG's revenue growth. Partially offsetting this growth, demand was weak in Europe and new residential home construction, both areas where CPG has a higher exposure than the RPM average. Demand in these two areas was particularly weak at the end of the second quarter. These headwinds, along with the negative impact from FX, unfavorable mix and reduced fixed cost leverage at plants, including the Corsicana, Texas facility that was acquired in fiscal 2022 2nd quarter, resulted in adjusted EBIT declining 12% to $80.4 million. As a reminder, unadjusted EBIT declined 40% in the quarter versus the prior year period. That was primarily due to a $41.9 million gain from the sale of real estate assets in Q2 2022 that did not recur this quarter. This gain was excluded from adjusted EBIT in Q2 2022. As you can see on the next slide, the Performance Coatings Group achieved record fiscal second quarter net sales with revenue of $335.2 million, an increase of 10.8%, compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Organic sales increased 15.4%, acquisitions added 0.6% and foreign currency translation was a 5.2% headwind. Flooring Systems, Protective Coatings and FRP grading, all generated double-digit revenue growth. Manufacturing customers fueled the increase, including demand for those who are reshoring their production to the U.S. such as pharmaceuticals, food and beverage, EV manufacturing and electronics companies. Good demand in energy markets and price increases in response to continued inflation also contributed to the growth. Adjusted EBIT increased 16.6% to a second quarter record of $46.2 million. The growth was driven by positive volumes and price increases. Partially offsetting these positive factors, foreign exchange translation was a headwind to adjusted EBIT. Turning to the next slide. The Specialty Products Group reported record second quarter sales of $212.1 million, an increase of 9.5% compared to the prior year period. Organic sales increased 11.5%, acquisitions added 0.9% and foreign currency translation was a headwind of 2.9%. Second quarter sales were led by strength in the food coating and the additives business as a result of strategically refocusing sales management and selling efforts. In the disaster restoration business, the response of Hurricane Ian contributed to strong sales growth and its ability to quickly meet increasing demand was aided by prior operational improvement investments. Price increases in response to continued inflation also contributed to the sales growth. SPG generated record second quarter adjusted EBIT of $30 million or an increase of 43.2%, compared to adjusted EBIT of $20.9 million in the prior year period. The increase was driven by strong sales growth and benefits from MAP 2025 initiatives. Moving to the following slide. The Consumer Group grew sales 15.3% to $610.4 million, which is a record for the second quarter. Organic sales increased 17.5%, acquisitions contributed 0.4% and foreign currency translation was a headwind of 2.6%. The Consumer Group sales growth was driven by price increases to catch up with continued cost inflation and strong sales growth in North America. Adjusted EBIT increased 180.3% in the fiscal 2023 second quarter to $94.2 million, which was a second quarter record. Successful implementation of MAP 2025 initiatives, many of which were enabled by improved material supply, as well as strong sales growth were key drivers to the increase in profitability. As a reminder, the Consumer Group experienced extraordinarily low profitability in Q2 2022 as a result of an explosion at an alkyd resin suppliers plant that caused severe supply disruptions and from high material cost inflation that was not offset by commensurate price increases. This contributed to the strong second quarter of 2023 year-over-year growth. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Matt to discuss capital allocation."

            "content": "Thanks, Matt. As Matt mentioned, we expect the headwinds that we have recently experienced to continue in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. These include slowing overall economic activity, rising interest rates, reducing construction activity and negatively impacting existing home sales, which have declined for 10 consecutive months. The bull up effect as some customers temporarily moderating purchases to normalize inventory levels as material availability has improved, a strong U.S. dollar compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2022, and lastly, continued year-over-year cost inflation. Through a combination of these headwinds, results in November and December have been meaningfully below the prior months in fiscal year 2023. At this point, it is too early to determine how much of the recent slowdown is due to weakening economic conditions versus the short-term impact of inventory normalization. Customer feedback on the reduced demand has been mixed as has recent economic data. Taking all these factors into account, we anticipate third quarter fiscal 2023 consolidated sales will increase in the low single-digit to mid single-digit percentage range compared to the prior year record results. By segment, we expect PCG to be the leader with sales up in the high single-digit to low double-digit range compared to the prior year record results. The strength is being driven by growth in businesses serving manufacturers who are reshoring their production to the U.S., including strength in energy-related markets. Additionally, PCG is expected to benefit from CS 168 initiatives, which are part of our MAP 2025 Commercial Excellence Program. Consumer sales are expected to increase in the mid single-digit range compared to prior year record results, led by pricing increases in response to year-over-year inflation Additionally, now that our material availability has increased, we have begun implementing new marketing and advertising initiatives, which we expect to benefit growth in the coming quarters. Partially offsetting this growth, we expect that the low levels of housing turnover will have a negative impact on Consumer volumes. SBG sales are expected to be flat to prior year record results. Here strength in food coatings and additives, and disaster restoration equipment in response to recent winter storms is expected to be offset by volume declines at businesses serving OEM customers, which are more economically sensitive. As an example, some OEM customers have extended shutdowns of their facilities above and beyond the usual holiday timeframe for the first time in several years. We anticipate that CPG sales will decline in the low single-digit to mid single-digit range compared to the prior year record period as it continues to be weighed down by a weak European economy and softening construction activity. With the softening macro environment, we are reducing production at some of our plants to be better balanced with expected demand. As a result, we expect to reduce inventories, which have been temporarily elevated to navigate supply chain challenges and positively impact our cash flows. We also expect that these actions will lead to lower fixed cost absorption and be a headwind to earnings. Taking all this into account, we anticipate that third quarter fiscal 2023 adjusted EBIT will be in the range of $75 million to $85 million, compared to the prior year record amount of $80.6 million. Included in this guidance are the expectations for year-over-year headwinds from FX and cost inflation. This concludes our prepared comments. We will now be pleased to answer your questions. Jeff, this is Rusty here. Corporate costs are up primarily from two categories, it's pension and insurance. In terms of pension, our assets have been hit in the pension plan and that leads to higher non-service related pension costs, as well as the fact we have had pay and wage inflation higher than our actuarial assumptions. Also, in terms of insurance, as you know, there have been several property events and insurance costs are up as rolled. It was $30 million."

            "name": "Frank Sullivan",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt. I will begin today's call by sharing commentary on our consolidated performance for the second quarter, Mike will provide details on our financial results and then I will turn the call back over to Matt to provide some business updates, and then, finally, Rusty Gordon will conclude our prepared remarks with our outlook for Q3. After our prepared remarks, we will be pleased to answer your questions. In the second quarter, we continued to build on recent momentum to deliver both record second quarter sales and adjusted EBIT. This represents the 10th consecutive quarter of record revenue and four consecutive quarters of record adjusted EBIT, an impressive accomplishment in today's uncertain economic and volatile climate. An important factor in achieving these results is our MAP 2025 Operating Improvement Program. Across RPM, associates have embraced MAP 2025 principles of collaboration and efficiency to successfully implement initiatives and help drive top and bottomline growth and performance. MAP 2025, which officially began at the beginning of this fiscal year is off to a strong start and we are on track to meet or exceed our first year EBIT target improvement of $120 million from MAP initiatives. This hard work was evident in our second quarter results where we achieved strong revenue growth, as well as significant adjusted EBIT margin improvement. Importantly, we achieved these positive results despite meaningful macroeconomic headwinds, including intensifying weakness in Europe, FX headwinds and a slowdown in some of our end markets. Turning to the next slide. Revenue growth was broad based with all four of our segments achieving record second quarter sales. This was accomplished primarily through the implementation of pricing increases in response to continued inflation. We also generated volume growth in several of our businesses that benefited from continued reshoring and infrastructure spending, as well as from improved material availability. Importantly, we not only generated strong sales growth but also expanded margins to achieve record second quarter adjusted EBIT on a consolidated basis at three of our four segments. This was driven by the successful execution of margin enhancement initiatives across the organization. The one outlier segment that did not achieve record second quarter adjusted EBIT was the Construction Products Group, which was most acutely impacted by macroeconomic headwinds, because of its relatively outsized exposure to Europe and to new residential home construction in North America. Looking at sales by geography on the next slide, Europe is clearly the laggard among the regions we serve with sales down nearly 12% for RPM and unit volume down even at a greater rate. This was driven by weak macroeconomic conditions, including persistently high inflation, additionally FX weighed heavily on our results in Europe. FX translation also negatively impacted our sales in emerging markets, so we still achieved healthy growth in these regions. Thanks to the hard work of our associates to align our businesses and products with growing end markets, and to successfully increase prices in response to cost inflation. Demand in North America remained strong through the second quarter with growth in all of our segments, growth in the region was fueled by price increases in response to continued inflation and strengthen our businesses to serve customers who are reshoring manufacturing to the U.S. and it serve infrastructure-related activities. Better material availability also contributed to organic growth in a number of our businesses in the quarter. I will now turn the call over to Mike Laroche to discuss our consolidated and segment financial results in more detail. Good morning, John. Yeah. I think that's correct. So in the second quarter year-over-year inflation was up about 17%. It was down sequentially in the quarter about 3%. We are experiencing better recovery on the spot market as you are suggesting today, but because of FIFO accounting, that's not going to show up until the end of the fourth quarter or into the first quarter of next year. I can give you a couple of data points. Again, we are seeing sequential improvements, but there's still some significant areas of inflation year-over-year, metal packaging is up 59% in the quarter, alkyd resin were up 30% in the quarter versus the prior year. But we are in the marketplace starting to see sequential improvements. Sure and it's a great question. Historically, when we would talk about destocking or any of our peer competitors or companies that deal in Consumer markets, it tended to be understood as a reference to inventory adjustments by major retailers, big box consumers discount. In this case, it's really inventory adjustments across the whole supply chain. So with many of our customers in industrial markets, we are in a similar fashion. Supply chains were so broken, you saw people buying what they could get. While our inventory is higher than it should be, in the quarter, we have seen a meaningful improvement from higher than usual raw materials to finished goods, which is the proper step of a cash conversion cycle. And so across our customer base, you are seeing people take actions to readjust inventory levels from kind of the extraordinary actions people had to take over the last year and a half or two years in light of supply chain disruptions. So, specifically, in the third quarter, Rusty referenced the Specialty Products Group and we have seen for the first time for the last couple of years some of our OEM customers did not take their usual shutdowns during the Christmas to New Year's timeframe. In this case, they have, and some are extending it into January and part of this is inventory level adjustments as opposed to necessarily recessionary moves. So there's some volatility there that's going to play out with more certainty in the next couple of months. I will hit that $120 million target this year. But one of the things that people have to adjust relative to original expectations in Q3 is most of the MAP 2025 programs are focused at the gross profit level. So it's greater efficiencies. It's establishing greater levels of capacity through greater efficiencies. It's a much more deliberate data usage on managing cost price mix. And it's having a good effect. The reason that's relevant to Q3 is it doesn't flow through your P&L until you sell something and given the seasonal low of our third quarter revenues, the impact in Q3 of MAP 2025 will be less than what you saw in Q1 and Q2. And then you will see a disproportionately larger impact of MAP 2025 in Q4 because of our higher sales. Sure. Yeah. Just to qualify that further. I think that's an important thing to note that the MAP 2025 benefits will, because of where we are targeting them, be driven proportionally by a revenue basis as opposed to taking our communications about for instance $120 million and dividing it by 12 or dividing it by four, it won't play out that way. Good morning, Frank. Sure. So I will try and address it in two ways. Number one, the biggest negative impact in Q2 and at the end going into Q3 is regional and it's Europe. Europe was down 11% in revenues. If you assume price in there, you can make some assumptions that Europe was down even greater on unit volume and while we don't disclose EBIT by region, EBIT in the European market was off by more than 50% year-over-year. And we have a disproportion, out of a $1 billion base of business, roughly half of that is in our Construction Products Group. And so that gives you a sense of the greatest challenge that we are facing, which is regional. We also saw a slowdown in residential, which today with Nudura and a few other product lines out of a $2.7 billion. Construction Products Group, we have about a $200 million exposure to residential new construction. And including some of our Consumer businesses, I'd say our total exposure to residential new construction in North America is about $300 million. The last comment I will make again, which makes the performance at the end of Q2 and the beginning of Q3 difficult is, we had a weather event not dissimilar to a year ago that impacted the entire United States and so that slowed down results for us as we start off this third quarter and it will be interesting to see [Audio Gap] recessionary. And as we sit here today, our inventory levels are being adjusted appropriately. We had more normal cash flow in the quarter and I think you will expect -- should expect to see better cash generation out of us in the coming quarters relative to focus on inventory adjustments. It's happening across the whole supply base and our customer base and not just, again, I want to make sure that people don't equate destocking to Consumer big customers. This is basically the supply chain across almost every business or industry that we serve adjusting back to normal levels of inventory. So that is circumstantial and that's playing out as we speak, because we are not the only company who's got higher levels of inventory in relationship to trying to adjust to the supply chain challenges in the last two years. Yeah. Good morning. Josh, we have not provided price detail by segment. But on a consolidated basis, price was in the 15% to 16% range on average across RPM in the second quarter and unit volume was up in some of our businesses down in the CPG and particularly in Europe. So on a total basis, unit volume in the quarter was down about 3%. We have held on to our pricing pretty much everywhere and as the supply chains adjust, typically in the past, there are very few areas where we would have to get back price. Some of it is in more commodity spaces. One example is in silicones in the Construction Products Group. There have been extraordinary spikes in silicone costs over the last year and a half, and that was a real problem for us in cost price/mix. There are significant declines in silicone prices. So you are likely to see some price adjustments in commodity -- more commodity areas like that. Other than that, historically, we have tended to hold on to our price across RPM and we intend to do that through this cycle as well. Sure. I think that's correct. There has been some destocking. I think that's stabilized. Consumer takeaway has still been very volatile from one week to the next. It could be down in units 10% or up 2% or 3% depending on the retailer. We have lost over the last year about $40 million in market share and I believe that that market share adjustment is over, and that's been in some categories of spray paint and wood states and finishes in a big box account. Our Consumer Group is pretty excited about the spring and we are going to be initiating a advertising and promotional initiatives in the spring, much larger than we have over the last couple of years. It's a combination of some new product introductions, some new market share opportunities. And finally, a supply chain such that we can deliver at the high fill rate levels that historically we have been able to deliver at. So we have done a lot of work, both through MAP 2025 and then specifically on the operations side at Rust-Oleum around some supply challenges and manufacturing efficiencies. Those have been addressed and we will be in a really strong position to be able to meet demand and also to drive demand in the spring selling season. So that's one area of strength for us as we look into the finish of fiscal 2023. Thank you. Hi, John. It's kind of broad based across our businesses. We have done six transactions this year, all very small product lines. But there have been some nice additions to Construction Products. Through some of the big construction product mergers, we were able to pick up pieces of concrete, I am sorry, of cement additives, which was a category that Euclid Chemical was not in. We have also invested internally and through some regional acquisitions and penalization for greater energy efficiency and wall construction. So some exciting areas for us, small acquisitions that with our distribution should be able to double or triple revenues in the coming years. So, that's pretty much what we have been seeing. As Matt commented on, we have been holding our discipline and we are seeing valuations coming down, and I suspect that we will continue to see small to medium-sized acquisition activity in the coming quarters. I think we have the price that we need now in the marketplace. I think the final straw of margin recovery is going to come through holding on to the price that we have got as raw materials cycle back to more normal cost levels. And when you look at our Consumer Group, the year-over-year improvement in EBIT is impressive. It has as much to do with how poorly we performed a year ago as it does today. We are still not back to record EBIT levels, but we expect to get there both through some commodity cycle recovery and the benefits of the MAP 2025 Program. Good morning. Sure. So the -- as you would guess and you are seeing in the numbers in our results, the residential piece has been weak and Europe has been weak. We have a very strong backlog in our roofing and waterproofing division going into the spring. And so as we sit here today, it looks like the spring and summer season for that portion of our Construction Products Group, which is the largest and most profitable will be strong, but we will see. Again, the volatility that we are seeing in different parts of our business, it's hard to understand how much of some of the underperformance here that we are expecting in Q3 is inventory destocking across customers and adjustments and/or weather related here as we start the quarter versus recessionary. As we sit here today, we have a very strong backlog and I think there's some comfort in the fact that unlike residential construction or normal commercial construction, there's been a lot of federal money and state and local money that will be going into school construction, into healthcare, and those are two very strong end-use markets for our roofing waterproofing division. Yeah. It's a good question and it's definitely a drag on EBIT. We have dropped shifts in certain places where we had previously been operating on a three-shift basis and that was not demand driven. That was inventory adjustment driven. And when you do that, your overhead absorption takes a hit and so that's temporary and you are seeing that in a number of places across RPM. So there's a deliberate effort to get inventory levels in a number of our businesses back to a normal pace and that will hurt us in the seasonally low third quarter as these actions again negatively impact overhead absorption. I'd like to think, I don't know how quickly we will adjust it will be adjusted through the spring and the summer selling season, which are our strong seasons and so those temporary negative impacts on gross margin should pick back up. Thank you. So it's mostly, Steve, focused on areas that would affect gross profit and so it is a continuation of what we call MS 168, which is driving lean manufacturing disciplines on a consistent basis across our manufacturing base. We had in our original MAP program, done so very effectively but really in our top 50 plants and there's another 75 plants out there that are more small- to medium-sized our ability to get to effectively was interrupted by COVID and so that's having an effect. There will be some modest plant consolidation, nothing to the extent of the original MAP program, but some modest plant consolidation and so those are two big areas. Then the other area is literally being in a position today to use data much more effectively to understand cost price mix better and to be able to drive a more deliberate margin profile that we want relative to really not having that data all the way down to a salesperson level such that we can really be deliberate and effective there. And so those are the primary areas that will affect principally gross profit margin. You have other -- yeah. The last piece of that we talked about is, we do expect somewhere between $100 million and $200 million of gross margin recovery from commodity cycle improvement as well, which is consistent with the margin recovery that we have had in past commodity cycles and in reference to a response to an earlier question. Yeah. Absolutely. So as you saw in the Investor Day presentation, over the last four years, our internal cross-selling efforts have increased from $60 million annually to $180 million, and certainly, the opportunity for that to double in the coming years exists. One example is, because of the success we have had with Arnette Polymers, which is a pre-polymer raw material resin division of Stonhard and then the Corsicana plant which, while it's part of our Construction Products Group, today is principally serving Consumer and Rust-Oleum. We are utilizing the leadership there to create a resin center of excellence in Europe to create the same type of stability and certainty in supply, competitive advantage in raw materials and cost selling and that's going to play out over the next 12 months or 18 months. So that's one of many concrete examples of trying to continue to accelerate what's been a pretty good story in terms of intercompany supply and/or cross-selling revenue benefits. Good morning. Thanks. Sure. Thank you. It will have a disproportionate negative impact on Q3 and that's certainly part of our guidance. As you trying to ramp down production in this case in a few specific areas to address inventory imbalances as opposed to absolute demand and I had commented earlier about the overhead absorption hit. It will be less in Q4 and into Q1. I think it will take another six months or nine months for us to get inventory back to where we want. It's just a slow and steady progression. But you are already seeing this. Our inventory levels quarter-over-quarter on a relative days basis haven't improved much. But there's been a significant shift from what was a higher-than-usual carrying of raw material inventory into finished goods, which is obviously the cash conversion cycle that we like to see. Now we got to sell it and turn it into cash. And I have never seen -- we have talked about destocking in the past when some of our big consumer customers would work to get to the next level of inventory stock efficiency and that certainly happened to us and people have talked about its impact circumstantially when it's happened. In my career, I have never seen the supply chain disruptions and then related inventory imbalances. And so, for instance, there were there was demand we couldn't meet in some of our Consumer businesses over the last year because of these things. So we would have certain customers order in excess more than what they probably needed because they wanted to get what they could sell. We had customers in our Construction Products Group over the last year going to the same thing. So you just had odd circumstances across multiple businesses and channels and industries in terms of order flows caused by this supply chain disruption and with a settling down of supply chains, which I think were back to normal, now you are seeing people try and modulate back into a normal inventory level and a refocus on working capital position back to something that's more normal and more stable and more predictable. Sure. As we think about Q3 going into the spring, we saw solid performance from our Consumer Group and we would expect to see that continue. We saw really solid performance in our Performance Coatings Group and given their infrastructure function and focus and heavy industry focus and some of the onshoring and infrastructure dollars out there, we expect that to continue. The weakness was really in the Construction Products Group at particularly as we start Q3. I can't tell you sitting here whether it's a sustained weakness that's continuing that's more recession like or whether some of it was a result of the winter storm that impacted all North America. We saw weakness in the OEM portion of our Specialty Products Group or our Specialty Products Group is about $800 million, about half of that is OEM coatings, powder coatings, liquid metal, wood stains and finishes, and again, some of that could be circumstantial. Over the last couple of years, the normal between Christmas, New Year shutdowns that some of our cabinet maker customers, door customers, RV customers had traditionally, they did not have, well, they had those again this year and some of that is extending into January. And how much of that is in anticipation of continuing recessionary pressure as opposed to some of these inventory adjustments we won't know for another month or 2. Thank you. Good morning. The other thing I would add to that as a result of our MAP to Growth program, as well as MAP 2025, our corporate staff has increased by about 30%. Now it starts on a relatively low basis of, let's say, 90 people, and I'd say, we are up to about 125, 130. That's in areas of IT, which we are driving center led in a number of areas. It's in a team of continuous improvement in engineering professionals that number about 12 and it's a team of corporate staff procurement people of about eight, none of which existed in the corporate payroll three years or four years ago. Sure. We look at SG&A levels across all our businesses on a regular basis. Some of the SG&A increases are along the lines of what Rusty talked about in terms of wage increases. It's been a challenging not -- for everybody a challenging employment environment and so inflation is not only raw material and raw material inflation is stabilizing and coming down, but wage inflation is here and it's here to stay. So that's part of it. The other issue is a return to, I don't know that we will ever get back to pre-COVID levels of travel and entertainment, but we are certainly getting back to more ordinary levels of investment in those categories than what we experienced during the COVID period, because they were damn near zero and that includes in-person sales meetings, traveling to customers and getting our people on site in front of customers more aggressively than we did, let's say, 12 months or 18 months ago. Yeah. I think that our third quarter is probably the wrong period of time, especially this quarter to be able to answer that question. Europe is the biggest driver of the deteriorating performance. And again, if you follow my comments, the world is not ending for RPM by any way, shape or form. I talked about in Q2, regionally, Europe was down 11% and given price increases, you can assume that unit volume was down more and then EBIT was off 50% in Europe. Gives you a sense of the strength of RPM anywhere else. We are seeing the weakness that we talked about. And Kevin, it's too soon for us to be able to say how much of it was weather related, how much of it is inventory driven shutdowns and OEM customers versus how much of it is full on recession. And so, I don't think we can answer that question today with any certainty. If you want to ask that our April call, I think, we would be in a much better position to have some clarity around that question. Sure. The fixed cost leverage both at Corsicana, which is serving Consumer and some of our Construction Products businesses, also Carboline in terms of alkyd resins. It's not just Corsicana, it's knocking off some weekend activity in plants or knocking off a shift to try and make inventory adjustments. That basically to slow down production so that we can get our inventory back in line and so the overhead absorption hit as a result of that, it's going to negatively impact Q3. I don't recall the other... MAP saving... Yeah. We -- I think we have commented the conclusion of not providing MAP savings every quarter. Our target is $120 million for fiscal 2023, which we are comfortable in hitting. I think we have disclosed, Rusty or Matt, what have we disclosed year-to-date in the prior -- in the first quarter? $30 million -- yeah. $30 million in the first quarter. So I think you can extrapolate that across the quarter, particularly as it relates to understanding since most of this is being driven at the gross profit level. It will -- that $120 million will flow around that basis in proportion to our revenue growth by quarter. Thank you. Hi, Mike. So a couple of things. I think we need to be effective in the sales and marketing and promotion activities that we expect to generate consumer and we are excited about that in the spring. So you will see some new product rollouts, and again, a higher level of advertising and promotion, because we have gotten ourselves back to the point of being able to supply on a very high level efficient basis. And I think we have a number of growth initiatives around Nudura. That's just -- that's a business that grew from $40 million to $100 million. It's a big. It's got a disproportionate amount of that work in residential. We have a lot of work to do to get that specified into commercial markets, particularly schools and other areas and we are working on that and the economic circumstances are not going to change that focus. So we have a number of exciting areas for us that we are going to continue to invest in, notwithstanding what's going on with the economy. Broadly speaking, Mike, we have got to see the Fed quit raising interest rates and we have got to see some stability in housing and things like that. And so those are the macro issues that are not only affecting us, but I think they are affecting everybody and so that's -- I guess that's the best answer I would have. We -- to an earlier question, we manage our SG&A unit-by-unit. We will continue to do that where appropriate. But we are not in a position where we see any need to come out with any broad based expense reduction program. We are still focused on executing our MAP program and selectively investing aggressively in a number of growth initiatives. Thank you. Good morning. We have lost that over the last 12 months and I think that's in relationship to, it wasn't unique to us, but the challenges that we faced in meeting demand because of supply disruptions. And so that was a between spray paint, where we have had a bare gain, a modest amount of spray paint in Home Depot and also some wood stains and finishes, about $30 million or $40 million of market share loss and I believe that's over. Yeah. This is Frank. It's a little bit of both. It will be up year-over-year just because we didn't spend a lot in the face of the supply chain challenges. But we are working to get back to normal levels pretty quickly and we have got some exciting new product introductions that we will talk about in the spring. And we have some exciting new products, we have some new market share opportunities and we have our operations in a position to lean in hard to support all of that. So we are going to get back to an advertising and promotion level that's more consistent with the past and there will be necessary to support that growth. That -- it falls in SG&A and we will be in a better position to provide details on that in April. Yeah. Good morning, Arun. Sure. So, at some point, we are going to be rounding easier comps in Europe, because Europe, we have been talking about since last spring has been deteriorating. And so I don't -- we are not in early innings there at all, we are in the teeth of a pretty good recession in demand destruction. And so, I think, boy, six months from now, nine months from now, at the very least, we will be stabilizing and moving in the right direction there. Part of that is geopolitical circumstantial in terms of the Russian war in Ukraine, in terms of energy markets in Europe and those things. The one area, and again, it's about $300 million, about $200 million in Construction Products and $100 million in Consumer, is our exposure to residential, new construction. And I wouldn't say it surprised us, but data has slowed down significantly and profitable business there. And I think you need to see stabilization of what the Fed is doing on interest rates before you are going to see stabilization both in the new home construction space and better housing turnover, which also drives a nice chunk of our [Audio Gap] Sure. In the past cycles, we have been able to maintain the vast majority of the price increases that we have initiated and we would expect to do exactly the same thing here. If you look at our performance in past commodity cycles, on the down cycle we should pick up $100 million to $200 million of margin benefit and we are working hard to do that and we intend to do it. And as I said, even Consumer with the very strong recoveries are showing there, and certainly, some of that is price driven, while the year-over-year performance is really strong. We are not yet back at record margins and we intend to get there through a combination of maintaining price where it's appropriate and the benefits of the MAP 2025 program. Thank you, Cole. Thanks to all of you for your participation in our investor call today. We are pleased with our second quarter results, which reflect the resiliency of our balanced business model and the extraordinary efforts of our associates around the globe. We are carefully monitoring early signs of economic slowing, but are confident in our ability to manage effectively through the entire business cycle. We look forward to providing you with details of our results in April. We will have a much better sense of where we are headed in terms of what seems to be an exciting opportunity for continuing growth in our Consumer Group and Performance Coatings Group, and hopefully, some improving performance out of Construction Products and Specialty Products as well. Thanks again for your time on today's call and best wishes for a happy, healthy and successful new year."

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Frank.\nFrank Sullivan: Thanks, Matt. Good morning. I'll share a broad commentary on our consolidated performance for the quarter, and then Mike Laroche will provide details on our financial results, after which Rusty Gordon will conclude our prepared remarks with our outlook. After our prepared remarks, we'll be pleased to take your questions. Before I begin discussing our results, I'd first like to send our best wishes and thoughts to all those impacted by Hurricane Ian, including many of our own associates. We're all grateful for the first responders and safety professionals who are playing a critical role in keeping people safe and rescuing those in danger. As people in the affected area work to rebuild their homes and property, our Legend Brands Disaster Restoration business and our Tremco Waterproofing business are responding to help return their lives to some sense of normalcy. For example, in our Tremco Weatherproofing Technologies, Inc. business associates drove 8 hours to obtain additional supplies in preparation for the storm and used, in one instance chainsaw to clear down trees to reach a commercial customer in deed. These include hospitals and schools. Additionally, one of our supervisors in Central Florida, Steve Reeves came in late Friday evening, the night before his son's wedding to ensure that our crews would be able to patch a customer\u2019s roof Saturday morning. These examples demonstrate the commitment we take in serving our customers and we will do our part to help the affected regions recover as quickly as possible. Now turning to our results. If you look at Slide 3 in our PowerPoint presentation, the first quarter was a positive one for RPM despite several market and macroeconomic challenges. Revenues grew by double-digits in all of our segments to reach a record for the first quarter and our adjusted EBIT margins recovered resulting in all-time record high adjusted EBIT for RPM. While supply conditions remain tight, material availability did improve throughout the quarter. This is primarily a result of measures our teams have taken, including using our Corsicana, Texas plant for self-sourced raw materials. Our R&D and procurement personnel have fought throughout the supply chain challenges by identifying new sources of raw materials and qualifying them to ensure our customers receive the quality products they expect from us. This collaboration, which is occurring across RPM's businesses has allowed us to better meet customer demand, add resiliency to our supply chain and realize additional savings from our MAP 2025, Margin Achievement Plan. During the first quarter, we generated $30 million of incremental MAP savings, which were a key driver in achieving record adjusted EBIT. The positive momentum in sales growth we achieved in fiscal year '22 continued during the first quarter of fiscal 2023. And I'm exceedingly proud of our associates' ability to overcome macroeconomic headwinds and supply chain challenges and convert this sales growth into expanded margins and improving profitability. Turning to Slide 4. You'll see all four segments generated double-digit sales growth resulting in record first quarter revenue. Consolidated unit volume increased approximately 5%, while pricing on a consolidated basis increased on average of 15%, as we work to catch up with continuing cost inflation that increased year-over-year 28% in the first quarter. Driven by operational efficiencies including the $30 million of MAP 2025 savings, pricing initiatives in three of our four segments achieved strong adjusted EBIT growth, with our Performance Coatings Group and Specialty Products Group achieving record results and consolidated EBIT margins expanded by approximately 170 basis points. Looking at sales by geography on Slide 5, growth was led by North America, our largest market which generated 80% of our first quarter revenue. Demand in North America was strong and we generated good sales growth across all of our segments. Emerging markets also performed well during the first quarter with double-digit revenue growth in Latin America, Asia-Pacific and Africa and the Middle East. Europe, which comprised 13% of overall sales in the first quarter was the outlier with revenue down 8.5%, which drove operating earnings down in the region 35% quarter-over-quarter. These declines resulted from the challenging macroeconomic conditions in Europe exacerbated by rapid inflation. Our Construction Products Group and Performance Coatings Group, which have relatively sizable presence in Europe, felt the impact of these challenging market conditions most acutely. I'll now turn the call over to Michael Laroche to discuss our consolidated segment financial results in more detail.\nMichael Laroche: Thanks, Frank. We generated record first quarter consolidated net sales of $1.93 billion, an increase of 17.1% compared to the $1.65 billion reported in the prior fiscal year period. Organic sales growth was 19.5% or $321.9 million. Acquisitions contributed 1% to sales, or $16 million while foreign exchange was a headwind that decreased sales by 3.4% or $56 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were a record $1.47 and represents an increase of 36.1% compared to the $1.08 reported in the year-ago quarter. Our consolidated adjusted EBIT increased 33.1% to an all-time record $275.3 million compared to $206.8 million reported in the prior year period. Our Construction Products Group generated first quarter record net sales of $729.7 million, an increase of 13.2% compared to the fiscal 2022 first quarter. Organic sales growth was 15.8% with acquisitions contributing 1.9% and foreign currency translation headwinds reducing sales by 4.5%. Roofing systems generated strong growth and benefited from increased public sector spending, its turnkey service model and a focus on renovations. Admixture and repair products for concrete also grew strongly during the quarter as the business gained share. Geographically, Asia-Pacific markets performed well, while sales and earnings declined significantly in Europe and Canada where CPG is more concentrated compared to RPM overall. Europe experienced severe inflation and macroeconomic challenges, while Canada was negatively impacted by strikes and concrete shortages that impeded the completion of construction projects and led to inefficiencies. These market challenges in Europe and Canada were key drivers of adjusted EBIT decline, which was down 5.1% to $111.2 million compared to $117.2 million in the prior year period. Additionally, the Corsicana plant rolls up through CPG and resulted in a negative financial impact during the first quarter as the facility increases production toward full capacity. FX and mix also negatively impacted EBIT. Partially offsetting these headwinds was pricing in response to continued cost inflation, which was a positive contributor to adjusted EBIT. Performance Coatings Group's fiscal 2023 first quarter net sales were a record $340.4 million, an increase of 19.2% over the prior year period. Organic sales increased 23.6%. Acquisitions did not impact sales and foreign currency translation was a 4.4% headwind. Flooring Systems, Protective Coatings and FRP grading all generated double-digit growth. These businesses are well positioned to benefit from the trend of reshoring manufacturing to the U.S. Additionally, energy markets continue to generate strong growth as did emerging markets. Pricing management also contributed to the strong growth. Adjusted EBIT increased 27.6% to a record $47.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The growth was driven by positive volumes, selling price increases and sales management, which generated favorable mix. Partially offsetting these positive factors was foreign exchange, which was a headwind to adjusted EBIT. Specialty Products Group reported record net sales of $202.7 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2023, an increase of 11.3% compared to the period a year ago. Organic sales increased 12.8%, acquisitions added 0.6% and foreign currency translation was a headwind of 2.1%. Record first quarter sales were driven by strength in the food coatings and additives business, whose new management team positioned this operating unit to benefit from increased institutional demand as pandemic restrictions were lifted. The Disaster Restoration Equipment business also grew its top line as we work through backlogs caused by previous semiconductor chip shortages. Selling price increases in response to continued cost inflation also contributed to revenue growth. SPG's adjusted EBIT of $29.6 million was a first quarter record and an increase of 18.9% compared to adjusted EBIT of $24.9 million in the prior year period. The increase was driven by improved sales and pricing, as well as fixed cost leverage resulting from higher production volume in the Disaster Restoration Equipment business. The Consumer Group achieved record first quarter net sales of $659.5 million in fiscal 2023, an increase of 22.5% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Organic sales increased 24.1%, acquisitions added 0.4% and foreign currency translation was a headwind of 2%. The Consumer Group's revenue growth was driven by improved supply of key alkyd resins produced by the Corsicana manufacturing facility, we acquired last September as well as from new suppliers who our teams worked hard to qualify. This increase in supply allowed us to better meet customer demand. Price increases in response to continued inflation also contributed to the strong revenue growth. Consumer Group's adjusted EBIT in the fiscal 2023 first quarter was $117.1 million, an increase of nearly 15% (ph) compared to adjusted EBIT of $46.9 million reported for the prior year period when sales and profitability suffered from severe supply shortages resulting from a plant explosion at an alkyd resins supplier. The growth was driven by MAP operational efficiencies that were realized as a result of the improved material supply. Pricing increases in response to continued cost inflation also contributed to adjusted EBIT margins approaching long term averages. Now I'd like to provide an update on capital allocation and structure. During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we repurchased $25 million of shares and paid dividends of $51.4 million. These actions demonstrate our long held commitment to enhance shareholder value by returning capital. Turning to our capital structure. We took actions to enhance our balance sheet, strength and flexibility. First, we increased the size of our revolving credit facility by $50 million to $1.35 billion and extended its term to August 1, 2027. This credit facility provides us the flexibility to implement strategic initiatives including MAP 2025 and M&A. Additionally, we prepaid $50 million of our term loan and extended its maturity to August 2025 from February 2023. The outstanding principal on this term loan is now $250 million. As a result, we only have modest repayment requirements through 2026. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rusty to discuss our outlook.\nRusty Gordon: Thank you, Mike. As we look forward to the second quarter of fiscal 2023 several of the challenges we faced in the first quarter are expected to continue and possibly intensify. Supply chains are improving both from our initiatives and market conditions, but remain tight and any disruptions can delay the realization of benefits from the execution of our growth initiatives. A strong U.S. dollar is expected to continue to be a headwind to both sales and adjusted EBIT growth, particularly in our CPG and PCG businesses which have a larger percentage of their sales outside the U.S. From a macroeconomic perspective, Europe is expected to be challenged by high inflation and impacts from the war in the Ukraine. In the U.S. persistently high inflation and rising interest rates have increased economic uncertainty and the possibility of an economic downturn. Even with this uncertainty, we are confident that the strategic actions we have taken position us to succeed in the second quarter and beyond. These include: number one, actions to further improve material supply; number two, implementing MAP 2025 initiatives; number three, positioning our businesses to benefit from the reshoring of manufacturing to the U.S. and continued infrastructure and stimulus spending; and number four, diversifying our portfolio of businesses which have limited exposure to China and autos, while focusing on sustainability, including maintenance, restoration and energy efficiency. As a result, we anticipate that second quarter sales growth on a consolidated basis will increase 9% to 12% led by consumer, which is expected to continue to benefit from better material supply and pricing increases in response to continued inflation. Fiscal 2023 second quarter consolidated adjusted EBIT is expected to increase by 30% to 40% as we benefit from MAP 2025 savings and favorable comparisons to the second quarter of fiscal 2022, when we were challenged by severe supply chain disruptions. This concludes our prepared comments. We will now be pleased to take your questions.\nMatt Schlarb: Waseem, where -- can you please open the line for questions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, John.\nJohn McNulty: Good morning, Frank, and congratulations and across the board, really solid results. So wanted to understand the consumer business maybe a little bit better because it was definitely stronger than we thought and I guess there were kind of two parts that the top line and the margin side. On the top line, I guess, how reflective is that of kind of the current demand environment? And is there like a catch up because I know alkyds kind of held you back from stocking the shelves in the past? Like, was there a little bit of a catch up, or are you actually seeing that kind of point of sale demand right now? And then on the margin front, again, the margins definitely came back faster than we thought and it seems like you've got an even better handle on the alkyds situation or it came back faster than we thought. I guess, is that a fair characterization of the quarter or were there some one time things that maybe benefited you and maybe we shouldn't be thinking about this as a good kind of normal run rate going forward? I guess, how would you characterize that?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So, John, let me start with some big picture comments that will then get specific to your questions on consumer. So I commented on our organic growth and the split which is roughly 5% unit volume on a consolidated basis and 15% price. Either we or any of our competitors provide specific price detail or at a segment level. But with that guidance, we had higher than average price increases in consumer, that's consistent with the historic patterns of getting price typically at a six-month to nine-month lag to what we get in other parts of RPM. So you could see that in our results a year ago where we were really challenged in operating it at historic low margin levels and low profitability, that was part of it. So a lag in pricing relative to raw material cost increases, which we're now catching up on. Second issue is clearly material. We moved aggressively to be able to source our own alkyd resins with the purchase of the Corsicana plant in Texas last September and that has helped us significantly we believe to catch up on demand that we weren't in the industry wasn't able to meet because of this alkyd resins shortfall. And then lastly, MAP 2025 is something that we have been working on for a year. And Rusty and I had hoped to introduce it and provide more detail before now. As you know, we have an Investor Day, which will be webcast on Friday that will provide more details on MAP 2025. We were waiting for a more stable period of time and it started to feel like waiting for a Gadea because there has not been a more stable period of time in the last two years and I don't think it's very stable today. I say all that because we have been designing and beginning to implement MAP 2025 over the last, let's call it, six months plus. And better than half of that work initially has been at our Consumer Group. And so if you look at the adjustments of consulting fees and other fees, we had a lot to do with -- a lot of work to do on operating efficiencies and SIOP efficiencies particularly consumers, so there's been a lot of work on that in the last year. Those three things, I think combined to generate the strong recovery at consumer. The last comment I will make and then I'll stop and answer additional questions is that despite the strong quarter only at our Performance Coatings Group, are we operating at record EBIT margins? We are not back to record EBIT margins at Construction Products and at Specialty Products or at Consumer. So we still have some more work to do both in terms of executing on MAP 2025 and on addressing cost price mix issues that have been driven by the inflationary environment that we're in.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. No, that's hugely helpful on the color. Maybe I can ask just as the follow-up on the Construction segment because you actually kind of pointed -- you gave a good segue on that. So the margin in that one, when I look at 1Q was down about 300 basis points from the prior year and even the year before that. Now you highlighted a couple of different things that might have impacted it. And so I'd love to get a little bit better understanding on it. You mentioned that there was a strike, there was a concrete shortages, you also have the Corsicana plant, it's now in here and maybe isn't kind of running on all cylinders quite yet. I guess can you unpack how we should be thinking about the margins degradation in that business and how to think about that going forward as maybe some of these things reverse themselves?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So the Corsicana plant is owned and operated by our Construction Products Group. The primary beneficiary of owning that facility so far has been our Consumer Group and in particular Rust-Oleum relative to introducing acrylic resin production there. It carries a cost of about $3 million negative per quarter. And so we're working to fill up that capacity and we have every belief that we will do so successfully both with some external production as well as more internal production across some different chemical products. But right now that cost is borne on the EBIT and P&L of our Construction Products Group. Europe is something we talked about when we talk to investors in July and our concerns have been borne out. Europe's in a recession. Our biggest exposure in Europe is in our Construction Products Group, whether it's in the UK and/or on the continent. And so energy costs or MS (ph) inflation is a -- happened a little later and so a little bit bigger than what we're seeing now in North America. Our ability to get a price there in the Construction Products Group because of Europe, I talked about the average price on a consolidated basis of 50% and the Construction Products Group was actually somewhat less than the average across all of RPM. And then the Canadian situation surprised us, but I think it's circumstantial. This is a quarter that happened over the summer months. And as you'll recall, there were some significant trucking strikes There also has not been new cement capacity in North America, particularly in Canada for probably 20 years. And so there has been a cement and related concrete shortage that's particularly been a problem in Canada, although it is somewhat of an issue in the U.S. And that negatively impacted both revenue base and the profit margin profile of Nudura in particular because concrete has been shorted to residential and light commercial versus infrastructure or more heavy industry.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. Thanks very much for the color, Frank.\nFrank Sullivan: Thanks, John.\nOperator: All right. Great. Now we will move on to the next question, John Roberts from Credit Suisse. You can go ahead with your question.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, John.\nJohn Roberts: Thanks. Congratulations. Good morning. Congratulations on the quarter and look forward to Friday. Where are alkyd resins prices versus last quarter in a year ago now? And would you say alkyds are now in line with the other resins and will basically just follow oil prices with a lag?\nFrank Sullivan: So I don\u2019t -- I\u2019ll let Rusty answer the specific there. I can tell you in the quarter, inflation was up year-over-year by 28% and sequentially from Q4 up about 2.5%. And I\u2019ll have to let Rusty for more specifics.\nRusty Gordon: Yeah. Alkyd resins, John, were up more than double that over 60% increase. What was the second part of your question, John?\nJohn Roberts: It's just where they are relative to other resins and will they basically just lag oil prices from here forward?\nRusty Gordon: Yeah. And in terms of alkyd resins, those have been affected by a variety of raw materials besides oil, they do incorporate certain components of plant based oils that we had difficulty getting out of Russia and the Ukraine. So there's a number of things besides oil that will impact that. As you probably remember, we had a major supplier outage over a year ago in North America, so supply has been tight. We have ramped up in sourcing at our Corsicana facility, but that does not take care of most of our requirements. It's a small percentage. So we still rely on the alkyd resins market and its way up in inflation.\nJohn Roberts: And could you talk about your exposure to rising interest rates that offset part of the upside at EBIT?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. In general, I think Rusty and his team have done a pretty good job there. About 60% of our debt capital structure is fixed with an average duration of almost 13 years and an average interest cost of 4.1%. And so the latest piece of that was a 10 year bond that was done in January of this year at 2.95%. So we've got some really solid interest rate protection there. The remaining 40% is floating rate and still at rates below our fixed rates. And part of our capital allocation strategy in the 2.5 year period of MAP 2025 is to reduce some of those debt levels.\nJohn Roberts: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: All right. Our next question comes from Mike Harrison from Seaport Research Partners.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Mike.\nMike Harrison: Hi. Good morning. Congratulations on the nice quarter and impressive guidance. I was wondering, if Frank you're willing to talk at all about the second half of fiscal '23 because you're doing something like 35% year-on-year EBIT growth for the first half based on your guidance and what you've just delivered. The comps do get a little bit more challenging in the second half, but I think we'd all appreciate maybe some initial thoughts on what EBIT growth could look like in the second half kind of based on what you know at this point, which I'm conscious that there's a lot of uncertainty out there?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So we provided guidance for Q2 and I think as we sit here today, we're pretty comfortable with that guidance, recognizing there's still tons of volatility. When we talk to investors in July about Q1, we did not anticipate the challenges that happened to our Construction Products Group in Canada for instance. Again, we think those are circumstantial behind us. So the Q2 guidance is there. Given the seasonality of our Q3 and the benefits of our MAP 2025 program, I think that we're likely to have a pretty solid Q3 performance. Mike, beyond that, I think who knows. We are aware that fundamental primary chemicals have dropped meaningfully. That is not showing up in the paint coatings industry's purchased chemicals yet. As I said, we've had 28% inflation year-over-year in Q1. What happens in Europe relative to the Russian war on Ukraine and its impact on energy costs and economic activity, particularly in the winter, it's hard to know. So I would -- it's impossible for us to venture beyond my comments.\nMike Harrison: All right. That's fair enough. And then I was wondering if you could comment on your fill rates within the Consumer business and maybe any shelf space wins and losses as you're kind of exiting this heavier season and starting to look at the next head (ph) season?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. Depending on the product line, across all of our Consumer Group and this is principally a North American commentary. Our fill rates range anywhere from the mid-70s to mid-90s. That is not at the 98% or 99% that our customers expect or that we delivered for decades, but it's substantially better than the 50% to 60% fill rates that we and others in our industry were operating at in fiscal '22 and part of fiscal '21 is a result of all the supply chain shortages. So there's been significant recovery there and you can see that in our Consumer Group results, but we still have more work to do and we are utilizing outside consultants on manufacturing and operations side in various places of RPM, but in particular in our Consumer businesses to address some inefficiencies that popped up both in the midst of the COVID boom and then the challenges that everybody faced with the supply chain issues. Just as a reminder, it was just in the third quarter of this last fiscal year and January of this calendar year, so December, January, we have massive Omicron disruptions in our Pleasant Prairie plant and our Kenosha distribution center. Those are our two largest facilities across all of RPM, the largest facilities in Consumer. So it's been pretty crazy. So fill rates were up dramatically better, but not where they need to be yet and we're working on that.\nMike Harrison: All right. Thanks very much.\nFrank Sullivan: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: We have Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley for our next question.\nVincent Andrews: Thank you.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning.\nVincent Andrews: Congratulations on the results. I have a quick follow-up on that last question. Just as you know, I know it's category-capped and you have good access to what's going on in terms of retail takeaway. So understanding what you said about the fill rates. But are you making any progress in terms of those store shelves or is the product still going out the door faster than you can get it on the shelf?\nFrank Sullivan: I think we're making good progress on store shelves. And I think you're, again, across the industry, you're seeing in comparison to prior year periods declines in the low to single -- mid-single digits in terms of consumer takeaway. So there is some weakness in some categories at DIY. The flip side is on the pro-area. So that is more in our primers and in our DAP, coat (ph) and sealants. You're actually seeing the opposite, some low to mid-single digit unit volume growth because the pro-seems to be holding up pretty well. But DIY is takeaway is somewhat less than last year in recent periods is very volatile. And you can see one week to the next, where -- not fill rates, but consumer takeaway is up, and then a week later, it's down. So there's a lot of volatility there in the DIY space, but some pretty solid unit volume growth in the pro contractor space.\nVincent Andrews: And just as a follow-up, you talked about the new management team. What in particular are they doing in the food coatings or additive space to sort of shake things up for you guys?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. Our Mantrose-Haeuser Group, which is part of the Specialty Products Group, is originally the business that created NatureSeal, which was a patented product that eliminated browning in sliced apples. And so it really revolutionized the apple market, and we wrote a great profitability on that for a long time until it went off patent. So that was a challenge. We also acquired Holton Foods, a couple of other businesses that I don't recall off the top of my head, two or three other businesses that were relatively small, a business called PFI. And so they were high margin food coating and/or specialty sustainable food additive businesses. And we had the leader retired of the Mantrose-Haeuser business three years ago. The head of PFI, who actually was an owner who we bought the business from, ran that business for a couple of years. We have worked together with him to hire a really talented industry expert, who is pulling those businesses together on a more integrated basis in terms of our approach to the market, and it's working. And they're doing a really nice job there. There's some exciting product areas. There's a product called VerdeCoat. It's in testing. It is a coating for cardboard that would eliminate the need for plastic clamshells. So they have a lot of exciting things going on in that business. We've got a really talented industry expert that is now leading it and pulling together what formerly were good, but really independently operating businesses that were relatively small.\nVincent Andrews: Okay. Makes a lot of sense. Thanks for all the detail.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: We have Steve Byrne from Bank of America.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Steve.\nSteve Byrne: You mentioned some consulting fees and so forth. So what was the net earnings benefit of that? And perhaps more importantly, is that a sustainable earnings contribution in subsequent quarters or is this more of a one-timer? And I'm sure you'll get into more detail on Friday, but can you highlight anything in particular that you implemented to achieve that $30 million in cost savings?\nFrank Sullivan: We will get into it in more detail on Friday. And we've got some good slides that provide that detail. And so I don't want to get too much in front of that, and that will be webcast all that. Information will be available to both those people present, as well as people that are online. If you are present, you'll also get a tour of our Tremco Sealant business and get to see their test law. So we would encourage people to be here for that. I think you'll get some really good insights into some unique things that we're doing in our Construction Products Group. Specific to your question, we have been working with outside consultants around big data management, particularly as it relates to cost price mix. We have been working with folks in the consumer group on better efficiencies in our manufacturing facilities, and we are making good progress. That's particularly true at Rust-Oleum, where we have more purpose driven facilities around, for instance, large volume runs versus more specialty niche smaller runs. So there's a lot of areas that we are really focused on. And they all are areas that should be gifts that continue to keep on giving, not one-time items. The original MAP to growth program, a key element of that was MS 168, which is our manufacturing systems 168, and introducing lean manufacturing disciplines. Those efforts did not end with the formal end of the 2020 MAP to Growth program, which was May 31, '21. They are continuing, and that is giving us incremental benefits at the plant efficiency line as well. So -- and I guess the last comment I would make is we have been developing and beginning to execute MAP 2025 over the last year. We just kept waiting for the world to get more stable before we introduced and committed to some three year goals. And I guess, we decided that we'd be waiting forever. So we will and very excitedly introduce more detail on the MAP 2025 program on Friday.\nSteve Byrne: And Frank, any comment on what the EBIT contribution was from that? It sounds like whatever the cost associated with it has already been spent. So perhaps the margin benefit could expand from here?\nFrank Sullivan: So it was $30 million in Q1. And again, some of that is a result of the MAP 2025 initiatives. And some of that is a continuation of the original MAP program initiatives. And I think we'll provide more detail and more guidance on what we expect in the coming years and, in some cases for this year by quarter on Friday.\nSteve Byrne: And Frank, if I can squeeze one more in here. You mentioned Corsicana is owned by Tremco. It sounds like fixed costs associated with that plant are not necessarily allocated to the other segments based on production. Is that right? And does that not reduce the incentives for cross-segment collaboration?\nFrank Sullivan: No, we have a formulaic cost-plus approach to intercompany manufacturing and coordination, and that's what's being applied here. But one of the great benefits of our MAP to Growth program was the reorganization into four segments and four groups, and being center-led in manufacturing in this lean manufacturing disciplined approach being center-led really to the point of centralized in procurement. And the data that was required, the data lake or data base that was required to allow that to happen. And so the collaboration and cooperation across RPM is a hell a lot better today than it ever was. And so your question, I think, sharply reflects following RPM for a long time and the fact that 10 years ago, that might have been a problem. It's not a problem today.\nSteve Byrne: Thank you.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: We have Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Arun.\nOperator: Please go ahead with your question, Arun Viswanathan. Arun, your line is open. Please go ahead. Arun, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nArun Viswanathan: Okay. I'm sorry, I was suppose asking a question on\nFrank Sullivan: Sorry go ahead, Arun.\nArun Viswanathan: Can you guys hear me now?\nOperator: Yeah.\nFrank Sullivan: Yes, we can. We're having some technical difficulties.\nArun Viswanathan: Sorry about that. So real quick, I was just wondering if you could help us understand, again, consumer was well above our estimates. So looking at that segment, if you could maybe split the upside that you saw between maybe alkyd resins availability improvement, price cost and demand? How would you kind of characterize how the segment performed and your outlook, I guess, in those three buckets? Thanks.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. Pretty much the comments we've made earlier. A disproportionate share of our early MAP 2025 initiatives have been focused on Consumer, particularly in manufacturing efficiencies. And so, we have picked up some manufacturing conversion cost efficiencies there. You'll recall a year ago that we talked about our gross margins were down in fiscal '22 in certain quarters by as much as 1,000 basis points, pretty dramatic. And we had talked about how hundreds of basis points of that was just poor throughput because of the material shortages, because of some of the labor issues we faced. So a combination of access to alkyd resins, and we think we have developed with Corsicana maybe some better access to alkyd resins than some competitors, and a more normal throughput in our plants helped overhead cost absorption as well. And then certainly, cost price mix. We got higher price increases over the summer in consumer than we got over the summer in our other businesses because we were late. So again, if you go back last year on a quarter-by-quarter basis, you saw really solid performance as we were gaining price in our industrial segments. And it took us that typical six month to nine month lag to be able to start to catch up on the cost price mix in consumer. And you saw that, obviously, in the first quarter. So those are the primary drivers of our Consumer business. We did have positive unit growth, which in this environment is not true in all consumer categories. And some of that's the nature of our businesses relative to small project redecorating, patch and repair and maintenance. And I think some of it is catching up on some of the supply shortages and fill rate issues that we've been improving upon since last year.\nArun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks. And if I could just ask a quick follow-up. So you've guided to -- it looks like about 16% adjusted EBIT margin in fiscal '25. Looks like over the last, say, five years, you've been more in the 11% to 12% range, so on an annual basis. So it's a nice kind of 400 basis point to 500 basis point uplift. Of that improvement, would you say that the progress would be equally split between the segments or which segments do you see the greatest opportunity? And that move, would that be ratable over the period or would it be kind of back half weighted or how do you think about that? Thanks.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So I can answer that from a big picture perspective. And then obviously, we'll provide segment results when we release those and talk about them in January. From a big picture perspective, we made really good progress in our 2020 MAP to Growth program. And we were a little bit behind the curve in terms of our goals. And then we got walloped by COVID and the supply chain challenges and took a big step backwards that you saw in our results, particularly in consumer. As volumes coming through our businesses and as we're catching up on cost price mix across all of our businesses, you are seeing us regain some of the MAP 2020 margin improvement that we obtained and is real, but was impacted by supply chain challenges. And as I indicated earlier, the MAP 2025 program has been in the works for a year and been in execution, particularly with a focus on consumer starting in January. And so we're getting the benefit of that, and that will continue throughout fiscal '23. We expect positive sales and EBIT results in each of our four segments in the second quarter, but the volatility is such that beyond that, I wouldn't say much about -- further about our expectations other than what we'll realize and then report in more detail in January.\nArun Viswanathan: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: We will take -- our next question comes from Josh Spector, UBS.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning.\nJosh Spector: Yeah. Hey. Good morning. Can you guys hear me?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes.\nRusty Gordon: Yeah.\nJosh Spector: Okay. Great. Just checking. So I just wanted to follow up on Europe specifically within construction and performance. The drivers there are pretty different in terms of the customer buying patterns. And I tend to think about performance at least a little bit more linked of kind of industrial CapEx maintenance spending. So I don't know, if you can comment if you've seen that part of your market pull back equally to what you've seen on the construction side or if they've been more similar? And then kind of related to that, I mean, most companies are talking about September got a lot worse versus August in the prior couple of months. Are you seeing that as well? And can you dimensionalize that versus the 8.5% decline you reported this quarter? Thanks.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So first of all, Europe was a challenge for all of our segments in the quarter. And we have a sizable presence there in Consumer, Performance Coatings and Construction Products. The biggest piece is Construction Products. Your observation is spot on. There are different dynamics. And so the Construction Products Group underperformed our expectations for the reasons we mentioned. Europe was a big piece of that. So on a relative basis, our Performance Coatings Group, while we struggled in Europe there, it was not nearly to the extent as our Construction Products Group because of their end markets. Oil and gas, more industrial capital spending. And I will tell you, we expect in Q2, and it is within our guidance, continued negative performance in the top line, bottom line in the European marketplace. And I don't know that it's going to be any different than what we experienced in Q1, but we are a little bit anxious about the winter months and what it's going to look like when we get into the winter and then into the spring relative to the trajectory of the economy and its impact in Europe.\nJosh Spector: Okay. Maybe I could just try one other way just on the volume side, I guess, within Europe. I guess, if you were down 8% to 9% for the quarter, was August down meaningfully more? So I guess, were volumes down there mid-teens plus or was it more ratable for you?\nFrank Sullivan: Yeah. I don't know that we would want to get into talking about a month, particularly a month in our second quarter. But again, I don't -- I think in Q2, we would expect a similarly disappointing or deteriorated performance that we saw in Q1. And so it's a combination of weak economic activity. A meaningful contribution of it was the strong dollar and foreign exchange. So you're probably looking at a down 8% or 10% in the top line and a down comparable to the, I think 30% -- operating earnings were down 30%. I don't have -- we don't run EBIT and don't disclose EBIT necessarily by geography, but we thought it was important to highlight Europe because it was a key factor across all of our businesses, particularly in the Construction Products Group in terms of the challenges that we're facing, and that's going to continue at the same level.\nJosh Spector: Okay. Appreciate it. Thanks, Frank.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Jeff.\nJeff Zekauskas: Hi. Good morning. I think you said in the course of the call that your raw materials are up 28%. But in the\u2026\nFrank Sullivan: In Q1, our raw materials were up 28% year-over-year, and they were up about actually 2.6% from quarter-to-quarter from Q4 to Q1. They are increasing at a lower rate certainly than what we saw in Q4 and Q3, but they're still up year-over-year.\nJeff Zekauskas: Yeah. So I was puzzled by that because your cost of goods sold is up 14.5%. And even if you take your MAP to Growth savings of $30 million and you add that back, then cost of goods sold is up 18%. So how can raw materials be up 28% if cost of goods sold is only up 14%.\nFrank Sullivan: I would have to do the math and get back to you. Our cost of goods sold incorporate -- that basically we had chemical cost of goods sold and incorporates freight, it incorporates other issues. So I don't have a specific answer to you other than we did the calculation on our primary raw material chemicals and they're up 28%.\nJeff Zekauskas: Okay. And then in the [indiscernible] year-over-year quarter, your SG&A was up, I don't know, $57 million. How would you divide that among the different segments? Was the -- was there any SG&A growth in the consumer business? Was that kind of flat and did volumes grow year-over-year in consumer?\nFrank Sullivan: So volumes grew every -- in each segment except for our Specialty Products Group year-over-year. And the SG&A was relatively equal across all of our businesses. We don't disclose that level of detail, but they were consistent with a year ago. I think the thing that's benefited us during the MAP to Growth program, and quite honestly, through COVID, is there was a level of COVID-driven reductions in SG&A around travel and entertainment and other things. And through the benefits of MAP to Growth and also understanding certain COVID-impacted expenses, what was essential and continuing. So for instance, we are again doing major sales meetings across most of our major businesses. Those were expenses we did not incur for the two years of '20 and '21 during COVID that we are recurring those. But the level of T&E is at a lower level than it was pre-COVID. And so I guess those are the comments I would have, but there's really nothing extraordinary in SG&A. We are building some SG&A talent, if you will, in our Specialty Products Group. And we are also building some SG&A in our Carboline business in both cases, to address either opportunities for growth or specifically with Carboline to be more deliberate about expanding their base of business outside of their traditional oil and gas markets, which is really where they exceed and part of what's driving our Performance Coatings Group today. So we have a number of growth initiatives that's driving SG&A, but nothing out of the ordinary.\nJeff Zekauskas: And then lastly, interest rates are going up in the United States. Is that making a difference to your demand profile in construction products? Does it seem that your order level has changed at all or as far as you're concerned, interest rates really aren't making much of a difference at all in going up to your demand?\nFrank Sullivan: Yeah. It's a great question. We have some exposure to housing market now with Nudura. And so maybe our housing market exposure is a couple of hundred million dollars and we didn't have much of it before in total. So that's certainly somewhat interest rate sensitive. But we had solid organic growth in our Construction Products Group in the United States. And it's an interesting dynamic, Jeff, relative to the types of things that normally you would have looked at historically in recessionary periods that would be driving activity. And quite honestly, the fact that cities, counties and states are sitting on hundreds of billions of dollars, that have to be purposed from various stimulus. And so the institutional work that we're doing with schools or hospitals and the infrastructure work is still pretty solid. And if the dynamics around all the stimulus is true, that should remain true in the United States for another 1.5 years or two years. And you can't even see the benefits yet of the $1 trillion plus Infrastructure bill that was passed. So there's just some funny dynamics in this economy that don't fit with the normal type of indicators that you would have looked at in the past.\nJeff Zekauskas: Okay. Great. Thank you so much.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi from Baird.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Ghansham.\nGhansham Panjabi: Yeah. Good morning. Can you hear me?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes. Thank you.\nGhansham Panjabi: Okay. Great. Good morning, Frank. I guess just as related -- a follow-up to the last question, the Consumer in the U.S. and Europe, it's clearly absorbing a fair amount of inflation. Some categories that are even Consumer staples have started to show some signs of demand disruption as elasticity sort of unfolds. How do you see that dynamic playing out for your Consumer segment over the next couple of quarters? I realize raw material availability has improved, but what about the demand destruction component?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So in general, I think we're seeing demand destruction in Europe, and that's obvious from our results, and we expect that to continue, and we're concerned that it could get worse in the winter relative to energy issues in the Russian war in Ukraine. In the U.S., in particular, as I commented earlier, consumer takeaway has been volatile. From one week to the next, it's up 3% or 5%. Another week, it might be down 5% or 10%. So it's very volatile in terms of where consumer spending is. I think we're doing better than other kind of DIY categories because of the DIY small project paint, patch repair, maintenance aspect of our products and also the kind of catch up on the port fill rate situation that we experienced in the back half of fiscal '21 and a good part of fiscal '22. So that's improving. We are seeing -- and this is broadly inventory adjustments at all the big accounts. And again, so there's a lot of dynamics going on here. Inventory adjustments, but fill rates improving, volatile consumer takeaway is making for a very interesting dynamic. And so, I think that's why we're very confident in the forecast that we provided for Q2, but are still in a -- the business of forecasting quarter-by-quarter because to go out further than that is really impossible.\nGhansham Panjabi: Yeah. We're struggling with that as well. For the second question, on your comment, I think you said that raw materials were up roughly 3% or just under 3% sequentially. How do you sort of see that evolving 2Q onwards? And I'm asking because it seems like there could be some decorrelation between Europe since dealing with the energy prices of significance versus the U.S. If that is true, can you confirm that? And then second, are you fully caught up on price costs in each of your operating segments at this point?\nFrank Sullivan: So I'll answer the last part. The answer is no. We were fully caught up in a number of our industrial businesses. And then I think people were expecting, particularly with some of the underlying primary chemicals coming down that we'd see a flattening out. And so in our Construction Products Group, in a few instances, we're behind the curve because of continuing inflation in Q1. We're getting there in Consumer. And again, that's more related to the lag that the people are aware of that has been true for us forever. And so that, I think, that's an issue. We did have $30 million of benefit from the MAP 2025 program in Q1, and we will provide more detail on our expectations when we talk in our Investor Day, on Friday, including over the MAP 2025 program, some anticipation of improving in the commodity cycle which should benefit our margins. That's anybody's guess, but the current underlying lower levels of propylene and polyethylene and ethylene and some of the primary chemicals, which are down but have not translated into lower prices of the type of specialty chemicals we buy yet, are things that we'll talk about on Friday. And I think things that we anticipate should benefit margin recovery over the MAP 2025. But the world we're living in today is still inflationary. The situation in Q1 is may be surprising to some of our businesses, but it's the world we live in.\nGhansham Panjabi: Got it. Thanks so much.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: All right. Great. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Kevin.\nKevin McCarthy: Good morning. Can you hear me okay?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes. Thank you.\nKevin McCarthy: Excellent. I wanted to talk pricing a little bit, Frank. So you referenced the raw material cost increase of 2.6% on a quarter-to-quarter basis. In that context, are you continuing to seek incremental pricing at this stage of the cycle? And if so, where are you most encouraged or least encouraged by prospects there? And if I zoom out the lens, do you think that very impressive level of 15% that you realized in the first quarter can be sustained for a little while here or do you think the comps just get too tough, and therefore, the price contribution starts to come down?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So I think we'll have solid contributions from price in Q2. It will start -- the benefit of price across RPM will start to -- it will still be positive, but start to deteriorate in Q3 and Q4 as we annualize price increase actions that our companies took in fiscal '22. And so -- and then unless there are further price increases, which would be in response to further inflation, I think we round the annualizing of pretty much all of our price increases by the first quarter of next year. And so you'll see the impact slowly diminish after Q2, but still be positive. And that assumes that things stay stable as to where they are now.\nKevin McCarthy: Okay. That's very helpful. And I wanted to ask about your Legend Brands business. I think you referenced Hurricane Ian and some of the heroic efforts that RPM folks have been engaged in, in recent days. Can you put that event in context versus history? If I look back to Winter Storm Uri or Hurricane Harvey, how do these disasters tend to flow through the financials for that business?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So first of all, fiscal '22 was a particularly challenging in the back half of '21 time for Legend Brands. They're oddly -- because they're in the equipment business, and over time it develop very sophisticated equipment that could be controlled remotely were impacted by the chip shortage and so that was an issue. And there really wasn't much in the way of hurricane activity or challenges in calendar '21 or in our fiscal '22. It's certainly possible that an event like Ian could drive $10 million plus of a spiky revenue climb with pretty decent margin business over a, call it, a quarter and half or two quarter period. So it tends -- the response here is certainly going to be greater than zero. It could be $10 million plus, and it happens over, I will call it, a three month or four month period, but it's not a sustained increase. We've grown that business nicely since we bought it. They are selling their products into different channels and looking at some new product introductions. Those are the kind of things that lead to a steady increase on a business that's roughly $140 million. And then you can see these $10 million or $15 million event related spikes over time.\nKevin McCarthy: Got it. Thank you very much.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Sison from Wells Fargo.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Michael.\nRichard Garchitorena: Great. Hi. This is Richard on for Mike.\nMatt Schlarb: Hey, Richard. We can hear you.\nRichard Garchitorena: One question on, just maybe if you can give us some color on the commercial construction market, both in how it's impacted on CPG and PCG segments? And then maybe just sort of give us an outlook. You mentioned reassuring benefits which you should see maybe also just visibility on the lead time that you get on that as well.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So our Performance Coatings Group is more driven by heavy industry, so oil and gas, marine, wastewater, water treatment, things like that. And that business from a demand perspective is doing very well. That's globally as well as in North America. And we see that continuing because of the stimulus dollars I referenced and where they'll go and the infrastructure dollars that are coming and the onshoring. We do a lot of fab plants around the globe with our Stonhard Flooring business. We do a lot of intumescent fire coatings. One of the interesting thing is we had some interesting big projects in the last year, a Tesla plant expansion, some Intel expansions, that were difficult to supply because of raw material shortages. The raw material shortages that impacted that are behind us for now, hopefully permanently. So we're pretty bullish on the Performance Coatings Group dynamics for the foreseeable future. Construction Products is related to the things I talked about earlier. There are just conflicting demand signals. Europe is a problem for our Construction Products Group, and that will continue. North America has been really solid, both some cost price mix recovery and good unit volume growth. But we saw these unexpected, we think circumstantial situations around concrete supply, for instance, in Canada. Just an interesting challenge. Right now, we are generating positive unit volume growth and some additional price benefit on top of that. Although as you saw in the quarter, not enough to get us back to record EBIT margins. Those things, combined with the benefits of MAP 2025, we would expect will drive positive EBIT results year-over-year in all of our segments, including our Construction Products segment in Q2.\nRichard Garchitorena: Okay. Great. Thanks.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions. I would like to turn the call back to RPM Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Frank Sullivan.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you, Waseem, and thank you, everybody for your participation in our call today. Tomorrow at 2:00 P.M. Eastern Time, we will be holding a Virtual Annual Meeting of Stockholders. You can participate through our website at www.RPMinc.com, and we would welcome your participation and your questions, which we will have a Q&A session virtually. We hope to return to RPM's in-person annual meeting, which has always been an exciting event for us in the fall of 2023. We also have an Investor Day presentation on Friday morning. That is also accessible via webcast at www.RPMinc.com. And in that Investor Day, we will highlight our sustainability activity and efforts. We will talk about our Construction Products Group in general. And for those present, I think, have a very interesting tour of one of our Construction Products Group sealant facilities and also provide details of our MAP 2025 program. So we would welcome all of your active participation. Thank you very much for your participation in our first quarter call today and for your continued interest in RPM. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Mike. As we look forward to the second quarter of fiscal 2023 several of the challenges we faced in the first quarter are expected to continue and possibly intensify. Supply chains are improving both from our initiatives and market conditions, but remain tight and any disruptions can delay the realization of benefits from the execution of our growth initiatives. A strong U.S. dollar is expected to continue to be a headwind to both sales and adjusted EBIT growth, particularly in our CPG and PCG businesses which have a larger percentage of their sales outside the U.S. From a macroeconomic perspective, Europe is expected to be challenged by high inflation and impacts from the war in the Ukraine. In the U.S. persistently high inflation and rising interest rates have increased economic uncertainty and the possibility of an economic downturn. Even with this uncertainty, we are confident that the strategic actions we have taken position us to succeed in the second quarter and beyond. These include: number one, actions to further improve material supply; number two, implementing MAP 2025 initiatives; number three, positioning our businesses to benefit from the reshoring of manufacturing to the U.S. and continued infrastructure and stimulus spending; and number four, diversifying our portfolio of businesses which have limited exposure to China and autos, while focusing on sustainability, including maintenance, restoration and energy efficiency. As a result, we anticipate that second quarter sales growth on a consolidated basis will increase 9% to 12% led by consumer, which is expected to continue to benefit from better material supply and pricing increases in response to continued inflation. Fiscal 2023 second quarter consolidated adjusted EBIT is expected to increase by 30% to 40% as we benefit from MAP 2025 savings and favorable comparisons to the second quarter of fiscal 2022, when we were challenged by severe supply chain disruptions. This concludes our prepared comments. We will now be pleased to take your questions. Yeah. Alkyd resins, John, were up more than double that over 60% increase. What was the second part of your question, John? Yeah. And in terms of alkyd resins, those have been affected by a variety of raw materials besides oil, they do incorporate certain components of plant based oils that we had difficulty getting out of Russia and the Ukraine. So there's a number of things besides oil that will impact that. As you probably remember, we had a major supplier outage over a year ago in North America, so supply has been tight. We have ramped up in sourcing at our Corsicana facility, but that does not take care of most of our requirements. It's a small percentage. So we still rely on the alkyd resins market and its way up in inflation. Yeah."

            "content": "Thanks, Frank. We generated record first quarter consolidated net sales of $1.93 billion, an increase of 17.1% compared to the $1.65 billion reported in the prior fiscal year period. Organic sales growth was 19.5% or $321.9 million. Acquisitions contributed 1% to sales, or $16 million while foreign exchange was a headwind that decreased sales by 3.4% or $56 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were a record $1.47 and represents an increase of 36.1% compared to the $1.08 reported in the year-ago quarter. Our consolidated adjusted EBIT increased 33.1% to an all-time record $275.3 million compared to $206.8 million reported in the prior year period. Our Construction Products Group generated first quarter record net sales of $729.7 million, an increase of 13.2% compared to the fiscal 2022 first quarter. Organic sales growth was 15.8% with acquisitions contributing 1.9% and foreign currency translation headwinds reducing sales by 4.5%. Roofing systems generated strong growth and benefited from increased public sector spending, its turnkey service model and a focus on renovations. Admixture and repair products for concrete also grew strongly during the quarter as the business gained share. Geographically, Asia-Pacific markets performed well, while sales and earnings declined significantly in Europe and Canada where CPG is more concentrated compared to RPM overall. Europe experienced severe inflation and macroeconomic challenges, while Canada was negatively impacted by strikes and concrete shortages that impeded the completion of construction projects and led to inefficiencies. These market challenges in Europe and Canada were key drivers of adjusted EBIT decline, which was down 5.1% to $111.2 million compared to $117.2 million in the prior year period. Additionally, the Corsicana plant rolls up through CPG and resulted in a negative financial impact during the first quarter as the facility increases production toward full capacity. FX and mix also negatively impacted EBIT. Partially offsetting these headwinds was pricing in response to continued cost inflation, which was a positive contributor to adjusted EBIT. Performance Coatings Group's fiscal 2023 first quarter net sales were a record $340.4 million, an increase of 19.2% over the prior year period. Organic sales increased 23.6%. Acquisitions did not impact sales and foreign currency translation was a 4.4% headwind. Flooring Systems, Protective Coatings and FRP grading all generated double-digit growth. These businesses are well positioned to benefit from the trend of reshoring manufacturing to the U.S. Additionally, energy markets continue to generate strong growth as did emerging markets. Pricing management also contributed to the strong growth. Adjusted EBIT increased 27.6% to a record $47.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The growth was driven by positive volumes, selling price increases and sales management, which generated favorable mix. Partially offsetting these positive factors was foreign exchange, which was a headwind to adjusted EBIT. Specialty Products Group reported record net sales of $202.7 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2023, an increase of 11.3% compared to the period a year ago. Organic sales increased 12.8%, acquisitions added 0.6% and foreign currency translation was a headwind of 2.1%. Record first quarter sales were driven by strength in the food coatings and additives business, whose new management team positioned this operating unit to benefit from increased institutional demand as pandemic restrictions were lifted. The Disaster Restoration Equipment business also grew its top line as we work through backlogs caused by previous semiconductor chip shortages. Selling price increases in response to continued cost inflation also contributed to revenue growth. SPG's adjusted EBIT of $29.6 million was a first quarter record and an increase of 18.9% compared to adjusted EBIT of $24.9 million in the prior year period. The increase was driven by improved sales and pricing, as well as fixed cost leverage resulting from higher production volume in the Disaster Restoration Equipment business. The Consumer Group achieved record first quarter net sales of $659.5 million in fiscal 2023, an increase of 22.5% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Organic sales increased 24.1%, acquisitions added 0.4% and foreign currency translation was a headwind of 2%. The Consumer Group's revenue growth was driven by improved supply of key alkyd resins produced by the Corsicana manufacturing facility, we acquired last September as well as from new suppliers who our teams worked hard to qualify. This increase in supply allowed us to better meet customer demand. Price increases in response to continued inflation also contributed to the strong revenue growth. Consumer Group's adjusted EBIT in the fiscal 2023 first quarter was $117.1 million, an increase of nearly 15% (ph) compared to adjusted EBIT of $46.9 million reported for the prior year period when sales and profitability suffered from severe supply shortages resulting from a plant explosion at an alkyd resins supplier. The growth was driven by MAP operational efficiencies that were realized as a result of the improved material supply. Pricing increases in response to continued cost inflation also contributed to adjusted EBIT margins approaching long term averages. Now I'd like to provide an update on capital allocation and structure. During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we repurchased $25 million of shares and paid dividends of $51.4 million. These actions demonstrate our long held commitment to enhance shareholder value by returning capital. Turning to our capital structure. We took actions to enhance our balance sheet, strength and flexibility. First, we increased the size of our revolving credit facility by $50 million to $1.35 billion and extended its term to August 1, 2027. This credit facility provides us the flexibility to implement strategic initiatives including MAP 2025 and M&A. Additionally, we prepaid $50 million of our term loan and extended its maturity to August 2025 from February 2023. The outstanding principal on this term loan is now $250 million. As a result, we only have modest repayment requirements through 2026. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rusty to discuss our outlook."

            "content": "Thanks, Matt. Good morning. I'll share a broad commentary on our consolidated performance for the quarter, and then Mike Laroche will provide details on our financial results, after which Rusty Gordon will conclude our prepared remarks with our outlook. After our prepared remarks, we'll be pleased to take your questions. Before I begin discussing our results, I'd first like to send our best wishes and thoughts to all those impacted by Hurricane Ian, including many of our own associates. We're all grateful for the first responders and safety professionals who are playing a critical role in keeping people safe and rescuing those in danger. As people in the affected area work to rebuild their homes and property, our Legend Brands Disaster Restoration business and our Tremco Waterproofing business are responding to help return their lives to some sense of normalcy. For example, in our Tremco Weatherproofing Technologies, Inc. business associates drove 8 hours to obtain additional supplies in preparation for the storm and used, in one instance chainsaw to clear down trees to reach a commercial customer in deed. These include hospitals and schools. Additionally, one of our supervisors in Central Florida, Steve Reeves came in late Friday evening, the night before his son's wedding to ensure that our crews would be able to patch a customer's roof Saturday morning. These examples demonstrate the commitment we take in serving our customers and we will do our part to help the affected regions recover as quickly as possible. Now turning to our results. If you look at Slide 3 in our PowerPoint presentation, the first quarter was a positive one for RPM despite several market and macroeconomic challenges. Revenues grew by double-digits in all of our segments to reach a record for the first quarter and our adjusted EBIT margins recovered resulting in all-time record high adjusted EBIT for RPM. While supply conditions remain tight, material availability did improve throughout the quarter. This is primarily a result of measures our teams have taken, including using our Corsicana, Texas plant for self-sourced raw materials. Our R&D and procurement personnel have fought throughout the supply chain challenges by identifying new sources of raw materials and qualifying them to ensure our customers receive the quality products they expect from us. This collaboration, which is occurring across RPM's businesses has allowed us to better meet customer demand, add resiliency to our supply chain and realize additional savings from our MAP 2025, Margin Achievement Plan. During the first quarter, we generated $30 million of incremental MAP savings, which were a key driver in achieving record adjusted EBIT. The positive momentum in sales growth we achieved in fiscal year '22 continued during the first quarter of fiscal 2023. And I'm exceedingly proud of our associates' ability to overcome macroeconomic headwinds and supply chain challenges and convert this sales growth into expanded margins and improving profitability. Turning to Slide 4. You'll see all four segments generated double-digit sales growth resulting in record first quarter revenue. Consolidated unit volume increased approximately 5%, while pricing on a consolidated basis increased on average of 15%, as we work to catch up with continuing cost inflation that increased year-over-year 28% in the first quarter. Driven by operational efficiencies including the $30 million of MAP 2025 savings, pricing initiatives in three of our four segments achieved strong adjusted EBIT growth, with our Performance Coatings Group and Specialty Products Group achieving record results and consolidated EBIT margins expanded by approximately 170 basis points. Looking at sales by geography on Slide 5, growth was led by North America, our largest market which generated 80% of our first quarter revenue. Demand in North America was strong and we generated good sales growth across all of our segments. Emerging markets also performed well during the first quarter with double-digit revenue growth in Latin America, Asia-Pacific and Africa and the Middle East. Europe, which comprised 13% of overall sales in the first quarter was the outlier with revenue down 8.5%, which drove operating earnings down in the region 35% quarter-over-quarter. These declines resulted from the challenging macroeconomic conditions in Europe exacerbated by rapid inflation. Our Construction Products Group and Performance Coatings Group, which have relatively sizable presence in Europe, felt the impact of these challenging market conditions most acutely. I'll now turn the call over to Michael Laroche to discuss our consolidated segment financial results in more detail. Good morning, John. Sure. So, John, let me start with some big picture comments that will then get specific to your questions on consumer. So I commented on our organic growth and the split which is roughly 5% unit volume on a consolidated basis and 15% price. Either we or any of our competitors provide specific price detail or at a segment level. But with that guidance, we had higher than average price increases in consumer, that's consistent with the historic patterns of getting price typically at a six-month to nine-month lag to what we get in other parts of RPM. So you could see that in our results a year ago where we were really challenged in operating it at historic low margin levels and low profitability, that was part of it. So a lag in pricing relative to raw material cost increases, which we're now catching up on. Second issue is clearly material. We moved aggressively to be able to source our own alkyd resins with the purchase of the Corsicana plant in Texas last September and that has helped us significantly we believe to catch up on demand that we weren't in the industry wasn't able to meet because of this alkyd resins shortfall. And then lastly, MAP 2025 is something that we have been working on for a year. And Rusty and I had hoped to introduce it and provide more detail before now. As you know, we have an Investor Day, which will be webcast on Friday that will provide more details on MAP 2025. We were waiting for a more stable period of time and it started to feel like waiting for a Gadea because there has not been a more stable period of time in the last two years and I don't think it's very stable today. I say all that because we have been designing and beginning to implement MAP 2025 over the last, let's call it, six months plus. And better than half of that work initially has been at our Consumer Group. And so if you look at the adjustments of consulting fees and other fees, we had a lot to do with -- a lot of work to do on operating efficiencies and SIOP efficiencies particularly consumers, so there's been a lot of work on that in the last year. Those three things, I think combined to generate the strong recovery at consumer. The last comment I will make and then I'll stop and answer additional questions is that despite the strong quarter only at our Performance Coatings Group, are we operating at record EBIT margins? We are not back to record EBIT margins at Construction Products and at Specialty Products or at Consumer. So we still have some more work to do both in terms of executing on MAP 2025 and on addressing cost price mix issues that have been driven by the inflationary environment that we're in. Sure. So the Corsicana plant is owned and operated by our Construction Products Group. The primary beneficiary of owning that facility so far has been our Consumer Group and in particular Rust-Oleum relative to introducing acrylic resin production there. It carries a cost of about $3 million negative per quarter. And so we're working to fill up that capacity and we have every belief that we will do so successfully both with some external production as well as more internal production across some different chemical products. But right now that cost is borne on the EBIT and P&L of our Construction Products Group. Europe is something we talked about when we talk to investors in July and our concerns have been borne out. Europe's in a recession. Our biggest exposure in Europe is in our Construction Products Group, whether it's in the UK and/or on the continent. And so energy costs or MS (ph) inflation is a -- happened a little later and so a little bit bigger than what we're seeing now in North America. Our ability to get a price there in the Construction Products Group because of Europe, I talked about the average price on a consolidated basis of 50% and the Construction Products Group was actually somewhat less than the average across all of RPM. And then the Canadian situation surprised us, but I think it's circumstantial. This is a quarter that happened over the summer months. And as you'll recall, there were some significant trucking strikes There also has not been new cement capacity in North America, particularly in Canada for probably 20 years. And so there has been a cement and related concrete shortage that's particularly been a problem in Canada, although it is somewhat of an issue in the U.S. And that negatively impacted both revenue base and the profit margin profile of Nudura in particular because concrete has been shorted to residential and light commercial versus infrastructure or more heavy industry. Thanks, John. Good morning, John. So I don't -- I'll let Rusty answer the specific there. I can tell you in the quarter, inflation was up year-over-year by 28% and sequentially from Q4 up about 2.5%. And I'll have to let Rusty for more specifics. Sure. In general, I think Rusty and his team have done a pretty good job there. About 60% of our debt capital structure is fixed with an average duration of almost 13 years and an average interest cost of 4.1%. And so the latest piece of that was a 10 year bond that was done in January of this year at 2.95%. So we've got some really solid interest rate protection there. The remaining 40% is floating rate and still at rates below our fixed rates. And part of our capital allocation strategy in the 2.5 year period of MAP 2025 is to reduce some of those debt levels. Good morning, Mike. Sure. So we provided guidance for Q2 and I think as we sit here today, we're pretty comfortable with that guidance, recognizing there's still tons of volatility. When we talk to investors in July about Q1, we did not anticipate the challenges that happened to our Construction Products Group in Canada for instance. Again, we think those are circumstantial behind us. So the Q2 guidance is there. Given the seasonality of our Q3 and the benefits of our MAP 2025 program, I think that we're likely to have a pretty solid Q3 performance. Mike, beyond that, I think who knows. We are aware that fundamental primary chemicals have dropped meaningfully. That is not showing up in the paint coatings industry's purchased chemicals yet. As I said, we've had 28% inflation year-over-year in Q1. What happens in Europe relative to the Russian war on Ukraine and its impact on energy costs and economic activity, particularly in the winter, it's hard to know. So I would -- it's impossible for us to venture beyond my comments. Sure. Depending on the product line, across all of our Consumer Group and this is principally a North American commentary. Our fill rates range anywhere from the mid-70s to mid-90s. That is not at the 98% or 99% that our customers expect or that we delivered for decades, but it's substantially better than the 50% to 60% fill rates that we and others in our industry were operating at in fiscal '22 and part of fiscal '21 is a result of all the supply chain shortages. So there's been significant recovery there and you can see that in our Consumer Group results, but we still have more work to do and we are utilizing outside consultants on manufacturing and operations side in various places of RPM, but in particular in our Consumer businesses to address some inefficiencies that popped up both in the midst of the COVID boom and then the challenges that everybody faced with the supply chain issues. Just as a reminder, it was just in the third quarter of this last fiscal year and January of this calendar year, so December, January, we have massive Omicron disruptions in our Pleasant Prairie plant and our Kenosha distribution center. Those are our two largest facilities across all of RPM, the largest facilities in Consumer. So it's been pretty crazy. So fill rates were up dramatically better, but not where they need to be yet and we're working on that. Thanks, Mike. Good morning. I think we're making good progress on store shelves. And I think you're, again, across the industry, you're seeing in comparison to prior year periods declines in the low to single -- mid-single digits in terms of consumer takeaway. So there is some weakness in some categories at DIY. The flip side is on the pro-area. So that is more in our primers and in our DAP, coat (ph) and sealants. You're actually seeing the opposite, some low to mid-single digit unit volume growth because the pro-seems to be holding up pretty well. But DIY is takeaway is somewhat less than last year in recent periods is very volatile. And you can see one week to the next, where -- not fill rates, but consumer takeaway is up, and then a week later, it's down. So there's a lot of volatility there in the DIY space, but some pretty solid unit volume growth in the pro contractor space. Sure. Our Mantrose-Haeuser Group, which is part of the Specialty Products Group, is originally the business that created NatureSeal, which was a patented product that eliminated browning in sliced apples. And so it really revolutionized the apple market, and we wrote a great profitability on that for a long time until it went off patent. So that was a challenge. We also acquired Holton Foods, a couple of other businesses that I don't recall off the top of my head, two or three other businesses that were relatively small, a business called PFI. And so they were high margin food coating and/or specialty sustainable food additive businesses. And we had the leader retired of the Mantrose-Haeuser business three years ago. The head of PFI, who actually was an owner who we bought the business from, ran that business for a couple of years. We have worked together with him to hire a really talented industry expert, who is pulling those businesses together on a more integrated basis in terms of our approach to the market, and it's working. And they're doing a really nice job there. There's some exciting product areas. There's a product called VerdeCoat. It's in testing. It is a coating for cardboard that would eliminate the need for plastic clamshells. So they have a lot of exciting things going on in that business. We've got a really talented industry expert that is now leading it and pulling together what formerly were good, but really independently operating businesses that were relatively small. Thank you. Good morning, Steve. We will get into it in more detail on Friday. And we've got some good slides that provide that detail. And so I don't want to get too much in front of that, and that will be webcast all that. Information will be available to both those people present, as well as people that are online. If you are present, you'll also get a tour of our Tremco Sealant business and get to see their test law. So we would encourage people to be here for that. I think you'll get some really good insights into some unique things that we're doing in our Construction Products Group. Specific to your question, we have been working with outside consultants around big data management, particularly as it relates to cost price mix. We have been working with folks in the consumer group on better efficiencies in our manufacturing facilities, and we are making good progress. That's particularly true at Rust-Oleum, where we have more purpose driven facilities around, for instance, large volume runs versus more specialty niche smaller runs. So there's a lot of areas that we are really focused on. And they all are areas that should be gifts that continue to keep on giving, not one-time items. The original MAP to growth program, a key element of that was MS 168, which is our manufacturing systems 168, and introducing lean manufacturing disciplines. Those efforts did not end with the formal end of the 2020 MAP to Growth program, which was May 31, '21. They are continuing, and that is giving us incremental benefits at the plant efficiency line as well. So -- and I guess the last comment I would make is we have been developing and beginning to execute MAP 2025 over the last year. We just kept waiting for the world to get more stable before we introduced and committed to some three year goals. And I guess, we decided that we'd be waiting forever. So we will and very excitedly introduce more detail on the MAP 2025 program on Friday. So it was $30 million in Q1. And again, some of that is a result of the MAP 2025 initiatives. And some of that is a continuation of the original MAP program initiatives. And I think we'll provide more detail and more guidance on what we expect in the coming years and, in some cases for this year by quarter on Friday. No, we have a formulaic cost-plus approach to intercompany manufacturing and coordination, and that's what's being applied here. But one of the great benefits of our MAP to Growth program was the reorganization into four segments and four groups, and being center-led in manufacturing in this lean manufacturing disciplined approach being center-led really to the point of centralized in procurement. And the data that was required, the data lake or data base that was required to allow that to happen. And so the collaboration and cooperation across RPM is a hell a lot better today than it ever was. And so your question, I think, sharply reflects following RPM for a long time and the fact that 10 years ago, that might have been a problem. It's not a problem today. Thank you. Good morning, Arun. Sorry go ahead, Arun. Yes, we can. We're having some technical difficulties. Sure. Pretty much the comments we've made earlier. A disproportionate share of our early MAP 2025 initiatives have been focused on Consumer, particularly in manufacturing efficiencies. And so, we have picked up some manufacturing conversion cost efficiencies there. You'll recall a year ago that we talked about our gross margins were down in fiscal '22 in certain quarters by as much as 1,000 basis points, pretty dramatic. And we had talked about how hundreds of basis points of that was just poor throughput because of the material shortages, because of some of the labor issues we faced. So a combination of access to alkyd resins, and we think we have developed with Corsicana maybe some better access to alkyd resins than some competitors, and a more normal throughput in our plants helped overhead cost absorption as well. And then certainly, cost price mix. We got higher price increases over the summer in consumer than we got over the summer in our other businesses because we were late. So again, if you go back last year on a quarter-by-quarter basis, you saw really solid performance as we were gaining price in our industrial segments. And it took us that typical six month to nine month lag to be able to start to catch up on the cost price mix in consumer. And you saw that, obviously, in the first quarter. So those are the primary drivers of our Consumer business. We did have positive unit growth, which in this environment is not true in all consumer categories. And some of that's the nature of our businesses relative to small project redecorating, patch and repair and maintenance. And I think some of it is catching up on some of the supply shortages and fill rate issues that we've been improving upon since last year. Sure. So I can answer that from a big picture perspective. And then obviously, we'll provide segment results when we release those and talk about them in January. From a big picture perspective, we made really good progress in our 2020 MAP to Growth program. And we were a little bit behind the curve in terms of our goals. And then we got walloped by COVID and the supply chain challenges and took a big step backwards that you saw in our results, particularly in consumer. As volumes coming through our businesses and as we're catching up on cost price mix across all of our businesses, you are seeing us regain some of the MAP 2020 margin improvement that we obtained and is real, but was impacted by supply chain challenges. And as I indicated earlier, the MAP 2025 program has been in the works for a year and been in execution, particularly with a focus on consumer starting in January. And so we're getting the benefit of that, and that will continue throughout fiscal '23. We expect positive sales and EBIT results in each of our four segments in the second quarter, but the volatility is such that beyond that, I wouldn't say much about -- further about our expectations other than what we'll realize and then report in more detail in January. Good morning. Yes. Sure. So first of all, Europe was a challenge for all of our segments in the quarter. And we have a sizable presence there in Consumer, Performance Coatings and Construction Products. The biggest piece is Construction Products. Your observation is spot on. There are different dynamics. And so the Construction Products Group underperformed our expectations for the reasons we mentioned. Europe was a big piece of that. So on a relative basis, our Performance Coatings Group, while we struggled in Europe there, it was not nearly to the extent as our Construction Products Group because of their end markets. Oil and gas, more industrial capital spending. And I will tell you, we expect in Q2, and it is within our guidance, continued negative performance in the top line, bottom line in the European marketplace. And I don't know that it's going to be any different than what we experienced in Q1, but we are a little bit anxious about the winter months and what it's going to look like when we get into the winter and then into the spring relative to the trajectory of the economy and its impact in Europe. Yeah. I don't know that we would want to get into talking about a month, particularly a month in our second quarter. But again, I don't -- I think in Q2, we would expect a similarly disappointing or deteriorated performance that we saw in Q1. And so it's a combination of weak economic activity. A meaningful contribution of it was the strong dollar and foreign exchange. So you're probably looking at a down 8% or 10% in the top line and a down comparable to the, I think 30% -- operating earnings were down 30%. I don't have -- we don't run EBIT and don't disclose EBIT necessarily by geography, but we thought it was important to highlight Europe because it was a key factor across all of our businesses, particularly in the Construction Products Group in terms of the challenges that we're facing, and that's going to continue at the same level. Thank you. Good morning, Jeff. In Q1, our raw materials were up 28% year-over-year, and they were up about actually 2.6% from quarter-to-quarter from Q4 to Q1. They are increasing at a lower rate certainly than what we saw in Q4 and Q3, but they're still up year-over-year. I would have to do the math and get back to you. Our cost of goods sold incorporate -- that basically we had chemical cost of goods sold and incorporates freight, it incorporates other issues. So I don't have a specific answer to you other than we did the calculation on our primary raw material chemicals and they're up 28%. So volumes grew every -- in each segment except for our Specialty Products Group year-over-year. And the SG&A was relatively equal across all of our businesses. We don't disclose that level of detail, but they were consistent with a year ago. I think the thing that's benefited us during the MAP to Growth program, and quite honestly, through COVID, is there was a level of COVID-driven reductions in SG&A around travel and entertainment and other things. And through the benefits of MAP to Growth and also understanding certain COVID-impacted expenses, what was essential and continuing. So for instance, we are again doing major sales meetings across most of our major businesses. Those were expenses we did not incur for the two years of '20 and '21 during COVID that we are recurring those. But the level of T&E is at a lower level than it was pre-COVID. And so I guess those are the comments I would have, but there's really nothing extraordinary in SG&A. We are building some SG&A talent, if you will, in our Specialty Products Group. And we are also building some SG&A in our Carboline business in both cases, to address either opportunities for growth or specifically with Carboline to be more deliberate about expanding their base of business outside of their traditional oil and gas markets, which is really where they exceed and part of what's driving our Performance Coatings Group today. So we have a number of growth initiatives that's driving SG&A, but nothing out of the ordinary. Yeah. It's a great question. We have some exposure to housing market now with Nudura. And so maybe our housing market exposure is a couple of hundred million dollars and we didn't have much of it before in total. So that's certainly somewhat interest rate sensitive. But we had solid organic growth in our Construction Products Group in the United States. And it's an interesting dynamic, Jeff, relative to the types of things that normally you would have looked at historically in recessionary periods that would be driving activity. And quite honestly, the fact that cities, counties and states are sitting on hundreds of billions of dollars, that have to be purposed from various stimulus. And so the institutional work that we're doing with schools or hospitals and the infrastructure work is still pretty solid. And if the dynamics around all the stimulus is true, that should remain true in the United States for another 1.5 years or two years. And you can't even see the benefits yet of the $1 trillion plus Infrastructure bill that was passed. So there's just some funny dynamics in this economy that don't fit with the normal type of indicators that you would have looked at in the past. Thank you. Good morning, Ghansham. Yes. Thank you. Sure. So in general, I think we're seeing demand destruction in Europe, and that's obvious from our results, and we expect that to continue, and we're concerned that it could get worse in the winter relative to energy issues in the Russian war in Ukraine. In the U.S., in particular, as I commented earlier, consumer takeaway has been volatile. From one week to the next, it's up 3% or 5%. Another week, it might be down 5% or 10%. So it's very volatile in terms of where consumer spending is. I think we're doing better than other kind of DIY categories because of the DIY small project paint, patch repair, maintenance aspect of our products and also the kind of catch up on the port fill rate situation that we experienced in the back half of fiscal '21 and a good part of fiscal '22. So that's improving. We are seeing -- and this is broadly inventory adjustments at all the big accounts. And again, so there's a lot of dynamics going on here. Inventory adjustments, but fill rates improving, volatile consumer takeaway is making for a very interesting dynamic. And so, I think that's why we're very confident in the forecast that we provided for Q2, but are still in a -- the business of forecasting quarter-by-quarter because to go out further than that is really impossible. So I'll answer the last part. The answer is no. We were fully caught up in a number of our industrial businesses. And then I think people were expecting, particularly with some of the underlying primary chemicals coming down that we'd see a flattening out. And so in our Construction Products Group, in a few instances, we're behind the curve because of continuing inflation in Q1. We're getting there in Consumer. And again, that's more related to the lag that the people are aware of that has been true for us forever. And so that, I think, that's an issue. We did have $30 million of benefit from the MAP 2025 program in Q1, and we will provide more detail on our expectations when we talk in our Investor Day, on Friday, including over the MAP 2025 program, some anticipation of improving in the commodity cycle which should benefit our margins. That's anybody's guess, but the current underlying lower levels of propylene and polyethylene and ethylene and some of the primary chemicals, which are down but have not translated into lower prices of the type of specialty chemicals we buy yet, are things that we'll talk about on Friday. And I think things that we anticipate should benefit margin recovery over the MAP 2025. But the world we're living in today is still inflationary. The situation in Q1 is may be surprising to some of our businesses, but it's the world we live in. Thank you. Good morning, Kevin. Yes. Thank you. Sure. So I think we'll have solid contributions from price in Q2. It will start -- the benefit of price across RPM will start to -- it will still be positive, but start to deteriorate in Q3 and Q4 as we annualize price increase actions that our companies took in fiscal '22. And so -- and then unless there are further price increases, which would be in response to further inflation, I think we round the annualizing of pretty much all of our price increases by the first quarter of next year. And so you'll see the impact slowly diminish after Q2, but still be positive. And that assumes that things stay stable as to where they are now. Sure. So first of all, fiscal '22 was a particularly challenging in the back half of '21 time for Legend Brands. They're oddly -- because they're in the equipment business, and over time it develop very sophisticated equipment that could be controlled remotely were impacted by the chip shortage and so that was an issue. And there really wasn't much in the way of hurricane activity or challenges in calendar '21 or in our fiscal '22. It's certainly possible that an event like Ian could drive $10 million plus of a spiky revenue climb with pretty decent margin business over a, call it, a quarter and half or two quarter period. So it tends -- the response here is certainly going to be greater than zero. It could be $10 million plus, and it happens over, I will call it, a three month or four month period, but it's not a sustained increase. We've grown that business nicely since we bought it. They are selling their products into different channels and looking at some new product introductions. Those are the kind of things that lead to a steady increase on a business that's roughly $140 million. And then you can see these $10 million or $15 million event related spikes over time. Thank you. Good morning, Michael. Sure. So our Performance Coatings Group is more driven by heavy industry, so oil and gas, marine, wastewater, water treatment, things like that. And that business from a demand perspective is doing very well. That's globally as well as in North America. And we see that continuing because of the stimulus dollars I referenced and where they'll go and the infrastructure dollars that are coming and the onshoring. We do a lot of fab plants around the globe with our Stonhard Flooring business. We do a lot of intumescent fire coatings. One of the interesting thing is we had some interesting big projects in the last year, a Tesla plant expansion, some Intel expansions, that were difficult to supply because of raw material shortages. The raw material shortages that impacted that are behind us for now, hopefully permanently. So we're pretty bullish on the Performance Coatings Group dynamics for the foreseeable future. Construction Products is related to the things I talked about earlier. There are just conflicting demand signals. Europe is a problem for our Construction Products Group, and that will continue. North America has been really solid, both some cost price mix recovery and good unit volume growth. But we saw these unexpected, we think circumstantial situations around concrete supply, for instance, in Canada. Just an interesting challenge. Right now, we are generating positive unit volume growth and some additional price benefit on top of that. Although as you saw in the quarter, not enough to get us back to record EBIT margins. Those things, combined with the benefits of MAP 2025, we would expect will drive positive EBIT results year-over-year in all of our segments, including our Construction Products segment in Q2. Thank you. Thank you, Waseem, and thank you, everybody for your participation in our call today. Tomorrow at 2:00 P.M. Eastern Time, we will be holding a Virtual Annual Meeting of Stockholders. You can participate through our website at www.RPMinc.com, and we would welcome your participation and your questions, which we will have a Q&A session virtually. We hope to return to RPM's in-person annual meeting, which has always been an exciting event for us in the fall of 2023. We also have an Investor Day presentation on Friday morning. That is also accessible via webcast at www.RPMinc.com. And in that Investor Day, we will highlight our sustainability activity and efforts. We will talk about our Construction Products Group in general. And for those present, I think, have a very interesting tour of one of our Construction Products Group sealant facilities and also provide details of our MAP 2025 program. So we would welcome all of your active participation. Thank you very much for your participation in our first quarter call today and for your continued interest in RPM. Have a great day."

[Operator Instructions]. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to hand the call over to Matt Schlarb. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Schlarb: Thank you, Andrea, and welcome to RPM International's conference call for the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter and full-year. Today's call is being recorded. Joining today's call are Frank Sullivan, RPM's Chair and CEO; Rusty Gordon, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Mike Laroche, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. This call is also being webcast and can be accessed live replayed on the RPM website at www.rpminc.com. Comments made on this call may include forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to be materially different. For more information on these risks and uncertainties, please review RPM's reports filed with the SEC. During this conference call, references may be made to non-GAAP financial measures. To assist you in understanding these non-GAAP terms, RPM has posted reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures on the RPM website. Also, please note that our comments will be on an as-adjusted basis and all comparisons to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, unless otherwise indicated. We have provided a supplemental slide presentation for our comments on this call. It can be accessed in the Presentations and Webcasts section of the RPM website at www.rpminc.com. As a reminder, certain businesses in Asia-Pacific that were previously part of the Construction Products Group are now being managed and reported under the Performance Coatings Group effective June 1, 2023. As a result, all references to CPG and PCG today reflect the updated structure. This change has no impact on consolidated results. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Frank.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you, Matt, and good morning. I'll start our conference call with a high-level review of our results, then Mike Laroche will provide more details on our fourth quarter and full-year financials. Matt Schlarb will then give a balance sheet update and discuss how we are using innovation to grow, after which Rusty Gordon will cover our outlook, then we'll be pleased to answer your questions. I'll begin on Slide 3 with our fourth quarter results. Overall, we're pleased with how RPM's associates executed. Despite challenging end markets in several of our businesses, we leveraged MAP 2025 improvements to generate our 10th consecutive quarter of record adjusted EBIT. For the year, sales were a record and adjusted EBIT increased approximately 12% to a record which was within the guidance we provided a year ago. This included approximately $160 million of MAP 2025 benefits on a run rate basis or roughly $100 million through the P&L in fiscal '24. Although a portion of these are being temporarily masked by lower fixed cost utilization from reduced volumes. In addition to margin expansion, MAP 2025 has played a critical role in our ability to structurally improve working capital throughout the entire year. This resulted in record cash flow from operating activities of $1.12 billion during fiscal '24, an improvement of over $545 million from fiscal 2023 and $356 million or 46% more than our previous annual record cash flow. We used a portion of this cash to reduce debt by approximately $557 million during the year and the resulting lower interest expense helped us grow adjusted EPS by 14.7% to a fourth quarter record and by 14.9% for the full-year to a record $4.94 per share. Moving to Slide 4, our Construction Products Group led growth during the quarter with broad-based strength in most of their businesses with roofing and its differentiated turnkey offerings, demonstrating particular strength. Consumer also executed well during the quarter as they achieved market share gains, upgraded product mix and realized MAP '25 benefits generate record adjusted EBIT despite a sales decline due to continued DIY softness. After multiple years achieving record results, our Performance Coatings Group declined in the fourth quarter as they faced challenging comparisons to the prior year and experienced negative headwinds from the timing of project completions, something we highlighted on our prior earnings call. In the Specialty Products Group, some end markets showed signs of bottoming out but we continue to remain challenged in this segment. The economic situation remains very challenging. However, we did a good job managing what we can control with a focus on MAP '25 and margin improvements to generate record adjusted EBIT and record levels of cash flow. Turning to geographies on Slide 5. North America, Africa and the Middle East grew. And while sales declined in other regions, we're still executing well in these areas. European sales declined 4% due to FX headwinds and divestitures in the Performance Coatings Group. However, their profitability improved meaningfully as targeted MAP '25 initiatives in the region gained momentum, including those focused on generating favorable product mix. Excluding FX, sales in Latin America grew mid-single digits as we continue to benefit from product serving infrastructure projects. Asia-Pacific is performing well under our new management structure. However, fourth quarter sales declined due to challenging comparisons as a large project was completed in the prior year period. To summarize our performance, in the face of several end market and economic challenges, we have realized good improvements in gross margins as a result of our MAP 25 initiatives. In addition to gross profit benefits, MAP '25 is allowing us to better leverage the power of RPM to create a more efficient and streamlined SG&A structure. We took several SG&A reduction initiatives in the fourth quarter, which will benefit us as we work our way through fiscal 2025. As economic headwinds persist, it's important to remember that the improvements we are making are structural. While they are helping us navigate near-term challenges, their benefits will be even more apparent as end markets eventually recover and we begin to generate better organic growth. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mike Laroche to cover our financial results in more detail.\nMichael Laroche: Thanks, Frank. Starting on Slide 6. Consolidated organic sales increased 0.4% as pricing was slightly higher and volumes overall were flat. FX was 0.7% headwind to revenue and divestitures net of acquisitions decreased sales by 0.1%, resulting in a modest decline in sales for the quarter. EBIT margins expanded 90 basis points, which was driven by MAP 2025 benefits, improved fixed cost leverage at the Construction Products Group and favorable mix at the consumer group. SG&A increased during the quarter driven by incentives to sell higher-margin products, long-term growth investments and compensation and benefits. As Frank mentioned, we implemented MAP 2025 enabled initiatives to streamline our SG&A structure in the fourth quarter, and those benefits will be realized in fiscal year 2025. Adjusted EPS increased 14.7% to $1.56, which was a record, driven by the adjusted EBIT growth and lower interest expense as strong cash flow allowed us to repay debt during the quarter. Next, moving to the Construction Products Group results on Slide 7. The segment experienced broad-based strength with roofing and wall systems performing particularly well. The growth came from both new building construction and renovation, and we gained market share in construction chemicals. They also generated growth in product serving infrastructure projects, including those that reduce both the cost and carbon footprint of their construction. Some of these, including driving gains, which reduced the amount of energy needed to produce cement and synthetic fibers that serve as a substitute for steel rebar and produce significantly lower CO2 emissions and require less labor to install. The rise in adjusted EBIT was led by improved fixed cost leverage from volume growth, MAP 2025 benefits and driving a favorable product mix. On Slide 8, the Performance Coatings Group sales declined as they faced challenging comparisons to the prior year period when sales grew 10.8% and the unfavorable timing of project completions as some were pulled forward into the third quarter while other projects are experiencing delays. Additionally, Europe had pockets of weakness. FX and the prior divestiture of the noncore European service business also pressured sales. Adjusted EBIT declined as a result of lower sales and reduced fixed cost leverage from volume declines. This was partially offset by MAP 2025 benefits. Moving to Slide 9. Specialty Products Group sales declined primarily due to challenging comparisons to the prior year period for the disaster restoration business. In the prior year, customers were rebuilding inventories that have been depleted as a result of increased storm activity and bursting pipes from freezing weather in prior quarters. Overall, specialty OEM markets, particularly those related to residential remained soft. The reduction in adjusted EBIT was driven by the sales and volume declines, which resulted in unfavorable fixed cost absorption. On Slide 10, the consumer group gained share with the help of new products and grew in markets outside the U.S., which helped to offset continued softness in the DIY space. The rationalization of lower-margin products also contributed to the sales declines. MAP 2025 initiatives and an improved mix resulted in record EBIT which is partially offset by under absorption associated with lower volumes and higher expenses from wages and benefits. Now I'll turn the call over to Matt, who will cover the balance sheet and cash flow and provide an update on innovation.\nMatthew Schlarb: Thank you, Mike. Moving to Slide 11. Cash flow from operations totaled $1.12 billion for the year, an increase of $545 million from the prior year and $356 million more than our previous annual record. Over the past two years, operating cash flow has improved by $944 million. MAP 2025 initiatives that resulted in improved profitability and working capital drove the increase. In Q4, working capital as a percentage of sales fell by 350 basis points from the prior year period to 23.5%. The significant portion of this cash flow is used to repay debt, which declined by $557 million during the year. This has resulted in lower interest expense and increased flexibility to invest in future organic and M&A growth opportunities. During fiscal 2024, we returned $287 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, which both increased during the year. As we enter fiscal year 2025, the quarter remained strong at $1.36 billion. On the next slide, I'd like to highlight an example of how we are using innovation to help grow a business we acquired a few years ago. In September 2020, we acquired Ali Industries, a leading manufacturer of sand paper and other abrasives that goes to market under the Gator brand. Like many of these businesses, they experienced supply chain disruptions over the past several years, but as those challenges have been resolved, they are back on offense and bringing new products to market and gaining share. One we'd like to highlight today is the new Reptilion product line. These innovative products use a proprietary design encoding that helps channel way dust while sanding, which prevents buildup and improves efficiency for the user. The Reptilionproduct line also lasts 4x longer than traditional power tool sanding accessories. Reptilionproducts are on the shelf now and build on Gator's legacy of providing high-performance abrasives to both Pro and DIY customers alike. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Rusty to cover our outlook.\nRussell Gordon: Thanks, Matt. Our first quarter outlook is on the next page, Slide 13. On a consolidated level, first quarter sales are expected to be approximately flat compared to a record prior year period with many market trends from the fourth quarter continuing. By segment, CPG is expected to generate low single-digit revenue growth on top of the nearly 11% growth they generated in the first quarter of 2024. As they benefit from their focus on restoration, selling, building envelope systems and unique turnkey offerings. In PCG, sales are expected to be flat due to challenging comparisons as a few larger projects were completed in the prior year period and others are being delayed beyond the first quarter of 2025. In SPG, overall demand is expected to remain soft. However, the segment is facing easier comparisons, which should result in sales declining in the low single-digit range. In Consumer Group, sales are expected to be down low-single-digits. Trends are expected to remain similar to the fourth quarter with market share gains and strength in international markets being offset by continued DIY softness. Consolidated first quarter adjusted EBIT is expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percentage range compared to a record prior year period driven by MAP 2025 benefits. As part of MAP 2025, we are in the process of consolidating or have recently consolidated 12 facilities, which demonstrates our continued momentum in generating efficiencies. Our fiscal 2025 full-year guidance is on the following slide, Slide 14. We expect sales growth will be up low single digits and adjusted EBIT will increase mid-single-digits to low-double-digits. On the top line, volume growth is uncertain as the visibility on the global economic outlook is limited which includes the unknown impact of elections in the U.S. and other markets. Our strategic balance and focus on repair and maintenance should be beneficial as we navigate the mixed economy. We expect pricing to be slightly positive in response to continued inflation in areas like labor and benefits, and we expect moderate increases in raw material costs in the second half of the fiscal year. By segment, CPG should outgrow its markets with its differentiated product and service offerings and should continue to benefit from spending on infrastructure and restoration projects. After a year of strong growth, CPG will face more challenging prior year comparisons in fiscal 2025, while commercial construction remains sluggish. Moving to PCG. They continue to benefit from increased spending on infrastructure projects as well as their more collaborative strategy in emerging markets, which is generating profitable growth. After years of strong growth, the growth in spending on reshoring projects appears to be moderating. And PCG will also experience a temporary headwind from the under absorption impact of opening of new plants in India and Malaysia that we highlighted on the last call -- on the last quarter. Although these plans will be a longer-term tailwind of PCG results. At SPG, the current expectation is that several key end markets will remain sluggish. As a result, SPG has pruned certain products and their associated SG&A cost structure. These actions, along with easier comparisons will help SPG get back to growth particularly if end markets recover. At Consumer, we will continue benefiting from new products and market share gains as well as driving an improved product mix which is expected to more than offset near-term softness in DIY. When end markets ultimately recover, consumer is poised for strong profitability growth as a result of the MAP 2025 initiatives put in place. On a consolidated level, the key driver of EBIT growth is expected to be our MAP 2025 benefits including manufacturing and commercial excellence improvements as well as the actions we have taken to make our SG&A structure more streamlined. This includes leveraging the power of RPM to generate efficiencies in areas like automation, digital selling tools and centralizing more back office functions. These efficiencies will be more apparent over time as we overcome the negative short-term under-absorption impact of MAP enabled plant consolidation. Finally, because of the strong cash flow and debt reductions made throughout fiscal year 2024, we will benefit from lower interest expense in fiscal year 2025. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be pleased to answer your questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from Mike Harrison of Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Mike.\nMichael Harrison: Hi, good morning. Congrats on a nice finish to the year here. I'm just curious on the Performance Coatings business. It looks like the revenue number came in maybe a little bit worse than you had anticipated. And I know you guys indicated that there were some delays going on in projects. But can you talk about some of the broader trends that you're seeing in terms of project activity? And what kind of visibility you have in that business? I'm particularly intrigued by this comment in here that you're expecting maybe some moderating growth from reshoring impacting that business this year.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I think the biggest impact in the quarter for our Performance Coatings Group was project timing, and we talked about that on our last call. We had a number of projects that ended up being accelerated into Q3, which negatively impacted the fourth quarter. We anticipate continued growth, although at a more modest level in the Performance Coatings Group for the balance of fiscal '25. And so there's still solid results there. The other thing that I think is worth noting in fiscal '24, was the divestiture of a number of the European, U.K. based service businesses in our Performance Coatings Group, which hampered our results year-over-year. But it was the right thing to do. It's improving profitability. And so we'll annualize that pretty quickly. And I think those are reasons to believe that we'll see positive momentum but at a more modest rate than what we experienced in the past year.\nMichael Harrison: All right. Thanks. And then I was also curious, you mentioned that there is some MAP 2025 initiatives to streamline SG&A that you implemented during Q4. Can you elaborate on those actions and maybe the timing and magnitude of potential benefits from those changes? Thank you.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. They really fall in two categories. One was a necessary rip across a number of our business units that impacted about 170 RPM associates. And the benefits of that on an annualized basis will be in the $25 million. And then the other area is, as we've talked about investments in a number of significant growth areas. And so we are continuing those where they are providing good momentum, and we are paring back on some of those that have not met our expectations as we go into fiscal '25.\nMichael Harrison: Thanks very much.\nFrank Sullivan: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kevin McCarthy of Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Kevin.\nKevin McCarthy: Thank you and good morning. Good morning. Hope you're doing well. Hey Frank, I wanted to follow-up on a comment that you made in the prepared remarks, whereby, I think you indicated that some lower operating rates and associated fixed cost absorption was masking some of the MAP program restructuring benefits. Can you quantify that? And what is your expectation for that dynamic going into fiscal 2025, will there be less masking perhaps?\nFrank Sullivan: So let me have Rusty to provide some details. But in general, as we've talked in the past, and you could see it in the improvement over the last two years in gross profitability. It's the hardest thing to move. And our MAP initiatives have been focused on that, consolidating production facilities. We are in the midst of -- and MAP '25, another dozen opportunities to consolidate versus the 30 or so that we completed in the original 2020 MAP to Growth program as well as a very effective systemized way of introducing lean manufacturing and continuous improvement initiatives in our plants. So we are reducing our plant footprint, and we are increasing conversion cost productivity. All of that shows up when you sell something. And so the only real solid, almost 7% organic growth in the fourth quarter was from our Construction Products Group. The others all were either modestly down. And so that's the big picture. In terms of specifics, let me have Rusty address that.\nRussell Gordon: Yes. Kevin, in fiscal '24, there is a little over $50 million of unfavorable impact from unfavorable absorption on conversion costs. In the fourth quarter, it was a little over $15 million. We expect more of that in this low volume growth environment. As you could see in specialty and consumer and now in Performance Coatings, they are experiencing volume challenges. And as Frank mentioned, as we go through a lot of these plant consolidation projects, we are building new plants, for example, in India and Malaysia, we are closing certain plants and relocating production to other plants with increased capital spending and some capacity expansions at certain sites. So as that transition goes on, we will have some start-up inefficiencies that will eventually work their way over time and generate efficiencies overall for RPM.\nFrank Sullivan: So Kevin, I would add that your question really gets at the heart of our outlook in what's a pretty wide range for fiscal '25. We are operating currently in a low, no growth environment in general. And -- if and when volumes pick up, and I would expect in the second half of the year, that the economic circumstances don't deteriorate that we'll see that will be certainly annualizing easier comps in our Specialty Products Group and Consumer. Any volume growth will accrete to very nice leverage on our bottom line. And so that's why we have come out with kind of a wide range in terms of our EBIT forecast, our MAP '25 initiatives will continue to deliver solid results, but volume growth can hit our bottom line very nicely when it shows up.\nKevin McCarthy: And then -- that's very helpful. Maybe just to follow-up on that notion, Frank. If volume growth does pick up, how would you characterize the contribution margins in your businesses based on the new asset and cost footprint that RPM has?\nFrank Sullivan: Without getting into specific details, I think the two biggest points of reference that people should focus on throughout the year is, A, the improvement that we generated in our gross profit margins. And you've seen that. And then B, this $50 million of unabsorbed overhead costs that Rusty talked about. The gross margin is going to deliver more profitability per dollar of sales. And there's a point at which we're going to have some favorable comparisons to these under absorption hits which will benefit our product line -- or I'm sorry, our profitability.\nKevin McCarthy: Got it, thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Frank Mitsch of Fermium Research. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Frank.\nFrank Mitsch: Good morning. Good morning, Frank. Congrats. I guess congrats to you for calling fiscal 2024 in terms of your initial guidance and let me offer my congrats to Matt on his recent promotion. Given your solid forecasting skills, Frank, you indicated that you expect volume growth perhaps in the back half of fiscal 2025. So I guess as you're looking at your order books, fiscal -- I'm sorry, calendar 2024, the back half, we shouldn't be baking in any DIY sort of improvement. Is that fair to say?\nFrank Sullivan: I think that's fair to say. I actually think both for the fiscal year and in the fourth quarter, we're executing at a really high level in our consumer group. We've been through what's now 15 months, maybe more 18 months of negative consumer takeaway across the DIY paint space. Some of that, 18 months ago, was I think still continued fallout from the COVID bump, which was huge. But as we sit here today, it's really driven by housing turnover. We are at a 30-year low in terms of housing turnover and housing turnover is one critical element that drives consumer takeaway. But having said all that, for the year and in the quarter, you're looking at negative units of about 1% versus our identifiable peers, it's pretty strong result in terms of how we're performing. And it's a lot of the things that Matt talked about, some market share gains, some new product introductions, some strength in some new product introductions in the U.K. and Europe. And so I think our consumer group is performing at a pretty good level in this environment. And I would expect that to continue. We don't have a better crystal ball than anyone else in terms of where the economy is going.\nFrank Mitsch: Got you. Understood. And I think you had indicated, obviously, your balance sheet has been improving. You've been generating a lot of cash. So that makes the question, what to do with cash. And I think you'd indicated prior that the valuations have been a bit of a hindrance in terms of M&A. I'm not going to ask specifically about PPG and what's going on there. But was wondering if you might be able to offer thoughts on potential M&A opportunities to think about in fiscal 2025?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So as we've talked about, we have structurally improved our cash generation capabilities. So we're at new levels of cash flow, which we expect to maintain in marginally improved because there's still some more work to do in working capital improvement. Our balance sheet is in the best shape it's been in 30 years. And so we have plenty of opportunities for acquisition activity. I would expect that to pick up versus what's been a pretty modest acquisition period, particularly relative to RPM's history. Our focus continues to be on the small and medium-sized acquisitions that are highly strategic to our businesses, and that's where you'll see us focus.\nFrank Mitsch: Terrific, thanks so much.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from John McNulty of BMO. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, John.\nJohn McNulty: Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions, Frank. Hey, Frank. So can you help us to think about what the cost savings would be tied to the 12 facilities that you're rationalizing. I understand some of it's tied to efficiency at other plants and that means to get the full benefit may take volumes. But is there just a flat cost benefit on the plant rationalization that we should be thinking about?\nFrank Sullivan: I don't have those details. I don't know if Rusty has a swag at that. But I don't have a good sense of that, good enough to give you a number that I could stand behind. Rusty, do you have any more insights?\nRussell Gordon: Yes, it will be, John, very meaningful and fiscal '25 as you might have seen a few times before, we are projecting $185 million of annualized MAP savings in wave 3 of our MAP program in fiscal '25. That's the highest year for savings and these planned consolidations are a big part of that.\nJohn McNulty: Okay. Fair enough. So I guess, Frank, when I think about your guide for '25, you've got the benefit of SG&A cuts that you spoke to about $25 million. You've got what sounds like some pretty significant benefits on the plant rationalization. So -- and it seems like you can get to kind of something in the whatever low to mid 14% margin range as you look out to 2025 without much in the way of volume growth. Is that the right way to think about it? And then the volume growth is kind of the additional kicker that may push you closer and closer to that 16% kind of longer-term target? Is that the right way to think about it?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I think we are on track to achieve in terms of delivered results, our goals for fiscal '26. And our program is on an annualized run rate. So we will not experience all of those benefits that Rusty talked about in fiscal '25. But at the end of '25, we will be benefiting fully from plant consolidation and other MAP initiatives. So I think we're in good shape there. It just depends on volume. And it's a broken record here, but we're in a low growth, no growth environment. And given our MAP '25 success with flat results, we should be able to deliver solid EBIT growth. And again, referencing the wide range in EBIT expectations. On the downside, I think we'll be able to deliver mid-single digit EBIT growth. And when we get some pickup in volume, you're going to see good growth in the teens. And so I don't have much more to add there because of a crystal ball and kind of the dynamics, particularly in our core North American market. I think we're going to be in this low no growth environment in Q1. And it's our expectation that by the time we get to the second half you're going to see some positive results even assuming there's no further deterioration just because we're going to be rounding easier comps, particularly in consumer and specialty products.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. Very clear. Thanks very much Frank.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Huang of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nDavid Huang: Good morning.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning.\nDavid Huang: I guess, first, regarding the FY '25 guidance, I guess you noted positive pricing. How should we think about that in terms of your project-based construction pricing and consumer pricing? And then I guess, which business or segment are you seeing the highest year-over-year price increases today?\nFrank Sullivan: So in general, both pricing and raw materials for the time being are relatively stable. Obviously, there are some exceptions up and down in different categories. Price in the quarter was marginally higher. But so I think the way to think about price for fiscal '25 will be in the 1% range, maybe slightly higher. The areas where we continue to see inflation are in wages, benefits, insurance costs, similar to other companies and not specific even to our industry. They have moderated in every case from where they were a few years ago. So it's going to be -- unless there is a meaningful change in inflation one way or another. I think a very modest impact on results.\nDavid Huang: Okay. Got it. Maybe I'll try PPG one more time. I guess has your interest level or scope changed versus a few months ago? And I guess, absent of any acquisitions, how should we think about capital allocation for FY '25?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So our capital allocation will remain what it has been. I would expect $50 million or more, depending on circumstances of share repurchases. I would expect our Board to raise our dividend for its 51st consecutive year when they meet in October. With our payout ratio -- 20 years ago, we consistently had a payout ratio at or above 50%. Now we're in the mid-30s. So our ability to increase our cash dividend at a rate more consistent with earnings growth exist today. And from an M&A perspective, I would expect us to do more M&A in the coming years versus a modest period of M&A growth in the last couple of years, primarily focused on small and medium-sized businesses or product lines.\nDavid Huang: And I guess no update on the PPG acquisition?\nFrank Sullivan: Beyond those comments, no update.\nDavid Huang: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from John Roberts of Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you. Good morning. On Slide 14, under the full-year 2025 guidance, Rusty mentioned that PCG had moderating growth from reshoring, is that expected continued delays on project completions? Or are you seeing declining new project start activity or both?\nFrank Sullivan: Some of it is both in our Construction Products Group and PCG, some slowing down of projects that we have already won. And then it's just anticipation of a low, no-growth environment as we round in PCG and CPG, pretty challenging tops. So the opposite of our consumer and specialty. We expect positive growth both in Performance Coatings and Infrastructure products, but they'll be rounding some pretty healthy comps in each quarter of fiscal '25.\nJohn Roberts: Okay. And can you remind us if there were tariffs on tin plate under the prior administration and how you're thinking about any risk around that?\nRussell Gordon: There were tariffs on tinplate and that's kept our packaging, which primarily impact or most impacts our consumer segment that those prices went up with the inflation, and they never came back down. So they've been sticky near the top, and those tariffs have been a contributing factor.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi of Baird. Please go ahead.\nGhansham Panjabi: Good morning, Frank. I guess going back to the consumer segment, can you just give us a bit more color as to what exactly you're embedding for volume growth for that segment in fiscal year '25. I know you called out some share gains, but do it yourself still seems a little bit weak?\nFrank Sullivan: It is. So I would expect Q1 and consumer to look like Q4. We still see some consumer takeaways not terrific. The new product introductions and some of the market share gains that we have and expanding presence of [indiscernible] break in some exciting new product categories and introductions in GAAP are going well. So as we get into the back half, I think you'll see low to mid-single digit growth in part just based upon easier comps. But in the first quarter, we're living in the same no growth environment or modestly negative consumer takeaway that we experienced in the spring.\nGhansham Panjabi: Okay. Thanks, Frank. And for CPG and PCG, obviously, comparisons are difficult in CPG and PCG, you called out some moderation just based on project completions, et cetera. Do you sort of see that as multi-quarter sort of dynamics that occur? I'm just trying to get a sense as to the cycles for those particular segments versus maybe consumer that you can ascribe to, maybe a change in interest rates, et cetera, more directly?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I think the timing issue most impacted Q4 and will continue a little bit into the early part of Q1. But there are still many, many hundreds of billions of dollars through the infrastructure bill and other things that will be spent as the years unfold, a lot of these chip stacks are a good example. We're well positioned in a number of those projects. But some of them have now been slowed down such that the spending is spread out over a couple of year longer period of time than originally envisioned. The dollars are still coming. Concrete is being poured with Euclid admixtures and Euclid fibers, and we would expect to get a reasonable share of the floor and fireproofing coatings and those. So those are just some examples. But if you look just at the Intel project here in Ohio, it's moving forward, but at a slightly slower pace than originally envisioned. Otherwise, I think the dynamics that are driving those businesses continue. We have added sales people. We've introduced new initiatives in the Construction Products Group in particular. We have had a multi-year shift from selling components to selling systems. And that seems to be paying off as our Construction Products Group outperforms what's a pretty punky new construction and commercial construction environment right now.\nGhansham Panjabi: Perfect. Thank you so much.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Jeffrey Zekauskas of JPMorgan.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Jeff.\nJeffrey Zekauskas: Hi, good morning. Thanks very much. This year, you took $30 million in restructuring charges. Will you take more next year or less?\nMichael Laroche: I think that's probably a pretty good run rate considering some of the plant consolidations that we spoke about previously going forward.\nJeffrey Zekauskas: And are the plant consolidations new in that? Through the first nine months, you spent $0.5 million, $500,000 on plant consolidation. So is there -- was there a real step-up this quarter in your cash spending? Or do you expect one for next year?\nMichael Laroche: Yes. We had a couple of larger plant announcements happened in the fourth quarter this year, which really drove the increased spending in Q4.\nFrank Sullivan: We -- more broadly, Dave Dennsteadt, who is the Leader of our Performance Coatings Group in support of all of RPM operations in Europe, relocated to Europe a little more than a year ago. To help coordinate our MAP activities there. As you'll recall, we were focused mostly in North America and the initiation of our plant initiatives and then COVID hit, which really slowed down our ability to do what's pretty hands-on on the plant floor process. And so with Dave's leadership and the support of our associates and our operations in Europe, we're catching up, if you will. And so a meaningful portion of these MAP 2025 plant consolidations are happening and will continue to happen in our European operations.\nJeffrey Zekauskas: Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Josh Spector of UBS. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Josh.\nJosh Spector: Hey, good morning Frank. So I wanted to ask on -- if I think about the low end of your guidance, so I mean basically, I assume that's pretty minimal sales growth. You're saying mid-single digit EBIT growth. I mean that maybe gets to up, I don't know, $50 million, $60 million or so on the EBIT line. Is the way to think about what that is, is pricings may be slightly up. It offsets raws in that, call it, $50 million or so ends up being the MAP savings you think you can achieve ex volumes? Or is there anything else you would put into that math?\nFrank Sullivan: I think that's pretty much it. A price will be modestly positive, but not really meaningful and less dynamics change out there. So the way to think about it is the continuing benefits of the MAP initiatives that we will be building throughout fiscal '25, offset by the volume or lack of volume under absorption that Rusty referenced. And when you net all those, I think we're still in a position to show positive momentum on the EBIT line, both in terms of dollars and margin in a low no growth environment. And so Q1 feels a lot like Q4 in terms of where we sit today halfway through the quarter. So I think your thoughts on the fiscal year are correct. And here we say multiple times that our wide range is based upon what happens with volume as we progress throughout the year.\nJosh Spector: Understood. I appreciate that. I guess if I build on that and think about the under absorption you sized earlier, $50 million of last year, you're not getting the benefit of that without volumes. You have residual MAP savings with volumes. I guess the question that goes into is how much volume improvement do you need to really realize all the MAP plans? I mean are we talking 3% to 5%? Are we talking a couple of years of growth catch up until you get that to really realize that 16% or so margin structure?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. It will play out over a couple of years, but 3% to 4% unit volume growth would sing on our bottom line really nicely.\nJosh Spector: Okay. Thanks, Frank.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Stephen Byrne of Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Steve.\nSteve Byrne: Thank you. Your cost of goods were down 5% year-over-year in the quarter. Can you comment on how much of that 5% was raw material cost deflation versus perhaps your facility consolidations? Volumes were flat. So seeing it would be these other categories. Any comments on that?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes, Steve. So almost all of that lower COGS was related to raw material deflation. So we had about mid-single digit deflation in Q4. We started that process of consolidating those plans -- the plans in Q4, but we'll really see those benefits as we progress through 2025.\nRussell Gordon: We also had math benefits in terms of procurement and manufacturing work streams. And those math savings were north of $20 million impacting cost of goods in the quarter.\nSteve Byrne: Okay. Thank you. And then maybe just drilling in a little bit more in your longer-term outlook for SG&A. Does as a percent of sales in the high 20s seem right to you? Or would you consider consolidating offices and sales forces and things like that beyond manufacturing facilities?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So I think structurally, there is more opportunities for us, particularly in the G&A area over time. I had -- we have a goal of getting our SG&A over time down to about 26%. I will tell you that the most important asset of RPM does not show up on our balance sheet, and it's more than 2,000 sales individual sales reps. We have more people in marketing. And so given the nature of who we are and the entrepreneurial approach to customers in terms of sales, marketing, tech service. I do not envision consolidating sales forces. Going back to my grandfather 70 some years ago, the more feet on the street, the better. Some of the growth initiatives that has been driving our SG&A up. It's been the addition of salespeople. And where that's not paying off, we'll adjust in a business like our Stonhard flooring business, the addition of new sales reps has meaningfully improved their business in the top line. So they're generating of our Performance Coatings Group, they're generating solid organic growth. And so that's how we think about SG&A going forward.\nSteve Byrne: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nVincent Andrews: Thank you and good morning. Can I ask on consumer with the bifurcation of performance in pro versus DIY over the past couple of years. Could you first just give us an update on what you think your business mix is now pro versus DIY and consumer? Maybe we'll just start there.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I would guess we're probably about 70% DIY and about 30% Pro. Our two primary consumer broad segments would be DAP, it would cost sealants, patch and repair products and they're adding new products and then Rust-Oleum in various small project paint, primers, things like that. We tend to be more consumer and Rust-Oleum small project paint. And the Zinsser Primer and DAP products, I think we're more 50-50 between consumer and Pro.\nVincent Andrews: And as a follow-up, you mentioned a few times that you're waiting for existing home sales to come back. And so I'm just kind of curious, is your portfolio more levered to the work that's done post home sale, versus the prep work that might be done before the home goes on the market? Or are you indifferent?\nFrank Sullivan: We're getting double whammy because in a sale, we get both. And so when you think about a home sale, people take time to fix up patch and repair, paint and plays very much into our hands because of the nature of our products, particularly paint and repair and the small project paint versus somebody hiring a pay contractor to paint their whole house, which is not the space that we're in today. And then when somebody shows up into a new house, they redecorate rooms and zoo modest us improvements. And again, that benefits us. So we benefit both on the sell and the actions taken to prepare the house for sale and on the buy and the actions of new homebuyers state. And we are not seeing that to the extent that we have in the past because we're at 30 -- literally a 30-year low in housing turnover because people stuck on some interest rates and other factors. It's also a significant driver of the underperformance in our Specialty Products Group. Our Industrial Coatings Business, which is the largest segment, almost half of our Specialty Products Group revenues serves efficient cabinets and all kinds of wood cabinets and woodwork and doors and windows. So we are still tied into a meaningful part of what's still manufactured in the United States. It goes into housing. And that's been a challenge as well, both on the new construction side as well as on the housing turnover side as it relates to furniture or major home improvements.\nVincent Andrews: So the increase we've seen in homes for sale so far, I guess the answer would be, it's just not material enough to really move the needle for you yet. Is that fair?\nFrank Sullivan: That's correct. Again, we're at a 30-year low. And the -- unfortunately, Wall Street Journal reported just this week that housing prices is hitting a new high. And so the value of homes in light of the inflation that we've experienced in North America, the significant increase in interest rates, its impact on mortgages. All those are factors that are underlying dynamics that are great. That's why I comment on the performance of our consumer group in light of those with unit volume down about 1% in the quarter is really outstanding. And it shows positively in comparison to our identifiable peers. And I think we're performing well given the dynamics that are out there. And further proof that when the warm turns, we'll see some nice volume pickups, particularly related to new shelf placement for abrasives. So we're in the sand paper business and growing. It's not a category that existed for RPM three or four years ago. And we're moving in some cleaner product categories. And so there's a number of new initiatives that I think will help growth.\nVincent Andrews: Great. Thanks very much.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mike Sison of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Michael.\nMichael Sison: Hey, good morning. Nice end of the year. Hopefully, the Guardians can follow through. Frank, what does demand gets worse going forward. I certainly don't hope that's the case. But if things get a little bit weaker, can you accelerate some of the MAP savings to still sort of have a good year relative to your guidance?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So I think that we're -- our people are executing the MAP initiatives at a really high level. And I don't know that there's any accelerating those. I think it's a very methodical approach to addressing of both the continuous improvement, lean manufacturing disciplines more broadly across the globe. Another initiative that is paying off for us, and it probably took us 20 years to figure this out, is the platform approach to the developing world. We had stop and start efforts with our businesses as we either organically or through small acquisitions. We do acquisitions in Southeast Asia or in China or in India. And we have a very high-performing leadership team that's based in South Africa. And given their success because of the uniqueness of that market across our consumer brands and our construction products brand and our Performance Coatings Brand, it's fundamentally Carboline business when we acquired the South African operation. So Performance Coatings business. They now have sales -- the consolidated administration and production but have independent sales and market focus across almost all of RPM's brands. They are now responsible for the Middle East, Africa, India and Southeast Asia. And that's paying big dividends for us. And so that's a different approach for RPM. It's not a small base, but the growth percentages are pretty impressive, and there's a lot more to come there. So those are the type of things, Michael, that, I think will allow us to generate positive momentum in a low growth, no growth environment. We don't see things deteriorating further. I think there's been a rolling recession, notwithstanding all the headlines in the manufacturing sector. Anything that touched housing, you can see it, and that's been accretive to our supply chain supplier base that it had a challenging year. I can't speak to services or tech. But if you're in manufacturing in the last 12 or 18 months have been challenging, we don't see it getting worse. Lastly, if it does get worse, unrelated to our MAP initiatives, there would be room, if necessary, on the SG&A area for additional expense reductions.\nMichael Sison: Got it. And then a quick follow-up in terms of innovation. I recall Nudura was one that had a lot of momentum, a lot in commercial areas, but have you seen any progress in moving that product into the residential applications?\nFrank Sullivan: We have and also, I think, more importantly, into commercial. And so we have a real significant effort to get Nudura specified, get it understood, communicate and educate about Nudura and get it specified into the new construction market for schools. We now have a specification throughout schools in Kentucky, for instance, following the terrible tornadoes they had a couple of years ago. We're moving it into other states, particularly states that are kind of in the tornado all area. Specification doesn't mean we'll get to work. but you've got to educate architects and engineers and builders and then you need to build momentum and we're starting to see that happen in the school market. So that's a nice area. The last comment I'll make about Nudura is my wife and I had an unfortunate sewer flooding circumstance in our home in Cleveland, Ohio. And after working with our insurance company for a few months to remediate that, we made the decision to tear it down and build a new home. And so we are in the midst of building a 5,000 square foot Nudura home. Paying for it directly through the builder, new to the architect and new to the builder, and I am learning along with them and the construction products group knows that I'm going to learn firsthand, all the good things that they're talking about Nudura and what challenges there are through direct experience.\nMichael Sison: Got it. Thank you.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our next question will come from Aleksey Yefremov of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning.\nAleksey Yefremov: Good morning. Frank, what is your expectation for infrastructure sales for your business in fiscal '25 and beyond?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I think they're going to continue. You've got $1 trillion infrastructure bill that will impact a lot of the areas. You've got a chips act in terms of chip manufacturing in the U.S., and we're well positioned in our Performance Coatings Group and Construction products for some of that work. And so we would expect to see the benefits of that, I think, through 2026. But again, you'll see a more modest sales growth than the past year just because we're rounding some very challenging comps. But nonetheless, we'll see positive growth there, and we're well positioned to benefit from it.\nAleksey Yefremov: Frank, you made some comments on restoring potentially slowing down this fiscal year. Is it mostly comps or in some of the slowdowns that you see there could be other reasons like, I don't know lack of resources or demand or anything like that? If you can give more color on the slowdowns that you already see?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. It's a combination of the more challenging comparisons, but it is also a slowdown in some of the project completions. I think that whether it's -- interestingly, it's as much about labor and new facilities as it is and training up personnel to staff new chip plants or other things as it is about construction labor. But the projects are not stopping, they're continuing. The dollars are there and committed. But I think the expectation of how they'll be spent is now going to be spread out over a longer period of time. So the impact in fiscal '26 will be -- I'm sorry, fiscal '25 will be pushed into '26 and maybe beyond versus what was a pretty good start -- kick start in fiscal '25.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Frank Sullivan for any closing remarks.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you, Andrea. Well, I'd like to conclude by recognizing and thanking our more than 17,000 associates around the globe who are executing at a really high level on our MAP initiatives making huge difference for RPM and for our shareholders. Thank you all for your participation in our conference call. And we look forward to talking to you about the development of fiscal '25 in October. And to having you participate in our shareholder meeting as well that will happen at the same time. Thanks again for your interest in RPM and for your investment in research and have a great rest of, let's say, very quickly happening summer of 2024. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Matt. Our first quarter outlook is on the next page, Slide 13. On a consolidated level, first quarter sales are expected to be approximately flat compared to a record prior year period with many market trends from the fourth quarter continuing. By segment, CPG is expected to generate low single-digit revenue growth on top of the nearly 11% growth they generated in the first quarter of 2024. As they benefit from their focus on restoration, selling, building envelope systems and unique turnkey offerings. In PCG, sales are expected to be flat due to challenging comparisons as a few larger projects were completed in the prior year period and others are being delayed beyond the first quarter of 2025. In SPG, overall demand is expected to remain soft. However, the segment is facing easier comparisons, which should result in sales declining in the low single-digit range. In Consumer Group, sales are expected to be down low-single-digits. Trends are expected to remain similar to the fourth quarter with market share gains and strength in international markets being offset by continued DIY softness. Consolidated first quarter adjusted EBIT is expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percentage range compared to a record prior year period driven by MAP 2025 benefits. As part of MAP 2025, we are in the process of consolidating or have recently consolidated 12 facilities, which demonstrates our continued momentum in generating efficiencies. Our fiscal 2025 full-year guidance is on the following slide, Slide 14. We expect sales growth will be up low single digits and adjusted EBIT will increase mid-single-digits to low-double-digits. On the top line, volume growth is uncertain as the visibility on the global economic outlook is limited which includes the unknown impact of elections in the U.S. and other markets. Our strategic balance and focus on repair and maintenance should be beneficial as we navigate the mixed economy. We expect pricing to be slightly positive in response to continued inflation in areas like labor and benefits, and we expect moderate increases in raw material costs in the second half of the fiscal year. By segment, CPG should outgrow its markets with its differentiated product and service offerings and should continue to benefit from spending on infrastructure and restoration projects. After a year of strong growth, CPG will face more challenging prior year comparisons in fiscal 2025, while commercial construction remains sluggish. Moving to PCG. They continue to benefit from increased spending on infrastructure projects as well as their more collaborative strategy in emerging markets, which is generating profitable growth. After years of strong growth, the growth in spending on reshoring projects appears to be moderating. And PCG will also experience a temporary headwind from the under absorption impact of opening of new plants in India and Malaysia that we highlighted on the last call -- on the last quarter. Although these plans will be a longer-term tailwind of PCG results. At SPG, the current expectation is that several key end markets will remain sluggish. As a result, SPG has pruned certain products and their associated SG&A cost structure. These actions, along with easier comparisons will help SPG get back to growth particularly if end markets recover. At Consumer, we will continue benefiting from new products and market share gains as well as driving an improved product mix which is expected to more than offset near-term softness in DIY. When end markets ultimately recover, consumer is poised for strong profitability growth as a result of the MAP 2025 initiatives put in place. On a consolidated level, the key driver of EBIT growth is expected to be our MAP 2025 benefits including manufacturing and commercial excellence improvements as well as the actions we have taken to make our SG&A structure more streamlined. This includes leveraging the power of RPM to generate efficiencies in areas like automation, digital selling tools and centralizing more back office functions. These efficiencies will be more apparent over time as we overcome the negative short-term under-absorption impact of MAP enabled plant consolidation. Finally, because of the strong cash flow and debt reductions made throughout fiscal year 2024, we will benefit from lower interest expense in fiscal year 2025. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be pleased to answer your questions. Yes. Kevin, in fiscal '24, there is a little over $50 million of unfavorable impact from unfavorable absorption on conversion costs. In the fourth quarter, it was a little over $15 million. We expect more of that in this low volume growth environment. As you could see in specialty and consumer and now in Performance Coatings, they are experiencing volume challenges. And as Frank mentioned, as we go through a lot of these plant consolidation projects, we are building new plants, for example, in India and Malaysia, we are closing certain plants and relocating production to other plants with increased capital spending and some capacity expansions at certain sites. So as that transition goes on, we will have some start-up inefficiencies that will eventually work their way over time and generate efficiencies overall for RPM. Yes, it will be, John, very meaningful and fiscal '25 as you might have seen a few times before, we are projecting $185 million of annualized MAP savings in wave 3 of our MAP program in fiscal '25. That's the highest year for savings and these planned consolidations are a big part of that. There were tariffs on tinplate and that's kept our packaging, which primarily impact or most impacts our consumer segment that those prices went up with the inflation, and they never came back down. So they've been sticky near the top, and those tariffs have been a contributing factor. We also had math benefits in terms of procurement and manufacturing work streams. And those math savings were north of $20 million impacting cost of goods in the quarter."

            "name": "Michael Laroche",
            "content": "Thanks, Frank. Starting on Slide 6. Consolidated organic sales increased 0.4% as pricing was slightly higher and volumes overall were flat. FX was 0.7% headwind to revenue and divestitures net of acquisitions decreased sales by 0.1%, resulting in a modest decline in sales for the quarter. EBIT margins expanded 90 basis points, which was driven by MAP 2025 benefits, improved fixed cost leverage at the Construction Products Group and favorable mix at the consumer group. SG&A increased during the quarter driven by incentives to sell higher-margin products, long-term growth investments and compensation and benefits. As Frank mentioned, we implemented MAP 2025 enabled initiatives to streamline our SG&A structure in the fourth quarter, and those benefits will be realized in fiscal year 2025. Adjusted EPS increased 14.7% to $1.56, which was a record, driven by the adjusted EBIT growth and lower interest expense as strong cash flow allowed us to repay debt during the quarter. Next, moving to the Construction Products Group results on Slide 7. The segment experienced broad-based strength with roofing and wall systems performing particularly well. The growth came from both new building construction and renovation, and we gained market share in construction chemicals. They also generated growth in product serving infrastructure projects, including those that reduce both the cost and carbon footprint of their construction. Some of these, including driving gains, which reduced the amount of energy needed to produce cement and synthetic fibers that serve as a substitute for steel rebar and produce significantly lower CO2 emissions and require less labor to install. The rise in adjusted EBIT was led by improved fixed cost leverage from volume growth, MAP 2025 benefits and driving a favorable product mix. On Slide 8, the Performance Coatings Group sales declined as they faced challenging comparisons to the prior year period when sales grew 10.8% and the unfavorable timing of project completions as some were pulled forward into the third quarter while other projects are experiencing delays. Additionally, Europe had pockets of weakness. FX and the prior divestiture of the noncore European service business also pressured sales. Adjusted EBIT declined as a result of lower sales and reduced fixed cost leverage from volume declines. This was partially offset by MAP 2025 benefits. Moving to Slide 9. Specialty Products Group sales declined primarily due to challenging comparisons to the prior year period for the disaster restoration business. In the prior year, customers were rebuilding inventories that have been depleted as a result of increased storm activity and bursting pipes from freezing weather in prior quarters. Overall, specialty OEM markets, particularly those related to residential remained soft. The reduction in adjusted EBIT was driven by the sales and volume declines, which resulted in unfavorable fixed cost absorption. On Slide 10, the consumer group gained share with the help of new products and grew in markets outside the U.S., which helped to offset continued softness in the DIY space. The rationalization of lower-margin products also contributed to the sales declines. MAP 2025 initiatives and an improved mix resulted in record EBIT which is partially offset by under absorption associated with lower volumes and higher expenses from wages and benefits. Now I'll turn the call over to Matt, who will cover the balance sheet and cash flow and provide an update on innovation. I think that's probably a pretty good run rate considering some of the plant consolidations that we spoke about previously going forward. Yes. We had a couple of larger plant announcements happened in the fourth quarter this year, which really drove the increased spending in Q4."

            "name": "Frank Sullivan",
            "content": "Thank you, Matt, and good morning. I'll start our conference call with a high-level review of our results, then Mike Laroche will provide more details on our fourth quarter and full-year financials. Matt Schlarb will then give a balance sheet update and discuss how we are using innovation to grow, after which Rusty Gordon will cover our outlook, then we'll be pleased to answer your questions. I'll begin on Slide 3 with our fourth quarter results. Overall, we're pleased with how RPM's associates executed. Despite challenging end markets in several of our businesses, we leveraged MAP 2025 improvements to generate our 10th consecutive quarter of record adjusted EBIT. For the year, sales were a record and adjusted EBIT increased approximately 12% to a record which was within the guidance we provided a year ago. This included approximately $160 million of MAP 2025 benefits on a run rate basis or roughly $100 million through the P&L in fiscal '24. Although a portion of these are being temporarily masked by lower fixed cost utilization from reduced volumes. In addition to margin expansion, MAP 2025 has played a critical role in our ability to structurally improve working capital throughout the entire year. This resulted in record cash flow from operating activities of $1.12 billion during fiscal '24, an improvement of over $545 million from fiscal 2023 and $356 million or 46% more than our previous annual record cash flow. We used a portion of this cash to reduce debt by approximately $557 million during the year and the resulting lower interest expense helped us grow adjusted EPS by 14.7% to a fourth quarter record and by 14.9% for the full-year to a record $4.94 per share. Moving to Slide 4, our Construction Products Group led growth during the quarter with broad-based strength in most of their businesses with roofing and its differentiated turnkey offerings, demonstrating particular strength. Consumer also executed well during the quarter as they achieved market share gains, upgraded product mix and realized MAP '25 benefits generate record adjusted EBIT despite a sales decline due to continued DIY softness. After multiple years achieving record results, our Performance Coatings Group declined in the fourth quarter as they faced challenging comparisons to the prior year and experienced negative headwinds from the timing of project completions, something we highlighted on our prior earnings call. In the Specialty Products Group, some end markets showed signs of bottoming out but we continue to remain challenged in this segment. The economic situation remains very challenging. However, we did a good job managing what we can control with a focus on MAP '25 and margin improvements to generate record adjusted EBIT and record levels of cash flow. Turning to geographies on Slide 5. North America, Africa and the Middle East grew. And while sales declined in other regions, we're still executing well in these areas. European sales declined 4% due to FX headwinds and divestitures in the Performance Coatings Group. However, their profitability improved meaningfully as targeted MAP '25 initiatives in the region gained momentum, including those focused on generating favorable product mix. Excluding FX, sales in Latin America grew mid-single digits as we continue to benefit from product serving infrastructure projects. Asia-Pacific is performing well under our new management structure. However, fourth quarter sales declined due to challenging comparisons as a large project was completed in the prior year period. To summarize our performance, in the face of several end market and economic challenges, we have realized good improvements in gross margins as a result of our MAP 25 initiatives. In addition to gross profit benefits, MAP '25 is allowing us to better leverage the power of RPM to create a more efficient and streamlined SG&A structure. We took several SG&A reduction initiatives in the fourth quarter, which will benefit us as we work our way through fiscal 2025. As economic headwinds persist, it's important to remember that the improvements we are making are structural. While they are helping us navigate near-term challenges, their benefits will be even more apparent as end markets eventually recover and we begin to generate better organic growth. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mike Laroche to cover our financial results in more detail. Good morning, Mike. Sure. I think the biggest impact in the quarter for our Performance Coatings Group was project timing, and we talked about that on our last call. We had a number of projects that ended up being accelerated into Q3, which negatively impacted the fourth quarter. We anticipate continued growth, although at a more modest level in the Performance Coatings Group for the balance of fiscal '25. And so there's still solid results there. The other thing that I think is worth noting in fiscal '24, was the divestiture of a number of the European, U.K. based service businesses in our Performance Coatings Group, which hampered our results year-over-year. But it was the right thing to do. It's improving profitability. And so we'll annualize that pretty quickly. And I think those are reasons to believe that we'll see positive momentum but at a more modest rate than what we experienced in the past year. Sure. They really fall in two categories. One was a necessary rip across a number of our business units that impacted about 170 RPM associates. And the benefits of that on an annualized basis will be in the $25 million. And then the other area is, as we've talked about investments in a number of significant growth areas. And so we are continuing those where they are providing good momentum, and we are paring back on some of those that have not met our expectations as we go into fiscal '25. Thanks, Mike. Good morning, Kevin. So let me have Rusty to provide some details. But in general, as we've talked in the past, and you could see it in the improvement over the last two years in gross profitability. It's the hardest thing to move. And our MAP initiatives have been focused on that, consolidating production facilities. We are in the midst of -- and MAP '25, another dozen opportunities to consolidate versus the 30 or so that we completed in the original 2020 MAP to Growth program as well as a very effective systemized way of introducing lean manufacturing and continuous improvement initiatives in our plants. So we are reducing our plant footprint, and we are increasing conversion cost productivity. All of that shows up when you sell something. And so the only real solid, almost 7% organic growth in the fourth quarter was from our Construction Products Group. The others all were either modestly down. And so that's the big picture. In terms of specifics, let me have Rusty address that. So Kevin, I would add that your question really gets at the heart of our outlook in what's a pretty wide range for fiscal '25. We are operating currently in a low, no growth environment in general. And -- if and when volumes pick up, and I would expect in the second half of the year, that the economic circumstances don't deteriorate that we'll see that will be certainly annualizing easier comps in our Specialty Products Group and Consumer. Any volume growth will accrete to very nice leverage on our bottom line. And so that's why we have come out with kind of a wide range in terms of our EBIT forecast, our MAP '25 initiatives will continue to deliver solid results, but volume growth can hit our bottom line very nicely when it shows up. Without getting into specific details, I think the two biggest points of reference that people should focus on throughout the year is, A, the improvement that we generated in our gross profit margins. And you've seen that. And then B, this $50 million of unabsorbed overhead costs that Rusty talked about. The gross margin is going to deliver more profitability per dollar of sales. And there's a point at which we're going to have some favorable comparisons to these under absorption hits which will benefit our product line -- or I'm sorry, our profitability. Good morning, Frank. I think that's fair to say. I actually think both for the fiscal year and in the fourth quarter, we're executing at a really high level in our consumer group. We've been through what's now 15 months, maybe more 18 months of negative consumer takeaway across the DIY paint space. Some of that, 18 months ago, was I think still continued fallout from the COVID bump, which was huge. But as we sit here today, it's really driven by housing turnover. We are at a 30-year low in terms of housing turnover and housing turnover is one critical element that drives consumer takeaway. But having said all that, for the year and in the quarter, you're looking at negative units of about 1% versus our identifiable peers, it's pretty strong result in terms of how we're performing. And it's a lot of the things that Matt talked about, some market share gains, some new product introductions, some strength in some new product introductions in the U.K. and Europe. And so I think our consumer group is performing at a pretty good level in this environment. And I would expect that to continue. We don't have a better crystal ball than anyone else in terms of where the economy is going. Sure. So as we've talked about, we have structurally improved our cash generation capabilities. So we're at new levels of cash flow, which we expect to maintain in marginally improved because there's still some more work to do in working capital improvement. Our balance sheet is in the best shape it's been in 30 years. And so we have plenty of opportunities for acquisition activity. I would expect that to pick up versus what's been a pretty modest acquisition period, particularly relative to RPM's history. Our focus continues to be on the small and medium-sized acquisitions that are highly strategic to our businesses, and that's where you'll see us focus. Thank you. Good morning, John. I don't have those details. I don't know if Rusty has a swag at that. But I don't have a good sense of that, good enough to give you a number that I could stand behind. Rusty, do you have any more insights? Sure. I think we are on track to achieve in terms of delivered results, our goals for fiscal '26. And our program is on an annualized run rate. So we will not experience all of those benefits that Rusty talked about in fiscal '25. But at the end of '25, we will be benefiting fully from plant consolidation and other MAP initiatives. So I think we're in good shape there. It just depends on volume. And it's a broken record here, but we're in a low growth, no growth environment. And given our MAP '25 success with flat results, we should be able to deliver solid EBIT growth. And again, referencing the wide range in EBIT expectations. On the downside, I think we'll be able to deliver mid-single digit EBIT growth. And when we get some pickup in volume, you're going to see good growth in the teens. And so I don't have much more to add there because of a crystal ball and kind of the dynamics, particularly in our core North American market. I think we're going to be in this low no growth environment in Q1. And it's our expectation that by the time we get to the second half you're going to see some positive results even assuming there's no further deterioration just because we're going to be rounding easier comps, particularly in consumer and specialty products. Thank you. Good morning. So in general, both pricing and raw materials for the time being are relatively stable. Obviously, there are some exceptions up and down in different categories. Price in the quarter was marginally higher. But so I think the way to think about price for fiscal '25 will be in the 1% range, maybe slightly higher. The areas where we continue to see inflation are in wages, benefits, insurance costs, similar to other companies and not specific even to our industry. They have moderated in every case from where they were a few years ago. So it's going to be -- unless there is a meaningful change in inflation one way or another. I think a very modest impact on results. Sure. So our capital allocation will remain what it has been. I would expect $50 million or more, depending on circumstances of share repurchases. I would expect our Board to raise our dividend for its 51st consecutive year when they meet in October. With our payout ratio -- 20 years ago, we consistently had a payout ratio at or above 50%. Now we're in the mid-30s. So our ability to increase our cash dividend at a rate more consistent with earnings growth exist today. And from an M&A perspective, I would expect us to do more M&A in the coming years versus a modest period of M&A growth in the last couple of years, primarily focused on small and medium-sized businesses or product lines. Beyond those comments, no update. Some of it is both in our Construction Products Group and PCG, some slowing down of projects that we have already won. And then it's just anticipation of a low, no-growth environment as we round in PCG and CPG, pretty challenging tops. So the opposite of our consumer and specialty. We expect positive growth both in Performance Coatings and Infrastructure products, but they'll be rounding some pretty healthy comps in each quarter of fiscal '25. It is. So I would expect Q1 and consumer to look like Q4. We still see some consumer takeaways not terrific. The new product introductions and some of the market share gains that we have and expanding presence of [indiscernible] break in some exciting new product categories and introductions in GAAP are going well. So as we get into the back half, I think you'll see low to mid-single digit growth in part just based upon easier comps. But in the first quarter, we're living in the same no growth environment or modestly negative consumer takeaway that we experienced in the spring. Sure. I think the timing issue most impacted Q4 and will continue a little bit into the early part of Q1. But there are still many, many hundreds of billions of dollars through the infrastructure bill and other things that will be spent as the years unfold, a lot of these chip stacks are a good example. We're well positioned in a number of those projects. But some of them have now been slowed down such that the spending is spread out over a couple of year longer period of time than originally envisioned. The dollars are still coming. Concrete is being poured with Euclid admixtures and Euclid fibers, and we would expect to get a reasonable share of the floor and fireproofing coatings and those. So those are just some examples. But if you look just at the Intel project here in Ohio, it's moving forward, but at a slightly slower pace than originally envisioned. Otherwise, I think the dynamics that are driving those businesses continue. We have added sales people. We've introduced new initiatives in the Construction Products Group in particular. We have had a multi-year shift from selling components to selling systems. And that seems to be paying off as our Construction Products Group outperforms what's a pretty punky new construction and commercial construction environment right now. Thank you. Good morning, Jeff. We -- more broadly, Dave Dennsteadt, who is the Leader of our Performance Coatings Group in support of all of RPM operations in Europe, relocated to Europe a little more than a year ago. To help coordinate our MAP activities there. As you'll recall, we were focused mostly in North America and the initiation of our plant initiatives and then COVID hit, which really slowed down our ability to do what's pretty hands-on on the plant floor process. And so with Dave's leadership and the support of our associates and our operations in Europe, we're catching up, if you will. And so a meaningful portion of these MAP 2025 plant consolidations are happening and will continue to happen in our European operations. Good morning, Josh. I think that's pretty much it. A price will be modestly positive, but not really meaningful and less dynamics change out there. So the way to think about it is the continuing benefits of the MAP initiatives that we will be building throughout fiscal '25, offset by the volume or lack of volume under absorption that Rusty referenced. And when you net all those, I think we're still in a position to show positive momentum on the EBIT line, both in terms of dollars and margin in a low no growth environment. And so Q1 feels a lot like Q4 in terms of where we sit today halfway through the quarter. So I think your thoughts on the fiscal year are correct. And here we say multiple times that our wide range is based upon what happens with volume as we progress throughout the year. Sure. It will play out over a couple of years, but 3% to 4% unit volume growth would sing on our bottom line really nicely. Thank you. Good morning, Steve. Yes, Steve. So almost all of that lower COGS was related to raw material deflation. So we had about mid-single digit deflation in Q4. We started that process of consolidating those plans -- the plans in Q4, but we'll really see those benefits as we progress through 2025. Sure. So I think structurally, there is more opportunities for us, particularly in the G&A area over time. I had -- we have a goal of getting our SG&A over time down to about 26%. I will tell you that the most important asset of RPM does not show up on our balance sheet, and it's more than 2,000 sales individual sales reps. We have more people in marketing. And so given the nature of who we are and the entrepreneurial approach to customers in terms of sales, marketing, tech service. I do not envision consolidating sales forces. Going back to my grandfather 70 some years ago, the more feet on the street, the better. Some of the growth initiatives that has been driving our SG&A up. It's been the addition of salespeople. And where that's not paying off, we'll adjust in a business like our Stonhard flooring business, the addition of new sales reps has meaningfully improved their business in the top line. So they're generating of our Performance Coatings Group, they're generating solid organic growth. And so that's how we think about SG&A going forward. Sure. I would guess we're probably about 70% DIY and about 30% Pro. Our two primary consumer broad segments would be DAP, it would cost sealants, patch and repair products and they're adding new products and then Rust-Oleum in various small project paint, primers, things like that. We tend to be more consumer and Rust-Oleum small project paint. And the Zinsser Primer and DAP products, I think we're more 50-50 between consumer and Pro. We're getting double whammy because in a sale, we get both. And so when you think about a home sale, people take time to fix up patch and repair, paint and plays very much into our hands because of the nature of our products, particularly paint and repair and the small project paint versus somebody hiring a pay contractor to paint their whole house, which is not the space that we're in today. And then when somebody shows up into a new house, they redecorate rooms and zoo modest us improvements. And again, that benefits us. So we benefit both on the sell and the actions taken to prepare the house for sale and on the buy and the actions of new homebuyers state. And we are not seeing that to the extent that we have in the past because we're at 30 -- literally a 30-year low in housing turnover because people stuck on some interest rates and other factors. It's also a significant driver of the underperformance in our Specialty Products Group. Our Industrial Coatings Business, which is the largest segment, almost half of our Specialty Products Group revenues serves efficient cabinets and all kinds of wood cabinets and woodwork and doors and windows. So we are still tied into a meaningful part of what's still manufactured in the United States. It goes into housing. And that's been a challenge as well, both on the new construction side as well as on the housing turnover side as it relates to furniture or major home improvements. That's correct. Again, we're at a 30-year low. And the -- unfortunately, Wall Street Journal reported just this week that housing prices is hitting a new high. And so the value of homes in light of the inflation that we've experienced in North America, the significant increase in interest rates, its impact on mortgages. All those are factors that are underlying dynamics that are great. That's why I comment on the performance of our consumer group in light of those with unit volume down about 1% in the quarter is really outstanding. And it shows positively in comparison to our identifiable peers. And I think we're performing well given the dynamics that are out there. And further proof that when the warm turns, we'll see some nice volume pickups, particularly related to new shelf placement for abrasives. So we're in the sand paper business and growing. It's not a category that existed for RPM three or four years ago. And we're moving in some cleaner product categories. And so there's a number of new initiatives that I think will help growth. Thank you. Good morning, Michael. Sure. So I think that we're -- our people are executing the MAP initiatives at a really high level. And I don't know that there's any accelerating those. I think it's a very methodical approach to addressing of both the continuous improvement, lean manufacturing disciplines more broadly across the globe. Another initiative that is paying off for us, and it probably took us 20 years to figure this out, is the platform approach to the developing world. We had stop and start efforts with our businesses as we either organically or through small acquisitions. We do acquisitions in Southeast Asia or in China or in India. And we have a very high-performing leadership team that's based in South Africa. And given their success because of the uniqueness of that market across our consumer brands and our construction products brand and our Performance Coatings Brand, it's fundamentally Carboline business when we acquired the South African operation. So Performance Coatings business. They now have sales -- the consolidated administration and production but have independent sales and market focus across almost all of RPM's brands. They are now responsible for the Middle East, Africa, India and Southeast Asia. And that's paying big dividends for us. And so that's a different approach for RPM. It's not a small base, but the growth percentages are pretty impressive, and there's a lot more to come there. So those are the type of things, Michael, that, I think will allow us to generate positive momentum in a low growth, no growth environment. We don't see things deteriorating further. I think there's been a rolling recession, notwithstanding all the headlines in the manufacturing sector. Anything that touched housing, you can see it, and that's been accretive to our supply chain supplier base that it had a challenging year. I can't speak to services or tech. But if you're in manufacturing in the last 12 or 18 months have been challenging, we don't see it getting worse. Lastly, if it does get worse, unrelated to our MAP initiatives, there would be room, if necessary, on the SG&A area for additional expense reductions. We have and also, I think, more importantly, into commercial. And so we have a real significant effort to get Nudura specified, get it understood, communicate and educate about Nudura and get it specified into the new construction market for schools. We now have a specification throughout schools in Kentucky, for instance, following the terrible tornadoes they had a couple of years ago. We're moving it into other states, particularly states that are kind of in the tornado all area. Specification doesn't mean we'll get to work. but you've got to educate architects and engineers and builders and then you need to build momentum and we're starting to see that happen in the school market. So that's a nice area. The last comment I'll make about Nudura is my wife and I had an unfortunate sewer flooding circumstance in our home in Cleveland, Ohio. And after working with our insurance company for a few months to remediate that, we made the decision to tear it down and build a new home. And so we are in the midst of building a 5,000 square foot Nudura home. Paying for it directly through the builder, new to the architect and new to the builder, and I am learning along with them and the construction products group knows that I'm going to learn firsthand, all the good things that they're talking about Nudura and what challenges there are through direct experience. Thank you. Good morning. Sure. I think they're going to continue. You've got $1 trillion infrastructure bill that will impact a lot of the areas. You've got a chips act in terms of chip manufacturing in the U.S., and we're well positioned in our Performance Coatings Group and Construction products for some of that work. And so we would expect to see the benefits of that, I think, through 2026. But again, you'll see a more modest sales growth than the past year just because we're rounding some very challenging comps. But nonetheless, we'll see positive growth there, and we're well positioned to benefit from it. Sure. It's a combination of the more challenging comparisons, but it is also a slowdown in some of the project completions. I think that whether it's -- interestingly, it's as much about labor and new facilities as it is and training up personnel to staff new chip plants or other things as it is about construction labor. But the projects are not stopping, they're continuing. The dollars are there and committed. But I think the expectation of how they'll be spent is now going to be spread out over a longer period of time. So the impact in fiscal '26 will be -- I'm sorry, fiscal '25 will be pushed into '26 and maybe beyond versus what was a pretty good start -- kick start in fiscal '25. Thank you, Andrea. Well, I'd like to conclude by recognizing and thanking our more than 17,000 associates around the globe who are executing at a really high level on our MAP initiatives making huge difference for RPM and for our shareholders. Thank you all for your participation in our conference call. And we look forward to talking to you about the development of fiscal '25 in October. And to having you participate in our shareholder meeting as well that will happen at the same time. Thanks again for your interest in RPM and for your investment in research and have a great rest of, let's say, very quickly happening summer of 2024. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] Please also note that this event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Matt Schlarb, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.\nMatthew Schlarb: Thank you, Jamie and welcome to RPM International's Conference Call for the fiscal 2024 third quarter. Joining today's call are Frank Sullivan, RPM's Chair and CEO, who is dialing in remotely today; Rusty Gordon, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Mike Laroche, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. This call is also being webcast and can be accessed live or replayed on the RPM website at www.rpminc.com. Comments made on this call may include forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to be materially different. For more information on these risks and uncertainties, please visit RPM's reports filed with the SEC. During this conference call, references may be made to non-GAAP financial measures. To assist you in understanding these non-GAAP terms, RPM has posted reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures on the RPM website. Also, please note that our comments will be on an as-adjusted basis and all comparisons are to the third quarter of fiscal 2023, unless otherwise indicated. We have provided a supplemental slide presentation to support our comments on this call. It can be accessed in the Presentations and Webcasts section of the RPM website at www.rpminc.com. Additionally, as a reminder, certain businesses in Asia Pacific that were previously part of the Construction Products Group are now being managed and reported under the Performance Coatings Group effective June 1, 2023. As a result, all references to CPG and PCG today reflect the updated structure. The recast businesses generate approximately $100 million in annual sales and this change has no impact on our consolidated results. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Frank.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you, Matt and thank you to everybody for participating on our call today. I'll start with a high-level review of our third quarter results. Then I'll turn the call over to Mike Laroche to discuss the financials in more detail. Matt will then provide an update on the balance sheet on organic growth investments in emerging markets and Rusty will cover our outlook for the balance of the year. At the end of the prepared remarks, we'll be pleased to answer your questions. I'll begin on Slide 3 with our third quarter results. In addition to our strategic balance and focus on repair and maintenance, positive momentum with our MAP 2025 operational improvement initiatives continued in the third quarter which generated our ninth consecutive quarter of record sales and EBIT results. Margins expanded and we had our fourth consecutive quarter of record cash from operations. During this trailing 12-month period, we generated $1,260 million in cash flow from operating activities far exceeding any previous 12-month period in RPM's history. Much of this has been driven by improvements in working capital which has been a particular area of focus with our MAP 2025 initiatives. Turning to Slide 4. Sales growth was led by our Construction Products Group and our Performance Coatings Group. These segments benefited from their focus on repair and maintenance as well as their ability to serve strong demand from infrastructure, reshoring and high-performance building projects with their engineered solutions. Favorable timing of some project completions, particularly in the Performance Coatings Group contributed to sales growth in Q3. Due to challenging market conditions, volume declines in the Consumer and Specialty Products segments continued. Consumer was negatively impacted by lower DIY takeaway and retail customers who continue to tightly manage inventory levels, partially offset by market share gains. While volumes declined in the Specialty Products Group due primarily to challenging comparisons in the Legend Brands disaster restoration business, there were signs of stabilization in our core specialty OEM markets. As expected, pricing was positive in all segments as we catch up with inflation, including continued inflation in wages, benefits and insurance. On a consolidated basis, pricing during the quarter was up approximately 1% quarter-over-quarter. We achieved record adjusted EBIT as our MAP 2025 benefit inclusive of the commodity cycle recovery drove a 170 basis point improvement in margins. MAP 2025 initiatives were a benefit to all businesses, particularly those that generated positive unit volume growth. It is imperative that throughout cycles we invest in initiatives to leverage our entrepreneurial spirit and generate volume growth that will allow us to fully realize the benefits from the MAP initiatives we have put in place. Some recent examples include capacity expansions, increasing R&D spending through the establishment of our Innovation Center of Excellence and improving our data-driven decision-making capabilities. We are also expanding our sales forces and training them to increase sales of higher-margin products as well as introducing new products such as DAP, one component wall and cavity spray foam which is helping us win market share this spring. Moving to Slide 5. The positive momentum from improved coordination outside the United States continued in the third quarter, emerging markets led growth for the company as a result of RPM's heavy emphasis on engineered solutions for infrastructure investments in these geographies. In Europe, we are taking share with our focused sales strategy. After excluding the impacts of a divested business, sales in the region were roughly flat despite macroeconomic pressures in several economies. And our focus on implementing MAP 2025 initiatives in the region generated strong EBIT margin improvement. Overall, I'm proud of our associates' continued commitment to our MAP 2025 program which has consistently generated efficiencies, higher levels of cash flow and record results. We remain focused on expanding margins, accelerating organic growth and improving cash flow to achieve our MAP 2025 targets. I'll now turn the call over to Mike Laroche to cover our third quarter financial results in more detail.\nMichael Laroche: Thanks, Frank. Starting on Slide 6. Consolidated organic sales increased 0.9%, driven by positive volumes at Construction Products Group and Performance Coatings Group as well as higher pricing in all segments. FX was 0.4% headwind to revenue. MAP 2025 benefits, including the commodity cycle drove adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 170 basis points, improved fixed cost leverage at Construction Products Group and Performance Coatings Group also contributed to better margins. As Frank mentioned, we are investing in initiatives to accelerate organic growth and this contributed to an increase in SG&A during the quarter. Incentives to sell higher-margin products and inflation and wages and benefits also added to the SG&A increase. We continue to selectively raise prices at businesses with the most pronounced inflationary pressures and took expense reduction actions at the end of fiscal year 2023 to help mitigate the SG&A rise. Adjusted EPS increased 40.5% to $0.52 which was a third quarter record and was driven by the adjusted EBIT growth. Interest expense declined in the quarter due to a $629 million debt reduction over the prior year as a result of record cash flow and this contributed to the adjusted EPS increase as well. Now turning to the segment results. Starting with Construction Products Group on Slide 7. Third quarter sales were a record and growth was led by concrete admixtures which continued to benefit from reshoring and infrastructure projects, including in Latin America. The segment also generated growth from increased demand for high-performance buildings and market share gains. The rise in adjusted EBIT was led by MAP 2025 benefits driving a favorable product mix and improved fixed cost leverage from volume growth. On Slide 8, Performance Coatings Group achieved record sales, once again driven by the demand for engineered solutions serving reshoring projects, including favorable timing of some project completions as well as market share gains. The businesses in Africa, Middle East and Asia Pacific that were recently aligned under the Performance Group -- Performance Coatings Group management contributed to the segment's growth driven by RPM's engineered solutions focused on infrastructure projects. Adjusted EBIT was a third quarter record, driven by sales growth, favorable mix and improved fixed cost leverage that was enhanced by MAP 2025. Moving to Slide 9. Specialty Products Group sales declined primarily due to challenging comparisons to the prior year period for the disaster restoration business, when it benefited from the response to freeze-related flooding which should not recur to the same extent this year. The divestiture of the noncore furniture warranty business also contributed to the sales decline. After several quarters of weakness, specialty OEM markets began showing signs of stabilization during the quarter. The reduction in adjusted EBIT was driven by the sales and volumes decline in the disaster restoration business which resulted in unfavorable absorption as well as the divestiture of the noncore furniture warranty business. SPG also continued strategic investments in long-term growth initiatives which were partially offset by expense reduction actions taken at the end of fiscal 2023. On Slide 10, the Consumer Group was pressured by weaker takeaway at retail stores from DIY customers, customers maintaining lean inventories and the rationalization of lower-margin products. Market share gains partially offset the decline in volumes. MAP 2025 initiatives and the rationalization of lower-margin products resulted in margin expansion which was partially offset by under-absorption associated with lower volumes and higher expenses from wages and benefits. Now, I'll turn the call over to Matt who will cover the balance sheet and cash flows and provide an update on emerging markets.\nMatthew Schlarb: Thank you, Mike. Moving to Slide 11. The positive momentum in working capital improvements continued in the third quarter as inventories declined by $261 million compared to the prior year. Year-over-year in the third quarter, we reduced working capital as a percentage of sales by 580 basis points to 21.4%. This contributed to a record $173 million in cash flow from operating activities during the quarter. Over the trailing 12-month period, we have generated $1.26 billion in cash flow from operating activities which is a record and represents an increase of $969 million from the same period in the prior year. We have used the strong cash flow to reduce debt by $629 million compared to the prior year and returned $210 million in cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the first 9 months of the fiscal year. On Slide 12, I'd like to highlight investments we've been making in emerging markets. As we've previously discussed, businesses in Asia Pacific, Africa and the Middle East have recently aligned under a new management structure. This alignment has resulted in improved coordination and growth has accelerated as we are better positioned to capture increasing demand for our engineered solutions serving infrastructure projects. We've seen this growth continuing and we are making investments in new plants in Malaysia and India to add capacity, reduce shipping costs and improve our ability to serve our customers. In line with our Building a Better World initiative, the construction of these plants incorporate several sustainability features, including solar panels, rain water harvesting and a solvent recovery system. These plants are also incorporating MAP manufacturing improvement initiatives and will produce from multiple brands across RPM segments, demonstrating the increased collaboration between RPM businesses that has been enabled by MAP. The Malaysian facility is scheduled to open in the first half of fiscal 2025 and the Indian plant is expected to come online in the second half of fiscal year 2025. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Rusty to cover the outlook.\nRussell Gordon: Thanks, Matt. Our fourth quarter and full year outlooks are on Slide 13. On a consolidated level, fourth quarter sales are expected to be approximately flat compared to a record prior year period. CPG is expected to lead growth with sales up low to mid-single digits, driven by demand for solutions serving infrastructure and institutional projects and its focus on restoration and maintenance. After multiple years of achieving record sales, PCG sales are expected to be approximately flat in the fourth quarter. This is primarily due to the timing of project completions, including some that were pulled forward into the third quarter. Additionally, PCG's results will be impacted by a previously announced business divestiture. SPG sales are expected to decline in the mid-single-digit percentage range as the disaster restoration business remains challenged, while specialty OEM markets stabilize, albeit at low levels. In Consumer, market share gains are expected to be more than offset by continued softness in DIY demand, resulting in sales declining in the mid-single-digit range. With these continued share gains, we believe we are poised to achieve accelerated growth when existing home sales and DIY markets ultimately recover. Consolidated fourth quarter adjusted EBIT is expected to increase in the high single-digit percentage range compared to a record prior year period driven by MAP 2025 benefits which are being partially offset by under-absorption from lower volumes. Finally, our full year guidance is at the bottom of Slide 13. We anticipate that full fiscal year sales growth will be near the midpoint of our previous guidance of up low single digits and adjusted EBIT growth will be near the midpoint of our previous guidance of up low double digits to mid-teens. This concludes our prepared comments. We will now be pleased to answer your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Joshua Spector from UBS.\nLucas Beaumont: It's Lucas Beaumont on for Josh today. Just wanted to start with Consumer, if we could. So I just wanted to get your view, current view on sort of whether you think now the sort of sell-in was reconnected with the takeaway at the retail stores, something you called out that the takeaway there was weak. And assuming things have sort of got more in sync now, how do you kind of see the outlook there at the retail level over the next couple of quarters? And when should we expect to return to volume growth?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So we expect a continuation in Q4 of what you have seen in Q3 and for most of fiscal '24, with continuing relative strength in Construction Products and Performance Coatings and some challenges in the Consumer segment and Specialty Products Group particularly in relationship in the Consumer segment to a very strong fourth quarter last year. I would expect we're going to start to see an improvement and Consumer takeaway and a return of volume as we get into fiscal '25.\nLucas Beaumont: Great. And then just on the continued strength on the CPG side. So I mean you guys basically beat your volume expectations for about 4 quarters in a row, despite the kind of broader macro indicators pointing to slowing. 3Q was kind of more in line. Could you maybe just kind of give us your thoughts there and sort of split out the benefits that you're seeing between the infrastructure reassuring versus the base growth? And I mean, should we see a reconnection with those macro indicators at some point? Or how do you see that kind of playing out?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So we see momentum continuing for both our Performance Coatings Group and our Construction Products Group into Q4 as well as into fiscal '25. It's worth noting that the Construction Products Group performance has been despite a lot of weakness in the core non-commercial, core commercial construction products market, certainly been relatively weak. We picked that up in infrastructure as well as a lot of the projects that we referenced. And then look going forward, we're well positioned. Our backlogs are in good shape and quite candidly globally and this is broadly speaking. We're not through a fraction of the trillions of dollars of government stimulus, mostly in the United States but in other parts of the world, they're helping to drive this. And so whether it's the onshoring and/or friendshoring in Europe and in North America. We're pretty well-positioned to continue to win more than our fair share of those projects and we see that continuing for the coming quarters.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research.\nFrank Mitsch: Frank, hopefully, you're someplace nice today. Let me follow up on that last comment. You said that the backlogs are looking pretty good. Was that a construction products specific comment? And is there any way that you can kind of size order of magnitude relative to where you are historically on the 4th of April?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I wouldn't comment on that any particular specificity. But our backlogs are good in Construction Products. Our Performance Coatings Group continues to see good momentum. We will have a little bit of a weaker fourth quarter as we projected, partly because of project completions. I think it's worth looking at the second half. If you include the guidance that we provided here, for all of RPM, second half of '24, the third quarter we just reported and the guidance that we reaffirmed relative to our full year would suggest sales growth on a consolidated basis at flat or plus 1% and adjusted EBIT growth in the 13% to 14% range. And I mentioned that because we had some acceleration or completion of projects at the end of Q3 that otherwise would have fallen into Q4 in Construction Products and Performance Coatings. But the backlog in both is really strong. It's an odd start for us and everybody in Q4 because of the way holidays fell, there were 3 less shipping days in March and there are 3 more shipping days in April. So we're also having some odd comparisons to prior years on a monthly basis. But in general, both of those segments are in really good shape and the dynamics that have led to record sales growth, positive unit volume growth and margin expansion feel like they're continuing.\nFrank Mitsch: That's very helpful. And then if I could follow up on the Consumer side. I believe the last time we spoke, the interplay between price and raws was looking to turn positive in Consumer. If you could just offer some comments as to how that stands and maybe a comment in general on raws. I know that the expectation was that we would see peak raw material deflation in the second half of '24. Is that still your assumptions?\nFrank Sullivan: It is still our assumption and that's what we're experiencing. In fact, in particular, with our Consumer Group, we're starting to see some raw material upticks in a few select areas, acetone is up significantly. That is kind of an outlier. Propellants up a little bit. Plastic cartridges are up. And so we're seeing some return of inflation or pricing in a few categories that particularly impact our Consumer Group. But overall, we are at the point at which I think the commodity cycle recovery is what we're experiencing. We'll see a little bit of that in Q4. And then I think time will tell as we look out into our new fiscal year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Harrison from Seaport Research Partners.\nMichael Harrison: Congrats on the strong cash flow in particular. I was wondering if you could give a little more detail on what's going on with the margin performance in the Specialty segment. The revenue there was pretty similar to last quarter but the adjusted EBITDA looks like it was close to $5 million that is lower compared to last quarter on a sequential basis there. What's driving that? And if you can provide any help on how we should think about specialty margins going forward?\nFrank Sullivan: I will let Rusty Gordon handle that question about both the Specialty Products Group performance in the quarter and year-to-date and kind of where we see it going.\nRussell Gordon: Yes. In terms of Specialty performance in the quarter, we really did not have any disaster restoration business to speak of, Mike, during the quarter. No weather events really drove sales. So as a result, we really suffered from under-absorption. We continue year-over-year to have an unfavorable comparison like we did in the second quarter and that we divested our furniture warranty business. And then in general, OEM volumes looks soft, not as bad as it's been. It's getting a little bit better. So we do have some reason to hope that, that will improve.\nFrank Sullivan: And then I would add to that, Mike, that the impact of weather-related events last year was very significant in Q3. We don't have exactly that same challenge comparatively in Q4. And the Guardian warranty business which was really not core to us, it was an insurance business and had nothing to do with products was a very high-margin business and that was sold last year in the third quarter. And so again, we will not be seeing the negative comparison of that when we get into the fourth quarter as well. So as Mike Laroche commented, we're starting to see in the core OEM coatings categories, things flattening out. And we won't have the same big challenging comparisons of the Guardian divestiture or the significant weather-related events at Legend Brands that have impacted Q3.\nMichael Harrison: All right. And then I was hoping that maybe you could provide some initial comments as we're starting to turn our attention to fiscal '25 think about earnings growth. Consensus is looking for EBITDA to be up by kind of a high single-digit number compared to fiscal '24. Is that a reasonable starting point for now? And maybe talk a little bit about some of the puts and takes as we're thinking about earnings growth next year.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. Other than reemphasizing some comments that we've already made which I'll do in a minute, we're not really prepared to provide guidance for fiscal '25 with any detail. We will do that when we report fourth quarter results in July and then we'll provide some more detail for how we see fiscal '25 shaking out. The comments that we have made are, we're going to be rounding easier comparisons as we just talked about in our Specialty Products Group. I think at some point, as we get into fiscal '25, we're going to see both easier comparisons and some market share-related wins, some positive unit volume growth coming back to our Consumer segment. And we see continued good momentum in the economic and market and infrastructure dynamics that we've been talking about for Construction Products and Performance Coatings. So we are planning on our tenth consecutive quarter of record sales and earnings in Q4. And I think we've gotten some good dynamics as we go into fiscal '25 but we'll provide more details on a consolidated basis and broadly by segment when we report Q4 in July.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Roberts from Mizuho.\nJohn Roberts: Frank, can you tell us if RPM would be interested in PPG's North American architectural paint business? Or any thoughts around that?\nFrank Sullivan: We generally don't comment about our acquisition activity until things are done. Certainly, M&A is picking up and it was publicly announced that the -- I believe it's about $1.8 billion in revenue, PPG architectural -- North American Architectural Coatings business is going to be sold, divested or realigned. And so I think like anybody in the paint and coatings interest industry, we have some interest in pieces and parts and we certainly intend to be part of any process and take a look at that. And that's more of the specifics that we generally would provide but it's relatively unique that a divestiture process like this would be announced publicly and has been. And so we'll take a look at it.\nJohn Roberts: The final year of MAP 2025 begins in a few weeks. Do you think there'll be a MAP 2028 program? Is that the right cadence to think about? Or do you think RPM will pivot to a different approach to strategy beyond MAP 2025?\nFrank Sullivan: That's a great question. And I think we're highly focused on achieving our MAP 2025 targets. And if you look at our performance through 9 months, I'm really proud of the incredible work of the RPM associates around the globe. You can see our MAP '25 initiatives having tremendous impact. We are improving working capital. We are improving margins. We are focused on driving a more favorable mix and whether it's operating improvement initiatives in our plants, whether it's taking some of the MS-168 disciplines into the commercial area. We're having a lot of success. You can see it clearly in our cash flow which is at meaningfully higher record levels. And so the things that we can control are working really well. One thing that we've talked about and makes sense when you look at the areas that we're focused on in MAP '25, when we have a return to unit volume growth in Specialty Products and Consumer, you'll see even better results out of those businesses, much like the real strong leverage we generated in Q3 with Performance Coatings and Construction Products, both of whom had positive unit volume growth in the quarter and we've had it throughout the year. So we're pretty excited about that. There will be a new program and it will be something that we will be talking about publicly either next spring or next summer, exactly what we call it. I couldn't tell you yet. But the MAP initiatives have a lot of legs, particularly on the commercial side and the data side. And there will be a new program and we will provide details, I would say, roughly a year from now. But in the interim, we're going to be focused on hitting the 42% gross margin goal and the 16% EBIT margin goal that we set out a few years ago.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dave Huang from Deutsche Bank.\nDavid Huang: I guess first in your project businesses in Construction and Performance Coatings. Can you talk about the competitive dynamic here. I think a lot of your peers indicated they're interesting further expanding the U.S. construction and manufacturing markets. I guess, do you expect any competitive pricing in the next few quarters where we could see some negative pricing for your businesses?\nFrank Sullivan: Broadly speaking, we've done a really good job of maintaining pricing. There have been a few exceptions, certain more commodity-like silicone sealants, where the underlying silicone chemicals have dropped dramatically from their peaks. It's been one area. There's been a few areas in our Consumer Group, where we literally bumped into some price elasticity and our understanding price levels on products that are interesting points in terms of continuing to drive Consumer takeaway. We're not seeing roughly speaking, with the exception of more commodity-type chemicals that have peaked dramatically a year ago, 1.5 years ago and have come down significantly since. Other than those areas, we're not seeing significant price reductions. I will tell you that the -- and you can read this, the level of inflation has dropped dramatically and we are seeing a stabilization of raw materials for the most part. And there are some commodity chemicals that have dropped meaningfully and that's the one area where we have also dropped some prices while still maintaining pretty good margins. Inflation is happening in a few categories, as I mentioned, in conversations about our comments about our Consumer Group and inflation is continuing at a more moderate pace but still up when it comes to salaries, benefits, hourly wages and categories like insurance.\nDavid Huang: And then, I guess on fixed cost absorption. I think last year, in Q3, you had $20 million headwind. I guess, at the company level, is there additional headwind this quarter? And I guess assuming you're closely be done with inventory rightsizing and assuming sales volume to be flat next year. What kind of leverage, I guess, would you have from fixed costs in FY '25 versus FY '24?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes, I'd like to have Rusty Gordon answer the question about absorption and its impact on us now and the inventory reduction programs that we have been pursuing internally pretty aggressively, its impact on results and how he thinks about that. Rusty?\nRussell Gordon: Yes, sure. We have, again, suffered from poor absorption, David, especially in our SPG and Consumer groups where volumes are dropping. On top of that, like Matt mentioned, we dropped our working capital ratio year-over-year by 580 basis points, much of that through inventory which you can see on the balance sheet. So that's continued. And you can really see in our PCG and CPG results where volumes are growing, the kind of leverage we get. We've still gotten great leverage in the Consumer segment due to a lot of their MAP activity and that will continue to help RPM through this under-absorption issue but really pronounced at SPG and Consumer.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets.\nJohn McNulty: So I wanted to dig into Consumer a little bit. So it looks like you're on pace for basically a record margin for the year in Consumer and that's despite a pretty tough demand environment. So I guess, how should we think about the levers that you can still pull around some of the MAP improvements and the efficiencies there as we look kind of going forward over the next 12 months? Or is the next step up in margin really going to be completely dependent on the volumes picking back up and kind of getting back to more normalized Consumer takeaway? How should we think about that?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I'll provide some comments and maybe Rusty has a few thoughts as well. First of all, I don't believe we're at record margins for our Consumer Group. Those were achieved during the COVID period. And so -- even pre-COVID, I think we've got some ways to go. Our Consumer Group was hit the hardest by raw material inflation given some of the metal packaging and some of the chemical raw materials they deal with. And that has been a challenge. We are seeing significant leverage. We're at the point where price and commodity cycle are benefiting us the most, although we're starting to see some raw material pickups like acetone that I mentioned. So that's a head scratcher. But the leverage and improvements that we've achieved in our Consumer segment has been significant. I mentioned on our prior call that we have uncovered tens of millions of unit and excess capacity just through efficiency. We are doing something pretty unique because of the significant improvements in Consumer. Historically, on the asset base we have, we would build inventory in February and March for the spring and summer months. In fact, last year and this year, internally, we're continuing to reduce inventory as we've developed a much more efficient operation that can meet supply and demand. Our fill rates are back up to the high 90% range. And so the improvements we've made there are really impressive and really dramatic. And you sure can't see them when your unit volume is declining in the low single digits. So when we get back to positive unit volume growth, I think you'll see the benefits of the MAP initiatives that are as meaningful at Consumer as they are, for instance, the Construction Products or Performance Coatings. But because so much of the benefits are tied to manufacturing efficiencies, they don't show up until you sell something.\nRussell Gordon: Yes, that's right, Frank. A lot of the MAP savings have been masked and under-absorption has been pronounced at Consumers since volumes have been declining. There's at least 200 basis points a quarter, I could point to this year for the impact of under-absorption caused not just by lower sales volumes but the conscious effort to reduce inventory.\nFrank Sullivan: But the underlying performance improvement, particularly in our plants is really remarkable. And I think it will show up when we get to a better unit volume environment.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. Okay. And then, I guess, just a second one, maybe a little bit farther out but you're making some decent investments in trying to drive the Asian business and you've got some new plants already that are coming on. I guess how are you tackling that in terms of gaining market share and brand awareness for a space that you don't have as big of a presence as you do, say, in the U.S. or Europe or even Latin America. So I guess, how should we be thinking about that? And how are you kind of looking at the growth opportunities there?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I'll make a few comments and then Matt Schlarb can add to that. As part of our MAP '25 initiative and really going back to the original MAP program, we recognize that our efforts, particularly in the developing world, we're not very effective. We had too many small operations, did some small acquisitions to have kind of a starting footprint. But because these were small and faraway operations, we didn't pay much attention to them. So we weren't having good traction. We have an exceptional management team in South Africa that because of the unique nature of that market both South Africa and Africa became a platform for multiple RPM products. And their success led to our decision as part of the MAP initiatives to put the Middle East, India and Southeast Asia from the Asian markets underneath that leadership team and really take an RPM platform approach to the developing world. And as you could see on Slide 5, in the PowerPoint slides that we teamed up with for this -- for our prepared remarks, really strong sales growth. And as you could imagine, equally impressive earnings growth in these geographies. And that's all as a result of kind of a restructuring and rethinking of how we could better approach growth in these developing parts of the world. Lastly, I'll tell you with an approach that seems to be working the fact that we're relatively small, makes me believe there's a ton of opportunity for continued growth. Matt, do you want to add anything to that?\nMatthew Schlarb: I'll just add one thing to John's question about the brand. So within PCG and CPG, our brands are well-known globally, particularly amongst multinational corporations who are making investments in Southeast Asia and India. But there's certainly room to grow those brands. So opening of those facilities there just allows us more responsive to our customers and it also helps with the shipping costs and get them the products that they need because we see investments in that part of the world and particularly in infrastructure and manufacturing CapEx continuing.\nFrank Sullivan: Yes. So they'll drive lower cost and higher service levels than typically what we've been able to generate from a mostly North American or European manufacturing base.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Sison from Wells Fargo.\nMichael Sison: Nice quarter. Frank, it seems to me you've done everything within your control to get to the sort of 42% gross margin goal, 16% EBIT margin goal. How much volume do you think you need to get to sort of get there? And maybe just any thoughts on what type of recovery you need to see in existing home sales, in DIY, to sort of put you on that to get you closer to those goals?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I'll make two comments on that as we approach fiscal '25. One is we expect to see and we will need a recovery in our Specialty Products group. This group even adjusting out the Guardian warranty business was a mid- to upper single digit -- I'm sorry, mid- to upper double digits. So mid-teens to upper teens EBIT margin business. And I would expect us to get back there over time and that recovery has got to happen in fiscal '25. We will see a return to positive Consumer takeaway sometime in fiscal '25. I don't think we have a good sense of when and we'll provide, I think, a better view of that when we talk about '25 in July. Lastly, as folks have noted, we've been making some significant investments in SG&A, for instance, around developing this RPM platform approach for the developed world which are -- developing world which is paying off and some of our MS-168 and CS-168. In case of CS-168, smart pricing initiatives. We've added people in different categories. In fiscal '25, I think you'll see a very deliberate approach to balancing SG&A spend and reallocating SG&A to things that are really growing and addressing some SG&A spend that's been very deliberate over the last 2 or 3 years. But if there's areas where it's not paying off, then we will tackle that. And so those are the elements that I see and that we will need for our MAP '25 goals.\nMichael Sison: Got it. And a quick follow-up. In Consumer Group, you mentioned market share gains. Any particular areas or customer sets? And then if things don't recover robustly in '25. With those market share gains, could you still turn the corner in volume growth for Consumer Group?\nFrank Sullivan: Matt, do you want to talk about some of the market share gains and new product introductions that we've had?\nMatthew Schlarb: Sure, sure. Happy to. So as Frank already mentioned this on the call but DAP introduced a new one component, wall and cavity foam insulation spray. We've had share gains. It's actually been pretty broad-based. We've had several share gains at automotive retailers. We've had some specialty retailers. And looking at product categories, you may remember, we acquired Ali Industries which makes Gator sand paper a few years ago and they've had some nice gains at home improvement retailers over the past several quarters as well. So it's a pretty broad-based strength in terms of its market share gains. But it's really a trend we've been seeing since we got through the supply chain challenges several quarters ago.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov from KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nAleksey Yefremov: Frank, just to come back to Consumer, I guess, how should we think about potential volume recovery or snapback? Is that volumes are down low single digit, so you'll get that back and then maybe the market is growing low singles or whenever that comes or is it some bigger number?\nFrank Sullivan: No, I think it's a steady return to normal Consumer takeaway combined with the volume driven by some new product introductions that Matt just talked about. We don't see any huge snapback per se but we will be rounding easier comparisons as we get into fiscal '25 when we really started to see Consumer takeaway. I think some of this is a long tail rebalancing from the boom in COVID. And I think some of it is the simple fact that in manufacturing. And again, we've talked about this in past quarters, while broadly speaking, perhaps we're avoiding a major recession. The manufacturing sector has gone through a rolling recession. Anything that touched housing has gone through a rolling recession and things that are driven by housing turnover have gone through a rolling recession. So we see that in our core Specialty Products Group that manufacturers wood, paints, finishes and things that go into kitchen cabinets and doors and windows and RVs and all kinds of things that are housing related. You can see that in other companies that manufacture goods that are in there. The housing turnover is starting to perk up which is a good thing for both our Specialty Products Group and our Consumer Group. Because housing turnover tends to drive some of our Consumer takeaway. And as was noted by just a few months ago, broadly, we're at a 30-year low in the United States for housing turnover. So that's been a challenging dynamic. I think all those things are moving in the right direction and then you'll start to see what's been consistently over the last fiscal year, negative Consumer takeaway in the low to mid-single digits, slowly turn into a positive number in terms of unit volume that would be low single digits, be nice if it was higher but there's no big boom that we foresee in terms of some huge snapback in volume.\nAleksey Yefremov: And then across your product lines, not just in Consumer but to have clients like Nudura, there is probably more optimism around new residential construction, not immediately but later this year or into even next calendar year. So in these areas, do you see any more optimism as far as your product takeaway or backlogs or anything like that?\nFrank Sullivan: Absolutely. We are performing really well in our Construction Products Group. Nudura specifically was not immune to the decline in residential new construction and the negative impact of interest rates both on construction and housing turnover. So that product line was hurt in last year. We're seeing those products, the Nudura products and projects grow. It was principally a residential product when we acquired it 5 years ago. Our Tremco Construction Products Group is now successfully targeting Nudura at the broad North American school market and we're having some successes there. So we're expanding what was primarily a residential new construction product line into some more commercial markets that we're excited about. Tremco is also relatively unique between Nudura and Dryvit. And the Tremco Sealants and putting together what they call a One Tremco package where they are working with architects and engineers to actually have specified an entire wall system. And so instead of having different components from different manufacturers that have different warranties or no warranties at all, we can put together a complete wall system and warrant the entire wall performance as opposed to individual components. So those are all dynamics that we've been working on and they are making good progress and momentum. And I think with a return of new construction residentially, a return of commercial construction which has also been down pretty significantly in the last 12 to 15 months, you'll see even better momentum in our Construction Products Group.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.\nJeff Zekauskas: Home Depot was buying SRS sort of building products and they have Specialty and Roofing. Is that something which is positive for RPM, or negative or it really doesn't matter?\nFrank Sullivan: I don't think at this stage, it matters. We have certainly good relationship with Home Depot and they are our largest customer. And so if there's opportunities for us to explore what that might mean, we'd be excited about it. But as I just mentioned relative to the previous question, most of our products are specified into schools, into universities, into hospitals. So they're highly specialized, particularly, as you know, in our stone hard flooring but in this case, Tremco Roofing. We do a lot of our own application, either outright or as the general manager -- general contractor on a major project. So not a lot of our products in the Roofing segment are sold through distribution. That does not mean that there's an opportunity in the future that we could explore to expand some of our product ranges more broadly into distribution. But at the current time, there's not a real -- it's not a positive or negative because of the nature of how we go to market versus people that have more commodity type products that go to market through distribution today.\nJeff Zekauskas: In response to an earlier question, you said that there were parts of the PPG business that might be interesting to RPM. Does that mean the whole business is not interesting to RPM?\nFrank Sullivan: Again, it's an odd circumstance where we normally wouldn't comment on M&A activity, except for the fact that this is very much in our space and a very much of a public announcement. It's our understanding that detailed material will be forthcoming in some weeks or months whenever it comes out. We have a sincere interest in looking at the entirety of what might be for sale. But there are certainly brands, pieces and parts that we would have a real interest in and could integrate. But Jeff, I can't answer that question in any detail because we have yet to see any detail.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Byrne from Bank of America.\nStephen Byrne: Your cost of goods in the quarter looked like they were down 6% or 7% on an absolute dollar value year-over-year. Can you rank the drivers of that decline between lower volumes in Consumer Specialty, lower raw material costs and the third bucket being MAP 2025. What would you -- how would you allocate the drivers of the lower COGS?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I'll let Rusty provide some color on that as well. I think, broadly speaking, it's a combination of cost price mix and our MAP initiatives. Some of it is a function of our very deliberate efforts of driving and incentivizing sales forces towards a higher margin mix, particularly in CPG and PCG. It's the benefits of our MAP initiatives on higher unit volume. But beyond that, I don't know if, Rusty, do you have any additional color you'd like to add.\nRussell Gordon: Yes. I would peg it exactly that. It's a combination of selling price increases which were modest but nevertheless, helpful across all segments. We did have deflation, plus right up there is the MAP savings. We're going to save incrementally this year, about $100 million that varies by quarter. We're in a obvious seasonal low quarter in the third quarter this year but that was very impactful, too.\nFrank Sullivan: Yes. And as Rusty mentioned earlier, a meaningful amount, tens of millions of dollars of our MAP savings have been undercut or masked by the under-absorption, particularly Consumer in a number of our Specialty Products Group companies.\nStephen Byrne: And Frank, I have a structural question for you. You look at Consumer -- pardon me, Construction Products and Performance Coatings, there's so much overlap between those segments in the products, the end markets that they sell into these new plants you're building in Malaysia and India will cover both. You have some businesses that switched from one to the other. A broad question for you and that is could you drive more cost synergies and maybe cross-selling by combining those segments?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I appreciate the question. First of all, throughout our history on a very thoughtful, long-term strategic perspective. RPM has been willing to adjust our structure. If you go back 24 years ago, we moved from really a true holding company with 40 or 50 independent business units into a 6-group structure that served RPM and our customers and shareholders as well for about 15 years. As we initiated the MAP 2020 program in 2018, we reorganized into 4 groups. That reorganization has really driven meaningful synergy and cooperation amongst our businesses even across the 4 groups in their various business units to a greater extent than what existed in our 6-group structure. So I think we're very committed to our current 4-group structure, certainly through the MAP 2025 period. And as I answered an earlier question, I think we will look this time next year, long term to think, all right, what's the next initiative for RPM. And whether it's a year from now or 10 years from now, the idea that we would look at our structure and do something different, it made sense. It's certainly something that we've proven in the past we're willing to do and we certainly would do in the future when it's appropriate. Specific to the Construction Products Group and the Performance Coatings Group, I think there are some significant differences between the end-use markets of the Performance Coatings Group which tend to be heavy industry and more infrastructure related and the Construction Products Group tends to be more construction markets and new home construction, commercial construction. The overlap today is pretty much the infrastructure area. And certainly, we have good levels of cooperation. That's also been enhanced by $1 trillion plus or federal stimulus that's just beginning to play out and so we'll see that continue. But at this stage, we don't have any plans to change that structure if it made sense. As we've done in the past, we would do it again in the future. I would add one more thing to that which is as long as these 2 segments with really good leaders and leadership are continuing to pile out positive unit volume despite some choppy economics and generate margin expansion and the solid EBIT growth year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, we would be very hesitant to adjust something that's working exceedingly well. And there's good momentum in both.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners.\nKevin McCarthy: Frank, a question for you on cash flow and specifically working capital. I think a couple of quarters ago, you had signaled potential to reduce your ratio of trade working capital to sales by maybe 300 basis points or so. And as of this morning, it looks like you're running a 580 basis points down. So really nice progress there. I guess my question would be, if you look out over the next 6 to 12 months, is there additional opportunity to extract cash from working capital? Or have you just about rightsized inventory and the other line items at this point?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes. I'll let Rusty add some commentary to that as well. But our MAP initiatives on the MS-168 side in particular are continuing. That's a never-ending effort of continuous improvement. And I think one of the -- I hope people appreciate one of the more significant benefits of our MAP initiatives beyond the metrics that we've improved in the cash flow numbers and the margins is the cultural change at RPM. And it's really in 2 areas. There's a level of I think cooperation and communication across our groups and businesses that didn't exist before. And there is a mindset of a lean manufacturing, continuous improvement approach that, as I mentioned earlier, isn't maybe new to the world but it's new to RPM, it's really taking hold and that's a cultural change that's paid huge dividends for us. Specific to the cash flow and working capital metrics, I'll let Rusty add his thoughts.\nRussell Gordon: Yes. I would say that when it comes to inventory, that was clearly our biggest opportunity to get better when we compare RPM to peers. And Kevin, I would say that we're good at some of our businesses but I'd still say more than half our businesses have plenty of room to improve in sales and operational planning so that we only make the stock that's needed by our customers and not much more.\nKevin McCarthy: And then secondly, I want to come back to Specialty Products. If you look at the big picture, do you think that the fiscal third quarter margin levels that you just posted are likely to be a durable trough level? And then related to that, I was a little surprised that the fourth quarter sales guide in Specialty Products, just given how much easier your comparison is versus the fourth quarter of last year. I heard your comments on lack of Disaster Restoration business. Is there anything else going on there, perhaps on a sequential basis, that would cause your sales to be running down mid-singles into the end of the fiscal year?\nFrank Sullivan: So about half of our Specialty Products Group is our OEM Coatings and the Industrial Coatings OEM piece of our businesses, highly tied to indirectly but to new home disruption, also a significant share in RV -- in the RV market which boomed during COVID. And because of that, it's been very, very soft. And so those dynamics are also impacting our Specialty Products Group. I believe that Q3 is the low point of performance for our Specialty Products Group and you will be seeing sequential improvement, both as we get into Q4 and as we get into fiscal '25.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi from Baird.\nGhansham Panjabi: Frank, as we kind of think about fiscal '24, obviously, Construction and Performance had outstanding volume years at least so far. And then price cost was obviously a big driver of margin expansion as well. Just based on your comments that some of the commodity input costs seem to have inflected a little bit, certainly in Consumer and then, of course, oil is up a bit. Is it fair to assume that margin expansion in '25 will be led by productivity and just better fixed cost and operating leverage and just some sort of a reversion back in Consumer? And then also, how should we think about construction and performance for fiscal year '25 in terms of difficult comparisons and so on, on a year-over-year basis?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I guess I'll refer back to some earlier comments and your presumption is correct. A) We expect to see margin expansion; B) It's going to be more driven by the leverage of unit volume growth to our bottom line and the MAP efficiencies that we've gained over the last 3 or 4 years and certainly over the last 1.5 years. So we see margin expansion but it will be driven -- will need to be driven by positive unit volume growth. And we're pretty certain we'll see that in Consumer in fiscal '25. I think we'll have a better sense of when that might be when we report our fourth quarter results and really talk in more detail about '25. Good momentum in Construction Products, good momentum in our Performance Coatings Group which we don't see changing and recovery in Specialty Products. So those are the things that will do it. But your presumption of your question is absolutely correct. You're going to see margin expansion more driven by the benefits of our MAP initiatives on higher volume levels than on any cost price mix impact. And as we highlighted, even in this quarter, I think we're at the third quarter kind of the peak of the benefits from commodity cycle, price on a year-over-year price on a consolidated basis is up 1% which is obviously sequentially down from over the last 4, 5 quarters. So it's going to be the good work that we've been done leveraging on higher unit volumes.\nGhansham Panjabi: And then for the second question, in terms of the emerging markets which were pretty solid throughout, what do you attribute that towards? I mean, I know comparisons are a little bit easier in some cases but is this just fundamental improvement? And you also mentioned some changes you made in terms of how you approach those markets internally as well.\nFrank Sullivan: Leadership matters everywhere and we've got really good leaders now in our developing regions throughout the South Africa, Middle East, Asia Pacific. It's taken us a while to really focus on a strategy that is leverageable and sustainable and we have one. And so we're pretty excited about it. Our acquisition approach was not working for a decade plus and acquiring small businesses and not giving them the resources are paying enough attention to them. So the performance you're seeing here is principally organic. It's a better structure, better leadership and a better focus. It will continue to be organic, as you see from our first-ever meaningful manufacturing, greenfield manufacturing investments in these regions and we'll fill up those plants pretty quickly. And so that strategy is going to continue for the next couple of years. And as we begin to get critical mass, we'll get back to the point where we can acquire a business but integrate it and make it part of this strategy as opposed to have a small business that's far away and not paid much attention to. So it's an area that we're pretty excited about. And was a key element of our MAP initiatives in terms of how we would be organized to be successful.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets.\nArun Viswanathan: Congrats on the strong progress. If we look at fiscal '24, it looks like Construction Products Group and Performance Coatings drove a large part of the gains this year with Consumer kind of offsetting Specialty. And then if I look into kind of fiscal '25, wanted to get your thoughts on maybe how those segments would play out. It does appear that maybe we're seeing a little bit of slowing momentum in Construction Products and Performance Coatings or at least some catch-up there but that could be offset by Consumer coming back and maybe Specialty as well. Is that how you're thinking about it? And I guess if that is the case, is it mainly MAP gains that would be kind of driving those dynamics? Or how do you kind of think about how your earnings growth is shaping up as you look out in the next couple of quarters?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. The fourth quarter guidance that we provided related to Construction Products and Performance Coatings is as much about the timing of the completion of some major projects and we will provide this detail in July. But when you look at the second half of fiscal '24 on a consolidated basis, I mentioned this earlier, you'll see sales on a consolidated basis, flat up 1% and EBIT up, let's say, 13% to 14%. That's based upon the results we reported today and the guidance that we provided for fiscal fourth quarter here in '24. When we look back at the second half of the Performance Coatings Group and Construction Products Group, you're going to see just really solid good unit volume growth and good performance. It's being masked a little bit by these project completions at the end of Q3 which will inhibit a little bit of our growth in Q4. We don't see any slowdown in the solid performance and momentum of those 2 segments as we go into the summer months. And as I mentioned earlier, I think we've hit bottom on our Specialty Products Group. And we will start around easier comps, along with a real focus in our Consumer Group on new product introductions and operating efficiencies that will allow us to serve customers at a very high level. So I think we see good trends as we go into fiscal '25 but the impact will be more as a result of MAP initiatives because the deflation elements and the pricing elements will be coming to an end as we get through the fourth quarter and get into the summer months.\nArun Viswanathan: Great. That's helpful. And then, yes, if I could just ask another question, I guess, on capital allocation. You guys have done a great job of bringing your leverage down and obviously, that has accreted to the equity side. At this point and in the past, you've often kind of favored smaller bolt-on deals. So is there an opportunity now to pursue something larger, given the changes in the organization and the ability to integrate maybe some larger properties? And if so, would you be open to taking on some extra leverage to do that?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. Yes, I appreciate the question. We will continue and actually have a decent pipeline of small- to medium-sized acquisitions that we will integrate and add to the strategies of our different companies and segments. So that I would expect to continue. Particularly in our Consumer Group and our Construction Products Group where we are more integrated than other parts of RPM, I think we are in a position to take on larger acquisitions and really drive synergies that are required to be competitive from a price perspective in those. And we have throughout my 30-plus career at RPM, been very fine with using our balance sheet. And so I think we've got tons of leverage. We've got a stronger cash flow than we've ever had and we would be willing to use our balance sheet right up to maintaining our investment-grade rating. And so there is plenty of room between cash flow and debt capacity to do larger transactions if we can find them at a price that works for us.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.\nSteven Haynes: This is Steven Haynes on for Vincent. Just wanted to come back to a comment you made on SG&A earlier. I think in your MAP targets, you're kind of looking for 26% of sales for SG&A. And right now, when you kind of adjust for all the onetime costs, I think you're running like 200 basis points or so above that. You're also doing better on gross margin. But just wanted to just like within the broader framework of the MAP program is 26% still kind of the right way to be thinking about your SG&A spend.\nFrank Sullivan: Yes, it is.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Frank Sullivan for any closing remarks.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you, Jamie and thank you to everybody for your participation on our investor call today. Through the first 9 months of the year, we demonstrated our ability to expand margins and increase cash flow despite some economic challenges, particularly for our Consumer and Specialty Products Group. We look forward to building momentum in those 2 segments and continuing the good momentum in our Construction Products Group and Performance Coatings Group as we enter our fourth quarter in the summer months of our new fiscal year. In July, we'll provide the details of our FY 2024 fourth quarter which we expect to be our tenth consecutive quarter of record sales and earnings performance and to provide any comments on our outlook for our fiscal 2025. Thanks again for participating in our call and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. We do thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "content": "Thanks, Matt. Our fourth quarter and full year outlooks are on Slide 13. On a consolidated level, fourth quarter sales are expected to be approximately flat compared to a record prior year period. CPG is expected to lead growth with sales up low to mid-single digits, driven by demand for solutions serving infrastructure and institutional projects and its focus on restoration and maintenance. After multiple years of achieving record sales, PCG sales are expected to be approximately flat in the fourth quarter. This is primarily due to the timing of project completions, including some that were pulled forward into the third quarter. Additionally, PCG's results will be impacted by a previously announced business divestiture. SPG sales are expected to decline in the mid-single-digit percentage range as the disaster restoration business remains challenged, while specialty OEM markets stabilize, albeit at low levels. In Consumer, market share gains are expected to be more than offset by continued softness in DIY demand, resulting in sales declining in the mid-single-digit range. With these continued share gains, we believe we are poised to achieve accelerated growth when existing home sales and DIY markets ultimately recover. Consolidated fourth quarter adjusted EBIT is expected to increase in the high single-digit percentage range compared to a record prior year period driven by MAP 2025 benefits which are being partially offset by under-absorption from lower volumes. Finally, our full year guidance is at the bottom of Slide 13. We anticipate that full fiscal year sales growth will be near the midpoint of our previous guidance of up low single digits and adjusted EBIT growth will be near the midpoint of our previous guidance of up low double digits to mid-teens. This concludes our prepared comments. We will now be pleased to answer your questions. Yes. In terms of Specialty performance in the quarter, we really did not have any disaster restoration business to speak of, Mike, during the quarter. No weather events really drove sales. So as a result, we really suffered from under-absorption. We continue year-over-year to have an unfavorable comparison like we did in the second quarter and that we divested our furniture warranty business. And then in general, OEM volumes looks soft, not as bad as it's been. It's getting a little bit better. So we do have some reason to hope that, that will improve. Yes, sure. We have, again, suffered from poor absorption, David, especially in our SPG and Consumer groups where volumes are dropping. On top of that, like Matt mentioned, we dropped our working capital ratio year-over-year by 580 basis points, much of that through inventory which you can see on the balance sheet. So that's continued. And you can really see in our PCG and CPG results where volumes are growing, the kind of leverage we get. We've still gotten great leverage in the Consumer segment due to a lot of their MAP activity and that will continue to help RPM through this under-absorption issue but really pronounced at SPG and Consumer. Yes, that's right, Frank. A lot of the MAP savings have been masked and under-absorption has been pronounced at Consumers since volumes have been declining. There's at least 200 basis points a quarter, I could point to this year for the impact of under-absorption caused not just by lower sales volumes but the conscious effort to reduce inventory. Yes. I would peg it exactly that. It's a combination of selling price increases which were modest but nevertheless, helpful across all segments. We did have deflation, plus right up there is the MAP savings. We're going to save incrementally this year, about $100 million that varies by quarter. We're in a obvious seasonal low quarter in the third quarter this year but that was very impactful, too. Yes. I would say that when it comes to inventory, that was clearly our biggest opportunity to get better when we compare RPM to peers. And Kevin, I would say that we're good at some of our businesses but I'd still say more than half our businesses have plenty of room to improve in sales and operational planning so that we only make the stock that's needed by our customers and not much more."

            "name": "Michael Laroche",
            "content": "Thanks, Frank. Starting on Slide 6. Consolidated organic sales increased 0.9%, driven by positive volumes at Construction Products Group and Performance Coatings Group as well as higher pricing in all segments. FX was 0.4% headwind to revenue. MAP 2025 benefits, including the commodity cycle drove adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 170 basis points, improved fixed cost leverage at Construction Products Group and Performance Coatings Group also contributed to better margins. As Frank mentioned, we are investing in initiatives to accelerate organic growth and this contributed to an increase in SG&A during the quarter. Incentives to sell higher-margin products and inflation and wages and benefits also added to the SG&A increase. We continue to selectively raise prices at businesses with the most pronounced inflationary pressures and took expense reduction actions at the end of fiscal year 2023 to help mitigate the SG&A rise. Adjusted EPS increased 40.5% to $0.52 which was a third quarter record and was driven by the adjusted EBIT growth. Interest expense declined in the quarter due to a $629 million debt reduction over the prior year as a result of record cash flow and this contributed to the adjusted EPS increase as well. Now turning to the segment results. Starting with Construction Products Group on Slide 7. Third quarter sales were a record and growth was led by concrete admixtures which continued to benefit from reshoring and infrastructure projects, including in Latin America. The segment also generated growth from increased demand for high-performance buildings and market share gains. The rise in adjusted EBIT was led by MAP 2025 benefits driving a favorable product mix and improved fixed cost leverage from volume growth. On Slide 8, Performance Coatings Group achieved record sales, once again driven by the demand for engineered solutions serving reshoring projects, including favorable timing of some project completions as well as market share gains. The businesses in Africa, Middle East and Asia Pacific that were recently aligned under the Performance Group -- Performance Coatings Group management contributed to the segment's growth driven by RPM's engineered solutions focused on infrastructure projects. Adjusted EBIT was a third quarter record, driven by sales growth, favorable mix and improved fixed cost leverage that was enhanced by MAP 2025. Moving to Slide 9. Specialty Products Group sales declined primarily due to challenging comparisons to the prior year period for the disaster restoration business, when it benefited from the response to freeze-related flooding which should not recur to the same extent this year. The divestiture of the noncore furniture warranty business also contributed to the sales decline. After several quarters of weakness, specialty OEM markets began showing signs of stabilization during the quarter. The reduction in adjusted EBIT was driven by the sales and volumes decline in the disaster restoration business which resulted in unfavorable absorption as well as the divestiture of the noncore furniture warranty business. SPG also continued strategic investments in long-term growth initiatives which were partially offset by expense reduction actions taken at the end of fiscal 2023. On Slide 10, the Consumer Group was pressured by weaker takeaway at retail stores from DIY customers, customers maintaining lean inventories and the rationalization of lower-margin products. Market share gains partially offset the decline in volumes. MAP 2025 initiatives and the rationalization of lower-margin products resulted in margin expansion which was partially offset by under-absorption associated with lower volumes and higher expenses from wages and benefits. Now, I'll turn the call over to Matt who will cover the balance sheet and cash flows and provide an update on emerging markets."

            "name": "Frank Sullivan",
            "content": "Thank you, Matt and thank you to everybody for participating on our call today. I'll start with a high-level review of our third quarter results. Then I'll turn the call over to Mike Laroche to discuss the financials in more detail. Matt will then provide an update on the balance sheet on organic growth investments in emerging markets and Rusty will cover our outlook for the balance of the year. At the end of the prepared remarks, we'll be pleased to answer your questions. I'll begin on Slide 3 with our third quarter results. In addition to our strategic balance and focus on repair and maintenance, positive momentum with our MAP 2025 operational improvement initiatives continued in the third quarter which generated our ninth consecutive quarter of record sales and EBIT results. Margins expanded and we had our fourth consecutive quarter of record cash from operations. During this trailing 12-month period, we generated $1,260 million in cash flow from operating activities far exceeding any previous 12-month period in RPM's history. Much of this has been driven by improvements in working capital which has been a particular area of focus with our MAP 2025 initiatives. Turning to Slide 4. Sales growth was led by our Construction Products Group and our Performance Coatings Group. These segments benefited from their focus on repair and maintenance as well as their ability to serve strong demand from infrastructure, reshoring and high-performance building projects with their engineered solutions. Favorable timing of some project completions, particularly in the Performance Coatings Group contributed to sales growth in Q3. Due to challenging market conditions, volume declines in the Consumer and Specialty Products segments continued. Consumer was negatively impacted by lower DIY takeaway and retail customers who continue to tightly manage inventory levels, partially offset by market share gains. While volumes declined in the Specialty Products Group due primarily to challenging comparisons in the Legend Brands disaster restoration business, there were signs of stabilization in our core specialty OEM markets. As expected, pricing was positive in all segments as we catch up with inflation, including continued inflation in wages, benefits and insurance. On a consolidated basis, pricing during the quarter was up approximately 1% quarter-over-quarter. We achieved record adjusted EBIT as our MAP 2025 benefit inclusive of the commodity cycle recovery drove a 170 basis point improvement in margins. MAP 2025 initiatives were a benefit to all businesses, particularly those that generated positive unit volume growth. It is imperative that throughout cycles we invest in initiatives to leverage our entrepreneurial spirit and generate volume growth that will allow us to fully realize the benefits from the MAP initiatives we have put in place. Some recent examples include capacity expansions, increasing R&D spending through the establishment of our Innovation Center of Excellence and improving our data-driven decision-making capabilities. We are also expanding our sales forces and training them to increase sales of higher-margin products as well as introducing new products such as DAP, one component wall and cavity spray foam which is helping us win market share this spring. Moving to Slide 5. The positive momentum from improved coordination outside the United States continued in the third quarter, emerging markets led growth for the company as a result of RPM's heavy emphasis on engineered solutions for infrastructure investments in these geographies. In Europe, we are taking share with our focused sales strategy. After excluding the impacts of a divested business, sales in the region were roughly flat despite macroeconomic pressures in several economies. And our focus on implementing MAP 2025 initiatives in the region generated strong EBIT margin improvement. Overall, I'm proud of our associates' continued commitment to our MAP 2025 program which has consistently generated efficiencies, higher levels of cash flow and record results. We remain focused on expanding margins, accelerating organic growth and improving cash flow to achieve our MAP 2025 targets. I'll now turn the call over to Mike Laroche to cover our third quarter financial results in more detail. Sure. So we expect a continuation in Q4 of what you have seen in Q3 and for most of fiscal '24, with continuing relative strength in Construction Products and Performance Coatings and some challenges in the Consumer segment and Specialty Products Group particularly in relationship in the Consumer segment to a very strong fourth quarter last year. I would expect we're going to start to see an improvement and Consumer takeaway and a return of volume as we get into fiscal '25. Sure. So we see momentum continuing for both our Performance Coatings Group and our Construction Products Group into Q4 as well as into fiscal '25. It's worth noting that the Construction Products Group performance has been despite a lot of weakness in the core non-commercial, core commercial construction products market, certainly been relatively weak. We picked that up in infrastructure as well as a lot of the projects that we referenced. And then look going forward, we're well positioned. Our backlogs are in good shape and quite candidly globally and this is broadly speaking. We're not through a fraction of the trillions of dollars of government stimulus, mostly in the United States but in other parts of the world, they're helping to drive this. And so whether it's the onshoring and/or friendshoring in Europe and in North America. We're pretty well-positioned to continue to win more than our fair share of those projects and we see that continuing for the coming quarters. Sure. I wouldn't comment on that any particular specificity. But our backlogs are good in Construction Products. Our Performance Coatings Group continues to see good momentum. We will have a little bit of a weaker fourth quarter as we projected, partly because of project completions. I think it's worth looking at the second half. If you include the guidance that we provided here, for all of RPM, second half of '24, the third quarter we just reported and the guidance that we reaffirmed relative to our full year would suggest sales growth on a consolidated basis at flat or plus 1% and adjusted EBIT growth in the 13% to 14% range. And I mentioned that because we had some acceleration or completion of projects at the end of Q3 that otherwise would have fallen into Q4 in Construction Products and Performance Coatings. But the backlog in both is really strong. It's an odd start for us and everybody in Q4 because of the way holidays fell, there were 3 less shipping days in March and there are 3 more shipping days in April. So we're also having some odd comparisons to prior years on a monthly basis. But in general, both of those segments are in really good shape and the dynamics that have led to record sales growth, positive unit volume growth and margin expansion feel like they're continuing. It is still our assumption and that's what we're experiencing. In fact, in particular, with our Consumer Group, we're starting to see some raw material upticks in a few select areas, acetone is up significantly. That is kind of an outlier. Propellants up a little bit. Plastic cartridges are up. And so we're seeing some return of inflation or pricing in a few categories that particularly impact our Consumer Group. But overall, we are at the point at which I think the commodity cycle recovery is what we're experiencing. We'll see a little bit of that in Q4. And then I think time will tell as we look out into our new fiscal year. I will let Rusty Gordon handle that question about both the Specialty Products Group performance in the quarter and year-to-date and kind of where we see it going. And then I would add to that, Mike, that the impact of weather-related events last year was very significant in Q3. We don't have exactly that same challenge comparatively in Q4. And the Guardian warranty business which was really not core to us, it was an insurance business and had nothing to do with products was a very high-margin business and that was sold last year in the third quarter. And so again, we will not be seeing the negative comparison of that when we get into the fourth quarter as well. So as Mike Laroche commented, we're starting to see in the core OEM coatings categories, things flattening out. And we won't have the same big challenging comparisons of the Guardian divestiture or the significant weather-related events at Legend Brands that have impacted Q3. Sure. Other than reemphasizing some comments that we've already made which I'll do in a minute, we're not really prepared to provide guidance for fiscal '25 with any detail. We will do that when we report fourth quarter results in July and then we'll provide some more detail for how we see fiscal '25 shaking out. The comments that we have made are, we're going to be rounding easier comparisons as we just talked about in our Specialty Products Group. I think at some point, as we get into fiscal '25, we're going to see both easier comparisons and some market share-related wins, some positive unit volume growth coming back to our Consumer segment. And we see continued good momentum in the economic and market and infrastructure dynamics that we've been talking about for Construction Products and Performance Coatings. So we are planning on our tenth consecutive quarter of record sales and earnings in Q4. And I think we've gotten some good dynamics as we go into fiscal '25 but we'll provide more details on a consolidated basis and broadly by segment when we report Q4 in July. We generally don't comment about our acquisition activity until things are done. Certainly, M&A is picking up and it was publicly announced that the -- I believe it's about $1.8 billion in revenue, PPG architectural -- North American Architectural Coatings business is going to be sold, divested or realigned. And so I think like anybody in the paint and coatings interest industry, we have some interest in pieces and parts and we certainly intend to be part of any process and take a look at that. And that's more of the specifics that we generally would provide but it's relatively unique that a divestiture process like this would be announced publicly and has been. And so we'll take a look at it. That's a great question. And I think we're highly focused on achieving our MAP 2025 targets. And if you look at our performance through 9 months, I'm really proud of the incredible work of the RPM associates around the globe. You can see our MAP '25 initiatives having tremendous impact. We are improving working capital. We are improving margins. We are focused on driving a more favorable mix and whether it's operating improvement initiatives in our plants, whether it's taking some of the MS-168 disciplines into the commercial area. We're having a lot of success. You can see it clearly in our cash flow which is at meaningfully higher record levels. And so the things that we can control are working really well. One thing that we've talked about and makes sense when you look at the areas that we're focused on in MAP '25, when we have a return to unit volume growth in Specialty Products and Consumer, you'll see even better results out of those businesses, much like the real strong leverage we generated in Q3 with Performance Coatings and Construction Products, both of whom had positive unit volume growth in the quarter and we've had it throughout the year. So we're pretty excited about that. There will be a new program and it will be something that we will be talking about publicly either next spring or next summer, exactly what we call it. I couldn't tell you yet. But the MAP initiatives have a lot of legs, particularly on the commercial side and the data side. And there will be a new program and we will provide details, I would say, roughly a year from now. But in the interim, we're going to be focused on hitting the 42% gross margin goal and the 16% EBIT margin goal that we set out a few years ago. Broadly speaking, we've done a really good job of maintaining pricing. There have been a few exceptions, certain more commodity-like silicone sealants, where the underlying silicone chemicals have dropped dramatically from their peaks. It's been one area. There's been a few areas in our Consumer Group, where we literally bumped into some price elasticity and our understanding price levels on products that are interesting points in terms of continuing to drive Consumer takeaway. We're not seeing roughly speaking, with the exception of more commodity-type chemicals that have peaked dramatically a year ago, 1.5 years ago and have come down significantly since. Other than those areas, we're not seeing significant price reductions. I will tell you that the -- and you can read this, the level of inflation has dropped dramatically and we are seeing a stabilization of raw materials for the most part. And there are some commodity chemicals that have dropped meaningfully and that's the one area where we have also dropped some prices while still maintaining pretty good margins. Inflation is happening in a few categories, as I mentioned, in conversations about our comments about our Consumer Group and inflation is continuing at a more moderate pace but still up when it comes to salaries, benefits, hourly wages and categories like insurance. Yes, I'd like to have Rusty Gordon answer the question about absorption and its impact on us now and the inventory reduction programs that we have been pursuing internally pretty aggressively, its impact on results and how he thinks about that. Rusty? Sure. I'll provide some comments and maybe Rusty has a few thoughts as well. First of all, I don't believe we're at record margins for our Consumer Group. Those were achieved during the COVID period. And so -- even pre-COVID, I think we've got some ways to go. Our Consumer Group was hit the hardest by raw material inflation given some of the metal packaging and some of the chemical raw materials they deal with. And that has been a challenge. We are seeing significant leverage. We're at the point where price and commodity cycle are benefiting us the most, although we're starting to see some raw material pickups like acetone that I mentioned. So that's a head scratcher. But the leverage and improvements that we've achieved in our Consumer segment has been significant. I mentioned on our prior call that we have uncovered tens of millions of unit and excess capacity just through efficiency. We are doing something pretty unique because of the significant improvements in Consumer. Historically, on the asset base we have, we would build inventory in February and March for the spring and summer months. In fact, last year and this year, internally, we're continuing to reduce inventory as we've developed a much more efficient operation that can meet supply and demand. Our fill rates are back up to the high 90% range. And so the improvements we've made there are really impressive and really dramatic. And you sure can't see them when your unit volume is declining in the low single digits. So when we get back to positive unit volume growth, I think you'll see the benefits of the MAP initiatives that are as meaningful at Consumer as they are, for instance, the Construction Products or Performance Coatings. But because so much of the benefits are tied to manufacturing efficiencies, they don't show up until you sell something. But the underlying performance improvement, particularly in our plants is really remarkable. And I think it will show up when we get to a better unit volume environment. Sure. I'll make a few comments and then Matt Schlarb can add to that. As part of our MAP '25 initiative and really going back to the original MAP program, we recognize that our efforts, particularly in the developing world, we're not very effective. We had too many small operations, did some small acquisitions to have kind of a starting footprint. But because these were small and faraway operations, we didn't pay much attention to them. So we weren't having good traction. We have an exceptional management team in South Africa that because of the unique nature of that market both South Africa and Africa became a platform for multiple RPM products. And their success led to our decision as part of the MAP initiatives to put the Middle East, India and Southeast Asia from the Asian markets underneath that leadership team and really take an RPM platform approach to the developing world. And as you could see on Slide 5, in the PowerPoint slides that we teamed up with for this -- for our prepared remarks, really strong sales growth. And as you could imagine, equally impressive earnings growth in these geographies. And that's all as a result of kind of a restructuring and rethinking of how we could better approach growth in these developing parts of the world. Lastly, I'll tell you with an approach that seems to be working the fact that we're relatively small, makes me believe there's a ton of opportunity for continued growth. Matt, do you want to add anything to that? Yes. So they'll drive lower cost and higher service levels than typically what we've been able to generate from a mostly North American or European manufacturing base. Sure. I'll make two comments on that as we approach fiscal '25. One is we expect to see and we will need a recovery in our Specialty Products group. This group even adjusting out the Guardian warranty business was a mid- to upper single digit -- I'm sorry, mid- to upper double digits. So mid-teens to upper teens EBIT margin business. And I would expect us to get back there over time and that recovery has got to happen in fiscal '25. We will see a return to positive Consumer takeaway sometime in fiscal '25. I don't think we have a good sense of when and we'll provide, I think, a better view of that when we talk about '25 in July. Lastly, as folks have noted, we've been making some significant investments in SG&A, for instance, around developing this RPM platform approach for the developed world which are -- developing world which is paying off and some of our MS-168 and CS-168. In case of CS-168, smart pricing initiatives. We've added people in different categories. In fiscal '25, I think you'll see a very deliberate approach to balancing SG&A spend and reallocating SG&A to things that are really growing and addressing some SG&A spend that's been very deliberate over the last 2 or 3 years. But if there's areas where it's not paying off, then we will tackle that. And so those are the elements that I see and that we will need for our MAP '25 goals. Matt, do you want to talk about some of the market share gains and new product introductions that we've had? No, I think it's a steady return to normal Consumer takeaway combined with the volume driven by some new product introductions that Matt just talked about. We don't see any huge snapback per se but we will be rounding easier comparisons as we get into fiscal '25 when we really started to see Consumer takeaway. I think some of this is a long tail rebalancing from the boom in COVID. And I think some of it is the simple fact that in manufacturing. And again, we've talked about this in past quarters, while broadly speaking, perhaps we're avoiding a major recession. The manufacturing sector has gone through a rolling recession. Anything that touched housing has gone through a rolling recession and things that are driven by housing turnover have gone through a rolling recession. So we see that in our core Specialty Products Group that manufacturers wood, paints, finishes and things that go into kitchen cabinets and doors and windows and RVs and all kinds of things that are housing related. You can see that in other companies that manufacture goods that are in there. The housing turnover is starting to perk up which is a good thing for both our Specialty Products Group and our Consumer Group. Because housing turnover tends to drive some of our Consumer takeaway. And as was noted by just a few months ago, broadly, we're at a 30-year low in the United States for housing turnover. So that's been a challenging dynamic. I think all those things are moving in the right direction and then you'll start to see what's been consistently over the last fiscal year, negative Consumer takeaway in the low to mid-single digits, slowly turn into a positive number in terms of unit volume that would be low single digits, be nice if it was higher but there's no big boom that we foresee in terms of some huge snapback in volume. Absolutely. We are performing really well in our Construction Products Group. Nudura specifically was not immune to the decline in residential new construction and the negative impact of interest rates both on construction and housing turnover. So that product line was hurt in last year. We're seeing those products, the Nudura products and projects grow. It was principally a residential product when we acquired it 5 years ago. Our Tremco Construction Products Group is now successfully targeting Nudura at the broad North American school market and we're having some successes there. So we're expanding what was primarily a residential new construction product line into some more commercial markets that we're excited about. Tremco is also relatively unique between Nudura and Dryvit. And the Tremco Sealants and putting together what they call a One Tremco package where they are working with architects and engineers to actually have specified an entire wall system. And so instead of having different components from different manufacturers that have different warranties or no warranties at all, we can put together a complete wall system and warrant the entire wall performance as opposed to individual components. So those are all dynamics that we've been working on and they are making good progress and momentum. And I think with a return of new construction residentially, a return of commercial construction which has also been down pretty significantly in the last 12 to 15 months, you'll see even better momentum in our Construction Products Group. I don't think at this stage, it matters. We have certainly good relationship with Home Depot and they are our largest customer. And so if there's opportunities for us to explore what that might mean, we'd be excited about it. But as I just mentioned relative to the previous question, most of our products are specified into schools, into universities, into hospitals. So they're highly specialized, particularly, as you know, in our stone hard flooring but in this case, Tremco Roofing. We do a lot of our own application, either outright or as the general manager -- general contractor on a major project. So not a lot of our products in the Roofing segment are sold through distribution. That does not mean that there's an opportunity in the future that we could explore to expand some of our product ranges more broadly into distribution. But at the current time, there's not a real -- it's not a positive or negative because of the nature of how we go to market versus people that have more commodity type products that go to market through distribution today. Again, it's an odd circumstance where we normally wouldn't comment on M&A activity, except for the fact that this is very much in our space and a very much of a public announcement. It's our understanding that detailed material will be forthcoming in some weeks or months whenever it comes out. We have a sincere interest in looking at the entirety of what might be for sale. But there are certainly brands, pieces and parts that we would have a real interest in and could integrate. But Jeff, I can't answer that question in any detail because we have yet to see any detail. Sure. I'll let Rusty provide some color on that as well. I think, broadly speaking, it's a combination of cost price mix and our MAP initiatives. Some of it is a function of our very deliberate efforts of driving and incentivizing sales forces towards a higher margin mix, particularly in CPG and PCG. It's the benefits of our MAP initiatives on higher unit volume. But beyond that, I don't know if, Rusty, do you have any additional color you'd like to add. Yes. And as Rusty mentioned earlier, a meaningful amount, tens of millions of dollars of our MAP savings have been undercut or masked by the under-absorption, particularly Consumer in a number of our Specialty Products Group companies. Sure. I appreciate the question. First of all, throughout our history on a very thoughtful, long-term strategic perspective. RPM has been willing to adjust our structure. If you go back 24 years ago, we moved from really a true holding company with 40 or 50 independent business units into a 6-group structure that served RPM and our customers and shareholders as well for about 15 years. As we initiated the MAP 2020 program in 2018, we reorganized into 4 groups. That reorganization has really driven meaningful synergy and cooperation amongst our businesses even across the 4 groups in their various business units to a greater extent than what existed in our 6-group structure. So I think we're very committed to our current 4-group structure, certainly through the MAP 2025 period. And as I answered an earlier question, I think we will look this time next year, long term to think, all right, what's the next initiative for RPM. And whether it's a year from now or 10 years from now, the idea that we would look at our structure and do something different, it made sense. It's certainly something that we've proven in the past we're willing to do and we certainly would do in the future when it's appropriate. Specific to the Construction Products Group and the Performance Coatings Group, I think there are some significant differences between the end-use markets of the Performance Coatings Group which tend to be heavy industry and more infrastructure related and the Construction Products Group tends to be more construction markets and new home construction, commercial construction. The overlap today is pretty much the infrastructure area. And certainly, we have good levels of cooperation. That's also been enhanced by $1 trillion plus or federal stimulus that's just beginning to play out and so we'll see that continue. But at this stage, we don't have any plans to change that structure if it made sense. As we've done in the past, we would do it again in the future. I would add one more thing to that which is as long as these 2 segments with really good leaders and leadership are continuing to pile out positive unit volume despite some choppy economics and generate margin expansion and the solid EBIT growth year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, we would be very hesitant to adjust something that's working exceedingly well. And there's good momentum in both. Yes. I'll let Rusty add some commentary to that as well. But our MAP initiatives on the MS-168 side in particular are continuing. That's a never-ending effort of continuous improvement. And I think one of the -- I hope people appreciate one of the more significant benefits of our MAP initiatives beyond the metrics that we've improved in the cash flow numbers and the margins is the cultural change at RPM. And it's really in 2 areas. There's a level of I think cooperation and communication across our groups and businesses that didn't exist before. And there is a mindset of a lean manufacturing, continuous improvement approach that, as I mentioned earlier, isn't maybe new to the world but it's new to RPM, it's really taking hold and that's a cultural change that's paid huge dividends for us. Specific to the cash flow and working capital metrics, I'll let Rusty add his thoughts. So about half of our Specialty Products Group is our OEM Coatings and the Industrial Coatings OEM piece of our businesses, highly tied to indirectly but to new home disruption, also a significant share in RV -- in the RV market which boomed during COVID. And because of that, it's been very, very soft. And so those dynamics are also impacting our Specialty Products Group. I believe that Q3 is the low point of performance for our Specialty Products Group and you will be seeing sequential improvement, both as we get into Q4 and as we get into fiscal '25. Sure. I guess I'll refer back to some earlier comments and your presumption is correct. A) We expect to see margin expansion; B) It's going to be more driven by the leverage of unit volume growth to our bottom line and the MAP efficiencies that we've gained over the last 3 or 4 years and certainly over the last 1.5 years. So we see margin expansion but it will be driven -- will need to be driven by positive unit volume growth. And we're pretty certain we'll see that in Consumer in fiscal '25. I think we'll have a better sense of when that might be when we report our fourth quarter results and really talk in more detail about '25. Good momentum in Construction Products, good momentum in our Performance Coatings Group which we don't see changing and recovery in Specialty Products. So those are the things that will do it. But your presumption of your question is absolutely correct. You're going to see margin expansion more driven by the benefits of our MAP initiatives on higher volume levels than on any cost price mix impact. And as we highlighted, even in this quarter, I think we're at the third quarter kind of the peak of the benefits from commodity cycle, price on a year-over-year price on a consolidated basis is up 1% which is obviously sequentially down from over the last 4, 5 quarters. So it's going to be the good work that we've been done leveraging on higher unit volumes. Leadership matters everywhere and we've got really good leaders now in our developing regions throughout the South Africa, Middle East, Asia Pacific. It's taken us a while to really focus on a strategy that is leverageable and sustainable and we have one. And so we're pretty excited about it. Our acquisition approach was not working for a decade plus and acquiring small businesses and not giving them the resources are paying enough attention to them. So the performance you're seeing here is principally organic. It's a better structure, better leadership and a better focus. It will continue to be organic, as you see from our first-ever meaningful manufacturing, greenfield manufacturing investments in these regions and we'll fill up those plants pretty quickly. And so that strategy is going to continue for the next couple of years. And as we begin to get critical mass, we'll get back to the point where we can acquire a business but integrate it and make it part of this strategy as opposed to have a small business that's far away and not paid much attention to. So it's an area that we're pretty excited about. And was a key element of our MAP initiatives in terms of how we would be organized to be successful. Sure. The fourth quarter guidance that we provided related to Construction Products and Performance Coatings is as much about the timing of the completion of some major projects and we will provide this detail in July. But when you look at the second half of fiscal '24 on a consolidated basis, I mentioned this earlier, you'll see sales on a consolidated basis, flat up 1% and EBIT up, let's say, 13% to 14%. That's based upon the results we reported today and the guidance that we provided for fiscal fourth quarter here in '24. When we look back at the second half of the Performance Coatings Group and Construction Products Group, you're going to see just really solid good unit volume growth and good performance. It's being masked a little bit by these project completions at the end of Q3 which will inhibit a little bit of our growth in Q4. We don't see any slowdown in the solid performance and momentum of those 2 segments as we go into the summer months. And as I mentioned earlier, I think we've hit bottom on our Specialty Products Group. And we will start around easier comps, along with a real focus in our Consumer Group on new product introductions and operating efficiencies that will allow us to serve customers at a very high level. So I think we see good trends as we go into fiscal '25 but the impact will be more as a result of MAP initiatives because the deflation elements and the pricing elements will be coming to an end as we get through the fourth quarter and get into the summer months. Sure. Yes, I appreciate the question. We will continue and actually have a decent pipeline of small- to medium-sized acquisitions that we will integrate and add to the strategies of our different companies and segments. So that I would expect to continue. Particularly in our Consumer Group and our Construction Products Group where we are more integrated than other parts of RPM, I think we are in a position to take on larger acquisitions and really drive synergies that are required to be competitive from a price perspective in those. And we have throughout my 30-plus career at RPM, been very fine with using our balance sheet. And so I think we've got tons of leverage. We've got a stronger cash flow than we've ever had and we would be willing to use our balance sheet right up to maintaining our investment-grade rating. And so there is plenty of room between cash flow and debt capacity to do larger transactions if we can find them at a price that works for us. Yes, it is. Thank you, Jamie and thank you to everybody for your participation on our investor call today. Through the first 9 months of the year, we demonstrated our ability to expand margins and increase cash flow despite some economic challenges, particularly for our Consumer and Specialty Products Group. We look forward to building momentum in those 2 segments and continuing the good momentum in our Construction Products Group and Performance Coatings Group as we enter our fourth quarter in the summer months of our new fiscal year. In July, we'll provide the details of our FY 2024 fourth quarter which we expect to be our tenth consecutive quarter of record sales and earnings performance and to provide any comments on our outlook for our fiscal 2025. Thanks again for participating in our call and have a great day."

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Matt Schlarb, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Schlarb: Thank you, Gary, and welcome to RPM International's conference call for the fiscal 2024 second quarter. Joining today's call are Frank Sullivan, RPM's Chair and CEO; Rusty Gordon, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Michael Laroche, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. The call is also being webcast and can be accessed live or replayed on the RPM website at www.rpminc.com. Comments made on this call may include forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to be materially different. For more information on these risks and uncertainties, please review RPM's reports filed with the SEC. During this conference call, references may be made to non-GAAP financial measures. To assist you in understanding these non-GAAP terms, RPM has posted reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures on the RPM website. Also, please note that our comments will be on an as-adjusted basis and all comparisons are to the second quarter of fiscal 2023, unless otherwise indicated. We have provided a supplemental slide presentation to support our comments on the call. It can be accessed in the Presentation and Webcasts section of the RPM website at www.rpminc.com. Additionally, as a reminder, certain businesses in Asia Pacific that were previously part of the Construction Products Group are now being managed and reported under the Performance Coatings Group effective June 1, 2023. As a result, all references to CPG and PCG today reflect the updated structure. The recast businesses generate approximately $100 million in annual sales and this change has no impact on consolidated results. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Frank.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you, Matt, and welcome to everybody joining us on our call today. I'll start with an overview of our second quarter performance, then I'll turn the call over to Mike Laroche to discuss the financials in more detail. Matt will then provide an update on the balance sheet and the recent opening of an R&D facility, and Rusty will cover our outlook. At the end of the prepared remarks, we'll be pleased to answer your questions. Starting with our second quarter results on Slide 3. We generated our eight consecutive quarter of record sales and adjusted EBIT. While revenue growth was slightly positive because of softness in certain end markets, we continued our trend of good margin expansion led by our MAP 2025 initiatives. This resulted in double-digit adjusted EBIT growth, which is squarely in the guidance we provided and in addition to the strong growth we generated in the prior year quarter. The MAP 2025 initiatives were also a key reason we generated all-time record cash flow of $408.6 million from operating activities during the quarter. Enhanced collaboration between commercial and operational functions, means we are now able to respond to customer demand more quickly without having to build large safety stocks as we have done in the past and this is having a positive impact on working capital. Through the first six months of fiscal 2024, we generated $767.8 million of cash flow from operating activities, which surpassed our previous all-time fiscal year record. Turning to Slide 4. Sales were led by our Construction Products Group and Perform -- and Performance Coatings segment, which benefited from their focus on repair and maintenance as well as their positioning to serve strong demand for infrastructure, re-shoring, and high-performance buildings with their engineered solutions. Volumes declined in the Consumer and Specialty Products Group segments as demand in DIY and especially OEM end-markets, particularly those with residential exposure remained soft. Both of the segments have been pressured for the past year as individuals have focused their spending on travel and entertainment and existing home turnover has been at a multi-decade low. Pricing was positive in all segments and helped offset lower overall volumes. Despite these challenging end markets, we achieved another quarter of strong margin expansion led by our MAP 2025 initiatives. Margin expansion was strongest at the Construction Products Group and the Performance Coatings Group, which both generated positive volume during the quarter. This demonstrates the potential for our MAP 2025-enabled margin expansion in our businesses underperforming when volumes begin to grow again. As a reminder, second quarter growth was in addition to a strong quarter in the prior year period. The two-year stack growth for sales and adjusted EBIT was 9.3% and 50.6% respectively. Moving to Slide 5, I'm pleased to report that the changes we recently made to our management structure are showing good progress. In Europe, new management teams have focused their sales strategy and implemented MAP 2025 initiatives to grow sales and expand margins. In Africa, Middle East, and Asia Pacific, which are now aligned under our Performance Coatings Group management, our businesses are realizing the potential of increased collaboration in our operations. Sales in Africa, Middle East grew 13%, and Asia-Pacific increased 6.4%, and we're realizing operational synergies that are leading to even greater profitability growth. Overall, I'm proud of our associates' performance in the second quarter. We're executing exceedingly well in the things that we can control and the hard work we are doing on MAP 2025 initiatives is enabling collaboration, efficiencies, and cash flow to benefit us now. And I'm optimistic that we have even greater opportunities in the future. I'd now like to turn the call over to Matt Schlarb to cover our financials -- I'm sorry, Mike Laroche to cover our financial results in more detail, Mike?\nMichael Laroche: Thanks, Frank. Starting on Slide 6. Consolidated sales increased slightly as positive volumes at the Construction Products Group and Performance Coatings Group, higher pricing, and favorable FX, were offset by end-market weakness in Consumer and the Specialty Products Group. MAP 2025 benefits, including the commodity cycle drove 320 basis points of gross margin improvement. Improved fixed cost leverage at the Construction Products Group and the Performance Coatings Group also contributed to gross margin expansion. SG&A as a percentage of sales increased during the quarter as we reinvest MAP savings in long-term growth initiatives and to incentivize the sale of higher margin products and services. Inflation in areas like wages, benefits, and health care expenses added to the increase in SG&A. Expense reduction actions taken at the end of fiscal 2023 helped to mitigate the increase and we are taking additional actions to limit SG&A increases in the second half of 2024. Adjusted EBIT grew -- adjusted EPS grew 10.9% to $1.22 which is a second quarter record and was driven by adjusted EBIT growth with an increase in interest rates, being offset by debt pay-downs. Turning to the Construction Products Group results on Slide 7. They achieved record Q2 sales led by concrete admixtures which continued to benefit from reshoring and infrastructure projects, as well as market-share gains. The segment also benefited from increased demand for high-performance buildings, both new and renovations, with particular strength in sealants and wall cladding. As Frank mentioned, Europe is benefiting from a more focused sales strategy, and this includes CPG which is our largest segment in Europe. Adjusted EBIT increased to a second quarter record led by higher sales, improved fixed-cost leverage, and MAP 2025 benefits. As a result of the strong financial performance, variable compensation increased and was partially offset by expense reduction actions put in place at the end of fiscal 2023. On Slide 8, the Performance Coatings Group achieved record second quarter sales, driven by strong demand for the segment's engineered turnkey flooring systems due to heavy activity in reshoring capital projects and market-share gains. The businesses in Africa, Middle East and Asia Pacific were all recently aligned under PCG management, contributed to the segment's growth. This volume growth resulted in improved fixed-cost leverage, and along with MAP 2025 benefits, generated all-time record adjusted EBIT during the quarter. Moving to Slide 9, Specialty Products Group sales declined as specialty OEM demand remained weak, particularly in the end-markets that have exposure to residential housing, including furniture, doors, windows, and cabinets. The divestiture of the non-core furniture warranty business last fiscal year, reduced sales and the segment also faced challenging comparisons to the prior year period when the disaster restoration business benefited from the response to Hurricane Ian in Florida, which did not repeat in fiscal 2024. The reduced volumes resulted in unfavorable deleveraging and adjusted EBIT declines, which were partially offset by expense reduction actions implemented at the end of fiscal 2023. SPG also continued strategic investments in long-term growth initiatives, which weighed on adjusted EBIT margins. Matt will talk about one of those growth investments shortly. Please note that adjusted EBIT excludes a $4 million expense related to an adverse legal ruling for a divested business. Turning to Slide 10, the Consumer Group was pressured by soft takeaway at retail stores from DIY customers as they focused their time and spending on travel and entertainment rather than projects around the house and as housing turnover hit multi-year lows. Certain retailers were also more cautious with inventory levels, which pressured volumes. Market-share gains, strength in international markets, and increased pricing to catch up with prior material and current labor inflation helped limit the volume declines. As a reminder, Consumer faced challenging comparisons as sales increased 15.3% in the prior year period. Despite challenging end markets, Consumer still generated record second quarter adjusted EBIT. This was achieved primarily due to MAP 2025 benefits and strength in international markets and was in addition to strong growth in the prior year when adjusted EBIT increased over 180%. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Matt, who will cover the balance sheet, cash flow, and provide an investment update.\nMatthew Schlarb: Thank you, Mike. Moving to Slide 11, we continue to make significant progress on improving working capital, primarily through lower inventories, which decreased $287 million from prior year levels. This combined with our improved profitability, resulted in all-time record cash flow from operating activities of $408.6 million in the second quarter. As Frank mentioned, our cash flow in the first six months of the fiscal year has surpassed our previous 12-month fiscal year record. Year-to-date, we have returned $113.3 million of cash to shareholders through dividends, and in October, we achieved our 50th consecutive year of increasing our dividend, an accomplishment only 41 other publicly traded companies can claim. This sustained dividend growth has been enabled by our strategic balance, our focus on repair and maintenance, and our entrepreneurial spirit, all of which help us grow throughout economic cycles. We have also returned additional cash to shareholders through share repurchases which total $225 million to date. Finally, we've continued to repay debt and at the end of the second quarter of 2024, total debt is $592 million lower than the prior year. These debt repayments have helped mitigate the impact of rising rates on interest expense and provided flexibility to take advantage of future opportunities. Moving to Slide 12, as Mike mentioned, our segments are making investments to accelerate long-term growth. We'd like to highlight one of those investments, the RPM Innovation Center of Excellence. We recently celebrated the ribbon cutting on this new state-of-the-art facility located in Greensboro, North Carolina. This facility is the first of its kind at RPM, where multiple businesses can collaborate and share resources to help drive innovation. This is particularly important for some of our smaller businesses that do not have the scale or local talent to run a comprehensive R&D led by themselves. Additionally, the Innovation Center of Excellence serves as a showcase to customers, where they can visit and see first-hand our ability to find solutions to their challenges. Also, by sharing resources, we are eliminating the need to have duplicative equipment and multiple labs which will control long-term expenses. The facility is being overseen by Specialty Products Group because many of their businesses are prime candidates to utilize it and we already have businesses from all four segments collaborating there today. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Rusty, to cover the outlook.\nRussell Gordon: Thanks, Matt. And before we start, just to clarify, the year-to-date share repurchases are $25 million, just so that's clear. Now I'll go on with the outlook. On Slide 13, you can see our third quarter outlook, which as a reminder, is our seasonally slowest quarter. Market trends in Q3 are expected to be similar to Q2 as strength in CPG and SPG, international markets, and market-share gains are offset by weakness in DIY and specialty OEM markets. The expected result is flat sales to the record prior year period. On consolidated adjusted EBIT -- excuse me, our consolidated adjusted EBIT growth is expected to accelerate and increase 25% to 35% over the prior year record results, driven by MAP 2025 benefits, including in Europe, which is an area of focus for us, and less challenging prior year comparisons. This adjusted EBIT outlook is inclusive of growth and efficiency, investments we are making in our businesses, and at the corporate level, which will weigh on short-term margins. I'll add that we are also taking actions to limit SG&A growth in the second half of the year. By segment, CPG and PCG are expected to continue to benefit from their focus on repair and maintenance, and from continued spending on infrastructure, high-performance building, and reshoring projects. Market-share gains are also expected to contribute to sales growth. We are expecting sales in both segments to increase in the mid-single-digit range. In SPG, we have not seen an inflection point in demand, with housing turnover hovering near multi-year low levels. As a result, we expect sales to decline in the mid-teen percentage range. In Consumer, we expect sales to decline by low-single-digits as soft DIY demand is expected to be partially offset by market-share gains. Moving to our full year outlook on Slide 14, we are lowering our sales expectations for the year due to lingering softness in the DIY and specialty OEM markets. Our new outlook for the year is, sales growth in the low-single-digit range versus the prior expectation of mid-single-digit growth. Despite the reduction in the sales outlook, we continue to make good progress achieving MAP 2025 benefits. And as a result, are affirming our adjusted EBIT outlook of growth in the low-double-digit to mid-teen range. This includes benefits we are capturing from the commodity cycle as overall raw material prices decline, while we maintain pricing. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be pleased to answer your questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Hi, John.\nJohn McNulty: Good morning. Hey, Frank. Good morning. So, I wanted to dig into Consumer a little bit. So, it was down a little bit north of 5%. Your original expectations forward (ph) in the quarter was up low-single digits. It doesn't look like it was price, because you've got pricing across all the businesses. So I guess, can you help us peel back Young and a little bit on volumes, how much was kind of -- was it down on just Consumer takeaway verse -- versus some of the destocking that you're seeing? And then also, can you speak to some of the share gain offset that you had? Maybe quantify that a little bit for us as well?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. On a consolidated basis, price in the quarter was up slightly less than 2% and so that should give you a sense, that's a little bit less than Consumer, and it's just month-after-month of negative Consumer takeaway. I would note that we are outperforming our directly comparable Consumer paid peers in terms of volume. But it's been a consistently minus low-single-digit, minus mid-single-digit Consumer POS over the last eight to nine months, and we don't see that changing until possibly this spring.\nJohn McNulty: Okay. And when you think about some of the destocking that you've seen in the business, because I think you highlighted, at a couple of retailers that was an issue. As far as where inventories are, or at some of these bigger retailers, I guess, would you say they're kind of about where they normally would be going into the beginning of the spring paint season, are they below? I guess, how would you characterize that?\nFrank Sullivan: I think they're back to normal. You've seen a significant readjustment in supply chains, both with our customers and also as we noted within RPM. Last -- this time last year, we talked about our efforts to really focus on operating efficiency and cash flow, and that we would do so at the expense of profitability in terms of overhead absorption, and that's happened throughout the last 12 months, but the execution of the RPM people in this quarter is exceptional. We have reduced debt by almost $600 million bucks over the last 12 months. We generated record levels of cash flow on a six-month period. Our cash conversion cycle versus one year ago is almost improved by 30 days. And so, the things that we can control are being executed very well. I think we're really happy with that. As you're seeing in the third quarter expectation, to be able to generate a 25% to 35% EBIT growth on what essentially is the same sales as last year, gives you a good sense of the improvements we've made.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. No. It makes sense. And actually maybe to that, if I can squeeze one last one in. You saw some notable margin lift despite a pretty soft volume environment. I guess, can you help us to think about how much of that was from the price versus raws benefit versus some of the MAP improvements? And then I guess maybe the third bucket would be just general mix improvements, but I guess, can you help us to parse out where some of that real improvement was coming in?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. We went cost price mix positive in most of our businesses starting in the summer and we'll be cost price mix positive relative to raw material inflation and our price increase efforts in Consumer in the third quarter. I'll just use Consumer as an example. Over a 18-month to 24-month period, we absorbed about $500 million of higher cost raw material, labor, and things like that. And as is normal in these cycles, we lose margin, spend time catching up, and we will be cost price mix margin positive in Consumer for the first time in Q3. And you can see we've been that way in PCG and CPG going back to the beginning of the summer. I think you can also see the strong leverage when we've got volume in the PCG and CPG performance and we would expect the same in our Specialty Products Group and Performance Coatings -- I'm sorry, Consumer Group, once we start generating positive unit volume.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. Thanks very much. Appreciate the color, Frank.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from David Huang with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning.\nDavid Huang: Hi. Good morning. I guess, on construction, can you talk about the trends you are seeing by end markets? And I guess, specific to infrastructure and reshoring, are you seeing any project delays, either because of slower government approval or people are just delaying their projects into 2024 because of lower construction cost expectations?\nFrank Sullivan: We have not seen much in the way of project delays. The project delays that we would experience tend to be weather-related in the -- particularly in the Construction Products Group, and so far, we're in pretty good shape there. It actually feels like -- and some of this is what happens when the government commits a trillion dollars of infrastructure and other stimulus, that there is a manufacturing renaissance happening. And so, while we are specified on some major onshoring projects, particularly in the technology area, and that's coming, you're seeing the follow-on of that with suppliers. And so we're in a pretty good space with, for instance, stonehard flooring, our Carboline high-performance coatings, Euclid Chemical and admixtures, a lot of the construction chemicals business. Also, just as a reminder, our Tremco roofing business is about $800 million, and 95% of that is reroofing and/or renovation. And so we're not very exposed to the commercial construction cycle there. And so, that's doing really well. Lastly, we have been moving with our WTI business into some asset management areas, including an acquisition of a couple years ago, Pure Air, and that is the refurbishment and renovation of commercial HV and industrial HVAC systems, and that business is showing some really strong growth as well.\nDavid Huang: Okay. Got it. And then on raw material, how much was the raw material costs during the quarter? And I guess, when do you expect the deflation benefits to peak?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. Matt, do you want to take that?\nMatthew Schlarb: Sure. Yeah. So, we -- raw materials were down about 5% in the second quarter. Now, other things like labor are still going up and it varies by product category, like some things, particularly in the Consumer segment like acetone was up 25%, metal packaging and TiO2 were pretty flat, propellant was little bit up, but other raw materials were down, that brought the overall average down about 5%. So, we think that we'll probably hit a peak of raw material deflation sometime in the third or fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.\nDavid Huang: Okay. Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Josh Spector with UBS. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Josh.\nJoshua Spector: Hey. Good morning, Frank. So, I just wanted to follow up on the comments on SG&A. So, your inflation in the first half is about 8% year-on-year, talked about some discrete items driving that and some actions to reduce that in the second half. So what are your expectations for second half SG&A inflation and how does that carry into '20 -- fiscal '25?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. You can see SG&A, re -- grow at a lesser rate in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter as we round our performance last year. And as we talked about, there are some specific areas that we are committed to investing in, in relationship to being in a good position to capture growth when the market turns. Matt mentioned one of those today. We committed tens of millions of dollars to the establishment of a new R&D center. It's part of our Wood Finishes Group and our Specialty Coatings Group. Their performance in the last year hasn't been particularly good because of their direct or indirect exposure to things in housing, which has been a really tough market environment. Nonetheless, we are committed to investments there, to investments in our Legend Brands business in terms of air handling and de-humidification equipment in a number of areas there. We have been investing significantly in some new product categories in our Consumer Group. And we're seeing placements of some new DAC spray products and re-capture of some Rust-Oleum market share as well coming this spring. So, we've been very deliberate about the balance between harvesting MAP savings and reinvesting in what we believe is future growth opportunities.\nJoshua Spector: Yeah. I guess\u2026\nFrank Sullivan: Yeah. I would add one other thing to that. We track that growth investment spending separately. And so, if we get to the point where the soft landing turns into something a little more difficult economically, our ability to turn on a dime and cut tens of millions of dollars of SG&A would -- could happen pretty quickly.\nJoshua Spector: Thanks. No. That's helpful. And if I kind of carry that forward, so, could you remind us of the expectation for the realized MAP to growth savings in fiscal '24, excluding raw material and price cost movements? And your comments on investment, has that increased versus your prior expectations in that, maybe the realization of those savings is less because you're investing more, or is it the same calculus you were running too, previously?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I'll let Matt give you the details on the numbers in terms of what we communicated, but our investment programs are essentially the same. So while they haven't increased in terms of the things that we've been doing in the MAP program, at this stage they also have not been cut back. So, we are committed to a number of initiatives in -- across a number of SBUs, with a goal of being in a good position to harvest growth when the economy gets a little bit stronger.\nMatthew Schlarb: Yeah. And related to the MAP savings, in prior calls, we communicated a run rate basis of $160 million and a P&L rate of about $100 million. We're still on-track for that. The thing is, those savings and those benefits are actually being masked by a lot of the under-absorption we've had from lower-than-expected volumes.\nJoshua Spector: Okay. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: The next question is from Jeff Zekauskas with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Jeff.\nJeff Zekauskas: Hi. Good morning. As a base case, how much is variable compensation likely to be up this year?\nFrank Sullivan: I don't know that we have that number specifically, but in a number of our businesses, we have addressed commercial disciplines that didn't exist before in terms of some CRM programs and other things, such that we've replaced some old compensation structures in Tremco Roofing and part of our Construction Products Group with more variable compensation associated with pricing and margin. And so, that's part of the increase in SG&A which goes hand-in-glove with the increase in gross margin profitability.\nJeff Zekauskas: Okay. And can you make some general remarks on your outlook on demand in the United States over the next 12 months in your various businesses and how you think it might change as the year progresses?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. Back to the Construction Products Group and Performance Coatings Group, we're really well-positioned with what continues to be a huge slug of federal stimulus in the areas that we have long been positioned to serve. And so, I think we feel pretty good about that over the next 12 months. The halt of the most aggressive in history interest rate rise campaign by the Fed, will start to produce some better results. I mean that our Specialty Products Group in particular, their largest business unit is our Industrial Coatings, wood, wood stains, and finishes. We sell into items that directly or indirectly go into new homes whether it's windows, doors, wood trim, and those markets have been negative since December of last year, which if you go back and model their declining performance, because the first six months of fiscal '23 were great. And then you model the Fed impact of interest rates on the housing market, both in terms of new home construction, in terms of housing turnover, if you read the headlines, people being stuck in homes because of low interest rate mortgages, it's had a direct negative impact there. And then, I also think, in the Consumer side, we're seeing the last vestiges across the industry of maybe the COVID boom, where people did a lot of projects and redecorating, and as Mike said, headlines suggested that there is spending out there by consumers, but they are not goods, they are more on services. I think as the interest rate environment improves, you're going to see improvement in both Consumer activity and in the housing activity, at the same time, we'll be rounding significantly easier comparables. And so, if we are -- just to finish this, if we are seeing an interest rate environment that begins to modestly improve in the housing market, both in terms of new construction and turnover improved, you're going to see our numbers pickup both in our Consumer DIY businesses as well as our Specialty Products Group.\nJeff Zekauskas: Okay. Great. Thank you so much.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nVincent Andrews: Thank you, and good morning.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Vincent.\nVincent Andrews: Could you talk a little bit about -- a little bit far enough along in its reshoring and infrastructure activity that maybe you have some insight into how lumpy it's going to be for your business in terms of, is there sell-in on these particular products -- projects that you're specked in on and as those projects are completed, do you have a very orderly handoff to another suite of projects that's of the same volume or more, or how should we think about the potential lumpiness of this benefit to your business?\nFrank Sullivan: Yeah. Sure. Back to my earlier comments. It feels like we're in a mini-manufacturing renaissance. Because, while we're being specified on a lot of these larger onshoring projects, in some cases, they haven't even put a shovel in the ground. And so on some larger projects that could be multimillion dollars, they will add some lumpiness to our results, as you suggest. But that's down the road. What we're seeing now is just a pretty solid industrial capital spending number and a market share gains target to point to in terms of new products with our Construction Products Group or Performance Coatings Group. But there's been a preference in some instances for our Stonhard flooring because we not only provide the material, but we supply the labor. So, we do a turnkey project in an environment where labor has been challenging, that's provided a competitive advantage for us. The same thing is true in our Tremco Roofing business with our WTI business. And so, having a labor component both in elements of Tremco and in the Stonhard division of our Performance Coatings Group has also helped us from a competitive advantage.\nVincent Andrews: And then as a follow-up, in areas like Consumer, where the volume is challenged, are you facing any pressure from your retail partners to either price promote more or to step-up media or ad spend or any types of things that might encourage foot traffic?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. We are facing pressure from customers across RPM businesses for modest price reductions here and there. As I mentioned, specific to Consumer, we absorbed over -- that was our largest hit in terms of raw material costs. We absorbed about $500 million of rising costs over an 18-month to 24-month period. And frustratingly, it remains the one segment that's still seeing some inflation. There are some tariff items around tin plate, which goes directly to metal cans, and a couple of other chemicals like acetone, that are -- that have not experienced the meaningful raw material reduction that some broader chemical categories have, like epoxy resins or silicones.\nVincent Andrews: Okay. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Mike Harrison with Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Mike.\nMichael Harrison: Hi. Good morning, Frank. I was hoping maybe you could give us a little bit more detail on the improvement that you've seen in the Construction business in Europe related to the more focused sales strategy and the benefits that you saw in Asia Pacific and Africa, and the Middle East in your Performance Coatings business, where there is some better coordination going on? Maybe just, again, some more detail on the changes that you've made there? And it sounds like you expect some additional improvement to come, just wanted to gauge your confidence around how much more legs you could have from those actions. Thank you.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. And it's a great question. So, I think the -- first, you got to step back and recall our 2020 MAP to Growth operating improvement program. We made a lot of good progress there, but our progress was interrupted by the COVID pandemic. Most of our early efforts in the first couple of years of the 2020 MAP to Growth program were focused on North America, and particularly in the -- what we call MS168 operating focus. We were interrupted in getting at Europe. Post-COVID and with MAP '25, we've had tremendous cooperation between our Construction Products Group and our Performance Coatings Group. But across all four of our segments, the President, the Group President of our Performance Coatings Group relocated with his family to Europe, and he's providing direct senior leadership oversight on executing the simplest way to think about it, is a MAP to Growth initiative in Europe. Likewise, we had too many small, far away, uncoordinated locations in the developing world. And we have coordinated and consolidated the oversight of those with a leadership team out of South Africa, and they've done an exceptional job. And so now in the Middle East, and Africa, and India, and Southeast Asia, we are approaching the market as RPM, not by products, certainly, it's all of our products, but in terms of oversight of asset allocation, accounting and finance, IT systems, we're consolidating more of that under one Group, and we're having real good benefits. We're getting the right people in the right places. We're eliminating redundant costs by -- as you'll recall, at one point, we closed the books in 104 places every month, so we're addressing that. And so of all these have had a really positive impact. The last thing I'll say is, in Europe, we had a pretty strong performance in the quarter. The UK was the first of the major markets that we're involved in that really went into a recession. And so it feels like there is some spending activity there. I would say continental Europe is not economically doing particularly well. So, most of what you're seeing there is self-help and the good execution on what I would call a European MAP to Growth initiative with senior leadership on the ground overseeing it.\nMichael Harrison: All right. Thanks for that. And then, you guys have done a really nice job managing working capital and obviously, that's showing up in the cash flow. But as you look across your segments, are your internal inventory levels where they need to be at this point? I'm just kind of trying to think about how we should look at production rates and fixed-cost absorption, particularly in that Specialty business and maybe Consumer, as we're kind of moving through the seasonally slower period in Q3 and they get into the spring pickup in Q4?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. Thank you. There is more room for us to improve in working capital. It will be incrementally smaller in the coming quarters, because again, as you recall, this time last year, we talked about tackling inventories in particular and the underlying operating efficiencies. And we've been doing that very effectively. And there, as I mentioned earlier on the call, we picked up almost 30 days over the last 12 months in our cash conversion cycle, we've got another 30 days to pick up. But there is incremental improvement that we will be generating in the coming quarters and the coming years.\nMichael Harrison: All right. Thanks very much.\nOperator: The next question is from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Michael.\nMichael Sison: Hey, guys. Happy New Year. Great. Frank, you mentioned that the Consumer Group could or maybe can see an inflection point in the spring. What do you think -- what are you looking forward to see -- any indicators, anything you're looking for to maybe give you confidence that, that could happen?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I think we need to get into the spring months which is our typical strongest selling season. We introduced the Rust-Oleum five in one and Stop Rust this time last year. We've introduced a highly-anticipated new DAP spray product, it's a -- essentially a single component that replaces a prior two component product. So, we've got a number of new product areas. We're also picking up a little bit of lost market share from the prior year. And so, some of it's going to be some new product placements and others of it is going to be a sense that if the economy picks up a little bit, particularly as it relates to housing turnover, you'll see improvement in our Consumer and Specialty Products Group. As a reminder, and I think all of you on the call know this, housing turnover, particularly for us, is more an indicator of economic activity than new home construction. We're not directly involved in new home construction except in our Specialty Products Group and to a lesser extent at DAP. But when you have housing turnover, a lot of repair and maintenance and a lot of fix-up for people that are selling and then a lot of repair and maintenance and redecorating for the buyers, and that activity has been at multi-decade lows over the last 12 months.\nMichael Sison: Got it. And then just a quick follow-up, I apologize if I missed this, what did you think pricing would be in the third and the fourth quarter? And then, there are some sort of news on the home improvement guys, they want to get a lot of the inflation back from their suppliers. So, it sounds like they are pushing for price decreases. How do you sort of handle that in the Consumer Group and are there other ways to really keep some of the pricing that you achieved over the last several years?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes. I don't think about it so much as pricing as I do margin. Some of that goes along with new product introductions, some of it goes along with category management activities that we have at big customers. And quite candidly, some of it is finally recapturing the lost margin during the commodity cycle activity. I don't -- and to your earlier part of the question, I don't anticipate much in the way of price in Q3 or Q4. The exception might be in a few rare areas like Consumer, I think people are paying attention to what's happening with this tariff negotiation around tin plate. There is some consolidation there in the industry. It's a frustrating item. So, there are a couple of areas that we're paying attention to. Now, whether that drives additional price increases or not, time will tell. But broadly speaking, across RPM, we don't anticipate much in the way of price in Q3 or Q4.\nMichael Sison: Got it. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question is from Aleksey Yefremov with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nRyan Weis: Good morning. This is Ryan on for Aleksey. I kind of wanted to piggyback off of the last pricing question there. So, I was wondering if you could maybe talk about how pricing is trending on bids for new projects in both CPG and PCG.\nFrank Sullivan: Well, in general, we have held price across most RPM businesses. Very few exceptions and the exceptions tend to be more commodity spaces around epoxy resins or silicones. We participate in line striping and in bridge and highway work and that tends to be a little more price-sensitive because they tend to have basic coatings that are more directly related to the underlying chemical raw materials.\nRyan Weis: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then, can you just maybe talk about what you guys are seeing in the repair and maintenance business? Obviously, it's held up relatively well. Is this business still growing? Or any color here would be great. Thank you.\nFrank Sullivan: Absolutely, it's holding up really well. You can see that in our Construction Products Group. The vast majority of that is repair and maintenance. And then also industrial capital spending, which seems to be pretty solid. That also impacts our Performance Coatings Group. So, we're pushing, as I mentioned earlier, other opportunities. I mentioned the Pure Air acquisition of a couple of years ago over the last two calls, we're seeing some nice growth there. And that was really in response to customers who talk to Tremco and our WTI services component. When we're up on their roof, can we help them with their HVAC equipment? And we didn't have any answer to that question for many, many years and we do now. So, we're able to sell more on the same roof and/or sell new components with the same sales force, and we're pretty excited about it and over time, I think we'll look for other opportunities as we think about this business more as an asset management, asset maintenance business, as opposed to just a purely roofing materials business.\nRyan Weis: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Stephen Byrne with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nStephen Byrne: Yes. Thank you.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Steve.\nStephen Byrne: Thank you. Frank, with respect to the new Innovation Center down in North Carolina, I was curious whether you're seeing any responses and changes between the various segments. Is there any increase in collaboration between them? And maybe more specifically, do you expect that multi-segment R&D center to benefit primarily from across a transfer of technology from one segment to another or do you think that it will have more effect on cross-selling, at the more of the commercial level between the segments?\nFrank Sullivan: So, it's a great question. And if you recall, one of the key elements of our original MAP to Growth program, was going from a relatively decentralized RPM with a holding company perspective to thinking about functions and disciplines in three areas, one is remaining independent and entrepreneurial, the other would be centralized and then the middle one is center-led. We have effectively centralized our procurement across RPM, that's helped us meaningfully. That was a big element on the original MAP to Growth program. We are centre-led in manufacturing and operations, and we are instituting a common playbook for our manufacturing facilities across the globe. We'll continue but on a smaller basis. In the original MAP to Growth program, we closed about 25 facilities. You'll see a few incremental closures, particularly related to our activities in Europe. And the R&D Center was really born of our operations asking us and recognizing that there is an opportunity for better collaboration across our businesses. So, I think it's going to be sharing best practices and I think it will be cross-fertilization of technologies that can play, for instance, from an industrial sector into the consumer sector. We're pretty excited about it. It's going to take time to be realized, but it goes hand-in-glove with really trying to look at RPM as a formerly pretty much holding company with 40 or 50 independent units, to recognizing what can we centralize and what can be center-led to take advantage of collaboration. Our four Group Presidents are doing an extraordinary job of leading that collaboration in terms of their actions and their words and it's filtering down through the organization in a very positive way. So, I said I -- the execution in this quarter of the things that we control was really good. And I would expect more of that to come. Obviously, results will be impacted by the underlying economic activity.\nStephen Byrne: Well, thank you, Frank. And maybe just continuing with this potential for cross-selling. I wanted to ask you a little bit about the Specialty Group. Are you reevaluating that segment in any way? Are there businesses in there that you would view as maybe not having either sufficient growth potential or maybe there's just no potential for cross-selling with your other businesses and thus some might be targeted for divestiture?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. It's a great question and we look at divestitures regularly -- a possibility of divestitures regularly with our Board. But I can tell you, in this MAP '25 program, in many ways, we're going just the opposite. We've had some challenges in our Day-Glo business, but we've had huge success with Arnette Polymers, and then the Corsicana chemical plant that we bought in Texas, it's part of our Construction Products Group. We're taking those leadership teams and working with Day-Glo to create a Resin Center of Excellence in Europe and expect the same type of benefits in Europe that we're gaining from having some control over some key chemical raw materials. Our Legend Brands business has a new MRO, if you will, focus that will allow for a more steady state as opposed to the swings of the weather events that have really spiked their business from one quarter to the next or one year to the next. And there is some real complementary efforts there with our Construction Products Group that is already in that asset management business. But we regularly look at opportunities to divest. And as you all know, the M&A market has been pretty dead and so the -- whether it's on the buy-side or in the sell-side, we'll have to see interest rates come down and M&A activity and valuations come back up and that plays both ways.\nStephen Byrne: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Frank.\nFrank Mitsch: Hey. Good morning, and Happy New Year. if I could just follow up on that last question, it kind of begs the -- it does beg the question about your thoughts on uses of cash, and you just discussed that the M&A market is all of it and made the comment before about your buybacks today overstated. I don't know if that was a 40 and slip, but to try and signal that you guys are thinking about increasing your buybacks at these levels, what are your thoughts there, M&A versus buybacks?\nFrank Sullivan: So, we are committed to buying back the dilution in every year. And then, boy, throughout my career here, we've been pretty strategic as to whether we get aggressive in buybacks relative to how we perceive value, and that will continue. But, we will be a more common, more regular buyer of our stock quarter-by-quarter-by-quarter, along with increasing our dividend. Frank, if you look at the opportunities we have with a higher level of permanent cash flow, a year ago we talked about, and I think it might have been a question from you, focus on cash generation and we indicated it would be to pay down debt. We've done that very successfully. But our dividend payout ratio over 20 years has gone from the mid-50%s to the mid-30%s. Our cash flow has increased dramatically and we're in a better position to be a regular buyer of our stock and/or continue our dividend program, unless in relationship to buying our stock, we see some sizable acquisition opportunities at the right value.\nFrank Mitsch: Got you. Very helpful. And if I can come back earlier, I believe it was Matt made the comment that, unabsorbed fixed costs are kind of masking the benefits of the MAP program, what have you, and I guess, I was thinking that for fiscal 2024, unabsorbed fixed costs would be materially less than they were in fiscal '23, how are you thinking about the interplay between this fiscal year and last fiscal year on that item?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. They should be less than fiscal '23 in the second half. Unfortunately, not as much of a recovery as we had hoped because of our original expectation on volume growth, which is, we covered in today's call, we're not seeing yet in Consumer or in the Specialty Products Group. But you are seeing in this quarter, and you'll see in future quarters, a real strong leverage to the bottom-line of our Construction Products Group and Performance Coatings Group, because of the MAP 25 benefits. When we have good volume and it's going to be coming, you're going to see nice leverage.\nFrank Mitsch: Very helpful. Thank you.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Kevin.\nKevin McCarthy: Yes. Good morning, Frank. A question on your sales mix by geography, if I look at Slide 5, it seems to me that there is a very large disparity between your negative 3% in North America and what looks to be an average of positive 9% to 10% overseas. It doesn't look like currency was a big factor this quarter. So, I'm curious, can you speak to why you're doing so well overseas, what are maybe the two or three most important drivers in your view, and how sustainable those might be? And do you think that in future quarters, we'll continue to see faster growth overseas versus the U.S.?\nFrank Sullivan: Yeah. So, I commented earlier in the call, Kevin, that, what we're seeing, particularly in Europe, is just a better focus and better organized approach. Think of it as a MAP to Growth for Europe. And so, we are driving efficiencies there. We're also having a more focused sales effort in a bunch of our businesses. And then, lastly, we're rounding some easier comps, particularly in UK, that went into a recession before most of the other markets that we serve. We also organized in what we call a platform approach for the developing world and it's having real positive effect. So, unless there is a some type of further disruption in a world with plenty of disruptions, I would expect that we would see really solid growth in Europe and the rest of the world and the growth in North America probably is not going to be a lot different in the coming quarter than you see here, again because of the year-over-year flat to negative in Consumer and Specialty Products Group. Hopefully, that will change in Q4, but we will see.\nKevin McCarthy: Okay. That's helpful. And then, I wanted to follow up on the discussion regarding Specialty Products. Can you speak to the margin level and outlook there, Frank? I'm cognizant that you had a step-down when you divested the higher-margin Guardian business there. First half of the year, it seems to be running 9%, 10%, how would you characterize the current level versus normal? And do you have a target for that segment margin? Looking out a couple of years, how can we think about the likely trajectory there?\nFrank Sullivan: Yeah. That's a great question, and yes, we do. The Specialty Products Group should be generating in a better economic environment, mid to slightly higher-teen EBIT margins, and they've been there before. The Guardian Products business was an outsized EBIT margin, but that was a $40 million business. And so, our expectations are, with an economic recovery, in a few years, especially Products Group will be back to the mid-single -- I'm sorry, mid-double-digit mid-teens EBIT growth. And to an earlier question, I'm very confident that we can get there. We're taking advantage of this opportunity now to synergize a few things. But if we don't get back there, then we would take a look at that Specialty Products Group or pieces of it in relationship to RPM's future.\nKevin McCarthy: Very good. I appreciate the color.\nOperator: The next question is from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please go ahead.\nGhansham Panjabi: Good morning, guys. Happy New Year.\nFrank Sullivan: Happy New Year, Ghansham.\nGhansham Panjabi: Thank you, Frank. To you as well. Just going back to the lower consolidated sales guidance for fiscal year '24, can you just sort of clarify what specific segment or segments it is due to and the offset in maintaining your EBIT guidance just purely incrementally more favorable price-cost?\nFrank Sullivan: No, the EBIT guidance is a favorable price cost mix and significant improvements from our MAP '25 initiatives. And as Frank Mitsch asked earlier, some better overhead absorption versus last year when we really tackled inventory, shut down production in a number of places. So, we've been very aggressive in rightsizing inventories and after, quite candidly, 30 years of my career, talking about improving working capital, finally getting around to getting it done on a sustainable basis. So, that's been our focus and we're executing and it's happening. So, we're excited about that. But the EBIT margin improvement is a combination of cost price mix which finally turned positive this fiscal year and the benefits to the MAP '25 program in our operations. One of the key things to that is that the vast majority of the MAP '25 initiatives are related to commercial activities in terms of how we incentivize salespeople relative to margins. It's focused on conversion costs in a number of areas there. So, the impact is mostly a gross margin impact, which means you don't realize it until you sell something. So, it's not like an SG&A cut that you can annualize over -- divide by 12 and annualize over a year. It really flows into your P&L as you move units.\nGhansham Panjabi: Okay. And then on the Consumer business, I mean, if you kind of zoom out, there has been a lot of ups and downs over the years with COVID and supply-chain shortages, etc., and then, of course, interest rates, what is the base case at RPM at this point for calendar year '24, in terms of volumes? Are you expecting a better year? I mean, obviously, interest rates impacted the markets last year, but that in theory should be in the base -- that should be in the base from last year ?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I think you're asking about maybe fiscal '25, which starts on June 1. Our fill rates are back in the high-90%s across the board. That was not true two years ago. We are at lower levels of inventory. And, last year for the first time in my career, shut down production in January and February to right-size inventories where typically we'd be adding inventory to sell into a big spring season. So, we've gotten much more agile in our manufacturing ability, so that we don't have to have the same size of safety stock. So those are the improvements that we have made. But fill rates are where they need to be. I think inventories for the most part in the supply chain are where they need to be. And we just need to help with our retail customers drive consumers back into the stores. Help them think of projects that they can do. And the real first opportunity for us to do that will be this spring because of the seasonality of the business in particular. You see, we expect good leverage in the third quarter, but the third quarter is not where we expect to see any revenue surprises because of the weather seasonality of some of our industrial businesses and certainly our Consumer Group.\nGhansham Panjabi: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question is from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Arun.\nArun Viswanathan: Good morning, Frank. Thanks for taking my question, and Happy New Year. So, I guess, first, I just wanted to go back to kind of the sales outlook. It looks like it's kind of a tale of two cities here with the Consumer and Specialty Products Group maybe a little bit more sluggish, while reshoring infrastructure drives more strength in Construction Products and PMC. Would you see that maybe switching as we move into the back half of calendar '24? Maybe I'll just start with that and just see if that's kind of in line with your thinking.\nFrank Sullivan: No. We think that the Construction Products Group and Performance Coatings Group will have a solid second half of fiscal '24, and the dynamics that we had talked about earlier in terms of stimulus, infrastructure bills, and Increases in industrial capital spending and a resurgence in manufacturing, should bode well for those business units and product lines in fiscal '25. I think the thing that we're focused on is continuing to improve our businesses and operating leverage with the expectation, whether it's in Q4 or as we get into fiscal '25, seeing some positive unit volume growth at a Consumer and a return to growth in most of our Specialty Products Group companies. And again, that's what we are most exposed to OEM, coatings to residential construction and we're not alone in having a very difficult challenge. There are certain segments of manufacturing that have had a tough year and anything that touches housing in the last year has not done very well.\nArun Viswanathan: Got it. And then, you mentioned fiscal '25, I think previously you had put out some MAP 2025 targets of that 16% adjusted EBIT margin. Do you still see that in the cards? I think we're maybe a couple of 100 basis points below that on an annual basis right now, but maybe what's kind of the bridge to getting there? What are some of the factors that we would need to see to realize that level of margin performance?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I think we're on target for that. I think whether we can achieve that on the timeliness or within the timeframe that we communicated depends on when we see the turn in positive unit growth in Consumer and Specialty Products Group. But we'll have a pretty robust appraisal of that when we release our fourth quarter results in July and talk about the balance of our 2025 fiscal year, which is the end of the MAP '25 program.\nArun Viswanathan: And just lastly, I think this question, you may have offered some comments, but I just wanted to ask again, within any of the businesses, are there any particular areas that you think that are just likely -- not likely to recover as you see, and may be candidates for divestiture? How is kind of the portfolio review going? Thanks.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. Yeah. Not at this time, but back to your earlier question, one of the key elements of getting to that 16% consolidated EBIT margin, is especially Products Group who's consolidated -- or Group level EBIT margins are in the mid-teens or slightly higher, which is up from about 9% or 10% level today. So, there needs to be a significant recovery there and we're focused on it. Without that, we will not hit the 16% consolidated goal.\nArun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Frank Sullivan for any closing remarks.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you. We appreciate everybody's participation in our investor call this morning and for your continuing interest in RPM. I'd also like to thank our associates for their tremendous dedication and hard work in fiscal 2024. We are executing at a high level and you can see it in our results. And lastly, to all on the call, we wish you a happy, healthy, and prosperous New Year. Thank you and have a great day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Matt. And before we start, just to clarify, the year-to-date share repurchases are $25 million, just so that's clear. Now I'll go on with the outlook. On Slide 13, you can see our third quarter outlook, which as a reminder, is our seasonally slowest quarter. Market trends in Q3 are expected to be similar to Q2 as strength in CPG and SPG, international markets, and market-share gains are offset by weakness in DIY and specialty OEM markets. The expected result is flat sales to the record prior year period. On consolidated adjusted EBIT -- excuse me, our consolidated adjusted EBIT growth is expected to accelerate and increase 25% to 35% over the prior year record results, driven by MAP 2025 benefits, including in Europe, which is an area of focus for us, and less challenging prior year comparisons. This adjusted EBIT outlook is inclusive of growth and efficiency, investments we are making in our businesses, and at the corporate level, which will weigh on short-term margins. I'll add that we are also taking actions to limit SG&A growth in the second half of the year. By segment, CPG and PCG are expected to continue to benefit from their focus on repair and maintenance, and from continued spending on infrastructure, high-performance building, and reshoring projects. Market-share gains are also expected to contribute to sales growth. We are expecting sales in both segments to increase in the mid-single-digit range. In SPG, we have not seen an inflection point in demand, with housing turnover hovering near multi-year low levels. As a result, we expect sales to decline in the mid-teen percentage range. In Consumer, we expect sales to decline by low-single-digits as soft DIY demand is expected to be partially offset by market-share gains. Moving to our full year outlook on Slide 14, we are lowering our sales expectations for the year due to lingering softness in the DIY and specialty OEM markets. Our new outlook for the year is, sales growth in the low-single-digit range versus the prior expectation of mid-single-digit growth. Despite the reduction in the sales outlook, we continue to make good progress achieving MAP 2025 benefits. And as a result, are affirming our adjusted EBIT outlook of growth in the low-double-digit to mid-teen range. This includes benefits we are capturing from the commodity cycle as overall raw material prices decline, while we maintain pricing. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be pleased to answer your questions."

            "content": "Thanks, Frank. Starting on Slide 6. Consolidated sales increased slightly as positive volumes at the Construction Products Group and Performance Coatings Group, higher pricing, and favorable FX, were offset by end-market weakness in Consumer and the Specialty Products Group. MAP 2025 benefits, including the commodity cycle drove 320 basis points of gross margin improvement. Improved fixed cost leverage at the Construction Products Group and the Performance Coatings Group also contributed to gross margin expansion. SG&A as a percentage of sales increased during the quarter as we reinvest MAP savings in long-term growth initiatives and to incentivize the sale of higher margin products and services. Inflation in areas like wages, benefits, and health care expenses added to the increase in SG&A. Expense reduction actions taken at the end of fiscal 2023 helped to mitigate the increase and we are taking additional actions to limit SG&A increases in the second half of 2024. Adjusted EBIT grew -- adjusted EPS grew 10.9% to $1.22 which is a second quarter record and was driven by adjusted EBIT growth with an increase in interest rates, being offset by debt pay-downs. Turning to the Construction Products Group results on Slide 7. They achieved record Q2 sales led by concrete admixtures which continued to benefit from reshoring and infrastructure projects, as well as market-share gains. The segment also benefited from increased demand for high-performance buildings, both new and renovations, with particular strength in sealants and wall cladding. As Frank mentioned, Europe is benefiting from a more focused sales strategy, and this includes CPG which is our largest segment in Europe. Adjusted EBIT increased to a second quarter record led by higher sales, improved fixed-cost leverage, and MAP 2025 benefits. As a result of the strong financial performance, variable compensation increased and was partially offset by expense reduction actions put in place at the end of fiscal 2023. On Slide 8, the Performance Coatings Group achieved record second quarter sales, driven by strong demand for the segment's engineered turnkey flooring systems due to heavy activity in reshoring capital projects and market-share gains. The businesses in Africa, Middle East and Asia Pacific were all recently aligned under PCG management, contributed to the segment's growth. This volume growth resulted in improved fixed-cost leverage, and along with MAP 2025 benefits, generated all-time record adjusted EBIT during the quarter. Moving to Slide 9, Specialty Products Group sales declined as specialty OEM demand remained weak, particularly in the end-markets that have exposure to residential housing, including furniture, doors, windows, and cabinets. The divestiture of the non-core furniture warranty business last fiscal year, reduced sales and the segment also faced challenging comparisons to the prior year period when the disaster restoration business benefited from the response to Hurricane Ian in Florida, which did not repeat in fiscal 2024. The reduced volumes resulted in unfavorable deleveraging and adjusted EBIT declines, which were partially offset by expense reduction actions implemented at the end of fiscal 2023. SPG also continued strategic investments in long-term growth initiatives, which weighed on adjusted EBIT margins. Matt will talk about one of those growth investments shortly. Please note that adjusted EBIT excludes a $4 million expense related to an adverse legal ruling for a divested business. Turning to Slide 10, the Consumer Group was pressured by soft takeaway at retail stores from DIY customers as they focused their time and spending on travel and entertainment rather than projects around the house and as housing turnover hit multi-year lows. Certain retailers were also more cautious with inventory levels, which pressured volumes. Market-share gains, strength in international markets, and increased pricing to catch up with prior material and current labor inflation helped limit the volume declines. As a reminder, Consumer faced challenging comparisons as sales increased 15.3% in the prior year period. Despite challenging end markets, Consumer still generated record second quarter adjusted EBIT. This was achieved primarily due to MAP 2025 benefits and strength in international markets and was in addition to strong growth in the prior year when adjusted EBIT increased over 180%. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Matt, who will cover the balance sheet, cash flow, and provide an investment update."

            "name": "Frank Sullivan",
            "content": "Thank you, Matt, and welcome to everybody joining us on our call today. I'll start with an overview of our second quarter performance, then I'll turn the call over to Mike Laroche to discuss the financials in more detail. Matt will then provide an update on the balance sheet and the recent opening of an R&D facility, and Rusty will cover our outlook. At the end of the prepared remarks, we'll be pleased to answer your questions. Starting with our second quarter results on Slide 3. We generated our eight consecutive quarter of record sales and adjusted EBIT. While revenue growth was slightly positive because of softness in certain end markets, we continued our trend of good margin expansion led by our MAP 2025 initiatives. This resulted in double-digit adjusted EBIT growth, which is squarely in the guidance we provided and in addition to the strong growth we generated in the prior year quarter. The MAP 2025 initiatives were also a key reason we generated all-time record cash flow of $408.6 million from operating activities during the quarter. Enhanced collaboration between commercial and operational functions, means we are now able to respond to customer demand more quickly without having to build large safety stocks as we have done in the past and this is having a positive impact on working capital. Through the first six months of fiscal 2024, we generated $767.8 million of cash flow from operating activities, which surpassed our previous all-time fiscal year record. Turning to Slide 4. Sales were led by our Construction Products Group and Perform -- and Performance Coatings segment, which benefited from their focus on repair and maintenance as well as their positioning to serve strong demand for infrastructure, re-shoring, and high-performance buildings with their engineered solutions. Volumes declined in the Consumer and Specialty Products Group segments as demand in DIY and especially OEM end-markets, particularly those with residential exposure remained soft. Both of the segments have been pressured for the past year as individuals have focused their spending on travel and entertainment and existing home turnover has been at a multi-decade low. Pricing was positive in all segments and helped offset lower overall volumes. Despite these challenging end markets, we achieved another quarter of strong margin expansion led by our MAP 2025 initiatives. Margin expansion was strongest at the Construction Products Group and the Performance Coatings Group, which both generated positive volume during the quarter. This demonstrates the potential for our MAP 2025-enabled margin expansion in our businesses underperforming when volumes begin to grow again. As a reminder, second quarter growth was in addition to a strong quarter in the prior year period. The two-year stack growth for sales and adjusted EBIT was 9.3% and 50.6% respectively. Moving to Slide 5, I'm pleased to report that the changes we recently made to our management structure are showing good progress. In Europe, new management teams have focused their sales strategy and implemented MAP 2025 initiatives to grow sales and expand margins. In Africa, Middle East, and Asia Pacific, which are now aligned under our Performance Coatings Group management, our businesses are realizing the potential of increased collaboration in our operations. Sales in Africa, Middle East grew 13%, and Asia-Pacific increased 6.4%, and we're realizing operational synergies that are leading to even greater profitability growth. Overall, I'm proud of our associates' performance in the second quarter. We're executing exceedingly well in the things that we can control and the hard work we are doing on MAP 2025 initiatives is enabling collaboration, efficiencies, and cash flow to benefit us now. And I'm optimistic that we have even greater opportunities in the future. I'd now like to turn the call over to Matt Schlarb to cover our financials -- I'm sorry, Mike Laroche to cover our financial results in more detail, Mike? Hi, John. Sure. On a consolidated basis, price in the quarter was up slightly less than 2% and so that should give you a sense, that's a little bit less than Consumer, and it's just month-after-month of negative Consumer takeaway. I would note that we are outperforming our directly comparable Consumer paid peers in terms of volume. But it's been a consistently minus low-single-digit, minus mid-single-digit Consumer POS over the last eight to nine months, and we don't see that changing until possibly this spring. I think they're back to normal. You've seen a significant readjustment in supply chains, both with our customers and also as we noted within RPM. Last -- this time last year, we talked about our efforts to really focus on operating efficiency and cash flow, and that we would do so at the expense of profitability in terms of overhead absorption, and that's happened throughout the last 12 months, but the execution of the RPM people in this quarter is exceptional. We have reduced debt by almost $600 million bucks over the last 12 months. We generated record levels of cash flow on a six-month period. Our cash conversion cycle versus one year ago is almost improved by 30 days. And so, the things that we can control are being executed very well. I think we're really happy with that. As you're seeing in the third quarter expectation, to be able to generate a 25% to 35% EBIT growth on what essentially is the same sales as last year, gives you a good sense of the improvements we've made. Sure. We went cost price mix positive in most of our businesses starting in the summer and we'll be cost price mix positive relative to raw material inflation and our price increase efforts in Consumer in the third quarter. I'll just use Consumer as an example. Over a 18-month to 24-month period, we absorbed about $500 million of higher cost raw material, labor, and things like that. And as is normal in these cycles, we lose margin, spend time catching up, and we will be cost price mix margin positive in Consumer for the first time in Q3. And you can see we've been that way in PCG and CPG going back to the beginning of the summer. I think you can also see the strong leverage when we've got volume in the PCG and CPG performance and we would expect the same in our Specialty Products Group and Performance Coatings -- I'm sorry, Consumer Group, once we start generating positive unit volume. Thank you. Good morning. We have not seen much in the way of project delays. The project delays that we would experience tend to be weather-related in the -- particularly in the Construction Products Group, and so far, we're in pretty good shape there. It actually feels like -- and some of this is what happens when the government commits a trillion dollars of infrastructure and other stimulus, that there is a manufacturing renaissance happening. And so, while we are specified on some major onshoring projects, particularly in the technology area, and that's coming, you're seeing the follow-on of that with suppliers. And so we're in a pretty good space with, for instance, stonehard flooring, our Carboline high-performance coatings, Euclid Chemical and admixtures, a lot of the construction chemicals business. Also, just as a reminder, our Tremco roofing business is about $800 million, and 95% of that is reroofing and/or renovation. And so we're not very exposed to the commercial construction cycle there. And so, that's doing really well. Lastly, we have been moving with our WTI business into some asset management areas, including an acquisition of a couple years ago, Pure Air, and that is the refurbishment and renovation of commercial HV and industrial HVAC systems, and that business is showing some really strong growth as well. Sure. Matt, do you want to take that? Good morning, Josh. Sure. You can see SG&A, re -- grow at a lesser rate in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter as we round our performance last year. And as we talked about, there are some specific areas that we are committed to investing in, in relationship to being in a good position to capture growth when the market turns. Matt mentioned one of those today. We committed tens of millions of dollars to the establishment of a new R&D center. It's part of our Wood Finishes Group and our Specialty Coatings Group. Their performance in the last year hasn't been particularly good because of their direct or indirect exposure to things in housing, which has been a really tough market environment. Nonetheless, we are committed to investments there, to investments in our Legend Brands business in terms of air handling and de-humidification equipment in a number of areas there. We have been investing significantly in some new product categories in our Consumer Group. And we're seeing placements of some new DAC spray products and re-capture of some Rust-Oleum market share as well coming this spring. So, we've been very deliberate about the balance between harvesting MAP savings and reinvesting in what we believe is future growth opportunities. Yeah. I would add one other thing to that. We track that growth investment spending separately. And so, if we get to the point where the soft landing turns into something a little more difficult economically, our ability to turn on a dime and cut tens of millions of dollars of SG&A would -- could happen pretty quickly. Sure. I'll let Matt give you the details on the numbers in terms of what we communicated, but our investment programs are essentially the same. So while they haven't increased in terms of the things that we've been doing in the MAP program, at this stage they also have not been cut back. So, we are committed to a number of initiatives in -- across a number of SBUs, with a goal of being in a good position to harvest growth when the economy gets a little bit stronger. Good morning, Jeff. I don't know that we have that number specifically, but in a number of our businesses, we have addressed commercial disciplines that didn't exist before in terms of some CRM programs and other things, such that we've replaced some old compensation structures in Tremco Roofing and part of our Construction Products Group with more variable compensation associated with pricing and margin. And so, that's part of the increase in SG&A which goes hand-in-glove with the increase in gross margin profitability. Sure. Back to the Construction Products Group and Performance Coatings Group, we're really well-positioned with what continues to be a huge slug of federal stimulus in the areas that we have long been positioned to serve. And so, I think we feel pretty good about that over the next 12 months. The halt of the most aggressive in history interest rate rise campaign by the Fed, will start to produce some better results. I mean that our Specialty Products Group in particular, their largest business unit is our Industrial Coatings, wood, wood stains, and finishes. We sell into items that directly or indirectly go into new homes whether it's windows, doors, wood trim, and those markets have been negative since December of last year, which if you go back and model their declining performance, because the first six months of fiscal '23 were great. And then you model the Fed impact of interest rates on the housing market, both in terms of new home construction, in terms of housing turnover, if you read the headlines, people being stuck in homes because of low interest rate mortgages, it's had a direct negative impact there. And then, I also think, in the Consumer side, we're seeing the last vestiges across the industry of maybe the COVID boom, where people did a lot of projects and redecorating, and as Mike said, headlines suggested that there is spending out there by consumers, but they are not goods, they are more on services. I think as the interest rate environment improves, you're going to see improvement in both Consumer activity and in the housing activity, at the same time, we'll be rounding significantly easier comparables. And so, if we are -- just to finish this, if we are seeing an interest rate environment that begins to modestly improve in the housing market, both in terms of new construction and turnover improved, you're going to see our numbers pickup both in our Consumer DIY businesses as well as our Specialty Products Group. Thank you. Good morning, Vincent. Yeah. Sure. Back to my earlier comments. It feels like we're in a mini-manufacturing renaissance. Because, while we're being specified on a lot of these larger onshoring projects, in some cases, they haven't even put a shovel in the ground. And so on some larger projects that could be multimillion dollars, they will add some lumpiness to our results, as you suggest. But that's down the road. What we're seeing now is just a pretty solid industrial capital spending number and a market share gains target to point to in terms of new products with our Construction Products Group or Performance Coatings Group. But there's been a preference in some instances for our Stonhard flooring because we not only provide the material, but we supply the labor. So, we do a turnkey project in an environment where labor has been challenging, that's provided a competitive advantage for us. The same thing is true in our Tremco Roofing business with our WTI business. And so, having a labor component both in elements of Tremco and in the Stonhard division of our Performance Coatings Group has also helped us from a competitive advantage. Sure. We are facing pressure from customers across RPM businesses for modest price reductions here and there. As I mentioned, specific to Consumer, we absorbed over -- that was our largest hit in terms of raw material costs. We absorbed about $500 million of rising costs over an 18-month to 24-month period. And frustratingly, it remains the one segment that's still seeing some inflation. There are some tariff items around tin plate, which goes directly to metal cans, and a couple of other chemicals like acetone, that are -- that have not experienced the meaningful raw material reduction that some broader chemical categories have, like epoxy resins or silicones. Thank you. Good morning, Mike. Sure. And it's a great question. So, I think the -- first, you got to step back and recall our 2020 MAP to Growth operating improvement program. We made a lot of good progress there, but our progress was interrupted by the COVID pandemic. Most of our early efforts in the first couple of years of the 2020 MAP to Growth program were focused on North America, and particularly in the -- what we call MS168 operating focus. We were interrupted in getting at Europe. Post-COVID and with MAP '25, we've had tremendous cooperation between our Construction Products Group and our Performance Coatings Group. But across all four of our segments, the President, the Group President of our Performance Coatings Group relocated with his family to Europe, and he's providing direct senior leadership oversight on executing the simplest way to think about it, is a MAP to Growth initiative in Europe. Likewise, we had too many small, far away, uncoordinated locations in the developing world. And we have coordinated and consolidated the oversight of those with a leadership team out of South Africa, and they've done an exceptional job. And so now in the Middle East, and Africa, and India, and Southeast Asia, we are approaching the market as RPM, not by products, certainly, it's all of our products, but in terms of oversight of asset allocation, accounting and finance, IT systems, we're consolidating more of that under one Group, and we're having real good benefits. We're getting the right people in the right places. We're eliminating redundant costs by -- as you'll recall, at one point, we closed the books in 104 places every month, so we're addressing that. And so of all these have had a really positive impact. The last thing I'll say is, in Europe, we had a pretty strong performance in the quarter. The UK was the first of the major markets that we're involved in that really went into a recession. And so it feels like there is some spending activity there. I would say continental Europe is not economically doing particularly well. So, most of what you're seeing there is self-help and the good execution on what I would call a European MAP to Growth initiative with senior leadership on the ground overseeing it. Sure. Thank you. There is more room for us to improve in working capital. It will be incrementally smaller in the coming quarters, because again, as you recall, this time last year, we talked about tackling inventories in particular and the underlying operating efficiencies. And we've been doing that very effectively. And there, as I mentioned earlier on the call, we picked up almost 30 days over the last 12 months in our cash conversion cycle, we've got another 30 days to pick up. But there is incremental improvement that we will be generating in the coming quarters and the coming years. Good morning, Michael. Sure. I think we need to get into the spring months which is our typical strongest selling season. We introduced the Rust-Oleum five in one and Stop Rust this time last year. We've introduced a highly-anticipated new DAP spray product, it's a -- essentially a single component that replaces a prior two component product. So, we've got a number of new product areas. We're also picking up a little bit of lost market share from the prior year. And so, some of it's going to be some new product placements and others of it is going to be a sense that if the economy picks up a little bit, particularly as it relates to housing turnover, you'll see improvement in our Consumer and Specialty Products Group. As a reminder, and I think all of you on the call know this, housing turnover, particularly for us, is more an indicator of economic activity than new home construction. We're not directly involved in new home construction except in our Specialty Products Group and to a lesser extent at DAP. But when you have housing turnover, a lot of repair and maintenance and a lot of fix-up for people that are selling and then a lot of repair and maintenance and redecorating for the buyers, and that activity has been at multi-decade lows over the last 12 months. Yes. I don't think about it so much as pricing as I do margin. Some of that goes along with new product introductions, some of it goes along with category management activities that we have at big customers. And quite candidly, some of it is finally recapturing the lost margin during the commodity cycle activity. I don't -- and to your earlier part of the question, I don't anticipate much in the way of price in Q3 or Q4. The exception might be in a few rare areas like Consumer, I think people are paying attention to what's happening with this tariff negotiation around tin plate. There is some consolidation there in the industry. It's a frustrating item. So, there are a couple of areas that we're paying attention to. Now, whether that drives additional price increases or not, time will tell. But broadly speaking, across RPM, we don't anticipate much in the way of price in Q3 or Q4. Well, in general, we have held price across most RPM businesses. Very few exceptions and the exceptions tend to be more commodity spaces around epoxy resins or silicones. We participate in line striping and in bridge and highway work and that tends to be a little more price-sensitive because they tend to have basic coatings that are more directly related to the underlying chemical raw materials. Absolutely, it's holding up really well. You can see that in our Construction Products Group. The vast majority of that is repair and maintenance. And then also industrial capital spending, which seems to be pretty solid. That also impacts our Performance Coatings Group. So, we're pushing, as I mentioned earlier, other opportunities. I mentioned the Pure Air acquisition of a couple of years ago over the last two calls, we're seeing some nice growth there. And that was really in response to customers who talk to Tremco and our WTI services component. When we're up on their roof, can we help them with their HVAC equipment? And we didn't have any answer to that question for many, many years and we do now. So, we're able to sell more on the same roof and/or sell new components with the same sales force, and we're pretty excited about it and over time, I think we'll look for other opportunities as we think about this business more as an asset management, asset maintenance business, as opposed to just a purely roofing materials business. Good morning, Steve. So, it's a great question. And if you recall, one of the key elements of our original MAP to Growth program, was going from a relatively decentralized RPM with a holding company perspective to thinking about functions and disciplines in three areas, one is remaining independent and entrepreneurial, the other would be centralized and then the middle one is center-led. We have effectively centralized our procurement across RPM, that's helped us meaningfully. That was a big element on the original MAP to Growth program. We are centre-led in manufacturing and operations, and we are instituting a common playbook for our manufacturing facilities across the globe. We'll continue but on a smaller basis. In the original MAP to Growth program, we closed about 25 facilities. You'll see a few incremental closures, particularly related to our activities in Europe. And the R&D Center was really born of our operations asking us and recognizing that there is an opportunity for better collaboration across our businesses. So, I think it's going to be sharing best practices and I think it will be cross-fertilization of technologies that can play, for instance, from an industrial sector into the consumer sector. We're pretty excited about it. It's going to take time to be realized, but it goes hand-in-glove with really trying to look at RPM as a formerly pretty much holding company with 40 or 50 independent units, to recognizing what can we centralize and what can be center-led to take advantage of collaboration. Our four Group Presidents are doing an extraordinary job of leading that collaboration in terms of their actions and their words and it's filtering down through the organization in a very positive way. So, I said I -- the execution in this quarter of the things that we control was really good. And I would expect more of that to come. Obviously, results will be impacted by the underlying economic activity. Sure. It's a great question and we look at divestitures regularly -- a possibility of divestitures regularly with our Board. But I can tell you, in this MAP '25 program, in many ways, we're going just the opposite. We've had some challenges in our Day-Glo business, but we've had huge success with Arnette Polymers, and then the Corsicana chemical plant that we bought in Texas, it's part of our Construction Products Group. We're taking those leadership teams and working with Day-Glo to create a Resin Center of Excellence in Europe and expect the same type of benefits in Europe that we're gaining from having some control over some key chemical raw materials. Our Legend Brands business has a new MRO, if you will, focus that will allow for a more steady state as opposed to the swings of the weather events that have really spiked their business from one quarter to the next or one year to the next. And there is some real complementary efforts there with our Construction Products Group that is already in that asset management business. But we regularly look at opportunities to divest. And as you all know, the M&A market has been pretty dead and so the -- whether it's on the buy-side or in the sell-side, we'll have to see interest rates come down and M&A activity and valuations come back up and that plays both ways. Good morning, Frank. So, we are committed to buying back the dilution in every year. And then, boy, throughout my career here, we've been pretty strategic as to whether we get aggressive in buybacks relative to how we perceive value, and that will continue. But, we will be a more common, more regular buyer of our stock quarter-by-quarter-by-quarter, along with increasing our dividend. Frank, if you look at the opportunities we have with a higher level of permanent cash flow, a year ago we talked about, and I think it might have been a question from you, focus on cash generation and we indicated it would be to pay down debt. We've done that very successfully. But our dividend payout ratio over 20 years has gone from the mid-50%s to the mid-30%s. Our cash flow has increased dramatically and we're in a better position to be a regular buyer of our stock and/or continue our dividend program, unless in relationship to buying our stock, we see some sizable acquisition opportunities at the right value. Sure. They should be less than fiscal '23 in the second half. Unfortunately, not as much of a recovery as we had hoped because of our original expectation on volume growth, which is, we covered in today's call, we're not seeing yet in Consumer or in the Specialty Products Group. But you are seeing in this quarter, and you'll see in future quarters, a real strong leverage to the bottom-line of our Construction Products Group and Performance Coatings Group, because of the MAP 25 benefits. When we have good volume and it's going to be coming, you're going to see nice leverage. Thank you. Good morning, Kevin. Yeah. So, I commented earlier in the call, Kevin, that, what we're seeing, particularly in Europe, is just a better focus and better organized approach. Think of it as a MAP to Growth for Europe. And so, we are driving efficiencies there. We're also having a more focused sales effort in a bunch of our businesses. And then, lastly, we're rounding some easier comps, particularly in UK, that went into a recession before most of the other markets that we serve. We also organized in what we call a platform approach for the developing world and it's having real positive effect. So, unless there is a some type of further disruption in a world with plenty of disruptions, I would expect that we would see really solid growth in Europe and the rest of the world and the growth in North America probably is not going to be a lot different in the coming quarter than you see here, again because of the year-over-year flat to negative in Consumer and Specialty Products Group. Hopefully, that will change in Q4, but we will see. Yeah. That's a great question, and yes, we do. The Specialty Products Group should be generating in a better economic environment, mid to slightly higher-teen EBIT margins, and they've been there before. The Guardian Products business was an outsized EBIT margin, but that was a $40 million business. And so, our expectations are, with an economic recovery, in a few years, especially Products Group will be back to the mid-single -- I'm sorry, mid-double-digit mid-teens EBIT growth. And to an earlier question, I'm very confident that we can get there. We're taking advantage of this opportunity now to synergize a few things. But if we don't get back there, then we would take a look at that Specialty Products Group or pieces of it in relationship to RPM's future. Happy New Year, Ghansham. No, the EBIT guidance is a favorable price cost mix and significant improvements from our MAP '25 initiatives. And as Frank Mitsch asked earlier, some better overhead absorption versus last year when we really tackled inventory, shut down production in a number of places. So, we've been very aggressive in rightsizing inventories and after, quite candidly, 30 years of my career, talking about improving working capital, finally getting around to getting it done on a sustainable basis. So, that's been our focus and we're executing and it's happening. So, we're excited about that. But the EBIT margin improvement is a combination of cost price mix which finally turned positive this fiscal year and the benefits to the MAP '25 program in our operations. One of the key things to that is that the vast majority of the MAP '25 initiatives are related to commercial activities in terms of how we incentivize salespeople relative to margins. It's focused on conversion costs in a number of areas there. So, the impact is mostly a gross margin impact, which means you don't realize it until you sell something. So, it's not like an SG&A cut that you can annualize over -- divide by 12 and annualize over a year. It really flows into your P&L as you move units. Sure. I think you're asking about maybe fiscal '25, which starts on June 1. Our fill rates are back in the high-90%s across the board. That was not true two years ago. We are at lower levels of inventory. And, last year for the first time in my career, shut down production in January and February to right-size inventories where typically we'd be adding inventory to sell into a big spring season. So, we've gotten much more agile in our manufacturing ability, so that we don't have to have the same size of safety stock. So those are the improvements that we have made. But fill rates are where they need to be. I think inventories for the most part in the supply chain are where they need to be. And we just need to help with our retail customers drive consumers back into the stores. Help them think of projects that they can do. And the real first opportunity for us to do that will be this spring because of the seasonality of the business in particular. You see, we expect good leverage in the third quarter, but the third quarter is not where we expect to see any revenue surprises because of the weather seasonality of some of our industrial businesses and certainly our Consumer Group. Good morning, Arun. No. We think that the Construction Products Group and Performance Coatings Group will have a solid second half of fiscal '24, and the dynamics that we had talked about earlier in terms of stimulus, infrastructure bills, and Increases in industrial capital spending and a resurgence in manufacturing, should bode well for those business units and product lines in fiscal '25. I think the thing that we're focused on is continuing to improve our businesses and operating leverage with the expectation, whether it's in Q4 or as we get into fiscal '25, seeing some positive unit volume growth at a Consumer and a return to growth in most of our Specialty Products Group companies. And again, that's what we are most exposed to OEM, coatings to residential construction and we're not alone in having a very difficult challenge. There are certain segments of manufacturing that have had a tough year and anything that touches housing in the last year has not done very well. Sure. I think we're on target for that. I think whether we can achieve that on the timeliness or within the timeframe that we communicated depends on when we see the turn in positive unit growth in Consumer and Specialty Products Group. But we'll have a pretty robust appraisal of that when we release our fourth quarter results in July and talk about the balance of our 2025 fiscal year, which is the end of the MAP '25 program. Sure. Yeah. Not at this time, but back to your earlier question, one of the key elements of getting to that 16% consolidated EBIT margin, is especially Products Group who's consolidated -- or Group level EBIT margins are in the mid-teens or slightly higher, which is up from about 9% or 10% level today. So, there needs to be a significant recovery there and we're focused on it. Without that, we will not hit the 16% consolidated goal. Thank you. We appreciate everybody's participation in our investor call this morning and for your continuing interest in RPM. I'd also like to thank our associates for their tremendous dedication and hard work in fiscal 2024. We are executing at a high level and you can see it in our results. And lastly, to all on the call, we wish you a happy, healthy, and prosperous New Year. Thank you and have a great day."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Matt Schlarb, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMatt Schlarb: Thank you, Andrea, and welcome to RPM International's conference call for the fiscal 2024 first quarter. Today's call is being recorded. Joining today's call are Frank Sullivan, RPM's Chairman and CEO; Rusty Gordon, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Michael Laroche, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. This call is also being webcast and can be accessed live or replayed on the RPM website at www.rpminc.com. Comments made on this call may include forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to be materially different. For more information on these risks and uncertainties, please review RPM's reports filed with the SEC. During this conference call, references may be made to non-GAAP financial measures. To assist you in understanding these non-GAAP terms, RPM has posted reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures on the RPM website. Also, please note that our comments will be on an as-adjusted basis and all comparisons are to the first quarter of fiscal 2023, unless otherwise indicated. We have provided a supplemental slide presentation to support our comments on this call. It can be accessed in the Presentations and Webcasts section of the RPM website at www.rpminc.com. Additionally, as we discussed on our most recent earnings call, certain businesses in Asia-Pacific that were previously part of the Construction Products Group are now being managed and reported under the Performance Coatings Group effective June 1, 2023. As a result, all references to CPG and PCG today reflect the updated structure. The recast businesses generate approximately $100 million in annual sales, and this change has no impact on consolidated results. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Frank.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you, Matt, and thank you to everyone for joining us on our call today. I'll begin today's call with an overview of our first quarter performance and then I'll turn the call over to Mike Laroche to discuss financials in more detail. Then Matt Schlarb will provide an update on one of our businesses. And then Rusty Gordon, our CFO will cover our outlook for the next quarter and the balance of fiscal '24. At the conclusion of the prepared remarks, we'll be pleased to answer your questions. Beginning on Slide 3 of our investor deck. Our associates are, to put it simply, executing at a very high level. We generated 4.1% sales growth in what can be best described as a mixed economic environment resulting in record first quarter sales. Driven by the continued execution of our MAP 2025 initiatives, we expanded margins and grew adjusted EBIT by 12.3% to an all-time quarterly record. These results represent the seventh consecutive quarter of record sales and adjusted EBIT. Importantly, we remain focused on converting this profitability into cash flow, and this focus resulted in $359.2 million of cash generated from our operating activities during the quarter, which is an all-time record. Moving to Slide 4. Sales were driven by pricing, mainly from the wraparound effect of increases implemented in fiscal 2023 and strong unit volume growth in our Construction Products Group. Our CPG was our fastest-growing segment as the team there leveraged its strategic focus on repair and maintenance and differentiated turnkey service model. As we've highlighted in the past, several of our businesses in our Performance Coatings Group and Construction Products Group have positioned themselves to benefit from spending on infrastructure and reshoring capital projects, which continued during the quarter. The successful execution of our MAP 2025 initiatives led to margin expansion during the quarter, particularly in businesses where volumes grew as we were able to more fully leverage the structural efficiency improvements that we put into place. MAP 2025 was a key driver in growing adjusted EBIT to an all-time record of $309 million. As I mentioned, this growth is in addition to strong results in the prior year. And our two-year stack sales and adjusted EBIT growth rates were 22% and 49%, respectively. MAP 2025 initiatives are also contributing to structural improvements in working capital. Through improved coordination between sales operations, procurement and R&D as well as being a more data-driven decision-making organization, we have become more agile with more efficient inventory processes. This contributed to strong cash flow conversion during the quarter. While we still have significant work to do in improving in this area, I'm proud of the progress we are making on a sustainable basis. Looking at sales by geography on Slide 5. Sales growth was strongest in Africa, the Middle East and Latin America, driven by continued spending on infrastructure projects in these emerging markets. This growth is in addition to strong prior year results when sales in these regions were up double-digits. Europe is expanding for the first time in over a year, while economic growth in the region remains subdued, our teams captured growth opportunities and are leveraging MAP 2025 initiatives to expand margins. While on the surface, sales growth in North America may appear moderate, it is important to keep in mind that in the prior year revenues increased in North America and nearly 23%. The two-year stack growth rate in North America is 26.1%. Overall, RPM has begun our fiscal year with positive momentum and our teams are executing at a high level on the things that we can control. We remain focused on executing our MAP 2025 program, leveraging our competitive strengths to capture growth opportunities, and bringing new products to market to continue growing throughout the fiscal year. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mike Laroche to cover our financial results in more detail.\nMichael Laroche: Thanks, Frank. Starting on Slide 6. Consolidated sales increased 4.1% to a first quarter record $2.01 billion, driven by pricing with modest volume growth. Organic sales increased 3.9% with foreign currency translation and acquisitions less divestitures, both contributing 0.1% to sales. Adjusted EBIT grew by 12.3% to an all-time record of $309 million during the quarter. Gross margin expansion was the driver of this growth, led by MAP 2025 initiatives and improved fixed-cost utilization, particularly at businesses with growing volumes. All segments, except Consumer, generated commodity cycle benefits. Because of Consumer's raw material basket and in particular TiO2 in metal packaging, this segment's raw material inflation has been larger and continued longer than the other segments. SG&A as a percentage of sales increased during the quarter, driven by growth investments and higher variable compensation expenses due to the improved financial performance. Expense reduction actions were implemented in the fourth quarter helped to offset the SG&A increase. Adjusted EPS grew 11.6% to $1.64, and was driven by adjusted EBIT growth. Turning to the segment results on Slide 7. Our Construction Products Group achieved all-time record sales of $783 million, an increase of 10.8% from the prior year period. Organic sales growth was 9.5% with acquisitions contributing 0.6%, and foreign currency translation adding 0.7% to sales. Sales growth was led by strength in our restoration systems for roofing, facades and parking structures, which benefited from the segment's strategic focus on repair and maintenance as well as its differentiated turnkey service model. Concrete admixtures and repair products also helped drive sales growth. After several quarters of sales declines, Europe returned to growth. As expected, new office construction was weak, but stronger demand in other end markets and our strategic focus on repair and maintenance more than offset this softness. Adjusted EBIT increased 33% to an all-time record $145 million, led by improved fixed cost leverage and MAP 2025 benefits, including commodity cycle benefits. As a result of improved financial performance, variable compensation increased and was partially offset by expense reduction actions put in place at the end of fiscal 2023. Additionally, as we recently announced, in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 CPG acquired a wall system fabricator to expand its offering in offsite panelized construction. The acquired business has annual sales of approximately $20 million. On Slide 8, the Performance Coatings Group achieved record net sales and adjusted EBIT. Revenue increased 4.1% to a record $379 million. Organic sales grew 4.0%, acquisitions added 0.8% and foreign currency translation was a 0.7% headwind. Sales were driven by strong demand for the segment's flooring systems and other engineered solutions for infrastructure and reshoring capital projects. Demand was strong internationally and increased pricing also contributed to growth. Adjusted EBIT increased 17.4% to an all-time record of $59 million. The growth was driven by strong sales and MAP 2025 benefits, led by commercial excellence programs in Europe and included commodity cycle benefits. These results are on top of a strong prior-year increase. Part of our MAP 2025 focus on improving profitability in Europe, PCG divested a non-core service business there. PCG incurred $14.6 million of charges related to this divested business, which are excluded from adjusted EBIT. Moving to the next slide, Specialty Products Group sales declined 10.7% to $181 million, organic sales declined 9.0%. Divestitures, net of acquisitions, reduced sales by 2.2%, and foreign currency translation was a tailwind of 0.5%. OEM demand was weak during the quarter, particularly in businesses that serve the residential sector, including coatings for furniture, doors, windows and cabinets. Additionally, SPG sales were negatively impacted by customers holding inventory levels below historical averages, which is pressuring volumes. The divestiture of the non-core furniture warranty business last fiscal year also reduced sales. Pricing helped to partially offset some of this weakness. SPG adjusted EBIT declined 39.6% to $18 million. The sales decline, product mix and unfavorable fixed cost leverage drove the decline. The divestiture of the non-core furniture warranty business also contributed to the adjusted EBIT decline. SG&A as a percentage of sales increased, driven by investments in growth initiatives and unfavorable impact of deleveraging a lower revenue. Expense reduction actions implemented at SPG in Q4 helped to offset this. Moving to Slide 10, the Consumer Group sales increased 1.5% to a first quarter record of $670 million. Organic sales increased 1.7%, foreign currency translation was a headwind of 0.2% and there was no impact from acquisitions. The sales growth was driven by increased pricing, primarily due to the large increase instituted during the first quarter of 2023 in response to inflation. Inflation, although less of a headwind, still persisted for the Consumer segment in the first quarter. As a reminder, Consumer faced the challenging prior year comparison as sales surged 22.5% in the first quarter of 2023, when it began restocking retailers after raw material -- raw material availability improved. Volumes declined moderately driven by reduced customer takeaway and certain customers holding inventory levels below historical averages. Share gains helped to partially offset these volume pressures. Adjusted EBIT increased 3.5% to $121 million, driven by MAP 2025 benefits and the sales increase. Cost inflation continued in the quarter and was a headwind to adjusted EBIT as was lower fixed cost utilization as we slowed production to normalize inventories. We also received a $10.3 million business interruption insurance reimbursement during the first quarter. And the gain associated with this reimbursement has been excluded from adjusted EBIT. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Matt to go over the balance sheet and cash flow, and provide a business update.\nMatt Schlarb: Thank you, Mike. Moving to Slide 11. The progress we made improving working capital during the fourth quarter continued in the first quarter driven by our inventory normalization actions and MAP 2025 initiatives to structurally improve working capital. Inventories declined by $223 million compared to the first quarter of 2023. Working capital management and strong profitability growth resulted in an all-time record cash flow from operating activities of $359 million compared to $24 million in the prior year. This enabled us to return $54 million to shareholders through dividends in the first quarter. We have continued our share repurchase program and have bought back $25 million of shares from the beginning of the fiscal year through the end of September. We also reduced debt by $178 million during the quarter. Now, turning to Slide 12, we'd like to provide an update on Pure Air, the indoor quality and HVAC service business that CPG acquired in fiscal 2022. Pure Air provides turnkey solutions to address indoor air quality and HVAC performance issues. These include environmental consulting, building diagnostics and HVAC system cleaning and restoration. As commercial HVAC systems age, they can become dirty and worn down, resulting in reduced performance, efficiency and air quality. These issues negatively impact all buildings that can become critical problems in places like hospitals and schools, which are key end markets for CPG. Pure Air's turnkey solutions address these challenges and offer building owners the possibility of restoring their HVAC equipment instead of replacing it, resulting in significant savings and reduced disruption to the building's occupants. Pure Air expand CPG's role as a partner to building owners, offering products and services focused on the repair, maintenance and restoration of all six sides of a building, which drives increased efficiency, extended asset life, and lower costs. Sales over the last 12 months are more than double what they were when Pure Air joined RPM, and we are optimistic about its future. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Rusty to cover the outlook.\nRusty Gordon: Thanks, Matt. Our outlook for the second quarter is on Slide 13. Many of the trends we experienced in the first quarter are expected to continue into the second quarter. On the positive side, the tailwinds include MAP 2025 including the commodity cycle, infrastructure and reshoring demand, reduced destocking, and resilient demand for repair and maintenance. As a reminder, some of our MAP 2025 benefits are more dependent on volumes to be fully realized. So they will naturally be lower in our seasonally lower-volume quarters of Q2 and Q3, and higher and stronger volume quarters, Q4 and Q1. Some of the challenges we expect to face in the second quarter are continued weakness in OEM demand, softness in some new construction end markets, and a reduced benefit from pricing, although pricing is still expected to be positive. We also faced challenging comparisons to the prior year when sales grew 9% and adjusted EBIT increased by 36%. Taking all of this into account, we are forecasting sales to increase in the low-single-digit range on a consolidated basis, led by CPG and PCG with specialty still showing declines. We expect adjusted EBIT margins to expand and to generate consolidated adjusted EBIT growth of high-single-digits to low-double-digits. Moving to Slide 14. Turning to our full year outlook, we still expect modest economic growth. Despite the soft macro backdrop, we are focused on leveraging the growth drivers we control including, number one, MAP 2025; number two, our strong position serving infrastructure and reshoring demand with our engineered solutions; and number three, our strategic focus on repair and maintenance. We also continue to expect to benefit from reduced inflation, reduced destockings and easier comparison in the second half of the year. As was the case last quarter, we anticipate weakness in certain new construction markets throughout the year and weakness in OEM demand, at least in the first half of the year. Our current outlook for 2024 on a consolidated basis remains unchanged. Sales are expected to increase in the mid-single-digit range, with adjusted EBIT growing in the low-double-digit to mid-teen range. This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now pleased to answer your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Mike Harrison of Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Mike.\nMike Harrison: Hi. Good morning. Congrats on a nice start to the year.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nMike Harrison: It seems like the Construction business was pretty strong across the board. Just curious, where are you expecting to see momentum continue? Where could we potentially see some choppiness? And can you breakdown the 9.5% organic growth between volume and pricing?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So boy, two-thirds to three quarters of their growth in the quarter was unit volume growth, and it was pretty strong at the Tremco Roofing WTI business at our Tremco Sealants business, Euclid. And then broadly, and this is mostly our Construction Products Group and our Performance Coatings Group in the Southern Hemisphere developing countries. And so real good strength there. In many instances, we're bucking trends. As we talked about in the past, we've had a real focused effort on investing in growth initiatives. And one of the real starts this year is something that in this quarter that Matt talked about, which is Pure Air, which is finally gaining some traction after its first year, which we got off to a slow start. Had to integrate it into WTI and into our Roofing sales force, and it's going very well. So that's one example of some of the very specific initiatives that we're investing in that's starting to pay off that's, I think, allowing us to buck some of the trends in the construction markets.\nMike Harrison: All right. And then over on the Specialty business, you mentioned that you're seeing weak demand from OEM customers, and it seems like that's going to continue into the November quarter. But any thoughts on what that business looks like once it stabilizes? Maybe talk a little bit about your longer-term growth and margin expectations for that Specialty segment.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So the biggest impact there is housing. We do a lot of wood stains and finishes into furniture, into windows and doors, kitchen cabinets. And so, notwithstanding the inventory mismatch for demand, particularly in this higher interest rate environment, the North American housing market, U.S. housing market is weak and continues to be weak, and that's hurt us. Some other categories that they have been strong in, including manufactured housing and/or RVs. And those are weak after the post-COVID bump. All that notwithstanding, we have some very targeted initiatives in our Kop-Coat adjuvant business. There's some patented products there that allow for a significant reduction in the use of herbicides and pesticides. We believe in the long-term benefit of that business, and we're investing in that. We're investing in an expanding MRO channel for our Legend Brands business that should take out some of the storm-related cyclicality. Those are just a few examples. And, the one thing that the lower volume is hiding is some significant MAP 2025 improvements in our Specialty Products Group. But as Rusty highlighted, most of these improvements are on the manufacturing floor and/or cost price mix items. And with improved conversion cost, better handle on mix, those benefits only show up when we sell something. And so the lower volume is hiding, I think, the good efforts in our Specialty Products Group folks have made, along with the rest of RPM and executing on the MAP '25 initiative.\nMike Harrison: All right. Thank you very much.\nFrank Sullivan: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi of Baird. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Ghansham.\nGhansham Panjabi: Good morning, Frank. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for fitting me in. I guess as a follow-up to the last question on construction and the margin improvement that you saw there. Frank, you highlighted several factors, fixed cost improvement, raw materials, MAP savings, et cetera. How would you have us think about those dynamics from a stack rank standpoint in terms of the margin bridge year-over-year?\nFrank Sullivan: Could you repeat that? I'm not sure I understand the question, Ghansham.\nGhansham Panjabi: Yes. So the margin improvement in CPG, I think, was up 310 basis points year-over-year. Just the main drivers as it relates to that.\nFrank Sullivan: So I think the main drivers are MAP '25 initiatives where we're seeing improvement in conversion costs. I mentioned this, what we call D3 initiative at RPM. It's data-driven decision-making. So we are much better today at driving mix on a going-forward basis, and that's helping us. We are benefiting in the quarter from the commodity cycle disinflation that we're starting to benefit in a few places, construction products is certainly one of those. And then it really is very focused efforts in strategic initiatives around repair and maintenance. So we're seeing real strong results in our core roofing business. All of that is - we're 95% reroofing and repair on existing roofs, not new construction. Pure Air has been very strong, and we expect that to continue. We'll see tens of millions of dollars of new volume from that initiative. Panelization is something we've been working on for the last three years or four years. We just added a significant piece of that with this Texas acquisition we announced in this past week. So it's really focusing on the things that we can control that tend to be in the large repair and maintenance areas. The last comment I'll make is that hospitals have been a significant market for us, and we had some booming business there during and coming out of COVID. Last year was not a good spending year for that sector. And so that weighed on our performance in fiscal '23, and we're seeing some pickup on a relative basis there and also some pickup on Nudura, which had a challenge '23 because of what's happening in the residential market. But again, a very focused effort on expanding the understanding and the specifications for the Nudura ICF system. So again, it's a lot of self-help and a lot of very deliberate spending into specific initiatives across RPM, and you're seeing the results of that spending best impacting our Construction Products Group as we sit here today.\nGhansham Panjabi: Yes. Perfect. Thank you for that, Frank. And then just in terms of the balance sheet, what do you expect the balance sheet to sort of end up at the end of fiscal year '24 on a net debt to EBITDA basis? And just related to that, how are you thinking about capital allocation in terms of - in context of where interest rates are and all the macroeconomic uncertainty? And I guess I'm referring specifically to your appetite for incremental acquisitions.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. Great question. And - so let me step back, big picture, and kind of just address simply, what are we trying to do with this MAP program and it's really two things. We're trying to significantly improve our cash conversion cycle and it's working. And we're trying to be more data-driven in our decision-making with a real focus on investing in specific organic growth initiatives, and you're seeing that work, particularly in our Construction Products Group. And so what that looks like is a record first - record fourth quarter cash from operations, followed by record first quarter cash from operations, notwithstanding a handful of acquisitions and maybe $25 million or so of what did we acquire Rusty last year in share repurchases?\nRusty Gordon: I mean, last year, we did $50 million.\nFrank Sullivan: $50 million in share repurchases. Year-over-year, we've reduced debt by $332 million. And so that focus on cash conversion is really working. We expect that those improvements to continue. And so that's big picture of what we're trying to do. The volatility that we've all experienced over the last few years is continuing. And so, as we work with our Board, I think we'll have a better answer in the coming quarters, Ghansham, about how we think about capital allocation. But as we sit here today, the M&A market is relatively slow. We will continue to execute on good strategic small- to medium-sized deals. But the days of huge multiples, in my opinion, are over, if not forever, at least temporarily. We went through a period of time where incremental cost of capital was almost zero. That is not true today. And so given the choppiness in the markets and the MAP initiatives that are benefiting our conversion costs and our efficiency, we are focusing a lot of time and attention on driving organic growth where we can. It's easier said than done in an economic environment that is, as Rusty likes to say, feels like a rolling recession, both geographically and across sectors.\nGhansham Panjabi: Understood. Thank you.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from John McNulty of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, John.\nJohn McNulty: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I guess the first one would just be on raw materials. Your previous destocking over the last few quarters that you guys were implementing and FIFO makes it a little bit complicated to kind of think about how raws are really trending for you. So, I guess, can you help us to think about - it looks like you got some improvement in the first quarter. How should we think about that continuing to flow through in terms of deflation throughout the rest of [technical difficulty]. And has the move in oil recently - has that had any impact upward on some of the raw material trends that you pay attention to? How should we be thinking about that?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. The - I'll address your last portion of your question first. The only place where we're seeing the move in oil prices impact us immediately is in acetone. That's a - it impacts a number of our coatings businesses, but in particular, Rust-Oleum. So in general, as you followed RPM for many years, we in our industry follow the commodity cycle increases up with lagging price increases, and so you see some margin compression. And then as the commodity cycle cycles down, we typically pick up the lost margin. We are now experiencing that in Q1, in most of our businesses and segments, except Consumer. We would expect to begin to see that in Consumer in Q2. You know we're rounding metal packaging increases that were pretty extreme and are paying attention to some tariff activity relative to tin plate, which is the, you know, primary raw material for metal packaging and spray cans, things like that. TiO2 is up modestly year-over-year and acetone is the only raw material that we see reacting to current price increases. So, the commodity cycle benefited us, particularly in our Construction Products and Performance Coatings segment in Q1, and we would expect it to continue to be a benefit to margin expansion in Q2 as well. Again, that's another one of those things that is volume-driven. You get the benefit when you sell something.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. Okay. No, fair enough. And then maybe just on the Consumer segment. So you spoke to - it sounds like some of your customers are drawing down inventory kind of below normal levels. I guess, can you help us to think about if that's largely played out at this point or if there's still a disconnect in terms of the point of sales and what you're seeing in terms of pull? And then I guess, maybe as an add-on to that, you mentioned some share gains. I guess, can you speak to those as well?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So our Consumer segment is continuing to perform, I think, at a good level. I think most of the inventory adjustments are behind us. They were certainly significant in the last year. I will tell you in terms of consumer takeaway, while it is improved, meaning less negative, it still trends across different product categories in different channels and the kind of low- to mid-negative range, which is a slight improvement from what we experienced in the second half of last year, which was kind of solidly mid- to upper-single-digit negative consumer takeaway. Some of that's hangover from the COVID bump. As we had communicated in the past, we had lost some share in a major big-box account. Some of that was related to our own supply challenges. Our supply challenges are over. Our fill rates are back to solid numbers. Through the MAP initiative, we have created through efficiencies, 40 million or 50 million units of volume. And so we're in really good shape today there. And product gains have been with our universal. We're picking up share in new accounts, and that's going really well. The Rust-Oleum five-in-one spray is showing some incremental gains, and I'd say incremental. Any positive numbers in the face of slightly negative consumer takeaway look good. We've got some new product introductions DAP, a two-component spray foam and one can that's being introduced really well as well as a textured spray that's being well-received. So new product introductions are going well, and we actually experienced because of the new product introductions, some positive unit volume growth in the quarter at DAP. And so that's kind of the broad overview of what's happening in Consumer.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. Thanks very much for the color.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. Thanks, John.\nOperator: The next question comes from Stephen Byrne of Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Steve.\nStephen Byrne: Good morning, Frank. I've got a question for you on CPG. Do you have a view as to how much of the revenue in that segment is generated from service versus selling materials? And that could be a complicated question given your - some turnkey projects. But I asked about this service component because it seems as if it's something that you're expanding into this Pure Air model seems to be service and your restoration and maintenance on roofing seems to be - you know, there's a service revenue component. And just wondering if you had an estimate on that. And maybe more importantly, would you see that model potentially expanding into other areas of service such as cleaning or water treatment, something beyond the air quality inside the building?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So great question. And in general, our Construction Products Group revenues are about 30%, maybe slightly higher 30% service revenues with roughly 70% driven by product sales. It's a little bit - and there's a little ambiguity there because in most instances, we're not selling - in some cases, we sell only repair services or other services, but in many instances, those services go hand in glove with the material sale for a reroofing project, for instance. I would expect that over time to expand. And we talked about Pure Air, that's a good example. That addresses right at indoor air quality. And it - we have been asked for many, many years as we're on the roof with our WTI services group and addressing issues on the roof and not just roofing materials, but rooftop safety in terms of the work that Tremco does with fiber grade in terms of railings and walkways. We've been asked for many years, can we address HVAC issues in repair and the answer for too long was no. Two years ago, we acquired Pure Air and there's a key element of this. It took us a while to fix. And that is a service business, whereby we do an assessment of existing HVAC systems and then have really good capabilities to clean, disinfect, and repair components. And it was a $20 million business when we acquired it. We expect a few tens of millions of dollars of revenue growth this year and the potential for that is meaningfully higher. And so as that rose as a share of our business that will grow, that 30% services business higher. The benefits are basically about one-third cost versus total replacement. The immediate benefits are significant improvement in efficiency of an old system that's getting worn down because of blades or motors or other things. And there is a measurable benefit immediately in indoor air quality. And so for the hospitals and school system, customers that our Construction Products Group serve, it's a really exciting market for us.\nStephen Byrne: And Frank, any thoughts about expanding some of that service to go into other issues such as cleaning services, for example, or water?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes. I think the expansion will come from our continued market share gains, broadly roofing. But the areas that will expand like a Pure Air are where we can add value. So we can add significant value versus replacement. And so we'll look for other opportunities but they'll be limited to areas where we can truly add value as opposed to areas that are more commodity-like in services. And I think it's critical and it's back to that component of it's not just the service, but it's adding the material element or the cleaning or disinfecting or blade repair components that go along with it. One other factor, which is also true for our Stonhard flooring business, and the reason that we got off to a rough start in the first year of Pure Air was staffing. I think anybody that is doing any work in residential or commercial and industrial construction, workforce issues are significant. We have solved that issue with Pure Air with our WTI roofing workforce. We have a great collection of installers with our Stonhard business. And so that certainty of having our people on the job on time, staying on the job to get it done in this environment is also getting us a competitive advantage in the roofing and the HVAC restoration and in the industrial flooring markets.\nStephen Byrne: Okay. Thank you, Frank. And one quick one on Nudura. Do you see the value proposition of that product to be more in, you know, its insulation value, thus either cold or hot climates, or more for its hurricane tornado protective value? And how are you marketing that product based on those two value propositions?\nFrank Sullivan: So the simple answer to that is yes. It's one of the most energy-efficient building systems for residential and commercial structures in the market today. It's got its unique characteristics that we continue to have to educate people on. But it's also one of the most durable residential and commercial structures today. So for instance, we got approval for Nudura specifications for schools in Kentucky. And that was, in part, a direct result of a terrible experience they had with a tornado a few years ago. The durability of Nudura in hurricanes is also becoming well-known, and so it's a combination of the energy efficiency for people that are looking for net-zero buildings. We completed the first net-zero school in Kentucky a year ago. It's not just the new Nudura piece, it's other building components, but -- so we can deliver that and the durability in the face of expectations for more climate-driven weather events.\nStephen Byrne: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Josh Spector of UBS. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Josh.\nJosh Spector: Hi. Good morning, Frank. So, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask on group pricing overall and maybe if you could drill into the segments a little bit more beyond Construction. I guess based on what you've given, I mean, it seems like price was up 3.5-ish percent. Our math at least is on a stack versus a few years ago. Second half last year, you're tracking about 30% pricing multiyear stack. This quarter implies maybe about mid-20s. I'm not sure if those numbers are right with your thinking that there has been a step down sequentially or not. And just curious how you think pricing would trend in the various segments based on that information through the rest of the year.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. And we don't provide that detail by segment. But on a consolidated basis, we're in the 3.5% range. So, you know, across our businesses, you're seeing price impact in the quarter that might be as low as 1.5% and might be as high as 5%, depending - and it's really not by segment, it's by product line and really driven by raw material issues. But on a consolidated basis, we were about 3.5% price in the quarter.\nJosh Spector: Okay. Thanks. I mean, I guess the crux of my question more is, is there any sequential step down in pricing in any of the segments? Or is that math may be incorrect?\nFrank Sullivan: No, I think that's correct. I mean, again, we've been fighting and it's not unique to us or the whole industry for that matter, most manufacturing a commodity cycle that's bigger than any of us have ever seen. Over a two-year period, we saw more than $500 million of raw material price impacts in our Consumer business. And so it took us a long time to get on top of that. And I can tell you the other aspect of it, and this is something that I said in the spring of '22, and we were early. We were starting to see inflation throughout our whole P&L. And so we've seen inflation, which continues, while raw material inflation is abating and our regulated price increases are stepping down, and you can see that with the data I just gave you this quarter. Labor is still an issue. Items like insurance, are a meaningful issue in terms of higher inflation. And so inflation still exists in a number of factors and inflation still exists because of interest rates in the housing market. And I think that's part of the challenges that we're seeing, particularly in our Specialty Products Group.\nJosh Spector: So I guess - sorry, to clarify one more time. So sequentially, when you're talking about inflation still persisting, are your pricing moving up sequentially, down sequentially or holding sequentially in terms of how you're thinking about this quarter and your outlook?\nFrank Sullivan: So in the quarter, year-over-year, we're up 1%.\nRusty Gordon: In which quarter?\nFrank Sullivan: This quarter?\nRusty Gordon: Oh, the second quarter?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes.\nRusty Gordon: Yes, we're going to lap some anniversaries of selling price increases, Josh. So yes, we would expect marginal decrease in that 3.5% price effect.\nFrank Sullivan: But it's - you know, again, there's a few areas where we've had price increases where it was just necessary to get them that are a little outside of cycle, but we are seeing the impact of price sequentially step down. And so I can't give you the numbers for future quarters other than - in this quarter, price increases accounted for about 3.5%, and we would expect that to sequentially slowly bleed out in the next couple of quarters. And the things that we're paying attention to are odd off ones, again, relative to oil prices and their impact in other areas, tin plate relative to tariff activity that's being pushed in Congress. So there are a couple of areas that we're paying attention to, but nothing that's impacting additional price increases today.\nJosh Spector: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Aleksey.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning. This is Ryan on for Aleksey. So I guess my first question, I understand there's a number of different pockets of non-res, but can you walk us through how demand is kind of trending in each of those markets? And have you seen any signs of slowdown in backlogs in any of those markets? Thank you.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So, you know, there's not too many - in the construction markets, there's not too many good statistics to point to. Residential construction is taking it on the chin in North America, which is where we have our primary exposure. Commercial construction is not very strong. You know, you look at the office glut and what's happening there. The build out of the Amazon distribution centers, things like that have run their course in terms of the big growth. So there's not a lot of good signs to point to. The areas of strength for us are the things that we talked about, very deliberate initiatives around maintenance and repair in the sectors that we have strengthened. And so, I think our performance is kind of bucking the underlying trends. And a big part of that is in our construct and products group, I would say we have maybe a 30% or 35% exposure in new construction between residential and commercial, which means we're in the 65% to 70% less cyclical renovation, repair, reconstruction, reroofing markets. And I think those markets are stable, and we're picking up share given some of the new initiatives we have. The other area that - the only area that's showing continued strength is related to industrial construction and capital spending driven by the onshore movement and a substantial amount of government subsidies in that area. And that is impacting Construction Products Group a little bit and our Performance Coatings Group more.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got you. Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then just I have a question on your comment in the deck here in the Specialty Products Group. So you mentioned customers held inventories below historical levels. I mean does this mean destocking this business is over and there's been no uptick from restocking? Can you kind of try and parse that out for us? Thank you\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I think it's over. I don't know that it would have a much of a big impact going forward. But a good example is because the supply chain challenges into RVs and what remaining furniture or cabinet making is done. It was very common for those businesses pre-COVID to shut down for instance, in the month of January for maintenance and other things. And during the COVID period and in the post-COVID period with supply chain challenges, those shutdowns disappeared. Well, they showed back up in calendar '23. And so they got back to normal shutdowns. There was inventory adjustments. The other thing that I don't think we've emphasized enough here is most of this is done, but not all of it. But starting in December of last year, really driven by better data and our MAP '25 initiatives, we very deliberately shut our own production in a number of areas to make some permanent inventory adjustments. And so, you know, in the second half of '23, we had tens of millions of dollars of unabsorbed overhead, both from lower volumes from a market perspective but also lower volumes from deliberate decisions to shut down productions in some of our specialty products companies, in our Consumer group and other areas to really address some permanent inventory level issues across RPM. Most of that is behind us as well.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Huang of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nDavid Huang: Hi, good morning.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, David.\nDavid Huang: I think in a deflation cycle, you historically generate $100 million to $200 million price cost tailwind. Can you talk about how much was the price cost tailwind on a dollar basis in FQ1? And then with higher oil prices now and some lingering inflation in consumer, maybe help us understand your expectation on price cost realization, this cycle versus the historical $100 million to $200 million range.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So I can give you a big picture. I don't know that we would disclose that by quarter. So, big picture in our MAP initiative, we laid out a goal, and it was actually a year ago that we went public with the MAP goals of achieving $465 million worth of savings. And about $115 million of that was our expectation of commodity cycle recovery. So non-MAP-driven initiatives, just the normal commodity cycle recovery. Our target this year in MAP savings is $160 million. I would venture that half of that is going to be commodity rate cycle recovery. You know, depending on our dynamics and looking at the past, it's possible that we would exceed that $115 million. But again, time will tell as the pending quarter's results happen.\nDavid Huang: Got it. And then on SG&A. I guess, first, can you talk about the investments you're making? And if demand gets worse from here, how much can you pair back from those spendings? And then can you also quantify the year-over-year headwind on incentive comp for your business?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. I'll let Rusty address the incentive comp issue and some of it is a truly incentive comp, which is higher based on higher results and better mix and some of it's continued inflation and wages and salaries.\nRusty Gordon: Sure. Yes. In terms of the SG&A for the quarter, David, there is a few areas of compensation. One obviously is commissions go up when we sell more, especially of higher margin products, which we're pushing, and you saw that on the gross margin line. Another area would be performance-related bonus accruals were up a few million dollars during the quarter. And then on, you know, basic salary and wage inflation and SG&A, you know, typically, those have run over the long-term about 3%. They're up more in the 4% to 5% range right now. So as a result of that, pay increases were probably, you know, in the $6 million or $7 million range impacting SG&A.\nFrank Sullivan: And to your - the first part of your question, roughly 25% or 30% of the SG&A increase in Q1 was driven by focused - we call them big ideas for growth, BIG, at our businesses. And so I can give you broadly some of the things. These are just directional. But in our Construction Products Group, Pure Air, panelization, Nudura are getting a lot of attention and extra investment. One example in our Performance Coatings segment is a project that we're in our second year called C2B, which is Carboline to $1 billion. And there is specific initiatives in Canada, Europe and in non-oil and gas segments. In our Specialty Products Group, we are focused on a turnaround of our DayGlo resin and fluorescent color business. I mentioned previously the specific investments in the Kop-Coat patented adjuvants as well as the channel - MRO channel focus for Legend Brands, which is a new market for them. In Consumer, we're very focused on increasing advertising and promotion around some of the new product introductions at DAP and Rust-Oleum. For the balance of the year, if we follow through with our plans, probably anywhere from 30% to 40% of SG&A increases would be associated with these specific initiatives with the intent of driving organic growth. All of these are easy to cut back, and I don't say that cavalierly. You know, in some instances, it's hiring more salespeople or tech service people, in other areas, it's truly advertising or promotion or digital advertising. But as we sit here today, we think that's pennywise and pound foolish. And it is our specific intent to focus some of the MAP savings on these specific growth investments. And if we're successful, you'll see in the coming year, some more stories like what we're talking about in our Construction Products Group today. We expect that to continue in CPG for the balance of the year. They got good momentum in these new initiatives. And on the flip side, if we bump into the deep recession that some economists fear, there are tens of millions of dollars of SG&A that could be cut pretty quickly.\nDavid Huang: Got it. Thank you.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mike Sison of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Mike.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Richard on for Mike.\nFrank Sullivan: Okay. Hi, Richard.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. So - yes. First question, you saw strong growth in Europe, over 9% year-over-year growth. You did divest one non-core business in Performance Coatings. So can you give me some color on what end markets were driving strong growth this quarter in Europe? And should we expect margins to improve somewhat from the divested business?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes. So I think part of the European story is Europe really was negatively impacted by recessionary elements and then the Russian war on Ukraine. And so we experienced a very challenging performance in Europe in calendar '22 and most of fiscal '23, and so some of it is we're rounding easier comparisons. The other area is that we are having a more focused effort in the MAP '25 initiatives in Europe. For instance, our MS-168 initiative, which is really driving lean manufacturing and continuous improvement disciplines across our plants. It's a very in-plant, hands-on, utilizing outside consultants process. It takes weeks. It's followed up by performance audits on a 90-day cycle. That got interrupted by COVID. And so our efforts were halted a little bit. The lion share of it was initially focused on our larger plants in North America. We're seeing those benefits now happen in Europe. We positioned Dave Dennsteadt, who's our Performance Coatings Group President. We also had a big presence in Europe. He and his family moved this summer to Europe, and he has a senior leader oversight to help accelerate some of the opportunities to drive efficiencies more aggressively in Europe. The decision to divest a business in the U.K. and close some underperforming operations were part of that. And so all of that should bode favorably for growth and margin expansion in Europe quarter-by-quarter and over the next couple of years.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks. And then just a follow-up, you know, strong EBIT margin growth on CPG as well. Is there a limit to how much additional margin improvement we can see there? Obviously, you got 18.5%. Maybe talk about some of the specific to CPG, you know, benefits from MAP and pricing as well.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. You know, I don't know that I would talk specifically about limits to EBIT margin growth in any of our businesses. We still have room to grow. But not surprising from my earlier comments, there is a trade-off in the near term between expanding margins and investing in organic growth. And back to the big picture thing, you know, if we simplify across RPM internally into our investors what we're trying to do here, it's significantly improve our cash conversion cycle and ramp up organic growth initiatives. And we think the economic circumstances that we're in call for that, and we're having really good progress in the cash conversion cycle improvement, and there's more to come. And we're having really good improvement on the organic growth piece in Construction Products, and we're hopeful that we'll see more benefits across more RPM companies in the coming year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Frank Mitsch of Fermium Research. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Frank.\nFrank Mitsch: Good morning, Frank, to you as well. Nice start to the year. I want to come back to the MAP 2025. I believe you mentioned before that you're expecting a benefit of $160 million in fiscal 2024. But I - my understanding is that's the run rate, right, that you're expecting to end this year? And you guys are actually expecting about $100 million to impact the 2024 P&L? Is my understanding correct?\nFrank Sullivan: That is 100% correct, and I appreciate you're clarifying that.\nFrank Mitsch: All right. Great. And what was the actual benefit that you saw in the first quarter from MAP 2025 of the $309 million EBIT?\nRusty Gordon: We ran at about the run rate you'd expect. So it was about a quarter of that year's benefit, maybe a touch ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: So $25 million or $30 million. And, you know, we communicated in July. We had a $120 million goal in fiscal '23, we exceeded that. And we have a $160 million run rate goal. And you're right, we expect $100 million of it to flow through our P&L. Some of that is benefits that will begin to be realized in the second half of the year in terms of run rate. Some of that is the impact of FIFO accounting, both in terms of conversion costs and the commodity cycle benefit that shows up in our case, maybe 60 days or 90 days later than were we on LIFO. And so that's what's happening there. But we are on or slightly ahead of target for that $160 million run rate for the year. And as I said earlier, I would expect about half of that or slightly less than half of that to be associated with the commodity cycle benefits as well. This should be the year unless we get surprised by oil prices or some other spikes. And as we look in the past, where the lion's share of the commodity cycle benefits should show up.\nFrank Mitsch: Got you. Well, we are seeing oil starting to pick up since the beginning of July. But I wanted to also ask a bigger-picture macro question. You know, given that the guide for the year assumes no recession, and you know you'd been indicating that you've been seeing red turn to yellow turn to green. I believe you mentioned last quarter and reading through the release, you know, it sounded fairly promising. So I'm just curious as to where do you stand on the whole hard landing, soft landing, no landing for the U.S. economy for your fiscal year.\nFrank Sullivan: Yes. I think - and maybe Rusty can comment on this. Rusty Gordon has captured the sentiment of this a bit better than any economist I know, and maybe it's a combination of his reading and seeing our numbers. But it feels like we're going through a rolling recession and the housing market is taking it on the chin, you can see it in our Specialty Products Group results, you can see it in companies that serve residential construction and/or the components that go into that, furniture and other things. Retail takeaway has not been very strong across many categories. And as we commented in the second half of last year, POS in our categories tended to be mid- to high-negative single-digits. We're seeing that improve, which means it's less bad. And so I'm hopeful that there'll be somewhat of a soft landing in the sense that this is a rolling recession. Again, Europe went in early. We're seeing better performance in Europe. I think there is more stability around the impact of the Russia war on Ukraine. We're rounding easier, comps and quite candidly, there's some reasonable growth in the U.K., for instance. And the U.K. seems to be performing better than continental Europe as we sit here. And for us that's a good thing because a little less than half of our revenues in Europe come out of the U.K. And so that's the best shot I have at that, Frank. And other than to say a lot of our performance in this quarter and what we expect in the second quarter is as much self-help as it is counting on any economic green shoots or pickups.\nFrank Mitsch: Very helpful. Thank you so much.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kevin McCarthy of Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Kevin.\nKevin McCarthy: Good morning. Frank, I wanted to ask about the impact of fiscal stimulus. It seems like the infrastructure and reshoring project contributions have really gained some traction over the last couple of quarters. Can you speak to the kind of the magnitude and duration of that tailwind? Do you think it will continue to accelerate as the year progresses or flatten out? And when do you see the peak in that phenomenon?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes. I still think that there is a significant amount of fiscal stimulus coming. You know, the infrastructure bill that was passed on a bipartisan basis I think was $1.2 trillion. I think the analysis of that not all of it was infrastructure. But you know if half of it, $500 billion or $600 billion was infrastructure, that's still coming. I can - you can see that in highway construction. You could see that in the onshoring of manufacturing. You can see that in some expansions in airports. So I think as we sit here today, we see that having a pretty good runway for the next 1.5 years or two years. And that's our best guess. It's not having any impact on residential construction and the housing market. And I think that in commercial construction as well. There's two big macro trends that are fighting each other. One is massive amounts, trillions of dollars of federal subsidies and stimulus fighting the fastest interest rate increase that this country has ever seen. And you look at bond rates today, the cost of mortgage, the cost of rent, the cost of a lot of things that are debt-driven are continuing to go up. So those are the two macro trends, I think, that are fighting each other relative to how these things impact the economy to your question and impact us. But for portions of our Construction Products Group and portions of our Performance Coatings Group, we think there's still pretty good tailwinds there.\nKevin McCarthy: That's a great segue to my second question. You spoke earlier on the call, Frank, about how higher interest rates, you know, render acquisitions a bit less appealing relative to the era of free money. The flip side of the coin is, you know, maybe divestitures become less punitive or less dilutive. And in the case of low-margin businesses, we're starting to see a couple of examples where divestitures can actually be accretive. And so I'm tempted to ask you, as you kind of look across the portfolio, do you think the next year or two could be an interesting window for what I would call portfolio cleanup, divestitures, you know, perhaps some candidates and specialty products or elsewhere in the portfolio to follow the trend that you started with Guardian?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. We're continuing to look as part of our MAP 2025 initiative at opportunities to improve margins where we have low-margin, no-growth businesses. The latest example of that was in this quarter where in the U.K. we were able to sell off a service element of our USL business and then also restructure a piece. Taking the high-margin product lines and putting it in different parts of RPM paid off nicely. The divested piece has gone to a group that will retain all the employees there and continue to drive that business in a manner that works for them, but was not margin-positive for RPM. So part of the self-help and what we expect to be a quarter-by-quarter and meaningful improvement in European margins is not only the broader dynamics we're talking about, but divesting or closing or restructuring lower margin, no growth businesses. There is more of that to come over the next year in our MAP initiative in different segments, and it tends to be either product line or specific facility-related. And when they're executed, we'll provide details.\nKevin McCarthy: Perfect. Thanks very much.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning, Jeff.\nJeff Zekauskas: Hi. Good morning. Thanks very much. I think on an adjusted basis your SG&A costs were up about 12% in the quarter. Isn't that way too high? And in general, should your SG&A costs grow above the rate of sales growth, below the rate of sales growth, at the rate of sales growth over a longer period of time, or do you not have a target?\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So in general the SG&A in the quarter was up 10.9%. And so I'm not sure where the adjusted number came from - \nJeff Zekauskas: That's 10.9%. Yes. Yes.\nFrank Sullivan: And you know it really goes back to my earlier comments. A couple of things are driving higher SG&A, some of it is continued inflation and wages and salaries that we're beginning to annualize. Those - we're not seeing that so much today as we were seeing it throughout fiscal '23. And so in the first half of fiscal '22, the higher wages and salaries, insurance costs, all the things that impact us and all our peers are there. The other element is really twofold. One is being much more deliberate about driving mix. I mean you're talking to a CFO and CEO in a company who maybe five years or seven years ago wasn't very good at analyzing mix with great accuracy in hindsight. And today with the data initiatives we have in place on the ground at the operating level, we're much better at driving mix going forward. Where do we want to incentivize our sales forces to focus their time? With higher mix comes higher commissions, particularly in our Construction Products and Performance Coatings Group where we still have a fair amount of commission-based sales. And then lastly are the very targeted initiatives that I've been talking about. We fully intend as part of MAP '25 to take some of these margin savings and reinvest them in our P&L and growth initiatives. It's paying off in a big way in Construction Products today, and I think as long as we can generate solid sales growth and earnings growth. And again, I would remind you we're generating positive results as RPM and in most of our segments, other than SPG, on top of big mountains. You know, last year, Consumer sales were up 22.5%. You know, RPM had an all-time record, Q1. I think our EBIT last year in Q2 was an all-time record, and it was up 36%. We expect to top that. And so as long as we have forward momentum on the sales line, and we're experiencing both the improved cash conversion cycle and the margin enhancements that we expect, we will continue to reinvest in these growth initiatives. And then we have to have the discipline when, after a couple - two years or three years of investing, we're not seeing the expected results to cut back in those areas. As I mentioned earlier, Jeff, as well, we are targeting very specifically what we call BIG, big ideas for growth investments separately in an SG&A sheet. And if the economy turns sour quickly, we have already lined up the specific SG&A cuts that we could make.\nJeff Zekauskas: Okay. And then maybe a follow-up.\nFrank Sullivan: Yes, I would just comment on that. As long as we continue to outperform quarter-by-quarter versus some big year - you know, big pounds last year, I would expect for the balance of the year for you to see SG&A rise at a level higher than sales, while at the same time, you'll see gross margin and EBIT margin expansion for the year. In the long run, SG&A should grow at or below the level of sales growth. That's correct.\nJeff Zekauskas: Okay. Good. Right. And then for my follow-up, sort of a two-part follow-up. Should inventory levels change very much this year? You know you're kind of flat sequentially, but raw materials are down and demand is sort of soft. And then in Construction, I think you talk about mid-single-digit growth for the second quarter, but you grew organically around 10 in the first quarter. And I get it that, you know, the price comparisons will be a little bit harder. But, you know, what accounts for the step down in Construction growth? And, you know, will inventories change very much from where we are?\nRusty Gordon: Yes, on the inventory side, Jeff, as you know, we have MAP objectives to reduce working capital, and inventory is a major piece of that. You've seen progress this year. I think what might be a bit different as we go forward for RPM is traditionally, you know, in the late time, we would build up safety stocks for the big spring orders. And I think thanks to a lot of our MAP improvements, you will not see that as pronounced going forward for RPM because we'll be able to respond better to typical higher seasonal demand. So that's your answer on inventory.\nFrank Sullivan: Yes. And in general, this year, I would expect a 300 basis point, maybe more improvement in working capital as a percent of sales. And you're seeing that. You know, we had an all-time record cash flow in Q4, all-time record cash flow in Q1. And inventory improvement has been a meaningful part and working capital improvement has been a meaningful part of that record cash flow generation along with margin expansion. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Morning, Vince.\nSteve Haynes: Hi, this is actually Steve Haynes on for Vincent. Thanks for squeezing me in here. A question on the guidance. You know first quarter was a bit better than expected. Looks like 2Q is also kind of a bit better than expected and your macro views don't sound, you know, that much worse at the margin versus kind of where we were last quarter. So I guess kind of what's keeping you from being more biased towards the high end of your guidance range?\nFrank Sullivan: Yes, great question. The volatility we've experienced over the last two years or three years is what's keeping us from being more bullish. We have seen sharp turns in economic conditions that we didn't expect. We've seen trends that look great for a while and then reversed. And there's nothing about all the headlines. Not to get too big picture, but, you know, whether it's government shutdowns or you know, anticipating things might get a little dicier as we get into an election year. And as bond rates actually start to rise, maybe we'll see a normal bond cycle in terms of the reverse of the current interest rate inversion. There's nothing that suggests that the economy is getting better. And so we're focused on delivering what we can control, anticipating that we're going to see challenges. Boy, if, you know, we hit a soft landing and the start of calendar '24 is peaches and cream with our MAP initiatives and positive unit volume growth across our organization with easy comparisons, we'll have a blowout second half. Most of our reading of the economy is people are anticipating that if we're going to have recession, it's going to start at the beginning of next year. And so we don't have any confidence that the economy is getting better. We just know the things that we can positively impact are continuing to happen. So we're pretty confident in Q2. And beyond that, we'll give you our level of confidence or lack thereof for the second half of the year when we have a chance to talk to investors in January.\nSteve Haynes: Okay. Thank you. Helpful context.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nFrank Sullivan: Good morning. Yes, good morning, Arun.\nArun Viswanathan: Good morning, Frank. How are you?\nFrank Sullivan: Good. Thank you.\nArun Viswanathan: I just wanted to go along those lines. I had kind of the same question as to potentially why you're not raising guidance for the full year, but also wanted to add on there, you know, a lot of folks that we speak to are speaking about destocking and inventories coming down. You mentioned 300 basis points, but you're - again, you're a little less - a little bit more cautious on the rest of the year from a volume standpoint. No confidence that things are getting better. Is that what your customers are saying too? I mean shouldn't they be thinking that they're more of in a coiled spring kind of situation where as soon as somebody bites, maybe they all start buying and we see a little bit better performance? What do you think is really holding them back as far as making greater commitments? And if you think that, you know, restocking is not going to be as pronounced as in the past, why is that the case? Thanks.\nFrank Sullivan: Sure. So a couple of comments. Number one, we're hesitant to really comment much beyond what we've done, particularly in the second half. I'd point out again, I think MAP '25 and our growth initiatives are delivering because we anticipate a record level of sales and earnings in Q2, albeit somewhat modest on top of the quarter last year, where sales were up 9% and earnings were up 36%. So unlike some peers, we're not rounding easier comps or modest comps. We're rounding an all-time record second quarter, and we're going to beat it. As it relates to the broader question, I really think that interest rates are biting more people in more parts of the economy. It was the fastest rate increase in the history of the United States. And there is a lag effect of when the Fed raises rates and how it filters into, you name it, you know, car loans, housing rent, mortgage rates, et cetera. Now I'm playing economist and I'm not very good at that. But you know you're going to have student loans that are going to begin to have to be paid starting this month. So there is a lot of different elements out there that I think make people hesitant. The last comment I'll say, and I think we're doing a pretty good job of this. And so I look at RPM sometimes, I think, what are trends. So our capital spending is really solid. And so I think most of our manufacturing customers who are doing capital spending, that's really solid, and we see that in the results of our PCG and our Construction Products Group to a lesser extent. On the other hand, RPM is meaningfully and sustainably improving our working capital ratios, which means we're bringing down levels of inventory. So are most of our customers and so are most of our competitors. So those trends are continuing. And so I - hopefully, that answers your question.\nArun Viswanathan: Thanks, Frank. And one quick follow-up. How much of the MAP savings are volume-dependent? You mentioned a portion there. What would you quantify that as? Thanks.\nFrank Sullivan: I would say 80% or 90% of them, they are very targeted at efficiencies in our plants, so lower conversion costs, a better cash conversion cycle. So that's all about how you get raws to the door, what you pay for them, how quickly you add value and how quickly you get it out the door. And then even a lot of the data decision-making is helping us drive a positive mix, but that's about what we sell. And so that's why I do think you'll see a nice rebound into the mid or upper teens in terms of EBIT margins in our Specialty Products Group when the volume returns. They're doing the work and it's having a real impact in their operations, but they've been through now seven months or so of negative unit volume growth. So the benefits of the work there aren't going to show up until we start seeing positive volume growth. So, very volume-dependent. It's why you're seeing the nice leverage in our Construction Products Group. When you have positive unit volume and the MAP savings are real, you'll see really nice leverage to our bottom line.\nArun Viswanathan: Thanks.\nFrank Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Frank Sullivan for any closing remarks.\nFrank Sullivan: Andrea, thank you very much. 2024 started out with positive momentum, and we look forward to leveraging our strengths to build on this strong start for the rest of the fiscal year. We appreciate your joining us today and hope you will join our Annual Meeting of Stockholders online tomorrow. It will be done virtually. It's at 01:00 P.M. Eastern time, and it can be accessed through the RPM website, www.rpminc.com. At tomorrow's Board Meeting and our Annual Meeting, we will be announcing our 50th consecutive increase in cash dividends to our shareholders, and our Board will be deliberating tomorrow about what that will be. I'd like to put that in perspective. If you like the power of compounding interest, you'll love the power of an annually growing cash dividend. My father, Tom, started our consistent consecutive growth in cash dividends 50 years ago, in 1973. Since then, we have had a compounded annual growth rate over 15 years to our shareholders, including reinvested dividends of 15.1%. To put that in further perspective, if you invested $1,000 in the S&P 500 in August of 1973, today you would have $178,000. That same $1,000 invested in RPM stock in August of 1973 with reinvested dividends would deliver a $1,150,000 value today. And as far as I can tell, about a third of that value creation was driven by our annually growing dividend. It's a track record that we're very proud of. It speaks to the stability of RPM strategy and businesses, and we're excited about the outcome of our 2025 MAP to growth initiative, where we are focused on significantly improving our cash conversion cycle and on reigniting organic growth in most of our businesses. Thank you for your participation in our investor call today, and we hope to hear from you and to have you join us for our Annual Meeting of Shareholders tomorrow. Thank you, and have a great day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Matt. Our outlook for the second quarter is on Slide 13. Many of the trends we experienced in the first quarter are expected to continue into the second quarter. On the positive side, the tailwinds include MAP 2025 including the commodity cycle, infrastructure and reshoring demand, reduced destocking, and resilient demand for repair and maintenance. As a reminder, some of our MAP 2025 benefits are more dependent on volumes to be fully realized. So they will naturally be lower in our seasonally lower-volume quarters of Q2 and Q3, and higher and stronger volume quarters, Q4 and Q1. Some of the challenges we expect to face in the second quarter are continued weakness in OEM demand, softness in some new construction end markets, and a reduced benefit from pricing, although pricing is still expected to be positive. We also faced challenging comparisons to the prior year when sales grew 9% and adjusted EBIT increased by 36%. Taking all of this into account, we are forecasting sales to increase in the low-single-digit range on a consolidated basis, led by CPG and PCG with specialty still showing declines. We expect adjusted EBIT margins to expand and to generate consolidated adjusted EBIT growth of high-single-digits to low-double-digits. Moving to Slide 14. Turning to our full year outlook, we still expect modest economic growth. Despite the soft macro backdrop, we are focused on leveraging the growth drivers we control including, number one, MAP 2025; number two, our strong position serving infrastructure and reshoring demand with our engineered solutions; and number three, our strategic focus on repair and maintenance. We also continue to expect to benefit from reduced inflation, reduced destockings and easier comparison in the second half of the year. As was the case last quarter, we anticipate weakness in certain new construction markets throughout the year and weakness in OEM demand, at least in the first half of the year. Our current outlook for 2024 on a consolidated basis remains unchanged. Sales are expected to increase in the mid-single-digit range, with adjusted EBIT growing in the low-double-digit to mid-teen range. This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now pleased to answer your questions. I mean, last year, we did $50 million. In which quarter? Oh, the second quarter? Yes, we're going to lap some anniversaries of selling price increases, Josh. So yes, we would expect marginal decrease in that 3.5% price effect. Sure. Yes. In terms of the SG&A for the quarter, David, there is a few areas of compensation. One obviously is commissions go up when we sell more, especially of higher margin products, which we're pushing, and you saw that on the gross margin line. Another area would be performance-related bonus accruals were up a few million dollars during the quarter. And then on, you know, basic salary and wage inflation and SG&A, you know, typically, those have run over the long-term about 3%. They're up more in the 4% to 5% range right now. So as a result of that, pay increases were probably, you know, in the $6 million or $7 million range impacting SG&A. We ran at about the run rate you'd expect. So it was about a quarter of that year's benefit, maybe a touch ahead. Yes, on the inventory side, Jeff, as you know, we have MAP objectives to reduce working capital, and inventory is a major piece of that. You've seen progress this year. I think what might be a bit different as we go forward for RPM is traditionally, you know, in the late time, we would build up safety stocks for the big spring orders. And I think thanks to a lot of our MAP improvements, you will not see that as pronounced going forward for RPM because we'll be able to respond better to typical higher seasonal demand. So that's your answer on inventory."

            "content": "Thanks, Frank. Starting on Slide 6. Consolidated sales increased 4.1% to a first quarter record $2.01 billion, driven by pricing with modest volume growth. Organic sales increased 3.9% with foreign currency translation and acquisitions less divestitures, both contributing 0.1% to sales. Adjusted EBIT grew by 12.3% to an all-time record of $309 million during the quarter. Gross margin expansion was the driver of this growth, led by MAP 2025 initiatives and improved fixed-cost utilization, particularly at businesses with growing volumes. All segments, except Consumer, generated commodity cycle benefits. Because of Consumer's raw material basket and in particular TiO2 in metal packaging, this segment's raw material inflation has been larger and continued longer than the other segments. SG&A as a percentage of sales increased during the quarter, driven by growth investments and higher variable compensation expenses due to the improved financial performance. Expense reduction actions were implemented in the fourth quarter helped to offset the SG&A increase. Adjusted EPS grew 11.6% to $1.64, and was driven by adjusted EBIT growth. Turning to the segment results on Slide 7. Our Construction Products Group achieved all-time record sales of $783 million, an increase of 10.8% from the prior year period. Organic sales growth was 9.5% with acquisitions contributing 0.6%, and foreign currency translation adding 0.7% to sales. Sales growth was led by strength in our restoration systems for roofing, facades and parking structures, which benefited from the segment's strategic focus on repair and maintenance as well as its differentiated turnkey service model. Concrete admixtures and repair products also helped drive sales growth. After several quarters of sales declines, Europe returned to growth. As expected, new office construction was weak, but stronger demand in other end markets and our strategic focus on repair and maintenance more than offset this softness. Adjusted EBIT increased 33% to an all-time record $145 million, led by improved fixed cost leverage and MAP 2025 benefits, including commodity cycle benefits. As a result of improved financial performance, variable compensation increased and was partially offset by expense reduction actions put in place at the end of fiscal 2023. Additionally, as we recently announced, in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 CPG acquired a wall system fabricator to expand its offering in offsite panelized construction. The acquired business has annual sales of approximately $20 million. On Slide 8, the Performance Coatings Group achieved record net sales and adjusted EBIT. Revenue increased 4.1% to a record $379 million. Organic sales grew 4.0%, acquisitions added 0.8% and foreign currency translation was a 0.7% headwind. Sales were driven by strong demand for the segment's flooring systems and other engineered solutions for infrastructure and reshoring capital projects. Demand was strong internationally and increased pricing also contributed to growth. Adjusted EBIT increased 17.4% to an all-time record of $59 million. The growth was driven by strong sales and MAP 2025 benefits, led by commercial excellence programs in Europe and included commodity cycle benefits. These results are on top of a strong prior-year increase. Part of our MAP 2025 focus on improving profitability in Europe, PCG divested a non-core service business there. PCG incurred $14.6 million of charges related to this divested business, which are excluded from adjusted EBIT. Moving to the next slide, Specialty Products Group sales declined 10.7% to $181 million, organic sales declined 9.0%. Divestitures, net of acquisitions, reduced sales by 2.2%, and foreign currency translation was a tailwind of 0.5%. OEM demand was weak during the quarter, particularly in businesses that serve the residential sector, including coatings for furniture, doors, windows and cabinets. Additionally, SPG sales were negatively impacted by customers holding inventory levels below historical averages, which is pressuring volumes. The divestiture of the non-core furniture warranty business last fiscal year also reduced sales. Pricing helped to partially offset some of this weakness. SPG adjusted EBIT declined 39.6% to $18 million. The sales decline, product mix and unfavorable fixed cost leverage drove the decline. The divestiture of the non-core furniture warranty business also contributed to the adjusted EBIT decline. SG&A as a percentage of sales increased, driven by investments in growth initiatives and unfavorable impact of deleveraging a lower revenue. Expense reduction actions implemented at SPG in Q4 helped to offset this. Moving to Slide 10, the Consumer Group sales increased 1.5% to a first quarter record of $670 million. Organic sales increased 1.7%, foreign currency translation was a headwind of 0.2% and there was no impact from acquisitions. The sales growth was driven by increased pricing, primarily due to the large increase instituted during the first quarter of 2023 in response to inflation. Inflation, although less of a headwind, still persisted for the Consumer segment in the first quarter. As a reminder, Consumer faced the challenging prior year comparison as sales surged 22.5% in the first quarter of 2023, when it began restocking retailers after raw material -- raw material availability improved. Volumes declined moderately driven by reduced customer takeaway and certain customers holding inventory levels below historical averages. Share gains helped to partially offset these volume pressures. Adjusted EBIT increased 3.5% to $121 million, driven by MAP 2025 benefits and the sales increase. Cost inflation continued in the quarter and was a headwind to adjusted EBIT as was lower fixed cost utilization as we slowed production to normalize inventories. We also received a $10.3 million business interruption insurance reimbursement during the first quarter. And the gain associated with this reimbursement has been excluded from adjusted EBIT. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Matt to go over the balance sheet and cash flow, and provide a business update."

            "name": "Frank Sullivan",
            "content": "Thank you, Matt, and thank you to everyone for joining us on our call today. I'll begin today's call with an overview of our first quarter performance and then I'll turn the call over to Mike Laroche to discuss financials in more detail. Then Matt Schlarb will provide an update on one of our businesses. And then Rusty Gordon, our CFO will cover our outlook for the next quarter and the balance of fiscal '24. At the conclusion of the prepared remarks, we'll be pleased to answer your questions. Beginning on Slide 3 of our investor deck. Our associates are, to put it simply, executing at a very high level. We generated 4.1% sales growth in what can be best described as a mixed economic environment resulting in record first quarter sales. Driven by the continued execution of our MAP 2025 initiatives, we expanded margins and grew adjusted EBIT by 12.3% to an all-time quarterly record. These results represent the seventh consecutive quarter of record sales and adjusted EBIT. Importantly, we remain focused on converting this profitability into cash flow, and this focus resulted in $359.2 million of cash generated from our operating activities during the quarter, which is an all-time record. Moving to Slide 4. Sales were driven by pricing, mainly from the wraparound effect of increases implemented in fiscal 2023 and strong unit volume growth in our Construction Products Group. Our CPG was our fastest-growing segment as the team there leveraged its strategic focus on repair and maintenance and differentiated turnkey service model. As we've highlighted in the past, several of our businesses in our Performance Coatings Group and Construction Products Group have positioned themselves to benefit from spending on infrastructure and reshoring capital projects, which continued during the quarter. The successful execution of our MAP 2025 initiatives led to margin expansion during the quarter, particularly in businesses where volumes grew as we were able to more fully leverage the structural efficiency improvements that we put into place. MAP 2025 was a key driver in growing adjusted EBIT to an all-time record of $309 million. As I mentioned, this growth is in addition to strong results in the prior year. And our two-year stack sales and adjusted EBIT growth rates were 22% and 49%, respectively. MAP 2025 initiatives are also contributing to structural improvements in working capital. Through improved coordination between sales operations, procurement and R&D as well as being a more data-driven decision-making organization, we have become more agile with more efficient inventory processes. This contributed to strong cash flow conversion during the quarter. While we still have significant work to do in improving in this area, I'm proud of the progress we are making on a sustainable basis. Looking at sales by geography on Slide 5. Sales growth was strongest in Africa, the Middle East and Latin America, driven by continued spending on infrastructure projects in these emerging markets. This growth is in addition to strong prior year results when sales in these regions were up double-digits. Europe is expanding for the first time in over a year, while economic growth in the region remains subdued, our teams captured growth opportunities and are leveraging MAP 2025 initiatives to expand margins. While on the surface, sales growth in North America may appear moderate, it is important to keep in mind that in the prior year revenues increased in North America and nearly 23%. The two-year stack growth rate in North America is 26.1%. Overall, RPM has begun our fiscal year with positive momentum and our teams are executing at a high level on the things that we can control. We remain focused on executing our MAP 2025 program, leveraging our competitive strengths to capture growth opportunities, and bringing new products to market to continue growing throughout the fiscal year. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mike Laroche to cover our financial results in more detail. Good morning, Mike. Thank you. Sure. So boy, two-thirds to three quarters of their growth in the quarter was unit volume growth, and it was pretty strong at the Tremco Roofing WTI business at our Tremco Sealants business, Euclid. And then broadly, and this is mostly our Construction Products Group and our Performance Coatings Group in the Southern Hemisphere developing countries. And so real good strength there. In many instances, we're bucking trends. As we talked about in the past, we've had a real focused effort on investing in growth initiatives. And one of the real starts this year is something that in this quarter that Matt talked about, which is Pure Air, which is finally gaining some traction after its first year, which we got off to a slow start. Had to integrate it into WTI and into our Roofing sales force, and it's going very well. So that's one example of some of the very specific initiatives that we're investing in that's starting to pay off that's, I think, allowing us to buck some of the trends in the construction markets. Sure. So the biggest impact there is housing. We do a lot of wood stains and finishes into furniture, into windows and doors, kitchen cabinets. And so, notwithstanding the inventory mismatch for demand, particularly in this higher interest rate environment, the North American housing market, U.S. housing market is weak and continues to be weak, and that's hurt us. Some other categories that they have been strong in, including manufactured housing and/or RVs. And those are weak after the post-COVID bump. All that notwithstanding, we have some very targeted initiatives in our Kop-Coat adjuvant business. There's some patented products there that allow for a significant reduction in the use of herbicides and pesticides. We believe in the long-term benefit of that business, and we're investing in that. We're investing in an expanding MRO channel for our Legend Brands business that should take out some of the storm-related cyclicality. Those are just a few examples. And, the one thing that the lower volume is hiding is some significant MAP 2025 improvements in our Specialty Products Group. But as Rusty highlighted, most of these improvements are on the manufacturing floor and/or cost price mix items. And with improved conversion cost, better handle on mix, those benefits only show up when we sell something. And so the lower volume is hiding, I think, the good efforts in our Specialty Products Group folks have made, along with the rest of RPM and executing on the MAP '25 initiative. Thanks, Mike. Good morning, Ghansham. Could you repeat that? I'm not sure I understand the question, Ghansham. So I think the main drivers are MAP '25 initiatives where we're seeing improvement in conversion costs. I mentioned this, what we call D3 initiative at RPM. It's data-driven decision-making. So we are much better today at driving mix on a going-forward basis, and that's helping us. We are benefiting in the quarter from the commodity cycle disinflation that we're starting to benefit in a few places, construction products is certainly one of those. And then it really is very focused efforts in strategic initiatives around repair and maintenance. So we're seeing real strong results in our core roofing business. All of that is - we're 95% reroofing and repair on existing roofs, not new construction. Pure Air has been very strong, and we expect that to continue. We'll see tens of millions of dollars of new volume from that initiative. Panelization is something we've been working on for the last three years or four years. We just added a significant piece of that with this Texas acquisition we announced in this past week. So it's really focusing on the things that we can control that tend to be in the large repair and maintenance areas. The last comment I'll make is that hospitals have been a significant market for us, and we had some booming business there during and coming out of COVID. Last year was not a good spending year for that sector. And so that weighed on our performance in fiscal '23, and we're seeing some pickup on a relative basis there and also some pickup on Nudura, which had a challenge '23 because of what's happening in the residential market. But again, a very focused effort on expanding the understanding and the specifications for the Nudura ICF system. So again, it's a lot of self-help and a lot of very deliberate spending into specific initiatives across RPM, and you're seeing the results of that spending best impacting our Construction Products Group as we sit here today. Sure. Great question. And - so let me step back, big picture, and kind of just address simply, what are we trying to do with this MAP program and it's really two things. We're trying to significantly improve our cash conversion cycle and it's working. And we're trying to be more data-driven in our decision-making with a real focus on investing in specific organic growth initiatives, and you're seeing that work, particularly in our Construction Products Group. And so what that looks like is a record first - record fourth quarter cash from operations, followed by record first quarter cash from operations, notwithstanding a handful of acquisitions and maybe $25 million or so of what did we acquire Rusty last year in share repurchases? $50 million in share repurchases. Year-over-year, we've reduced debt by $332 million. And so that focus on cash conversion is really working. We expect that those improvements to continue. And so that's big picture of what we're trying to do. The volatility that we've all experienced over the last few years is continuing. And so, as we work with our Board, I think we'll have a better answer in the coming quarters, Ghansham, about how we think about capital allocation. But as we sit here today, the M&A market is relatively slow. We will continue to execute on good strategic small- to medium-sized deals. But the days of huge multiples, in my opinion, are over, if not forever, at least temporarily. We went through a period of time where incremental cost of capital was almost zero. That is not true today. And so given the choppiness in the markets and the MAP initiatives that are benefiting our conversion costs and our efficiency, we are focusing a lot of time and attention on driving organic growth where we can. It's easier said than done in an economic environment that is, as Rusty likes to say, feels like a rolling recession, both geographically and across sectors. Thank you. Good morning, John. Sure. The - I'll address your last portion of your question first. The only place where we're seeing the move in oil prices impact us immediately is in acetone. That's a - it impacts a number of our coatings businesses, but in particular, Rust-Oleum. So in general, as you followed RPM for many years, we in our industry follow the commodity cycle increases up with lagging price increases, and so you see some margin compression. And then as the commodity cycle cycles down, we typically pick up the lost margin. We are now experiencing that in Q1, in most of our businesses and segments, except Consumer. We would expect to begin to see that in Consumer in Q2. You know we're rounding metal packaging increases that were pretty extreme and are paying attention to some tariff activity relative to tin plate, which is the, you know, primary raw material for metal packaging and spray cans, things like that. TiO2 is up modestly year-over-year and acetone is the only raw material that we see reacting to current price increases. So, the commodity cycle benefited us, particularly in our Construction Products and Performance Coatings segment in Q1, and we would expect it to continue to be a benefit to margin expansion in Q2 as well. Again, that's another one of those things that is volume-driven. You get the benefit when you sell something. Sure. So our Consumer segment is continuing to perform, I think, at a good level. I think most of the inventory adjustments are behind us. They were certainly significant in the last year. I will tell you in terms of consumer takeaway, while it is improved, meaning less negative, it still trends across different product categories in different channels and the kind of low- to mid-negative range, which is a slight improvement from what we experienced in the second half of last year, which was kind of solidly mid- to upper-single-digit negative consumer takeaway. Some of that's hangover from the COVID bump. As we had communicated in the past, we had lost some share in a major big-box account. Some of that was related to our own supply challenges. Our supply challenges are over. Our fill rates are back to solid numbers. Through the MAP initiative, we have created through efficiencies, 40 million or 50 million units of volume. And so we're in really good shape today there. And product gains have been with our universal. We're picking up share in new accounts, and that's going really well. The Rust-Oleum five-in-one spray is showing some incremental gains, and I'd say incremental. Any positive numbers in the face of slightly negative consumer takeaway look good. We've got some new product introductions DAP, a two-component spray foam and one can that's being introduced really well as well as a textured spray that's being well-received. So new product introductions are going well, and we actually experienced because of the new product introductions, some positive unit volume growth in the quarter at DAP. And so that's kind of the broad overview of what's happening in Consumer. Sure. Thanks, John. Good morning, Steve. Sure. So great question. And in general, our Construction Products Group revenues are about 30%, maybe slightly higher 30% service revenues with roughly 70% driven by product sales. It's a little bit - and there's a little ambiguity there because in most instances, we're not selling - in some cases, we sell only repair services or other services, but in many instances, those services go hand in glove with the material sale for a reroofing project, for instance. I would expect that over time to expand. And we talked about Pure Air, that's a good example. That addresses right at indoor air quality. And it - we have been asked for many, many years as we're on the roof with our WTI services group and addressing issues on the roof and not just roofing materials, but rooftop safety in terms of the work that Tremco does with fiber grade in terms of railings and walkways. We've been asked for many years, can we address HVAC issues in repair and the answer for too long was no. Two years ago, we acquired Pure Air and there's a key element of this. It took us a while to fix. And that is a service business, whereby we do an assessment of existing HVAC systems and then have really good capabilities to clean, disinfect, and repair components. And it was a $20 million business when we acquired it. We expect a few tens of millions of dollars of revenue growth this year and the potential for that is meaningfully higher. And so as that rose as a share of our business that will grow, that 30% services business higher. The benefits are basically about one-third cost versus total replacement. The immediate benefits are significant improvement in efficiency of an old system that's getting worn down because of blades or motors or other things. And there is a measurable benefit immediately in indoor air quality. And so for the hospitals and school system, customers that our Construction Products Group serve, it's a really exciting market for us. Yes. I think the expansion will come from our continued market share gains, broadly roofing. But the areas that will expand like a Pure Air are where we can add value. So we can add significant value versus replacement. And so we'll look for other opportunities but they'll be limited to areas where we can truly add value as opposed to areas that are more commodity-like in services. And I think it's critical and it's back to that component of it's not just the service, but it's adding the material element or the cleaning or disinfecting or blade repair components that go along with it. One other factor, which is also true for our Stonhard flooring business, and the reason that we got off to a rough start in the first year of Pure Air was staffing. I think anybody that is doing any work in residential or commercial and industrial construction, workforce issues are significant. We have solved that issue with Pure Air with our WTI roofing workforce. We have a great collection of installers with our Stonhard business. And so that certainty of having our people on the job on time, staying on the job to get it done in this environment is also getting us a competitive advantage in the roofing and the HVAC restoration and in the industrial flooring markets. So the simple answer to that is yes. It's one of the most energy-efficient building systems for residential and commercial structures in the market today. It's got its unique characteristics that we continue to have to educate people on. But it's also one of the most durable residential and commercial structures today. So for instance, we got approval for Nudura specifications for schools in Kentucky. And that was, in part, a direct result of a terrible experience they had with a tornado a few years ago. The durability of Nudura in hurricanes is also becoming well-known, and so it's a combination of the energy efficiency for people that are looking for net-zero buildings. We completed the first net-zero school in Kentucky a year ago. It's not just the new Nudura piece, it's other building components, but -- so we can deliver that and the durability in the face of expectations for more climate-driven weather events. Good morning, Josh. Sure. And we don't provide that detail by segment. But on a consolidated basis, we're in the 3.5% range. So, you know, across our businesses, you're seeing price impact in the quarter that might be as low as 1.5% and might be as high as 5%, depending - and it's really not by segment, it's by product line and really driven by raw material issues. But on a consolidated basis, we were about 3.5% price in the quarter. No, I think that's correct. I mean, again, we've been fighting and it's not unique to us or the whole industry for that matter, most manufacturing a commodity cycle that's bigger than any of us have ever seen. Over a two-year period, we saw more than $500 million of raw material price impacts in our Consumer business. And so it took us a long time to get on top of that. And I can tell you the other aspect of it, and this is something that I said in the spring of '22, and we were early. We were starting to see inflation throughout our whole P&L. And so we've seen inflation, which continues, while raw material inflation is abating and our regulated price increases are stepping down, and you can see that with the data I just gave you this quarter. Labor is still an issue. Items like insurance, are a meaningful issue in terms of higher inflation. And so inflation still exists in a number of factors and inflation still exists because of interest rates in the housing market. And I think that's part of the challenges that we're seeing, particularly in our Specialty Products Group. So in the quarter, year-over-year, we're up 1%. This quarter? Yes. But it's - you know, again, there's a few areas where we've had price increases where it was just necessary to get them that are a little outside of cycle, but we are seeing the impact of price sequentially step down. And so I can't give you the numbers for future quarters other than - in this quarter, price increases accounted for about 3.5%, and we would expect that to sequentially slowly bleed out in the next couple of quarters. And the things that we're paying attention to are odd off ones, again, relative to oil prices and their impact in other areas, tin plate relative to tariff activity that's being pushed in Congress. So there are a couple of areas that we're paying attention to, but nothing that's impacting additional price increases today. Good morning, Aleksey. Sure. So, you know, there's not too many - in the construction markets, there's not too many good statistics to point to. Residential construction is taking it on the chin in North America, which is where we have our primary exposure. Commercial construction is not very strong. You know, you look at the office glut and what's happening there. The build out of the Amazon distribution centers, things like that have run their course in terms of the big growth. So there's not a lot of good signs to point to. The areas of strength for us are the things that we talked about, very deliberate initiatives around maintenance and repair in the sectors that we have strengthened. And so, I think our performance is kind of bucking the underlying trends. And a big part of that is in our construct and products group, I would say we have maybe a 30% or 35% exposure in new construction between residential and commercial, which means we're in the 65% to 70% less cyclical renovation, repair, reconstruction, reroofing markets. And I think those markets are stable, and we're picking up share given some of the new initiatives we have. The other area that - the only area that's showing continued strength is related to industrial construction and capital spending driven by the onshore movement and a substantial amount of government subsidies in that area. And that is impacting Construction Products Group a little bit and our Performance Coatings Group more. Sure. I think it's over. I don't know that it would have a much of a big impact going forward. But a good example is because the supply chain challenges into RVs and what remaining furniture or cabinet making is done. It was very common for those businesses pre-COVID to shut down for instance, in the month of January for maintenance and other things. And during the COVID period and in the post-COVID period with supply chain challenges, those shutdowns disappeared. Well, they showed back up in calendar '23. And so they got back to normal shutdowns. There was inventory adjustments. The other thing that I don't think we've emphasized enough here is most of this is done, but not all of it. But starting in December of last year, really driven by better data and our MAP '25 initiatives, we very deliberately shut our own production in a number of areas to make some permanent inventory adjustments. And so, you know, in the second half of '23, we had tens of millions of dollars of unabsorbed overhead, both from lower volumes from a market perspective but also lower volumes from deliberate decisions to shut down productions in some of our specialty products companies, in our Consumer group and other areas to really address some permanent inventory level issues across RPM. Most of that is behind us as well. Good morning, David. Sure. So I can give you a big picture. I don't know that we would disclose that by quarter. So, big picture in our MAP initiative, we laid out a goal, and it was actually a year ago that we went public with the MAP goals of achieving $465 million worth of savings. And about $115 million of that was our expectation of commodity cycle recovery. So non-MAP-driven initiatives, just the normal commodity cycle recovery. Our target this year in MAP savings is $160 million. I would venture that half of that is going to be commodity rate cycle recovery. You know, depending on our dynamics and looking at the past, it's possible that we would exceed that $115 million. But again, time will tell as the pending quarter's results happen. Sure. I'll let Rusty address the incentive comp issue and some of it is a truly incentive comp, which is higher based on higher results and better mix and some of it's continued inflation and wages and salaries. And to your - the first part of your question, roughly 25% or 30% of the SG&A increase in Q1 was driven by focused - we call them big ideas for growth, BIG, at our businesses. And so I can give you broadly some of the things. These are just directional. But in our Construction Products Group, Pure Air, panelization, Nudura are getting a lot of attention and extra investment. One example in our Performance Coatings segment is a project that we're in our second year called C2B, which is Carboline to $1 billion. And there is specific initiatives in Canada, Europe and in non-oil and gas segments. In our Specialty Products Group, we are focused on a turnaround of our DayGlo resin and fluorescent color business. I mentioned previously the specific investments in the Kop-Coat patented adjuvants as well as the channel - MRO channel focus for Legend Brands, which is a new market for them. In Consumer, we're very focused on increasing advertising and promotion around some of the new product introductions at DAP and Rust-Oleum. For the balance of the year, if we follow through with our plans, probably anywhere from 30% to 40% of SG&A increases would be associated with these specific initiatives with the intent of driving organic growth. All of these are easy to cut back, and I don't say that cavalierly. You know, in some instances, it's hiring more salespeople or tech service people, in other areas, it's truly advertising or promotion or digital advertising. But as we sit here today, we think that's pennywise and pound foolish. And it is our specific intent to focus some of the MAP savings on these specific growth investments. And if we're successful, you'll see in the coming year, some more stories like what we're talking about in our Construction Products Group today. We expect that to continue in CPG for the balance of the year. They got good momentum in these new initiatives. And on the flip side, if we bump into the deep recession that some economists fear, there are tens of millions of dollars of SG&A that could be cut pretty quickly. Thank you. Good morning, Mike. Okay. Hi, Richard. Yes. So I think part of the European story is Europe really was negatively impacted by recessionary elements and then the Russian war on Ukraine. And so we experienced a very challenging performance in Europe in calendar '22 and most of fiscal '23, and so some of it is we're rounding easier comparisons. The other area is that we are having a more focused effort in the MAP '25 initiatives in Europe. For instance, our MS-168 initiative, which is really driving lean manufacturing and continuous improvement disciplines across our plants. It's a very in-plant, hands-on, utilizing outside consultants process. It takes weeks. It's followed up by performance audits on a 90-day cycle. That got interrupted by COVID. And so our efforts were halted a little bit. The lion share of it was initially focused on our larger plants in North America. We're seeing those benefits now happen in Europe. We positioned Dave Dennsteadt, who's our Performance Coatings Group President. We also had a big presence in Europe. He and his family moved this summer to Europe, and he has a senior leader oversight to help accelerate some of the opportunities to drive efficiencies more aggressively in Europe. The decision to divest a business in the U.K. and close some underperforming operations were part of that. And so all of that should bode favorably for growth and margin expansion in Europe quarter-by-quarter and over the next couple of years. Sure. You know, I don't know that I would talk specifically about limits to EBIT margin growth in any of our businesses. We still have room to grow. But not surprising from my earlier comments, there is a trade-off in the near term between expanding margins and investing in organic growth. And back to the big picture thing, you know, if we simplify across RPM internally into our investors what we're trying to do here, it's significantly improve our cash conversion cycle and ramp up organic growth initiatives. And we think the economic circumstances that we're in call for that, and we're having really good progress in the cash conversion cycle improvement, and there's more to come. And we're having really good improvement on the organic growth piece in Construction Products, and we're hopeful that we'll see more benefits across more RPM companies in the coming year. Good morning, Frank. That is 100% correct, and I appreciate you're clarifying that. So $25 million or $30 million. And, you know, we communicated in July. We had a $120 million goal in fiscal '23, we exceeded that. And we have a $160 million run rate goal. And you're right, we expect $100 million of it to flow through our P&L. Some of that is benefits that will begin to be realized in the second half of the year in terms of run rate. Some of that is the impact of FIFO accounting, both in terms of conversion costs and the commodity cycle benefit that shows up in our case, maybe 60 days or 90 days later than were we on LIFO. And so that's what's happening there. But we are on or slightly ahead of target for that $160 million run rate for the year. And as I said earlier, I would expect about half of that or slightly less than half of that to be associated with the commodity cycle benefits as well. This should be the year unless we get surprised by oil prices or some other spikes. And as we look in the past, where the lion's share of the commodity cycle benefits should show up. Yes. I think - and maybe Rusty can comment on this. Rusty Gordon has captured the sentiment of this a bit better than any economist I know, and maybe it's a combination of his reading and seeing our numbers. But it feels like we're going through a rolling recession and the housing market is taking it on the chin, you can see it in our Specialty Products Group results, you can see it in companies that serve residential construction and/or the components that go into that, furniture and other things. Retail takeaway has not been very strong across many categories. And as we commented in the second half of last year, POS in our categories tended to be mid- to high-negative single-digits. We're seeing that improve, which means it's less bad. And so I'm hopeful that there'll be somewhat of a soft landing in the sense that this is a rolling recession. Again, Europe went in early. We're seeing better performance in Europe. I think there is more stability around the impact of the Russia war on Ukraine. We're rounding easier, comps and quite candidly, there's some reasonable growth in the U.K., for instance. And the U.K. seems to be performing better than continental Europe as we sit here. And for us that's a good thing because a little less than half of our revenues in Europe come out of the U.K. And so that's the best shot I have at that, Frank. And other than to say a lot of our performance in this quarter and what we expect in the second quarter is as much self-help as it is counting on any economic green shoots or pickups. Thank you. Good morning, Kevin. Yes. I still think that there is a significant amount of fiscal stimulus coming. You know, the infrastructure bill that was passed on a bipartisan basis I think was $1.2 trillion. I think the analysis of that not all of it was infrastructure. But you know if half of it, $500 billion or $600 billion was infrastructure, that's still coming. I can - you can see that in highway construction. You could see that in the onshoring of manufacturing. You can see that in some expansions in airports. So I think as we sit here today, we see that having a pretty good runway for the next 1.5 years or two years. And that's our best guess. It's not having any impact on residential construction and the housing market. And I think that in commercial construction as well. There's two big macro trends that are fighting each other. One is massive amounts, trillions of dollars of federal subsidies and stimulus fighting the fastest interest rate increase that this country has ever seen. And you look at bond rates today, the cost of mortgage, the cost of rent, the cost of a lot of things that are debt-driven are continuing to go up. So those are the two macro trends, I think, that are fighting each other relative to how these things impact the economy to your question and impact us. But for portions of our Construction Products Group and portions of our Performance Coatings Group, we think there's still pretty good tailwinds there. Sure. We're continuing to look as part of our MAP 2025 initiative at opportunities to improve margins where we have low-margin, no-growth businesses. The latest example of that was in this quarter where in the U.K. we were able to sell off a service element of our USL business and then also restructure a piece. Taking the high-margin product lines and putting it in different parts of RPM paid off nicely. The divested piece has gone to a group that will retain all the employees there and continue to drive that business in a manner that works for them, but was not margin-positive for RPM. So part of the self-help and what we expect to be a quarter-by-quarter and meaningful improvement in European margins is not only the broader dynamics we're talking about, but divesting or closing or restructuring lower margin, no growth businesses. There is more of that to come over the next year in our MAP initiative in different segments, and it tends to be either product line or specific facility-related. And when they're executed, we'll provide details. Thank you. Good morning, Jeff. Sure. So in general the SG&A in the quarter was up 10.9%. And so I'm not sure where the adjusted number came from - And you know it really goes back to my earlier comments. A couple of things are driving higher SG&A, some of it is continued inflation and wages and salaries that we're beginning to annualize. Those - we're not seeing that so much today as we were seeing it throughout fiscal '23. And so in the first half of fiscal '22, the higher wages and salaries, insurance costs, all the things that impact us and all our peers are there. The other element is really twofold. One is being much more deliberate about driving mix. I mean you're talking to a CFO and CEO in a company who maybe five years or seven years ago wasn't very good at analyzing mix with great accuracy in hindsight. And today with the data initiatives we have in place on the ground at the operating level, we're much better at driving mix going forward. Where do we want to incentivize our sales forces to focus their time? With higher mix comes higher commissions, particularly in our Construction Products and Performance Coatings Group where we still have a fair amount of commission-based sales. And then lastly are the very targeted initiatives that I've been talking about. We fully intend as part of MAP '25 to take some of these margin savings and reinvest them in our P&L and growth initiatives. It's paying off in a big way in Construction Products today, and I think as long as we can generate solid sales growth and earnings growth. And again, I would remind you we're generating positive results as RPM and in most of our segments, other than SPG, on top of big mountains. You know, last year, Consumer sales were up 22.5%. You know, RPM had an all-time record, Q1. I think our EBIT last year in Q2 was an all-time record, and it was up 36%. We expect to top that. And so as long as we have forward momentum on the sales line, and we're experiencing both the improved cash conversion cycle and the margin enhancements that we expect, we will continue to reinvest in these growth initiatives. And then we have to have the discipline when, after a couple - two years or three years of investing, we're not seeing the expected results to cut back in those areas. As I mentioned earlier, Jeff, as well, we are targeting very specifically what we call BIG, big ideas for growth investments separately in an SG&A sheet. And if the economy turns sour quickly, we have already lined up the specific SG&A cuts that we could make. Yes, I would just comment on that. As long as we continue to outperform quarter-by-quarter versus some big year - you know, big pounds last year, I would expect for the balance of the year for you to see SG&A rise at a level higher than sales, while at the same time, you'll see gross margin and EBIT margin expansion for the year. In the long run, SG&A should grow at or below the level of sales growth. That's correct. Yes. And in general, this year, I would expect a 300 basis point, maybe more improvement in working capital as a percent of sales. And you're seeing that. You know, we had an all-time record cash flow in Q4, all-time record cash flow in Q1. And inventory improvement has been a meaningful part and working capital improvement has been a meaningful part of that record cash flow generation along with margin expansion. Thank you. Morning, Vince. Yes, great question. The volatility we've experienced over the last two years or three years is what's keeping us from being more bullish. We have seen sharp turns in economic conditions that we didn't expect. We've seen trends that look great for a while and then reversed. And there's nothing about all the headlines. Not to get too big picture, but, you know, whether it's government shutdowns or you know, anticipating things might get a little dicier as we get into an election year. And as bond rates actually start to rise, maybe we'll see a normal bond cycle in terms of the reverse of the current interest rate inversion. There's nothing that suggests that the economy is getting better. And so we're focused on delivering what we can control, anticipating that we're going to see challenges. Boy, if, you know, we hit a soft landing and the start of calendar '24 is peaches and cream with our MAP initiatives and positive unit volume growth across our organization with easy comparisons, we'll have a blowout second half. Most of our reading of the economy is people are anticipating that if we're going to have recession, it's going to start at the beginning of next year. And so we don't have any confidence that the economy is getting better. We just know the things that we can positively impact are continuing to happen. So we're pretty confident in Q2. And beyond that, we'll give you our level of confidence or lack thereof for the second half of the year when we have a chance to talk to investors in January. Thank you. Good morning. Yes, good morning, Arun. Good. Thank you. Sure. So a couple of comments. Number one, we're hesitant to really comment much beyond what we've done, particularly in the second half. I'd point out again, I think MAP '25 and our growth initiatives are delivering because we anticipate a record level of sales and earnings in Q2, albeit somewhat modest on top of the quarter last year, where sales were up 9% and earnings were up 36%. So unlike some peers, we're not rounding easier comps or modest comps. We're rounding an all-time record second quarter, and we're going to beat it. As it relates to the broader question, I really think that interest rates are biting more people in more parts of the economy. It was the fastest rate increase in the history of the United States. And there is a lag effect of when the Fed raises rates and how it filters into, you name it, you know, car loans, housing rent, mortgage rates, et cetera. Now I'm playing economist and I'm not very good at that. But you know you're going to have student loans that are going to begin to have to be paid starting this month. So there is a lot of different elements out there that I think make people hesitant. The last comment I'll say, and I think we're doing a pretty good job of this. And so I look at RPM sometimes, I think, what are trends. So our capital spending is really solid. And so I think most of our manufacturing customers who are doing capital spending, that's really solid, and we see that in the results of our PCG and our Construction Products Group to a lesser extent. On the other hand, RPM is meaningfully and sustainably improving our working capital ratios, which means we're bringing down levels of inventory. So are most of our customers and so are most of our competitors. So those trends are continuing. And so I - hopefully, that answers your question. I would say 80% or 90% of them, they are very targeted at efficiencies in our plants, so lower conversion costs, a better cash conversion cycle. So that's all about how you get raws to the door, what you pay for them, how quickly you add value and how quickly you get it out the door. And then even a lot of the data decision-making is helping us drive a positive mix, but that's about what we sell. And so that's why I do think you'll see a nice rebound into the mid or upper teens in terms of EBIT margins in our Specialty Products Group when the volume returns. They're doing the work and it's having a real impact in their operations, but they've been through now seven months or so of negative unit volume growth. So the benefits of the work there aren't going to show up until we start seeing positive volume growth. So, very volume-dependent. It's why you're seeing the nice leverage in our Construction Products Group. When you have positive unit volume and the MAP savings are real, you'll see really nice leverage to our bottom line. Thank you. Andrea, thank you very much. 2024 started out with positive momentum, and we look forward to leveraging our strengths to build on this strong start for the rest of the fiscal year. We appreciate your joining us today and hope you will join our Annual Meeting of Stockholders online tomorrow. It will be done virtually. It's at 01:00 P.M. Eastern time, and it can be accessed through the RPM website, www.rpminc.com. At tomorrow's Board Meeting and our Annual Meeting, we will be announcing our 50th consecutive increase in cash dividends to our shareholders, and our Board will be deliberating tomorrow about what that will be. I'd like to put that in perspective. If you like the power of compounding interest, you'll love the power of an annually growing cash dividend. My father, Tom, started our consistent consecutive growth in cash dividends 50 years ago, in 1973. Since then, we have had a compounded annual growth rate over 15 years to our shareholders, including reinvested dividends of 15.1%. To put that in further perspective, if you invested $1,000 in the S&P 500 in August of 1973, today you would have $178,000. That same $1,000 invested in RPM stock in August of 1973 with reinvested dividends would deliver a $1,150,000 value today. And as far as I can tell, about a third of that value creation was driven by our annually growing dividend. It's a track record that we're very proud of. It speaks to the stability of RPM strategy and businesses, and we're excited about the outcome of our 2025 MAP to growth initiative, where we are focused on significantly improving our cash conversion cycle and on reigniting organic growth in most of our businesses. Thank you for your participation in our investor call today, and we hope to hear from you and to have you join us for our Annual Meeting of Shareholders tomorrow. Thank you, and have a great day."
