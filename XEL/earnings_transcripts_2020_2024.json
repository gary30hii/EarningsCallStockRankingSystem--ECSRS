[Operator Instructions] Questions will be taken from institutional investors. Reporters can contact media relations with inquiries and individual investors and others can reach out to Investor Relations. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nPaul Johnson: Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy\u2019s 2020 Year-end Conference Call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Bob Frenzel, President and Chief Operating Officer; Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Amanda Rome, Executive Vice President and General Counsel. This morning, we will review our 2020 results and share recent business and regulatory developments. Slides that accompany today\u2019s call are available on our website. As a reminder, some of the comments during today\u2019s call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our SEC filings. Today, we will discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures, including ongoing earnings and electric and natural gas margins. Information on the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in the earnings release. I\u2019m going to go off script for a second, which sizes a little bit dangerous. But in December, utility and I recommended Ben Fowke as utility executive of the year for his environmental leadership. Ben was the architect of our steel for fuel strategy Xcel. He is also the one that drove us to be the first utility to clear that we have an objective of 100% carbon-free by 2050. This is a well-deserved and overdue award. With that, I will turn it over to Ben.\nBenjamin Fowke: Anyway, okay, all right. So I\u2019m not going to go off script, and I\u2019m going to thank everybody, and welcome you to our call. Last year was certainly a challenging year, but our employees came through delivering on our financial and operational objectives while mitigating the impacts of COVID and helping our communities. Overall, 2020 was truly a stellar year. We executed on our business continuity plans as we kept employees and customers safe, while providing reliable customer service. We are helping to jump-start the economy through our capital investment programs, which create jobs and investment in our communities. And we stepped up our commitment to charitable giving to support those in need including donating a gain of almost $20 million from our sale of the Mankato facility. We had a long and impressive list of accomplishments in 2020. Let me share a few of them. We delivered EPS of $2.79 in 2020, which is the 16th consecutive year of meeting or exceeding our earnings guidance. We raised our annual dividend by $0.10 per share, which is the 17th straight year we have increased our dividend, and we achieved a total shareholder return of just over 7.8%, which was the second highest TSR for our peer group. Our O&M declined almost 1% as we took actions to mitigate the impacts of COVID. The Minnesota Commission approved our wind repowering proposal and I have requested to acquire another wind farm. And finally, we resolved multiple rate cases during the pandemic. Now turning to our investment plans. The Minnesota Commission recently approved our 650-megawatt wind repowering proposal with $750 million of rate base investment. The wind portfolio is projected to provide customer savings of more than $160 million over the life of the assets. It will create jobs, jump-start the economy and reduce carbon. In addition, we are also proposing to acquire a repowered 120-megawatt wind farm PPA buyout for about $210 million. Now this project was initially submitted as part of the Minnesota relief and recovery RFP, but the repowering didn\u2019t result in customer savings. However, we worked with the party on the terms and the project gets now expected to provide customer savings over the life of the asset. So we will move forward with it. We also plan to file our Minnesota solar proposal later in the quarter. This project consists of 460 megawatts of solar facilities near our retiring Sherco Coal plant, which takes advantage of existing transmission. We fine-tuned our projections and now expect an estimated investment of $550 million. This lower cost provides more benefit to our customers. We have requested a commission decision on both projects in the third quarter and are confident the commission will see the consumer benefit. As part of our strategy to lead the clean energy transition, we are also working to electrify the transport sector. In 2020, we announced the goal to enable 1.5 million electric vehicles in our service territory by 2030. We have programs and filings underway in various states and our transportation electrification plan in Colorado was just recently approved. And we continue to achieve important milestones in our nation leading wind expansion program with the completion of 6 projects in 2020. These projects represent nearly 1,500 megawatts of capacity and were completed under budget. In addition, we have approximately 800 megawatts of wind projects under construction, which are expected to be completed in 2021. We are excited to continue the clean energy transition, which will result in significant customer savings and carbon reductions. We also had a strong year operationally. For example, our nuclear fleet continues to make great strides in transforming performance while reducing cost. The fleet achieved a capacity factor of over 96% in 2020, even with the refueling outage during COVID. We have one of the top-performing nuclear fleets in the country as rated by both the NRC and INPO. And in addition to strong performance, we have continued to lower our cost structure, with O&M costs declining by more than 5% in 2020, and this is the sixth straight year of declining O&M costs in our nuclear operations. So I\u2019m extremely proud of the effort and the results of our nuclear employees and their leadership in our industry. Beyond our strong financial and operational performance, I\u2019m also very proud of our ESG leadership. In 2020, we estimate that we reduced carbon emissions by about 50% from 2005 levels. And we remain on track to achieve an 80% carbon reduction by 2030. We announced our plans to convert the Harrington coal plant in Texas to natural gas by the end of 2024. Working with our co-owners, we announced the proposed early retirement of the Craig and Hayden Coal plants in Colorado. We will address the remaining coal plants in Colorado in our resource plan filing at the end of March. We are also making significant strides to improve ESG compliance, transparency and disclosure as we issued our TCFD risk assessment, our natural gas report on our plans to reduce greenhouse gases in our LDC and our green bond impact report. We earned another perfect score on the human rights campaigns corporate quality index and remain among the best places to work for LGBTQ equality. All of this adds up to an outstanding ESG record, which is integrated into our strategy and increasingly important to investors. So I\u2019m really pleased with our accomplishments and looking forward. I\u2019m excited about the opportunities we have in 2021 and beyond. With that, I will turn it over to Brian.\nBrian Van Abel: Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. We had another strong year, booking $2.79 per share for 2020 compared with $2.64 per share last year. The most significant earnings drivers for the year include the following: higher electric margins increased earnings by $0.32 per share, primarily driven by rivers and rate outcomes; higher AFUDC increased earnings by $0.08 per share due to large projects under construction. Including our wind generation; lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.02 per share, driven by our cost management efforts; and finally, a lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.22 per share. As a reminder, production tax credits lowered the ETR. However, PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation and interest expense, which reduced earnings by $0.36 per share, reflecting our capital investment program. Other taxes, primarily property taxes, reduced earnings by $0.06 per share. And finally, other items combined to reduce earnings by $0.07 per share. Turning to sales. As expected, COVID had an adverse impact as weather in leaf adjusted electric sales declined by about 3%. For 2021, we don\u2019t anticipate a full shutdown of the economy like we experienced last spring. Instead, we expect a small recovery of lingering impacts throughout the year. As a result, we anticipate modest weather-adjusted sales growth of approximately 1% off of depressed 2020 sales levels. As a reminder, we have a sales true-up mechanism for all-electric classes in Minnesota and decoupling could be electric residential and non-demand small C&I classes in Colorado. This covers about 45% of our total retail electric sales. Shifting to expenses. We showed strong cost to management by reducing O&M nearly 1% to mitigate the adverse COVID impacts. We expect O&M expenses to be relatively flat in 2021, reflecting incremental costs for our new wind farms offset by a decline in base O&M. Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. In December, the Minnesota Commission approved our 2021 sale proposal as an alternative to our filed rate case. We view this as a constructive outcome that will allow us to focus on the Minnesota resource plan and other policy initiatives in 2021. In January, we filed a New Mexico rate case seeking a rate increase of approximately $88 million or a net rate increase of $48 million after reflecting the fuel savings in PTCs from the Sag Marlin farm. The net increase was driven by investment, transmission and distribution due to the significant growth in New Mexico system the last case. The request is based on an ROE of 10.35%, an equity ratio of 54.7% and a retail rate base of $1.9 billion in historic test year. It also includes changes in depreciation to reflect the planned early retirement of our top coal plant. The decision and implementation of final rates is anticipated in the fourth quarter of this year. We also plan to file a Texas rate case later in the quarter. Both cases were required as a part of the approval of our wind projects at SPS. In November 2020, we filed a request in North Dakota seeking an electric rate increase of approximately $22 million. This is our first rate case in North Dakota in eight years. The request is based on an ROE of 10.2% and an equity ratio of 52.5%, a rate base of $677 million in the forecast test year. Interim rates were implemented in January, and the decision is expected later this year. And in February, we will file a transmission expansion plan in Colorado to increase capacity to enable the addition of renewables to the system. We will also file a resource plan in Colorado at the end of March. It will include proposed plans for our remaining coal plants in the state as well as additional renewable resources as we work to produce carbon emissions at least 80% by 2030. The transmission expansion and resource plan will provide transparency into our long-term opportunities will likely lead to robust capital investment in the second half of the decade. We expect the decisions on both the transmission expansion and the resource plan by early 2022. As Ben mentioned, the Minnesota Commission approved our wind repowering proposal. As a result, we are moving these wind projects into our base capital forecast, which now reflects rate base growth of 6.6%. We also have potential incremental CapEx of approximately $210 million for the PPA buyout and $550 million for the Sherco Solar facility. If approved, rate base growth would be 6.9%. Accordingly, we have updated our capital tables and our financing plans as detailed in our earnings release. We anticipate that the incremental capital, if approved by the Minnesota Commission, will be financed with approximately 50% equity and 50% debt. This incremental equity will allow us to fund accretive capital investments, which will benefit our customers, while maintaining our solid credit metrics and favorable access to the capital markets. And with that, I will wrap up with a quick summary. We continue to provide reliable service to our customers while ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and communities. We effectively mitigated COVID impacts and delivered earnings within our original guidance range for the16th consecutive year. We increased our dividend for the 17th consecutive year. We continue to execute on our steel for fuel strategy by adding nearly 1,500 megawatts of owned wind in 2020. Minnesota Commission approved our wind repowering proposal and the acquisition of the more wind farm, both of which will provide significant benefits to our customers. The Colorado Commission approved our transportation electrification plan. We enhanced our ESG disclosures and made further progress to reduce coal exposure and delivering our carbon reduction goals. We resolved multiple regulatory proceedings. We have reaffirmed our 2021 earnings guidance of $2.97 per share to $3 per share. And finally, we remain confident we can deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within our $0.05 to $0.07 objective range. With that, that concludes our remarks, and operator, we will now take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Jeremy Tonet, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi good morning. Just wanted to start off with what you could say about what type of capital opportunities are you seeing associated with the Colorado IRP. And I was just wondering if you could frame the magnitude of what incremental spend might look like versus your current plan?\nBenjamin Fowke: Hey Jeremy good morning. So Jeremy, so two parts to that is really the Colorado transmission expansion plan. And if you have heard about us talk before about transmission. We see a lot of opportunities to really - this is needed to enable our energy transition, right? We need to enable several gigawatts of renewables. And if you think about that, it is enabling low-cost universal scale solar and wind to bring it to our load centers in Denver. So what you will see out of that, and I can\u2019t give you specifics in terms of the overall capital investment. We will file that in the next month or so. But significant investment opportunity on the transmission side. It is really a transmission backbone to deliver that for our customers as part of the ERP. On the Colorado resource plan, I think more detail would come on that. But look at our Minnesota resource plan is a good proxy, where we have several gigawatts of renewables in our preferred plant through 2030. So it will look and feel a lot like that. We are looking at what we are doing with our coal plants and adding a lot of renewables to help us achieve that 80% plan. So we are excited about it, excited by that transparency into the back half of this decade and more details to come.\nJeremy Tonet: That is helpful. Was just wondering if you might be able to comment on how the PPA bio opportunity set has evolved over the past year or so during the pandemic. And do you expect any market changes going forward here?\nBrian Van Abel: No, I think it has evolved a little bit. You see, we just announced 1 year generic, we will provide more details and officially announce that in the next month or so as we file it. We are excited to continue to execute on it. We delivered the Mower PPA buyout this year with the commission in this one. We continue to have conversations with our counterparties. I think there is another opportunity if you see potential tax credit extensions in Washington that you get some further repowering opportunities, but it is something that we continually look at and work on other counterparties. There is another good data point to watch is that our IRPs often drives RFPs, where we can have PPAs bid into us, PPA buyout opportunities. So that is a really good opportunity longer term. So what we are excited about it. We have delivered - if you look, we have delivered on our PPA buyout opportunity, we are counting this one that we just announced. It is over $500 million of PPA buyouts, and that is excluding Mankato. So we have delivered Mower, Longroad, this new one KEPCO and [indiscernible] Belmont. So a good long-term opportunity as we continue to look at harvesting it.\nBenjamin Fowke: Yes. And I think just whether it is PPAs, whether it is transmission spend, whether it is renewables, you should feel very confident that we have got a long runway of capital investment, and that is what we are really excited about it. And of course, we have been focused on renewables that actually save customers money too, so that gives clean energy transition can be driven by economics, which, of course, then sets up the electrification of other sectors like transport. So I think we have got great organic growth in front of us, Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That is very helpful. And 1 last one, if I could sneak in here. Just wondering, what do you guys see as the risk and opportunities with the potential acceleration of Minnesota\u2019s carbon-free electricity goal to 2040 here? And also thinking about on a national level, Biden has set up plans for 2035 there, just wondering if you had any thoughts you could share?\nBenjamin Fowke: Well, I mean, first of all, pretty pleased that Xcel and our whole industry now is really on volume board, achieving net zero goals. And for us, we think we can do zero carbon, not net zero, but zero carbon by 2050, with an important interim goal of 80% by 2030. But if you heard me talk before, I will tell you that, that last 20% is going to take technologies to become commercially viable because, Jeremy, I think it is incredibly important that this transition is based on economics. So that you do have the opportunities to electrify other sectors with economics and buying. You get a lot of bipartisan support when economics can drive the decisions. So could we go faster than our goal of 2050? Well, it is possible. but I think that would mean that those technologies that we refer to, whether it is the next-generation nuclear, whether it is the development of hydrogen. Whether it is carbon capture working economically, whether it is long-term storage. They have to come into the money much sooner than I think they will. But you have heard me say before, I never bet against technology. So more to come on that.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. I appreciate the thoughts in there. That is it for me. Thanks.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey good morning team. Thanks for the time. So I just wanted to follow-up on Colorado and latest thought process on timing for rate case there. In conjunction with the question, just curious about the shift in your 2021 guide on O&M. Is that driven in part by a thought process on Colorado rate case timing? I also noticed that there is a little bit of a shift in the lighter revenues there as well. So if you could speak to the 2021 shift on O&M as well as the latest on Colorado and timing here as well, if you don\u2019t mind.\nRobert Frenzel: Hey Julien, it is Bob. And thanks for the question. With regard to the case, I will cover that, and I will turn it back over to Brian to talk a little bit about your question on the O&M. So in Colorado, obviously, we have been talking about a case there. We filed two writers in the summer of last year. Obviously, we watch what happened with the [Ages] (Ph) writers. We are still prosecuting the wildfire writer. But there is a number of other factors that go into evaluation of our case in Colorado, and we are continuing to watch those. Obviously, the pace of economic recovery in Colorado is very important. We are seeing very strong growth there. But as Brian indicated, our sales forecast still expects a slow recovery with some lingering impacts. So sales is a key driver, and obviously our efforts around O&M and efficiency that we can gain in that business will probably dictate when and how we file a case in Colorado. It is likely in the second half outcome at the earliest. And it is largely associated with capital investments in the distribution business and enabling technologies for us to continue to deliver a great customer experience out there. So more to come from us, but it is probably at least a second half decision for us.\nBrian Van Abel: Good morning Julien. On your O&M question, first, just let me say, really proud of the employees and the work that was done in 2020. Just a great effort in terms of the mitigation work that everyone did in this company. About 2021, well it is a combination of things. One is we are continuing to drive sustainable cost transformation. And two, our 2020 actuals came in a little bit higher than we thought in Q3 due to a couple of discrete items, but expect us to continue to drive O&M transformation. Now what you don\u2019t see in our flat guidance is we are adding about $50 million of wind O&M in 2021. So we are offsetting that to keep our overall O&M flat with our cost transformation effort. So excited about what we accomplished in 2020, and what we expect to accomplish in 2021 and beyond.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Bob, coming back to you real quickly, if I can. In terms of - when you said that the - to quote a number of other factors here that go into it. I think if I\u2019m hearing right, perhaps the most decisive one is obviously the sales and economic growth, are there other material drivers that will come into it? It sounds like you are waiting to see the trajectory of this post-COVID year on sales. But I don\u2019t want to sort of mischaracterize that.\nRobert Frenzel: Look, we still have our wildfire rider proposal in front of the ALJ right now. We went to hearings a week or two ago and felt like we made a really good show in there. I mean this is a significant investment to mitigate a big state policy desire in terms of mitigating wildfires. So we would ask for a rider. The interveners came back proposing deferrals and we are differing on lengths and return profiles of those. So our, obviously, arguing a decent outcome in the wildfire writer is one of the factors that would go into our decision-making, but certainly not exclusive.\nBenjamin Fowke: Julien, probably like Bob said, it is sales, it is O&M, and then it would be regulatory decisions. All of that would factor into a maybe a kind of review and determine whether or not we need to file or not.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. Yes, understood. And if you got the deferral that would that be adequate? It sounds like there is more than just a binary decision on the wildfire here?\nBenjamin Fowke: Think you would have to just look at how - the devil is always in the details on those things. So that, along with the other drivers that I mentioned sales and O&M would be all the factors that we look down.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Appreciate it. All right guys. Thank you very much. All the best.\nBenjamin Fowke: Thank you too.\nRobert Frenzel: Thanks Julien.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nInsoo Kim: Thank you. Good morning. Brian, on the five year CapEx plan, can you just, I guess, go through which of the items are in the base plan versus the incremental? I know the proposed wind repowering and the one PPA buyout is - would be incremental amount of the base, but are investments in the hair between coal plant conversion and the investments with wildfire protection, all of those are - is that embedded in the baseline, or would that be incremental?\nBrian Van Abel: Yes. No. those are the ones that you mentioned are basically in the base plan. It is a relatively small investment in the current and the conversion of Harrington from coal to natural gas. We have our wildfire investments in our base plan. You are right, clear that we have the solar opportunity and the PPA buyout opportunity in the incremental plan and hope and expect to get visibility into those by the end of this year. So we can provide color and hopefully at a rate base growth trajectory of nearly 7% if we execute on those.\nInsoo Kim: Got it. And Ben just going back to Jeremy\u2019s question on President Biden\u2019s plans to achieve the carbon pollution free power sector in the year 2035. And setting to the side for a moment the probability hacking the federal or state policies to achieve that, do you think when you look at your fleet, the undepreciated value of your remaining coal plants or other fossil fuel units. How do you see that? Do you see that as potentially achievable given the current regulatory and price framework for renewable or what items do you think you are going to need on both ends to achieve that?\nBenjamin Fowke: Well, the accelerated depreciation is certainly a factor. But as I said with the prior question, it is far more a question of are the technologies ready and economically viable. Because getting to 80% is not easy, but we know we can do it with existing technology, and I know I can do it in a way that preserves affordability and reliability. But just to move completely away from fossil would require an incredible emergence and acceleration of technologies that I think are still ways away. So I mean, again, if technology can emerge, but 2035 is like tomorrow in utility land as far as technologies go. So I think there is going to be an element of pragmatism that gets baked into those goals. And I have always said, we will move as fast as the speed of technology and that is what we will do. But honestly, I think it is a very much of a stretch goal-based upon the way I see the horizon in front of us. With that said, I mean, there is a lot of good things that come with that goal. We support 100% carbon free. So we are aligned with that. I think under the Biden administration, you will see an acceleration of EVs and an acceleration of transmission build. I think you will see an acceleration of the R&D and the technologies that we need to achieve those goals, whether it is 2035, 2040 or 2050. And I think that is the key to me. And if we can all pull together on that and develop the right frameworks, invest in R&D, have the right tax policies. I think we are going to do amazing things. And nobody would have thought that we would be where we are today as an industry and certainly not at Xcel Energy just five years ago. So I\u2019m excited about what the future possibilities hold.\nInsoo Kim: Got it. Thank you so much for the color.\nBenjamin Fowke: Got it.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nStephen Byrd: Hey good morning. Hope you all are doing well. Just following up on - you can sense the theme on the questions here on federal policy, but I wanted to maybe get a little more specific. We may see further legislation that would both extend tax credits for wind and solar, potentially create a new tax credit for storage. And I\u2019m just curious, if you saw that kind of, let\u2019s say, that there is a longer-term extension, could that be material enough for you all to want to both kind of relook at your Minnesota resource plan, could that have a pretty big impact on how you think about your resource mix in Colorado. Like how impactful could longer-term extensions for wind and solar and kind of the new tax rate for storage be as you think about your resource mix in the future?\nBenjamin Fowke: Well, first of all, I think it is overall, it would be a positive. And I think there is also a discussion about tax credits for nuclear as well, which I am fully supportive of in transmission, all of those things are going to enable us to go, I think, even faster because of the affordability equation to it. Obviously, at some point, you do saturate the big grid with renewables regardless of cost. But if renewables continue to fall in price, Stephen, what that would allow you to do is put more renewables on your system, even if you have an increase in curtailments because the economics would pencil out better. So that is probably a long-winded answer to your question. But hopefully, that gives you some insights to it.\nRobert Frenzel: And Steve, I would just add that depending on how - certainly the devil is in the details, but depending on how long that PTC extension is for wind, you start to see more repowering opportunities come up as the wind farms exit their original 10-year PTC life. And so that is what you saw with the couple of wind farms that we got approved recently in the Minnesota commission. So I think that could present itself more opportunities if you have a longer-term extension.\nStephen Byrd: That is a good point. Maybe just following up a little bit on this. So let\u2019s dream here, and let\u2019s say that there is going to be longer-term extension of these tax credits and new store, tax credit, maybe transmission, nuclear. Is that enough to sort of trigger a kind of formal review on your part in terms of the mix that you have sort of established or is it less formal? And it would just - you continue to evolve your thinking over time, but it wouldn\u2019t necessarily sort of trigger a reassessment of your broader plans?\nBenjamin Fowke: Well I mean, I think it just puts our IRP processes and our proposals that much more deeply and money for our customers. And it makes the economics that much more compelling. Again, I think we can do more, accelerate some of the renewables that we have put into our system within operational limitations. But, Stephen, I mean, if you have got - our electricity because of those things becomes even more affordable, think about the opportunities to accelerate EV and other electrification of other sectors. I mean that would be a tremendous benefit.\nStephen Byrd: That is a fair point. Maybe just on EV\u2019s last question for me, I promise, just if we did...\nBenjamin Fowke: Stephen, can\u2019t hear you. Stephen, you both can\u2019t hear you. Stephen, did you go on mute by accident? That is one of the most popular terms in 2020, by the way. The other one is, could you go on mute? And the other one is I forgot my mask. We will move on to next question.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nSophie Karp: Congrats on the good year in this challenging environment for sure. Maybe to continue with the EV topic, right? What are the opportunities in the EV advancement, I guess, for you, aside from participating in the changing infrastructure. Have you done some modeling maybe along the lines of if penetration, household versus to levels, this maybe some upgrading into the distribution system. Do you know which areas or which state maybe have more need for that? Like how should we think about that? Because that is what really - topic has been on my mind a lot.\nRobert Frenzel: Hey, Sophie, it is Bob. Maybe I will start this, and then I will kick it over to Brian potentially. You are a little bit muffled, but I think you are asking about what\u2019s the investment opportunity if we have a significant penetration of electric vehicles. I think our forecast right now for the next five years has $0.5 billion in electric vehicle. And that includes charging stations and the distribution infrastructure that you mentioned to enable that. And over the decade, that number is closer to $1.5 billion to $2 billion. Similarly, that is all encapsulating into the distribution system. I think the one area that we could probably still sharpen our pen on a little bit is the impacts of fleet and heavy-duty vehicles and how that would impact us. Those are very discrete and high loads in certain feeders on our system. We probably aren\u2019t as sophisticated. We would like to be right now on exactly when and where that would happen because it is largely in the hands of the owners of those vehicles. So it is possible there is some incremental upside there. Our distribution feeders are I wouldn\u2019t say wildly underutilized at this point. And so potential capital expansion opportunities on fleet and heavy-duty vehicles is probably where any of the upside might come.\nBrian Van Abel: I think too, Sophie, there is a virtuous circle here. The more EV penetration we get, particularly we encourage customers to charge-off peak, the more all customers benefit. And so that tends to give us that tailwind of keeping our product affordable, which makes more electrification, more easy, everything else more possible. So that element of it is super exciting. You look way down the road, and there is a lot of folks. I think EV penetration could be an extension of the grid, if you will, in the use of those batteries. And I was kind of encouraged by the CEO of Ford when he spoke to us at an industry event that he saw that future too because in the past, I have been told that the car manufacturers are a little worried about using batteries in that matter. Now we are ways away from that. But I mean, when you look down a road, you can certainly see a future that incorporates EVs into the grid.\nSophie Karp: Got it, got it. This is very helpful. And then just on the power supply side, as the renewable targeting goals become more aggressive and possibly, we will see more build out if, as you mentioned, we will have additional ITC or the fiscal incentives. Is there a some area, where maybe you see kind of throwing in their potential coal retirement in Colorado. Is there a scenario where in some of these jurisdictions Colorado specifically or meeting so that you would see a shortage of base load power or like some dispatchable capacity, if you will, like what they have seen maybe in some other regions in that area right now or do you feel that you have adequate supplies to tie you over to the point where you can have dispatchability?\nBrian Van Abel: I mean, Sophie, let me just make sure I got - heard your question because it is a little muffled. Could you ask if do you see a situation where because of EV penetration and other things that we might have a shortage of expansion generation? Is that your question?\nSophie Karp: Yes, not as much because of EVs, but due to higher maybe wind penetration and coal retirements emerging.\nBrian Van Abel: Well, I mean, that is what the IRP processes are all about. I mean we do take a long-term view. That is why I do think the vertically integrated regulated model really works because we can plan for those kinds of contingencies and make sure that we do have adequate reserves and adequate backup. The point that we have to get across is to hit important interim goals. We do lead in the upper Midwest of reserve and the fleet, that is going very well, by the way. And we are going to need a little more of a gas back up, not necessarily using more gas, but having it ready when some of the renewable resources might not be there. All-in-all, it still pencils out to be cost beneficial for our customers. But those are the kinds of things we have to discuss in those resource planning processes so that we have a plan, to your point, that provides some economic benefits, the environmental benefits and, of course, maintains reliability.\nSophie Karp: Thank you so much. I will jump back into the queue.\nBrian Van Abel: Thank you Sophie.\nOperator: We will take our final question from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.\nPaul Patterson: So I wanted to just really quickly. I noticed that microgrids, you guys have a microgrid project, I think, you filed for something, I think, in December in Wisconsin. I was just wondering, what are you seeing or are you seeing any trend in that in any other service territories or - I realize it is a pilot, and I think it is only around $170-something million. But just sort of wondering if there is anything more you are seeing on that end in the service territories.\nRobert Frenzel: Paul, it is Bob. Look, we filed first some, we call them community resiliency initiatives in Colorado. And worked those through the process with the commission, and we have now got approval, and we are going to start to build out those initiatives. Haven\u2019t seen a lot of pull in micro grids in the rest of the service territories, but obviously something that we are willing to explore with our customers through the process, but it is been pretty quiet other than Colorado.\nBrian Van Abel: I think microgrids have a role in utilities future. They don\u2019t come without a price tag. So the resiliency element of it, those become important things. And what we are always willing to do is figure out how we can incorporate that into our total distribution planning process. And I think you will see more of that in the future. But it is not about cost, obviously.\nPaul Patterson: So just to sort of follow-up on that because I guess it varies from territory to territory. I guess within your service territories, I guess the economics simply aren\u2019t there in terms of arbitrage and stuff in terms of offsetting those costs. Is that how you sort of see it in terms of it being wide spend?\nRobert Frenzel: Yes, I think that is fair. I think they work primarily, again, in extra resiliency and extra reliabilities in order.\nPaul Patterson: Got it. Okay. Thanks so much.\nBrian Van Abel: Thank you Paul.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. For closing remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to Brian Van Abel.\nBrian Van Abel: Yes. Thank you all for participating in our earnings call this morning. For any questions, just please contact our Investor Relations team, and have a great day. Thank you all.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Hey Julien, it is Bob. And thanks for the question. With regard to the case, I will cover that, and I will turn it back over to Brian to talk a little bit about your question on the O&M. So in Colorado, obviously, we have been talking about a case there. We filed two writers in the summer of last year. Obviously, we watch what happened with the [Ages] (Ph) writers. We are still prosecuting the wildfire writer. But there is a number of other factors that go into evaluation of our case in Colorado, and we are continuing to watch those. Obviously, the pace of economic recovery in Colorado is very important. We are seeing very strong growth there. But as Brian indicated, our sales forecast still expects a slow recovery with some lingering impacts. So sales is a key driver, and obviously our efforts around O&M and efficiency that we can gain in that business will probably dictate when and how we file a case in Colorado. It is likely in the second half outcome at the earliest. And it is largely associated with capital investments in the distribution business and enabling technologies for us to continue to deliver a great customer experience out there. So more to come from us, but it is probably at least a second half decision for us. Look, we still have our wildfire rider proposal in front of the ALJ right now. We went to hearings a week or two ago and felt like we made a really good show in there. I mean this is a significant investment to mitigate a big state policy desire in terms of mitigating wildfires. So we would ask for a rider. The interveners came back proposing deferrals and we are differing on lengths and return profiles of those. So our, obviously, arguing a decent outcome in the wildfire writer is one of the factors that would go into our decision-making, but certainly not exclusive. Thanks Julien. And Steve, I would just add that depending on how - certainly the devil is in the details, but depending on how long that PTC extension is for wind, you start to see more repowering opportunities come up as the wind farms exit their original 10-year PTC life. And so that is what you saw with the couple of wind farms that we got approved recently in the Minnesota commission. So I think that could present itself more opportunities if you have a longer-term extension. Hey, Sophie, it is Bob. Maybe I will start this, and then I will kick it over to Brian potentially. You are a little bit muffled, but I think you are asking about what's the investment opportunity if we have a significant penetration of electric vehicles. I think our forecast right now for the next five years has $0.5 billion in electric vehicle. And that includes charging stations and the distribution infrastructure that you mentioned to enable that. And over the decade, that number is closer to $1.5 billion to $2 billion. Similarly, that is all encapsulating into the distribution system. I think the one area that we could probably still sharpen our pen on a little bit is the impacts of fleet and heavy-duty vehicles and how that would impact us. Those are very discrete and high loads in certain feeders on our system. We probably aren't as sophisticated. We would like to be right now on exactly when and where that would happen because it is largely in the hands of the owners of those vehicles. So it is possible there is some incremental upside there. Our distribution feeders are I wouldn't say wildly underutilized at this point. And so potential capital expansion opportunities on fleet and heavy-duty vehicles is probably where any of the upside might come. Paul, it is Bob. Look, we filed first some, we call them community resiliency initiatives in Colorado. And worked those through the process with the commission, and we have now got approval, and we are going to start to build out those initiatives. Haven't seen a lot of pull in micro grids in the rest of the service territories, but obviously something that we are willing to explore with our customers through the process, but it is been pretty quiet other than Colorado. Yes, I think that is fair. I think they work primarily, again, in extra resiliency and extra reliabilities in order."

            "name": "Benjamin Fowke",
            "content": "Anyway, okay, all right. So I'm not going to go off script, and I'm going to thank everybody, and welcome you to our call. Last year was certainly a challenging year, but our employees came through delivering on our financial and operational objectives while mitigating the impacts of COVID and helping our communities. Overall, 2020 was truly a stellar year. We executed on our business continuity plans as we kept employees and customers safe, while providing reliable customer service. We are helping to jump-start the economy through our capital investment programs, which create jobs and investment in our communities. And we stepped up our commitment to charitable giving to support those in need including donating a gain of almost $20 million from our sale of the Mankato facility. We had a long and impressive list of accomplishments in 2020. Let me share a few of them. We delivered EPS of $2.79 in 2020, which is the 16th consecutive year of meeting or exceeding our earnings guidance. We raised our annual dividend by $0.10 per share, which is the 17th straight year we have increased our dividend, and we achieved a total shareholder return of just over 7.8%, which was the second highest TSR for our peer group. Our O&M declined almost 1% as we took actions to mitigate the impacts of COVID. The Minnesota Commission approved our wind repowering proposal and I have requested to acquire another wind farm. And finally, we resolved multiple rate cases during the pandemic. Now turning to our investment plans. The Minnesota Commission recently approved our 650-megawatt wind repowering proposal with $750 million of rate base investment. The wind portfolio is projected to provide customer savings of more than $160 million over the life of the assets. It will create jobs, jump-start the economy and reduce carbon. In addition, we are also proposing to acquire a repowered 120-megawatt wind farm PPA buyout for about $210 million. Now this project was initially submitted as part of the Minnesota relief and recovery RFP, but the repowering didn't result in customer savings. However, we worked with the party on the terms and the project gets now expected to provide customer savings over the life of the asset. So we will move forward with it. We also plan to file our Minnesota solar proposal later in the quarter. This project consists of 460 megawatts of solar facilities near our retiring Sherco Coal plant, which takes advantage of existing transmission. We fine-tuned our projections and now expect an estimated investment of $550 million. This lower cost provides more benefit to our customers. We have requested a commission decision on both projects in the third quarter and are confident the commission will see the consumer benefit. As part of our strategy to lead the clean energy transition, we are also working to electrify the transport sector. In 2020, we announced the goal to enable 1.5 million electric vehicles in our service territory by 2030. We have programs and filings underway in various states and our transportation electrification plan in Colorado was just recently approved. And we continue to achieve important milestones in our nation leading wind expansion program with the completion of 6 projects in 2020. These projects represent nearly 1,500 megawatts of capacity and were completed under budget. In addition, we have approximately 800 megawatts of wind projects under construction, which are expected to be completed in 2021. We are excited to continue the clean energy transition, which will result in significant customer savings and carbon reductions. We also had a strong year operationally. For example, our nuclear fleet continues to make great strides in transforming performance while reducing cost. The fleet achieved a capacity factor of over 96% in 2020, even with the refueling outage during COVID. We have one of the top-performing nuclear fleets in the country as rated by both the NRC and INPO. And in addition to strong performance, we have continued to lower our cost structure, with O&M costs declining by more than 5% in 2020, and this is the sixth straight year of declining O&M costs in our nuclear operations. So I'm extremely proud of the effort and the results of our nuclear employees and their leadership in our industry. Beyond our strong financial and operational performance, I'm also very proud of our ESG leadership. In 2020, we estimate that we reduced carbon emissions by about 50% from 2005 levels. And we remain on track to achieve an 80% carbon reduction by 2030. We announced our plans to convert the Harrington coal plant in Texas to natural gas by the end of 2024. Working with our co-owners, we announced the proposed early retirement of the Craig and Hayden Coal plants in Colorado. We will address the remaining coal plants in Colorado in our resource plan filing at the end of March. We are also making significant strides to improve ESG compliance, transparency and disclosure as we issued our TCFD risk assessment, our natural gas report on our plans to reduce greenhouse gases in our LDC and our green bond impact report. We earned another perfect score on the human rights campaigns corporate quality index and remain among the best places to work for LGBTQ equality. All of this adds up to an outstanding ESG record, which is integrated into our strategy and increasingly important to investors. So I'm really pleased with our accomplishments and looking forward. I'm excited about the opportunities we have in 2021 and beyond. With that, I will turn it over to Brian. Hey Jeremy good morning. So Jeremy, so two parts to that is really the Colorado transmission expansion plan. And if you have heard about us talk before about transmission. We see a lot of opportunities to really - this is needed to enable our energy transition, right? We need to enable several gigawatts of renewables. And if you think about that, it is enabling low-cost universal scale solar and wind to bring it to our load centers in Denver. So what you will see out of that, and I can't give you specifics in terms of the overall capital investment. We will file that in the next month or so. But significant investment opportunity on the transmission side. It is really a transmission backbone to deliver that for our customers as part of the ERP. On the Colorado resource plan, I think more detail would come on that. But look at our Minnesota resource plan is a good proxy, where we have several gigawatts of renewables in our preferred plant through 2030. So it will look and feel a lot like that. We are looking at what we are doing with our coal plants and adding a lot of renewables to help us achieve that 80% plan. So we are excited about it, excited by that transparency into the back half of this decade and more details to come. Yes. And I think just whether it is PPAs, whether it is transmission spend, whether it is renewables, you should feel very confident that we have got a long runway of capital investment, and that is what we are really excited about it. And of course, we have been focused on renewables that actually save customers money too, so that gives clean energy transition can be driven by economics, which, of course, then sets up the electrification of other sectors like transport. So I think we have got great organic growth in front of us, Jeremy. Well, I mean, first of all, pretty pleased that Xcel and our whole industry now is really on volume board, achieving net zero goals. And for us, we think we can do zero carbon, not net zero, but zero carbon by 2050, with an important interim goal of 80% by 2030. But if you heard me talk before, I will tell you that, that last 20% is going to take technologies to become commercially viable because, Jeremy, I think it is incredibly important that this transition is based on economics. So that you do have the opportunities to electrify other sectors with economics and buying. You get a lot of bipartisan support when economics can drive the decisions. So could we go faster than our goal of 2050? Well, it is possible. but I think that would mean that those technologies that we refer to, whether it is the next-generation nuclear, whether it is the development of hydrogen. Whether it is carbon capture working economically, whether it is long-term storage. They have to come into the money much sooner than I think they will. But you have heard me say before, I never bet against technology. So more to come on that. Julien, probably like Bob said, it is sales, it is O&M, and then it would be regulatory decisions. All of that would factor into a maybe a kind of review and determine whether or not we need to file or not. Think you would have to just look at how - the devil is always in the details on those things. So that, along with the other drivers that I mentioned sales and O&M would be all the factors that we look down. Thank you too. Well, the accelerated depreciation is certainly a factor. But as I said with the prior question, it is far more a question of are the technologies ready and economically viable. Because getting to 80% is not easy, but we know we can do it with existing technology, and I know I can do it in a way that preserves affordability and reliability. But just to move completely away from fossil would require an incredible emergence and acceleration of technologies that I think are still ways away. So I mean, again, if technology can emerge, but 2035 is like tomorrow in utility land as far as technologies go. So I think there is going to be an element of pragmatism that gets baked into those goals. And I have always said, we will move as fast as the speed of technology and that is what we will do. But honestly, I think it is a very much of a stretch goal-based upon the way I see the horizon in front of us. With that said, I mean, there is a lot of good things that come with that goal. We support 100% carbon free. So we are aligned with that. I think under the Biden administration, you will see an acceleration of EVs and an acceleration of transmission build. I think you will see an acceleration of the R&D and the technologies that we need to achieve those goals, whether it is 2035, 2040 or 2050. And I think that is the key to me. And if we can all pull together on that and develop the right frameworks, invest in R&D, have the right tax policies. I think we are going to do amazing things. And nobody would have thought that we would be where we are today as an industry and certainly not at Xcel Energy just five years ago. So I'm excited about what the future possibilities hold. Got it. Well, first of all, I think it is overall, it would be a positive. And I think there is also a discussion about tax credits for nuclear as well, which I am fully supportive of in transmission, all of those things are going to enable us to go, I think, even faster because of the affordability equation to it. Obviously, at some point, you do saturate the big grid with renewables regardless of cost. But if renewables continue to fall in price, Stephen, what that would allow you to do is put more renewables on your system, even if you have an increase in curtailments because the economics would pencil out better. So that is probably a long-winded answer to your question. But hopefully, that gives you some insights to it. Well I mean, I think it just puts our IRP processes and our proposals that much more deeply and money for our customers. And it makes the economics that much more compelling. Again, I think we can do more, accelerate some of the renewables that we have put into our system within operational limitations. But, Stephen, I mean, if you have got - our electricity because of those things becomes even more affordable, think about the opportunities to accelerate EV and other electrification of other sectors. I mean that would be a tremendous benefit. Stephen, can't hear you. Stephen, you both can't hear you. Stephen, did you go on mute by accident? That is one of the most popular terms in 2020, by the way. The other one is, could you go on mute? And the other one is I forgot my mask. We will move on to next question."

            "name": "Brian Van Abel",
            "content": "Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. We had another strong year, booking $2.79 per share for 2020 compared with $2.64 per share last year. The most significant earnings drivers for the year include the following: higher electric margins increased earnings by $0.32 per share, primarily driven by rivers and rate outcomes; higher AFUDC increased earnings by $0.08 per share due to large projects under construction. Including our wind generation; lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.02 per share, driven by our cost management efforts; and finally, a lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.22 per share. As a reminder, production tax credits lowered the ETR. However, PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation and interest expense, which reduced earnings by $0.36 per share, reflecting our capital investment program. Other taxes, primarily property taxes, reduced earnings by $0.06 per share. And finally, other items combined to reduce earnings by $0.07 per share. Turning to sales. As expected, COVID had an adverse impact as weather in leaf adjusted electric sales declined by about 3%. For 2021, we don't anticipate a full shutdown of the economy like we experienced last spring. Instead, we expect a small recovery of lingering impacts throughout the year. As a result, we anticipate modest weather-adjusted sales growth of approximately 1% off of depressed 2020 sales levels. As a reminder, we have a sales true-up mechanism for all-electric classes in Minnesota and decoupling could be electric residential and non-demand small C&I classes in Colorado. This covers about 45% of our total retail electric sales. Shifting to expenses. We showed strong cost to management by reducing O&M nearly 1% to mitigate the adverse COVID impacts. We expect O&M expenses to be relatively flat in 2021, reflecting incremental costs for our new wind farms offset by a decline in base O&M. Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. In December, the Minnesota Commission approved our 2021 sale proposal as an alternative to our filed rate case. We view this as a constructive outcome that will allow us to focus on the Minnesota resource plan and other policy initiatives in 2021. In January, we filed a New Mexico rate case seeking a rate increase of approximately $88 million or a net rate increase of $48 million after reflecting the fuel savings in PTCs from the Sag Marlin farm. The net increase was driven by investment, transmission and distribution due to the significant growth in New Mexico system the last case. The request is based on an ROE of 10.35%, an equity ratio of 54.7% and a retail rate base of $1.9 billion in historic test year. It also includes changes in depreciation to reflect the planned early retirement of our top coal plant. The decision and implementation of final rates is anticipated in the fourth quarter of this year. We also plan to file a Texas rate case later in the quarter. Both cases were required as a part of the approval of our wind projects at SPS. In November 2020, we filed a request in North Dakota seeking an electric rate increase of approximately $22 million. This is our first rate case in North Dakota in eight years. The request is based on an ROE of 10.2% and an equity ratio of 52.5%, a rate base of $677 million in the forecast test year. Interim rates were implemented in January, and the decision is expected later this year. And in February, we will file a transmission expansion plan in Colorado to increase capacity to enable the addition of renewables to the system. We will also file a resource plan in Colorado at the end of March. It will include proposed plans for our remaining coal plants in the state as well as additional renewable resources as we work to produce carbon emissions at least 80% by 2030. The transmission expansion and resource plan will provide transparency into our long-term opportunities will likely lead to robust capital investment in the second half of the decade. We expect the decisions on both the transmission expansion and the resource plan by early 2022. As Ben mentioned, the Minnesota Commission approved our wind repowering proposal. As a result, we are moving these wind projects into our base capital forecast, which now reflects rate base growth of 6.6%. We also have potential incremental CapEx of approximately $210 million for the PPA buyout and $550 million for the Sherco Solar facility. If approved, rate base growth would be 6.9%. Accordingly, we have updated our capital tables and our financing plans as detailed in our earnings release. We anticipate that the incremental capital, if approved by the Minnesota Commission, will be financed with approximately 50% equity and 50% debt. This incremental equity will allow us to fund accretive capital investments, which will benefit our customers, while maintaining our solid credit metrics and favorable access to the capital markets. And with that, I will wrap up with a quick summary. We continue to provide reliable service to our customers while ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and communities. We effectively mitigated COVID impacts and delivered earnings within our original guidance range for the16th consecutive year. We increased our dividend for the 17th consecutive year. We continue to execute on our steel for fuel strategy by adding nearly 1,500 megawatts of owned wind in 2020. Minnesota Commission approved our wind repowering proposal and the acquisition of the more wind farm, both of which will provide significant benefits to our customers. The Colorado Commission approved our transportation electrification plan. We enhanced our ESG disclosures and made further progress to reduce coal exposure and delivering our carbon reduction goals. We resolved multiple regulatory proceedings. We have reaffirmed our 2021 earnings guidance of $2.97 per share to $3 per share. And finally, we remain confident we can deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within our $0.05 to $0.07 objective range. With that, that concludes our remarks, and operator, we will now take questions. No, I think it has evolved a little bit. You see, we just announced 1 year generic, we will provide more details and officially announce that in the next month or so as we file it. We are excited to continue to execute on it. We delivered the Mower PPA buyout this year with the commission in this one. We continue to have conversations with our counterparties. I think there is another opportunity if you see potential tax credit extensions in Washington that you get some further repowering opportunities, but it is something that we continually look at and work on other counterparties. There is another good data point to watch is that our IRPs often drives RFPs, where we can have PPAs bid into us, PPA buyout opportunities. So that is a really good opportunity longer term. So what we are excited about it. We have delivered - if you look, we have delivered on our PPA buyout opportunity, we are counting this one that we just announced. It is over $500 million of PPA buyouts, and that is excluding Mankato. So we have delivered Mower, Longroad, this new one KEPCO and [indiscernible] Belmont. So a good long-term opportunity as we continue to look at harvesting it. Good morning Julien. On your O&M question, first, just let me say, really proud of the employees and the work that was done in 2020. Just a great effort in terms of the mitigation work that everyone did in this company. About 2021, well it is a combination of things. One is we are continuing to drive sustainable cost transformation. And two, our 2020 actuals came in a little bit higher than we thought in Q3 due to a couple of discrete items, but expect us to continue to drive O&M transformation. Now what you don't see in our flat guidance is we are adding about $50 million of wind O&M in 2021. So we are offsetting that to keep our overall O&M flat with our cost transformation effort. So excited about what we accomplished in 2020, and what we expect to accomplish in 2021 and beyond. Yes. No. those are the ones that you mentioned are basically in the base plan. It is a relatively small investment in the current and the conversion of Harrington from coal to natural gas. We have our wildfire investments in our base plan. You are right, clear that we have the solar opportunity and the PPA buyout opportunity in the incremental plan and hope and expect to get visibility into those by the end of this year. So we can provide color and hopefully at a rate base growth trajectory of nearly 7% if we execute on those. I think too, Sophie, there is a virtuous circle here. The more EV penetration we get, particularly we encourage customers to charge-off peak, the more all customers benefit. And so that tends to give us that tailwind of keeping our product affordable, which makes more electrification, more easy, everything else more possible. So that element of it is super exciting. You look way down the road, and there is a lot of folks. I think EV penetration could be an extension of the grid, if you will, in the use of those batteries. And I was kind of encouraged by the CEO of Ford when he spoke to us at an industry event that he saw that future too because in the past, I have been told that the car manufacturers are a little worried about using batteries in that matter. Now we are ways away from that. But I mean, when you look down a road, you can certainly see a future that incorporates EVs into the grid. I mean, Sophie, let me just make sure I got - heard your question because it is a little muffled. Could you ask if do you see a situation where because of EV penetration and other things that we might have a shortage of expansion generation? Is that your question? Well, I mean, that is what the IRP processes are all about. I mean we do take a long-term view. That is why I do think the vertically integrated regulated model really works because we can plan for those kinds of contingencies and make sure that we do have adequate reserves and adequate backup. The point that we have to get across is to hit important interim goals. We do lead in the upper Midwest of reserve and the fleet, that is going very well, by the way. And we are going to need a little more of a gas back up, not necessarily using more gas, but having it ready when some of the renewable resources might not be there. All-in-all, it still pencils out to be cost beneficial for our customers. But those are the kinds of things we have to discuss in those resource planning processes so that we have a plan, to your point, that provides some economic benefits, the environmental benefits and, of course, maintains reliability. Thank you Sophie. I think microgrids have a role in utilities future. They don't come without a price tag. So the resiliency element of it, those become important things. And what we are always willing to do is figure out how we can incorporate that into our total distribution planning process. And I think you will see more of that in the future. But it is not about cost, obviously. Thank you Paul. Yes. Thank you all for participating in our earnings call this morning. For any questions, just please contact our Investor Relations team, and have a great day. Thank you all."

Questions will only be taken from institutional investors. Reporters can contact media relations with inquiries, and individual investors and others can reach out to Investor Relations. At this time, I turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nPaul Johnson: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2020 third quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Bob Frenzel, President and Chief Operating Officer; Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Amanda Rome, Executive Vice President and General Counsel. This morning, we'll review our third quarter results, share recent business and regulatory developments and provide 2021 guidance in our updated five-year financial plan. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder, some of the comments we make during today's call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. Today, we will discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures, including items, ongoing earnings, electric and natural gas margins. Information on comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release. With that I'll turn the call over to Ben Fowke.\nBen Fowke: Well, thank you, Paul and good morning everyone. We had another strong quarter booking earnings of $1.14 per share for the third quarter of 2020, compared with $1.01 per share last year. Our year-to-date earnings are on track with our financial plan, and we are mitigating the impact of COVID-19. As a result, we are narrowing our 2020 guidance range to $2.75 to $2.81 per share. Now, consistent with our third quarter tradition, we have provided our updated base investment plan, which reflects 22.6 billion of capital expenditures over the next five years. This represents rate base growth of 6.3% off of 2020 base year. This represents our base capital. In addition, we've identified potential incremental CapEx of 1.4 billion associated with the Minnesota relief and recovery proposal, which, if approved, would drive rate base growth of 6.9%. We're also initiating 2021 guidance of $2.90 to $3 per share, which is consistent with our 5% to 7% long-term EPS growth objectives. We're very excited about our plan, which provides significant customer value, keeps bills well and delivers attractive returns for our investors. We also continue to help our customers and protect our employees during this pandemic. We stepped up charitable giving to help our communities including donating a gain from the sale of our Mankato facility. For more details, see our slides. Our business continuity plans have been executed extremely well, including the completing of a re-fueling outage at our Prairie Island Nuclear facility for keeping employees safe while providing reliable customer service. And we're helping to restart the economy through our capital investment programs which create jobs in our communities. Earlier this year, the Minnesota Commission opened a relief and recovery docket and inviting utilities to submit potential projects that will create jobs and jumpstart the economy. In September, we filed a repowering proposal that includes four Xcel energy wind farms of approximately 650 megawatts, with 750 million of capital investment. In addition, the proposal includes 67 megawatts of repowered PPA extensions. The portfolio is projected to provide customer savings of over $160 million over the life of the assets. We've requested a commission decision on the wind proposal by year-end. We're also proposing 460 megawatts of solar facilities near our retiring Sherco coal plant to take advantage of the existing transmission. Project represents an estimated investment of 650 million. We plan to file our solar proposal in early 2021 and anticipate a decision in mid '21. We're confident the commission will see the customer benefits of these projects. We continue to make progress on our PPA buyout strategy. In August, the Minnesota Commission approved our request to acquire the 99-megawatt Mower wind farm after it is repowered. Mower is currently a PPA. In addition, we filed to buy out the KEPCO solar facility in Colorado. While the $41 million investment is relatively small, the PPA is out of the money, and the buyout will save our customers $38 million over the 11 years. I think this is another example of our keeping bills well priority. We continue to make strong progress on our wind development initiatives. In August our 500 megawatts Cheyenne Ridge wind farm went into operation. Cheyenne Ridge was completed ahead of schedule and under budget. Since it began operations, we set a record with 70% of hourly load coming from wind generation in Colorado. We also reached an agreement to acquire a 74-megawatt solar facility in Wisconsin for approximately $100 million. We expect a commission decision later in 2021 and this will be our first universal scale solar rate base investment. I'm also excited to announce that Xcel Energy was recently awarded a $10 million DOE grant for an innovation pilot to produce carbon free hydrogen at one of our nuclear power plants. We're partnering with the Idaho National Lab and others to use excess electricity and steam to separate the hydrogen and oxygen molecules and water using a high temperature electrolysis process, which is 30% more efficient, and a sustainable way to produce hydrogen. And while it's not currently economical, we think hydrogen has long-term potential to be a carbon free form of dispatchable generation, which will allow the country to achieve its carbon goals, while maintaining reliability. I want to wrap up with a couple of comments on electric vehicles. We recently announced our vision to enable 1.5 million EVs in our service territory by 2030. We spent the last few years working with our commission on programs that will enable EVs in our service territory and help turn this vision into reality. Electrification of the transport system will reduce carbon and save our customers money. I'm also proud of the recent award we received from Fortnightly, which declared our EV program the smartest transportation electrification project as part of its smartest utility projects in 2020. We've developed an EV subscription that makes it easier for customers that have charging stations installed at their homes and to be charged a monthly rate for off peak usage, which can save customers money and make more efficient use of the electric grid. So before I do turn it over to Brian for more detail on financial results and outlook, I just want to say that as you probably know, the southeast is wrestling with Hurricane Beta, and its widespread outages. And the Southwest is working around the clock restoring our customers on the damages due to Winter Storm Billy. Our customers over the past three days have restored two thirds of 145 customers in SPS that have been out as a result of this ice storm. I know there are hundreds of thousands out there and other parts of the Southwest that are out. I'm just so proud of our team for focusing on our customers in these adverse conditions. And I'm proud of the industry. We have a history of mutual aid. It's never more evident in storm recovery and these last two events and quite frankly, the entire year. So with that, I will turn it over to Brian.\nBrian Van Abel: Thanks, Ben and good morning everyone. We had another strong quarter booking $1.14 per share for the third quarter of 2020 compared with $1.01 per share last year. More significant earnings drivers for the quarter include the following. Higher electric margins increased earnings by $0.20 per share, primarily driven by riders and rate outcomes. O&M expensive were flat for the quarter, primarily driven by our cost management efforts. And the lower effective tax rate increase earnings by $0.07 per share. As a reminder, production tax credits lower the ETR. However, PTGs are flawed back to customers through lower electric margin and are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation and interest expense, which reduced earnings by $0.12 per share, reflecting our capital investment program. In addition, other items combined to reduce earnings by $0.02 per share. Next, I want to discuss the status of COVID-19 impacts in our mitigation efforts. As expected, COVID-19 had an adverse impact as third quarter weather-adjusted electric sales declined by 2.4%. Although, these impacts are better than projected in our guidance assumptions, we now assume annual electric sales will decline approximately 3% for 2020. As a reminder, we have a sales drop mechanism for all electric classes in Minnesota, and the coupling for the electric residential and non-demand small C&I classes in Colorado, which covers about 45% of our total retail electric sales. Since sales have come in better than projected and weather has been favorable, we've adjusted our O&M contingency plans accordingly. We continue to closely monitor bad debt expense and work with customers on payment plans. At this point, we expect bad debt expense will increase approximately $25 million over normal levels, which remains in line with previous forecasts. We received approval for certain pandemic related expenses in all states, except for North Dakota, where our request remains on the Commission review. We've also made strong progress on reducing O&M expenses to mitigate COVID-19 impacts. Based on our year-to-date results and updated sales projections, we now expect annual O&M expenses will decline 1% to 2% in 2020 compared to our initial guidance of a 2% increase. Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. In Texas, the Commission approved our rate case settlement that reflects an electric rate increase of $88 million, a ROE of 9.45% and equity ratio of 54.6% for AC/DC purposes, an acceleration of the depreciation life of the Tolk coal plant. In October, the Colorado Commission accepted the ALJs recommended decision to approve our natural gas rate case settlement without modification reflecting a net rate increase of $77 million, a ROE of 9.2%, an equity ratio of 55.6% and the historic test year of an adjustment for the Tungsten the BlackRock projects. We view both the Texas and Colorado decisions as constructive regulatory outcomes. My preference is to avoid rate cases when possible. So in July, we filed for rider recovery of our wildfire and advanced grid investments in Colorado instead of filing a comprehensive rate case. The riders will cover 2021 through 2025 and provide regulatory flexibility. We're still in the early phases of these proceedings. In September, we filed the 2021 sale proposal in Minnesota is as an alternative path to the rate case we plan to file in early November. We expect the commission to decide in December whether it will accept the sale or proceed as a multi-year rate case. And as Ben noted we're initiating our 2021 earnings guidance range of $2.90 to $3 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%. Our 2021 EPS guidance is based on several assumptions which are detailed in our earnings release. I want to highlight several of these items here. We've seen constructive regulatory outcomes in all proceedings. We anticipate modest impact from COVID-19. We project electric sales growth of approximately 1%, which reflects a modest recovery over the COVID depressed sales levels in 2020. We expect O&M expenses to increase approximately 1%, which reflects increased costs for new wind projects and lower O&M levels in 2020 due to COVID mitigation. Please note that wind O&Ms recover to regulatory mechanisms in most jurisdictions and is offset by fuel savings. And finally, we anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately negative 9%, largely driven by increased levels of wind PTCs, which are credited to customers and generally have no material impact on earnings. In our earnings release, you'll find more detail about our updated $22.6 billion five-year base capital forecasts. The base forecasts reflect significant grid investment including our advanced grid initiative and additional investment in the transmission system to maintain absolute health and reliability and enable renewable generation. It also includes a modest level of renewable, expenditure to improve the customer experience and the natural gas combined cycle plant at our Sherco facility to ensure reliability as we have proposed to retire all of our Minnesota coal plants by 2030. Our base capital plan results in annual rate base growth of approximately 6.3% using 2020 as a base. We also have potential incremental CapEx of approximately $750 million for wind repowering projects and $650 million for a solar facility, which are pending Commission approval as part of the Minnesota relief and recovery filing. We're confident the Commission will see the customer benefits of these projects. If approved, rate base growth will be 6.9%. In addition, we think there's other potential upside CapEx that could materialize in the future. Our capital investment plan supports are 5% to 7% long-term earnings growth objective and our goal to deliver EPS and dividend growth in the upper half of the range. We've also updated our financing plan, which reflects a combination of internal cash generation and debt issuances to fund the majority of our capital expenditures. In addition, we expected to issue $250 million of equity and $400 million of DRIP and benefits equity consistent with our previous forecasts. Importantly, our financing plan maintains our current credit metrics. We anticipate that the incremental capital, if approved by the Minnesota Commission will be financed with approximately 50% equity and 50% debt. This incremental equity will allow us to fund the creative capital investments, which will benefit our customers on maintaining solid credit ratings and favorable access to the capital markets. And with that, I'll wrap up. We're effectively mitigating COVID-19 impacts. We continue to provide reliable service to our customers, while ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and communities. The Colorado and Texas Commissions approved constructive rate case settlements. Our relief and recovery proposal in Minnesota will create jobs, help jubilate our local economies and result in significant customer benefits. We narrowed our 2020 guidance range to $2.75 to $2.81 per share based on solid year-to-date results and progress on contingency plans. We announced a robust updated capital investment program that provides strong, transparent rate base growth and significant customer value. We initiated 2021 earnings guidance at $2.90 to $3 per share consistent with our long-term objective. And finally, we remain confident we can deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within our 5% to 7% objective range. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator we will now take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning, team. Congratulations on the update there.\nBen Fowke: Thank you.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: I'll keep going here on the '21 update. Can you talk a little bit about the thought process on the 1% on an increase? I mean, conceptually I get that you had a down here this year. So it would reverse, but how are you thinking about that reversing? Obviously, you guys are one of the first out there in the industry to give a '21 with COVID impacts. How are you thinking about the back to business and the ability to sustain some of the benefits you saw this year?\nBen Fowke: Hey, Julien. Good morning. So the way we think about it and maybe frame it up into - if you remember going into this year, our O&M guidance was 2% up. We're investing significantly in our wind farms, along with all these strategic priorities, such as our grid investments in customer. And then we didn't see our guidance for 2021, but we expected a similar increase prior to COVID in that range. But now if you look at where we'll land this year, down 1% to 2, and slightly up next year, will roughly be flat to 2019. So that kind of gives - and that's on a consolidated level. Obviously, it's varies a little bit by article. But overall, that kind of gives you a sense of how we're kind of driving cost transformation through our business, as we absorb our strategic priorities and remain flat.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Yeah, and even to clarify that slightly, you said in your prepared remarks, the wind aspect of the O&M increase, that would be also disclosed to as well. So when they impact your net margins? I heard you right?\nBen Fowke: Yes. So yeah, that's correct, in terms of where it is recovered.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent and then if I can a little bit more conceptually here, as you're thinking about prospects in the next year. And obviously, things are pending at two figures, but with respect to subsequent legislation in Minnesota, specifically around RPS reform, et cetera. Can you help frame some of the possibilities that are out there today, if you don't mind?\nBen Fowke: RPS reform Julien, this is done.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Sorry, energy legislation, as I suppose there's a variety of -\nBen Fowke: Brian talked about.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Right, I mean, I'll need you to fill in the blank pretty well?\nBen Fowke: Yeah, I mean, I think - I mean, we'll have to see obviously, how it plays out at the state level and obviously, the federal level as well. But Julien, I think we're very well positioned for whatever happens. I mean, remember, one of the things I'm so proud of is we're leading the way, we've got an 80% interim target, a 100% target by 2050, but we do that with liability and economics in mind. So that tends to bring both sides of the aisle along. At the federal level, if it does become a Biden administration, and maybe the senate flips as well, I think we're probably well positioned to do more with renewable. I think they would probably accelerate EVs and help with our 1.5 million target. I would also welcome the chance as both CEO of Xcel and Chairman of EI to work with the Biden ministration and kind of let them know that 2035 and utility timeframe for the technologies that will be needed is very aggressive. So there's a reason why we chose 2050. Now at the state level, we'll just play it out. But I mean, I think we've demonstrated we can work very well crafting legislation that works for customers and shareholders alike.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it, excellent, well, I'll leave it there, taking this time, thank you all.\nBen Fowke: Thank you, Julien. Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet of JP Morgan.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.\nBen Fowke: Good morning Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: Just want to start off, see if it's possible, you could provide any early feedback that you might be having on your Minnesota recovery planning application at this point.\nBob Frenzel: Hey, Jeremy, it's Bob, and thanks for the question, loved the headline on the report this morning and the reference. On the Minnesota R&R plan and the broader stay out proposal. We are working productively with all stakeholders. I think we've got support from the OAG and the environmental advocates for a stay out and so the R&R proposal, we're I would say proactively working with the department and trying to gain their support. We expect to follow our mean rate case next week as the alternative to the sale proposal. And similar last year, we would expect the commission to take that up in about six to eight weeks. So call it early to mid-December timeframe. We'd expect them to make a decision. And look we think the R&R plan and the stay out proposal are very much in line with the Administration's and the Commission's goals and we'd expect a productive outcome in December.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it, that's very helpful. Thanks for that. And then just switching gears here, there's been multiple reports of potential M&A in the industry and some transactions have happened recently. Just wondering, does Xcel have any role to play in industry consolidation or just the Great plants that you guys have in front of yourself as far as the attractive organic growth that really kind of keeps all of your attention focus there, and M&A is not really a big consideration for you guys.\nBob Frenzel: Well, I mean, we don't - it's a great question, by the way. And I won't comment on anything specific. But I mean you've heard me speak over the years that our focus is primarily on organic growth. It's nothing like one times book. And I think our investors love that. But we obviously see what's happening in the industry and the long-term trend to consolidation. It's not like we don't look at things, but I will just tell you, we can be disciplined because we do have good organic growth, and we're not looking to fill some sort of earnings void or something like that. So we're very disciplined about it and I think that's one of the reasons why we trade at a bit of a premium to our peers.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That makes sense. That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra of Evercore ISI.\nBen Fowke: Good morning.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey, good morning team. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to go back and clarify the December sort of timeline that you gave us, is that for the R&R filing? I'm just trying to see what kind of the milestones or timeline that we should be watching for you to kind of get approval on the incremental CapEx that you laid out?\nBob Frenzel: Yeah, sure, so this is Bob again. For the mid December filing, we would expect a decision on rate case or stay out provision. We also would expect the wind component of our R&R plan to be heard in the December timeframe as well. I think the solar piece of our plan is more likely going to be a Q2 of 2021 timeframe. I think that makes up the bulk of the investment opportunity, there's some other areas around electric vehicles and distribution and transmission spend, which we could take up in normal course in separate dockets, but those are the two big buckets.\nDurgesh Chopra: Super helpful, so just to clarify wind by this year, and then solar by the first quarter next year, right. Did I get that right?\nBob Frenzel: Correct. Second quarter, sorry, end of second quarter is probably more realistic.\nDurgesh Chopra: Okay, understood, thank you. That's great. And then maybe just going back to your comments around a potential regime change in Biden administration, I think we hear you on sort of the aggressive 2035 targets, but generally speaking, how does it fit into your current plan? Does it delve into future rate base CapEx growth the climate plan that is and then maybe is there any thoughts in a potential tax rate changing implications for you?\nBen Fowke: So I'm going to let Brian talk about the tax implications. As far as headwind tailwind, I think it's I think it's probably helpful to accelerate our renewable program. I absolutely think it'd be helpful to our 1.5 million electric vehicle goal. And that's something that would create additional opportunities for investment. I'm particularly excited about EVs, if you've heard me speak before, because I don't know if it's steel for fuel, but it's a type of steel for fuel. The variable cost of an EV is significantly below that of a gasoline. The charge off similar rates its equivalent of $0.60 a gallon, so while EVs are expensive today, we think that cost comes down. Biden administration might help that costs come down even more and then we're getting more EVs out there reducing the carbon footprint obviously, and creating investment opportunities for us in additional sales load, which all customers benefit from. I'll turn it over to Brian, for your tax question.\nBrian Van Abel: Yeah, and the details on the Biden tax and are still a little bit light, but I'll hit on a couple of high points, right, if you think whether tax rate increased from 21% to 28%. Just like the TCJA, where we went from 35 %to 21%, our customers saw a savings of 3% to 4%. So if we go the other way, we expect to see a onetime customer impact of 1.5%, 2%. In a while it's never positive to see that impacts our customer bills, we do think it's manageable. And we did set that precedent in all the regulatory proceedings going through the TCJA in terms of through the majority of our jurisdictions we the customers saw timely refund or saving. We expect similar treatment if the tax rate goes up. On the credit metric side, certainly in increasing the tax rates would help on the credit metric side. You'd probably expect for us to see 100 to 150 basis point increase in our credit metrics. But that depends on the details. I know there is a talk about an AMT related to book income, which would be detrimental in that sense, but that 100 to 150 basis points benefit to our credit metrics really related to if AMT goes back to the prior regime. So those are the two big components from the tax perspective.\nBen Fowke: Excellent Brian, thank you.\nBob Frenzel: I do want to talk a little bit about - hey, Durgesh it's Bob, just a couple add-ons to Ben's comments. First and foremost, on the federal side, one of the tailwinds, we would expect to see is a real increase in the budgets for R&D for new generation, which we've been very focused on as a company, and at EEI and making sure that the next generation of dispatchable generation that will provide reliability and affordability for our customers, and the R&D has started today. And secondly, I don't want to diminish the impact that partnering with our states has had. Federal tailwinds are good, but our partnerships with our states have enabled us to deliver over the past four years a substantial amount of carbon reduction, electric vehicle penetration goals and other investment opportunities around cyber and wildfires and other areas that have been very helpful. So while the Feds can be helpful, I think the partnerships of the state are really important as well, I think we're very much aligned there.\nBen Fowke: And that's all customer driven, which is why I think this clean energy transition happens under just about any type of administration.\nDurgesh Chopra: Super helpful guys, I appreciate all the comments. Just one quick follow up for Brian, really. Just Brian on PTCs, doesn't the actual increase in tax rate kind of help you with using higher PTCs increases your appetite for using PTCs?\nBrian Van Abel: Yeah, you're absolutely right. It also actually helps from just the L2 from our customers. So you're right about that.\nDurgesh Chopra: Okay, perfect. Thanks, guys. Much appreciate the time. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from James Thalacker of BMO Capital Markets.\nBen Fowke: Good Morning.\nJames Thalacker: Good morning, guys. And thanks for the question, time for the question. Just looking at your updated CapEx forecasts and the rate base forecasts and understanding that the bulk of the incremental spend is probably not going to be sort of fully articulated, I guess, until 2Q of '21. But how are you guys, I guess, thinking about that translation into where you sit within the growth rate. Right now, it looks like you guys are kind of solidly at the midpoint. But should you be successful in Minnesota, would you think that that could put you solidly at the upper end, even with their modest solution you have with financing the incremental CapEx?\nBen Fowke: Yeah, I mean, we strive to be at the upper end of that 5% to 7% goal and the additional 1.4 million, albeit we'll make sure we're sensitive to credit quality, which is really important, would be helpful to that goal. So we're very confident that we're going to be able to achieve our long-term growth rate.\nJames Thalacker: Is outside of an adverse outcome, I guess, on the solar side, is there anything that would prevent you from being at the top end of the growth rate?\nBen Fowke: Well, I mean there's always things, I mean, who thought we would be in COVID two years ago. So there's a lot of things that could happen. And of course, it could be - we've always had regulatory outcomes and things like that to consider, sales and there's always things, but again, I think we're in very good shape.\nJames Thalacker: Okay. And I guess just following up on that point on sales, it looks like the 2021 assumption is for a 1% increase in retail rates. Could you talk I guess, a little bit about the component to the mix of that as you're thinking about it for 2021?\nBrian Van Abel: Yeah. Sure and good morning, Jim. So we kind of break it down between residential and C&I. Residential, we expect it to be fairly flat for this year. We are seeing good strong customer growth of about 1% across the consolidated family. So we expect that customer growth to continue and a little bit of I'll call it a reduction in the use per customer. On the C&I side, I think what you see is we expecting, call it, around the 2% increase in C&I sales. And the best way to think about that is really a - we don't expect in April and May to happen next year, but we do expect to know C&I sales to be impacted. So if you kind of took April and May out kind of the worst parts of COVID this year is kind of gives you a sense of what we're thinking for next year.\nJames Thalacker: Thank you very much for that color.\nBen Fowke: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley.\nStephen Byrd: Hey, good morning.\nBen Fowke: Hey, Stephen.\nStephen Byrd: A lot of it's been covered already. I didn't want to talk more about EVs and then you provided some interesting commentary. I was just curious, let's assume that there is an interest at the federal level and giving specific financial support for EV infrastructure, what form of support would be most helpful? Is it tax credits, direct spending? And how might some level of increased federal support accelerate your plans in terms of spending on EV infrastructure?\nBen Fowke: Well, I think rebates to the consumer to buy down the cost of the EVs. I do think they're going to come down naturally, as more and more models are introduced, but that would - that obviously, would stimulate purchases and just making it an overall part of industry wide carbon goals would be helpful to Stephen. So I think their support can come in a number of forms. The other thing I would say is kind of this - the addressing range anxiety, maybe a public-private partnership to make sure we have fast charging stations around the corridors for people who travel, those are all things that I think you'd be more likely to happen under a Biden administration than a Trump administration. So I mean, I think we can get through our goal either way. But I was asked to comment, whether it would be a tailwind or headwind, and I definitely think that could be a tailwind for us.\nStephen Byrd: That's really helpful. I guess just building on that if you did receive or if we did see that kind of federal support, is that the kind of support where you would then start to really take moves to specifically sort of accelerate your existing plans? Or is that just more helpful to ensure adoption, more helpful to ensure that your existing plans could work well and that there's actually enough EV adoption to make sense for what you're already planning?\nBen Fowke: I mean, I think it gives us more confidence. I mean, the 1.5 million EV goal is definitely a vision and it reflects 20% of cars that are currently on a road. So I think it'd be very helpful to getting there.\nStephen Byrd: Got you, thank you so much, that's all I have.\nBen Fowke: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Fremont of Mizuho.\nBen Fowke: Good morning Paul.\nPaul Fremont: Hi. Thank you very much. Basically, my first question is, you initially also talked in the incremental spend bucket of about 150 million of EV spend. Is that now been moved into your base spending numbers?\nBrian Van Abel: Hey, Paul, yeah, that is correct. That is in the base numbers.\nPaul Fremont: And then my other question is what's driving sort of a higher level of spend at PSCo and the MSP Wisconsin and sort of a 400 million decremental spend at MSP Minnesota in your base interest?\nBrian Van Abel: Well, I think the big part is in Colorado, we're really starting to roll out our advanced grid initiatives. And we also have some transition investments that we need to do in Colorado. In longer term where we had - we talked about it before that we have significant transition investments in all our articles longer term really to enable the generation transition. In Wisconsin we do have some - the solar farm that we just announced, a $100 million solar farm with Wisconsin which is for Wisconsin size that is material, and we do have some transmission projects in Wisconsin. So those are really the big drivers for those articles.\nBen Fowke: In Minnesota, keep in mind, there's a lot of wind that's going into service which would lead to - and a lot of that wind is in Minnesota.\nPaul Fremont: Right, so Minnesota is actually lower?\nBrian Van Abel: Yeah, you're rolling for the big win spend in Minnesota this year, so when you roll forward from 20 to 24 or 21 to 25 is what you're seeing.\nPaul Fremont: Got it, so some of that wind is actually adjust when that would have taken place in another year?\nBen Fowke: The projects have been included in '20.\nBrian Van Abel: Yeah, go on in service. So then if you think of the incremental plan, right, we would like to tell Minnesota R&R, that's all Minnesota spend and significant customer value in the developed proved that will increase the overall CapEx for Minnesota.\nPaul Fremont: Thank you, that's it.\nBen Fowke: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Insoo Kim of Goldman Sachs.\nBen Fowke: Good morning.\nInsoo Kim: Good morning. I think one question from me, in Minnesota what type of momentum, if any, is there for securitization legislation to retire coal plants? And I think - correct me if I'm wrong, there is a precedent the state for getting some accelerated depreciation for the remaining value of coal plants. How do you frame all of that and the potential to further accelerate the retirement of coal plants like Sherco 3 or the game plan?\nBob Frenzel: Hey, Insoo, it's Bob, good to hear you this morning. We've got - we are accelerating with appreciation on the two plants that we have approval to retire early, that's Sherco units 1 and 2 and they're being accelerated and depreciated fully by their projected retirement date in '23 and 2026 respectively. As part of our Minnesota resource plan, we have offered to retire Sherco 3 and the King plants early also with accelerated depreciation. And we think those proposals, we likely heard sometime in 2021, next year, as we go through the resource planning process. We've been very successful and working with our stakeholders in mitigating the transition of these legacy plants of ours. We've taken care of the workforces, and the property taxes in the jurisdictions. And so we think this is just part of the overall package and we've been successful that in the past, and we'd expect to continue in that fashion.\nBen Fowke: The only place we have securitization is in Colorado. As of now we don't have it.\nInsoo Kim: Right, no, I was just talking about asking about momentum for any potential securitization in the state, but understood. And just on that, I understand the Sherco 3 and King, what the proposals were the 2028 and 2030 for the two branches effectively. Is that the earliest dates that we should be considering for these plants given accelerated depreciation timeline?\nBen Fowke: Yeah, look, I think that we've taken a proactive approach to propose those in our resource plan. It gives us a runway to manage through the employee and community issues. And so that's our proposal right now.\nInsoo Kim: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question today is from Sophie Karp of KeyBanc.\nBen Fowke: Good morning.\nSophie Karp: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Missing from your proposed incremental project is energy storage. And I was wondering if you could discuss maybe more broadly, what place energy storage would have in your portfolio going forward? And maybe tying that into potential election outcome, what kind of a policy from the federal level would be helpful to accelerate adoption there? Thank you.\nBen Fowke: Yeah, that's a great question. Thanks for that. I mean, I think you're going to see us - and the emphasis on storage will take place in our resource planning proposals, both in Minnesota and Colorado, and we do see a role for storage. It's not I think kind of fear, I mean, it's all our batteries can only do so much. So when you think of technologies that are needed to get that last 20% out, we're going to need perhaps some form of long-term storage to address those seasonal variations. But yeah, just thinking about the Minnesota plan we talked about peaking resources that will be needed. Well, that can - batteries is definitely part of his peaking resources. The same will hold true in Colorado. I would just say too, when we look at what we did with the R&R plan in Minnesota, we're actually saving customers money by repowering wind projects. And so to us, given the economic conditions we're in and that made all the sense in the world.\nSophie Karp: Got it, so are you considering than any other types of storage you can rely on maybe pumped storage, any other kind of older technology, so hydrogen, even that can be effectively deployed to select addresses relations that you have in a cost-effective manner? Or is it just too early to say right now?\nBen Fowke: No. Yes to all of those. I mean, I think hydrogen is perhaps that long-term storage, it can be used in different ways, but storage is definitely one of the things. Pumped storage is on the table. We're looking at what we can do with our Cabin Creek plant. There is pumped storage in Colorado. So yeah, I mean, all those things are on the table. And you'll see some of that get, I think, flushed out a little bit as we go through the resource planning process.\nSophie Karp: All right, thank you.\nBen Fowke: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ryan Levine of Citi.\nRyan Levine: Good morning. So regarding - so it looks like you announced a couple updates around the PPA buyout program, can you comment around how that pace of development or opportunity could change into the election? If higher federal tax rate could influence any PPA buyout decisions?\nBrian Van Abel: Sure. Good morning, Ryan. Yeah, we announced to get more million from buyouts approved in Minnesota which is very good to see and deliver significant customer benefits than that solar buyout in Colorado was filed and again, significant customer benefits, even though it's a pretty small dollar amount, from a capital perspective. Yeah, it's something that we spend a lot of time in the corporate development team in terms of discussions and just conversations with the IPPs that we do business with. A couple things right that we watch, if you want to kind of talk about the election opportunities, right, if you could see an extension of PTCs, maybe that provides more repowering opportunities. If PTCs are extended, certainly a change in the corporate tax rate could impact how these IPPs view their wind farms. So this is something that we'll continue to look at and in conversations with. I speak about this as just something that we continue to have conversations is really a long-term opportunity, because it is about finding kind of the sweet spot in terms of ensuring that we deliver significant customer value and finding the price point that works for us actually quite well.\nRyan Levine: Have there been any recent acceleration of commercial development activity in those efforts in the last few months or is it been relatively routable around the conversations you're having with counterparties.\nBrian Van Abel: That would say it's relatively routable, certainly some conversations picked up during kind of the impaction of COVID as some of the developers had challenges. There was a PPA that was bid into our Minnesota relief and recovery win RFP, those PPA buyout - was bid in. We were close to getting there, but we couldn't get to the customer savings number that we wanted to deliver and that RFP and so we'll continue to negotiate with that counterparty to see if we can actually reach an agreement that provides our customers significant savings. So like I said, it's important for us to deliver the savings for our customers.\nRyan Levine: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Travis Miller of Morningstar.\nBen Fowke: Good morning, Travis.\nTravis Miller: Good morning. Thank you. I want to talk about the election and issues there, so wondering as a follow up for that conversation. What at the state level or the regulatory level are you looking at on election day, any key state level races are a regulatory election that you're looking at or policies at the local level stuff like that?\nBen Fowke: Well, I mean, I think what we'll be looking at in Minnesota is whether or not the Senate, which is currently Republican, if it were to go Democrat, and you have an all democratic DFL branches and we would be looking probably at increased corporate taxes and maybe some legislation, energy wise, but again, I think we've done a really good job of developing relationships across the aisle and actually executing on just these pretty bold and aggressive carbon reduction plans. And I do think the administration has appreciated what we've been able to do for our communities and things like the R&R plan that we talked about. So I'm not particularly focused on any kind of transformative type legislation that might come out of an election. I say that and Bob or Amanda, so you want to comment.\nBob Frenzel: Yeah. Travis, this is Bob. I think the only other thing to watch is obviously the ballot initiative in New Mexico on elected versus appointed commissioners. And I think we've got a good history of working there well and any new commission, we would we would proactively engage with.\nAmanda Rome: This is Amanda. The only other one we're obviously watching closely is the boulder vote on municipalization.\nTravis Miller: Okay, great. No, that's very helpful. Thank you. And then another follow-up to the whole easy discussion, is that a lot of talking and speculation about who might own and how they might own charging stations? What are your thoughts around that? And in terms of your role are you inclined to own them as rate base, like assets and expand that late which of being inclined on them as pseudo merchant pipe, so to speak assets? Or you have the right to charging the third party? Just wondering your thoughts around who owns and how the economics for the chargers?\nBen Fowke: Yeah. Are you talking about fast charging Travis?\nTravis Miller: Either way or whatever - not in home and probably the residential customer.\nBen Fowke: Yeah, on the residential side, or multi dwelling, things like that, I think we're very well positioned to own those charging stations. In fact I'm really excited about our EV plans that would allow you - if you had a home and you wanted to get an EV, we try to make it easy for you because it's not as easy as you think sometimes. And so with a call to us, we can get the home charger installed at no cost for you build it into our subscription rate, it just encourages you to charge off peak and saves you a significant amount of money. So you don't have to compare KWH and equivalence, it's like - I think it's $44 a month. And it's all you can use off peak. And we've done the math; we think it works out really well for the EV owner, but just as importantly, the other customers, because it minimizes the impact to the grid. Now, when you get to like fast charging stations, I think they're really necessary to address range anxiety, but make no bones about it. They're kind of lost. So I think that that's where a public private partnership could come into play. We're happy to play a role there. But we don't have to; I just like to see it done. So I guess that would be kind of like I answered your question. I think that's where we see it.\nTravis Miller: Sure. Okay, great and I appreciate it.\nBen Fowke: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates.\nBen Fowke: Good morning, Paul.\nPaul Patterson: Good morning. How you doing? So just quick on the EV thing, just to sort of clarify this, the public private partnership, just to help me out here, what's the public entities or entity that you're thinking about? And who would be the private entities? Just really briefly sort of a - I'm missing exactly what that would be?\nBen Fowke: Well, I mean, I think it can take a lot of different forms. I mean, the government, either federal or state could provide funding to buy down the cost of those charging stations. It doesn't necessarily have to have an Xcel energy label on it, we could just provide the necessary supporting infrastructure, or we could be part of it. I mean, I would just tell you, Paul, we're wide open to that. The key to me is to get these stations built. So that people - one of the biggest barriers and purchasing an EV is space range anxiety. And so you need, I think, the right amount of fast charging stations, which again, are lost leaders to be built, so that you have more easy penetration. So it's kind of a chicken or the egg type thing and it can take a lot of different forms.\nPaul Patterson: Okay. And I was just wondering, what about you guys basically just having a put into rate base so to speak and socializing cost over customers. I mean, I'm just wondering, is that an option? Or do you feel that is a simple strategy -\nBen Fowke: As long as it's - yes, the short answer is yes. But I mean you want to make sure the process is followed. I mean one of the things that we'd want to show is okay, if this leads to more easy penetration, how does that benefit all of our customers? How much it's exactly, how much we're going to socialize? And you've heard me talk about incentives and subsidies and things like that. And I've always been okay with them, as long as they're transparent. So I would not want something that is kind of hidden, where people were not really sure what is being socialized and what isn't being socialized. And I don't think that would happen with these charging stations. But that's what we'd be advocating for, just a real transparent process. Because not everybody - when you say the word socialization, I mean, it gets people upset sometimes. But a selective amount of seeding I think is really important and perhaps we could play a role in that.\nBob Frenzel: Hi, Paul, it's Bob. We discuss two areas where I think we're excellent and also making sure that in a world where we are involved, we can make sure that public charging, whether it's on interstates or neighborhood, there are areas of town and areas that communities that don't get left behind, we want to make sure that there's an equitable investment, and making sure that all of our customers can benefit from the opportunity that electric vehicles provide. And the second area where I think that we are very valuable in ownership and control of the charging stations is really around the impacts in the grid and making sure that we have appropriate incentives for more off peak than on peak charging. Recognizing some on peak will have to happen, certainly in those public spaces, but bouncing the grid loads and making sure that we're optimizing the distribution investments around electric vehicles is really important. And I think our role there is critical. So that leads you to believe that we would be a very good partner or owner of those types of stations as well.\nPaul Patterson: Awesome, okay and then just on the tax issue and I just have a crystal ball question and I realize it's kind of fraught, but I guess I'm sort of trying to wonder is, I mean, on the Biden plan, if one were to assume that he got elected, would there be - what kind of sense do you get Biden, in the Congress for higher corporate taxes in general? And do you think it would make a significant difference if it was a Democratic Senate or a Republican Senate or just any flavor there? I mean, when we're thinking about this how - and how do you guys look at this when you're trying to plan in everything and I don't know what I mean, is it sort of like, do you feel that there is a strong sense that people really want to raise taxes in Congress, on corporations, and that that's probably pretty likely?\nBen Fowke: Well, I think, I think to implement the Biden tax plan you're going to need to do sweep Paul. I don't think - I think it's - you might have some sort of form of compromise wrapped around other things if it's sports Congress and Senate. But I don't think there's going to be a tremendous amount of interest if the Republicans hold the Senate and implementing the full Biden tax plan.\nPaul Patterson: But if we have a Democratic Senate, maybe, yes. I know, it's really -\nBen Fowke: I think you need a Democratic Senate and then I think if you look at how the Senate would be taken over by Democrats, many of those candidates are running on moderate platform. So I think you'd have to be - it would also depend on how big the sweep is.\nPaul Patterson: Okay, fair enough. Thank you.\nBen Fowke: Stay tuned, we should know sometimes. Not so sure. It'll be November 3, by the way, but we will know at some point.\nPaul Patterson: Yeah. I can't wait. Okay. Thanks so much.\nBen Fowke: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: As there are no other questions, I would like to hand the call back to Mr. Brian Van Abel, CFO for any additional or closing remarks.\nBrian Van Abel: Yeah, thank you all for participating in our earnings calls this morning. If you have any follow up questions, please contact Paul Johnson in our Investor Relations team. Thank you everyone.\nBen Fowke: Thank you. Have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Bob Frenzel",
            "content": "Hey, Jeremy, it's Bob, and thanks for the question, loved the headline on the report this morning and the reference. On the Minnesota R&R plan and the broader stay out proposal. We are working productively with all stakeholders. I think we've got support from the OAG and the environmental advocates for a stay out and so the R&R proposal, we're I would say proactively working with the department and trying to gain their support. We expect to follow our mean rate case next week as the alternative to the sale proposal. And similar last year, we would expect the commission to take that up in about six to eight weeks. So call it early to mid-December timeframe. We'd expect them to make a decision. And look we think the R&R plan and the stay out proposal are very much in line with the Administration's and the Commission's goals and we'd expect a productive outcome in December. Well, I mean, we don't - it's a great question, by the way. And I won't comment on anything specific. But I mean you've heard me speak over the years that our focus is primarily on organic growth. It's nothing like one times book. And I think our investors love that. But we obviously see what's happening in the industry and the long-term trend to consolidation. It's not like we don't look at things, but I will just tell you, we can be disciplined because we do have good organic growth, and we're not looking to fill some sort of earnings void or something like that. So we're very disciplined about it and I think that's one of the reasons why we trade at a bit of a premium to our peers. Yeah, sure, so this is Bob again. For the mid December filing, we would expect a decision on rate case or stay out provision. We also would expect the wind component of our R&R plan to be heard in the December timeframe as well. I think the solar piece of our plan is more likely going to be a Q2 of 2021 timeframe. I think that makes up the bulk of the investment opportunity, there's some other areas around electric vehicles and distribution and transmission spend, which we could take up in normal course in separate dockets, but those are the two big buckets. Correct. Second quarter, sorry, end of second quarter is probably more realistic. I do want to talk a little bit about - hey, Durgesh it's Bob, just a couple add-ons to Ben's comments. First and foremost, on the federal side, one of the tailwinds, we would expect to see is a real increase in the budgets for R&D for new generation, which we've been very focused on as a company, and at EEI and making sure that the next generation of dispatchable generation that will provide reliability and affordability for our customers, and the R&D has started today. And secondly, I don't want to diminish the impact that partnering with our states has had. Federal tailwinds are good, but our partnerships with our states have enabled us to deliver over the past four years a substantial amount of carbon reduction, electric vehicle penetration goals and other investment opportunities around cyber and wildfires and other areas that have been very helpful. So while the Feds can be helpful, I think the partnerships of the state are really important as well, I think we're very much aligned there. Hey, Insoo, it's Bob, good to hear you this morning. We've got - we are accelerating with appreciation on the two plants that we have approval to retire early, that's Sherco units 1 and 2 and they're being accelerated and depreciated fully by their projected retirement date in '23 and 2026 respectively. As part of our Minnesota resource plan, we have offered to retire Sherco 3 and the King plants early also with accelerated depreciation. And we think those proposals, we likely heard sometime in 2021, next year, as we go through the resource planning process. We've been very successful and working with our stakeholders in mitigating the transition of these legacy plants of ours. We've taken care of the workforces, and the property taxes in the jurisdictions. And so we think this is just part of the overall package and we've been successful that in the past, and we'd expect to continue in that fashion. Yeah. Travis, this is Bob. I think the only other thing to watch is obviously the ballot initiative in New Mexico on elected versus appointed commissioners. And I think we've got a good history of working there well and any new commission, we would we would proactively engage with. Hi, Paul, it's Bob. We discuss two areas where I think we're excellent and also making sure that in a world where we are involved, we can make sure that public charging, whether it's on interstates or neighborhood, there are areas of town and areas that communities that don't get left behind, we want to make sure that there's an equitable investment, and making sure that all of our customers can benefit from the opportunity that electric vehicles provide.

            "name": "Ben Fowke",
            "content": "Well, thank you, Paul and good morning everyone. We had another strong quarter booking earnings of $1.14 per share for the third quarter of 2020, compared with $1.01 per share last year. Our year-to-date earnings are on track with our financial plan, and we are mitigating the impact of COVID-19. As a result, we are narrowing our 2020 guidance range to $2.75 to $2.81 per share. Now, consistent with our third quarter tradition, we have provided our updated base investment plan, which reflects 22.6 billion of capital expenditures over the next five years. This represents rate base growth of 6.3% off of 2020 base year. This represents our base capital. In addition, we've identified potential incremental CapEx of 1.4 billion associated with the Minnesota relief and recovery proposal, which, if approved, would drive rate base growth of 6.9%. We're also initiating 2021 guidance of $2.90 to $3 per share, which is consistent with our 5% to 7% long-term EPS growth objectives. We're very excited about our plan, which provides significant customer value, keeps bills well and delivers attractive returns for our investors. We also continue to help our customers and protect our employees during this pandemic. We stepped up charitable giving to help our communities including donating a gain from the sale of our Mankato facility. For more details, see our slides. Our business continuity plans have been executed extremely well, including the completing of a re-fueling outage at our Prairie Island Nuclear facility for keeping employees safe while providing reliable customer service. And we're helping to restart the economy through our capital investment programs which create jobs in our communities. Earlier this year, the Minnesota Commission opened a relief and recovery docket and inviting utilities to submit potential projects that will create jobs and jumpstart the economy. In September, we filed a repowering proposal that includes four Xcel energy wind farms of approximately 650 megawatts, with 750 million of capital investment. In addition, the proposal includes 67 megawatts of repowered PPA extensions. The portfolio is projected to provide customer savings of over $160 million over the life of the assets. We've requested a commission decision on the wind proposal by year-end. We're also proposing 460 megawatts of solar facilities near our retiring Sherco coal plant to take advantage of the existing transmission. Project represents an estimated investment of 650 million. We plan to file our solar proposal in early 2021 and anticipate a decision in mid '21. We're confident the commission will see the customer benefits of these projects. We continue to make progress on our PPA buyout strategy. In August, the Minnesota Commission approved our request to acquire the 99-megawatt Mower wind farm after it is repowered. Mower is currently a PPA. In addition, we filed to buy out the KEPCO solar facility in Colorado. While the $41 million investment is relatively small, the PPA is out of the money, and the buyout will save our customers $38 million over the 11 years. I think this is another example of our keeping bills well priority. We continue to make strong progress on our wind development initiatives. In August our 500 megawatts Cheyenne Ridge wind farm went into operation. Cheyenne Ridge was completed ahead of schedule and under budget. Since it began operations, we set a record with 70% of hourly load coming from wind generation in Colorado. We also reached an agreement to acquire a 74-megawatt solar facility in Wisconsin for approximately $100 million. We expect a commission decision later in 2021 and this will be our first universal scale solar rate base investment. I'm also excited to announce that Xcel Energy was recently awarded a $10 million DOE grant for an innovation pilot to produce carbon free hydrogen at one of our nuclear power plants. We're partnering with the Idaho National Lab and others to use excess electricity and steam to separate the hydrogen and oxygen molecules and water using a high temperature electrolysis process, which is 30% more efficient, and a sustainable way to produce hydrogen. And while it's not currently economical, we think hydrogen has long-term potential to be a carbon free form of dispatchable generation, which will allow the country to achieve its carbon goals, while maintaining reliability. I want to wrap up with a couple of comments on electric vehicles. We recently announced our vision to enable 1.5 million EVs in our service territory by 2030. We spent the last few years working with our commission on programs that will enable EVs in our service territory and help turn this vision into reality. Electrification of the transport system will reduce carbon and save our customers money. I'm also proud of the recent award we received from Fortnightly, which declared our EV program the smartest transportation electrification project as part of its smartest utility projects in 2020. We've developed an EV subscription that makes it easier for customers that have charging stations installed at their homes and to be charged a monthly rate for off peak usage, which can save customers money and make more efficient use of the electric grid. So before I do turn it over to Brian for more detail on financial results and outlook, I just want to say that as you probably know, the southeast is wrestling with Hurricane Beta, and its widespread outages. And the Southwest is working around the clock restoring our customers on the damages due to Winter Storm Billy. Our customers over the past three days have restored two thirds of 145 customers in SPS that have been out as a result of this ice storm. I know there are hundreds of thousands out there and other parts of the Southwest that are out. I'm just so proud of our team for focusing on our customers in these adverse conditions. And I'm proud of the industry. We have a history of mutual aid. It's never more evident in storm recovery and these last two events and quite frankly, the entire year. So with that, I will turn it over to Brian. Thank you. Hey, Julien. Good morning. So the way we think about it and maybe frame it up into - if you remember going into this year, our O&M guidance was 2% up. We're investing significantly in our wind farms, along with all these strategic priorities, such as our grid investments in customer. And then we didn't see our guidance for 2021, but we expected a similar increase prior to COVID in that range. But now if you look at where we'll land this year, down 1% to 2, and slightly up next year, will roughly be flat to 2019. So that kind of gives - and that's on a consolidated level. Obviously, it's varies a little bit by article. But overall, that kind of gives you a sense of how we're kind of driving cost transformation through our business, as we absorb our strategic priorities and remain flat. Yes. So yeah, that's correct, in terms of where it is recovered. RPS reform Julien, this is done. Brian talked about. Yeah, I mean, I think - I mean, we'll have to see obviously, how it plays out at the state level and obviously, the federal level as well. But Julien, I think we're very well positioned for whatever happens. I mean, remember, one of the things I'm so proud of is we're leading the way, we've got an 80% interim target, a 100% target by 2050, but we do that with liability and economics in mind. So that tends to bring both sides of the aisle along. At the federal level, if it does become a Biden administration, and maybe the senate flips as well, I think we're probably well positioned to do more with renewable. I think they would probably accelerate EVs and help with our 1.5 million target. I would also welcome the chance as both CEO of Xcel and Chairman of EI to work with the Biden ministration and kind of let them know that 2035 and utility timeframe for the technologies that will be needed is very aggressive. So there's a reason why we chose 2050. Now at the state level, we'll just play it out. But I mean, I think we've demonstrated we can work very well crafting legislation that works for customers and shareholders alike. Thank you, Julien. Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet of JP Morgan. Good morning Jeremy. Good morning. So I'm going to let Brian talk about the tax implications. As far as headwind tailwind, I think it's I think it's probably helpful to accelerate our renewable program. I absolutely think it'd be helpful to our 1.5 million electric vehicle goal. And that's something that would create additional opportunities for investment. I'm particularly excited about EVs, if you've heard me speak before, because I don't know if it's steel for fuel, but it's a type of steel for fuel. The variable cost of an EV is significantly below that of a gasoline. The charge off similar rates its equivalent of $0.60 a gallon, so while EVs are expensive today, we think that cost comes down. Biden administration might help that costs come down even more and then we're getting more EVs out there reducing the carbon footprint obviously, and creating investment opportunities for us in additional sales load, which all customers benefit from. I'll turn it over to Brian, for your tax question. Excellent Brian, thank you. And that's all customer driven, which is why I think this clean energy transition happens under just about any type of administration. Good Morning. Yeah, I mean, we strive to be at the upper end of that 5% to 7% goal and the additional 1.4 million, albeit we'll make sure we're sensitive to credit quality, which is really important, would be helpful to that goal. So we're very confident that we're going to be able to achieve our long-term growth rate. Well, I mean there's always things, I mean, who thought we would be in COVID two years ago. So there's a lot of things that could happen. And of course, it could be - we've always had regulatory outcomes and things like that to consider, sales and there's always things, but again, I think we're in very good shape. Thanks. Hey, Stephen. Well, I think rebates to the consumer to buy down the cost of the EVs. I do think they're going to come down naturally, as more and more models are introduced, but that would - that obviously, would stimulate purchases and just making it an overall part of industry wide carbon goals would be helpful to Stephen. So I think their support can come in a number of forms. The other thing I would say is kind of this - the addressing range anxiety, maybe a public-private partnership to make sure we have fast charging stations around the corridors for people who travel, those are all things that I think you'd be more likely to happen under a Biden administration than a Trump administration. So I mean, I think we can get through our goal either way. But I was asked to comment, whether it would be a tailwind or headwind, and I definitely think that could be a tailwind for us. I mean, I think it gives us more confidence. I mean, the 1.5 million EV goal is definitely a vision and it reflects 20% of cars that are currently on a road. So I think it'd be very helpful to getting there. Thank you. Good morning Paul. In Minnesota, keep in mind, there's a lot of wind that's going into service which would lead to - and a lot of that wind is in Minnesota. The projects have been included in '20. Thank you. Good morning. The only place we have securitization is in Colorado. As of now we don't have it. Yeah, look, I think that we've taken a proactive approach to propose those in our resource plan. It gives us a runway to manage through the employee and community issues. And so that's our proposal right now. Good morning. Yeah, that's a great question. Thanks for that. I mean, I think you're going to see us - and the emphasis on storage will take place in our resource planning proposals, both in Minnesota and Colorado, and we do see a role for storage. It's not I think kind of fear, I mean, it's all our batteries can only do so much. So when you think of technologies that are needed to get that last 20% out, we're going to need perhaps some form of long-term storage to address those seasonal variations. But yeah, just thinking about the Minnesota plan we talked about peaking resources that will be needed. Well, that can - batteries is definitely part of his peaking resources. The same will hold true in Colorado. I would just say too, when we look at what we did with the R&R plan in Minnesota, we're actually saving customers money by repowering wind projects. And so to us, given the economic conditions we're in and that made all the sense in the world. No. Yes to all of those. I mean, I think hydrogen is perhaps that long-term storage, it can be used in different ways, but storage is definitely one of the things. Pumped storage is on the table. We're looking at what we can do with our Cabin Creek plant. There is pumped storage in Colorado. So yeah, I mean, all those things are on the table. And you'll see some of that get, I think, flushed out a little bit as we go through the resource planning process. Thank you. Good morning, Travis. Well, I mean, I think what we'll be looking at in Minnesota is whether or not the Senate, which is currently Republican, if it were to go Democrat, and you have an all democratic DFL branches and we would be looking probably at increased corporate taxes and maybe some legislation, energy wise, but again, I think we've done a really good job of developing relationships across the aisle and actually executing on just these pretty bold and aggressive carbon reduction plans. And I do think the administration has appreciated what we've been able to do for our communities and things like the R&R plan that we talked about. So I'm not particularly focused on any kind of transformative type legislation that might come out of an election. I say that and Bob or Amanda, so you want to comment. Yeah. Are you talking about fast charging Travis? Yeah, on the residential side, or multi dwelling, things like that, I think we're very well positioned to own those charging stations. In fact I'm really excited about our EV plans that would allow you - if you had a home and you wanted to get an EV, we try to make it easy for you because it's not as easy as you think sometimes. And so with a call to us, we can get the home charger installed at no cost for you build it into our subscription rate, it just encourages you to charge off peak and saves you a significant amount of money. So you don't have to compare KWH and equivalence, it's like - I think it's $44 a month. And it's all you can use off peak. And we've done the math; we think it works out really well for the EV owner, but just as importantly, the other customers, because it minimizes the impact to the grid. Now, when you get to like fast charging stations, I think they're really necessary to address range anxiety, but make no bones about it. They're kind of lost. So I think that that's where a public private partnership could come into play. We're happy to play a role there. But we don't have to; I just like to see it done. So I guess that would be kind of like I answered your question. I think that's where we see it. Thank you. Good morning, Paul. Well, I mean, I think it can take a lot of different forms. I mean, the government, either federal or state could provide funding to buy down the cost of those charging stations. It doesn't necessarily have to have an Xcel energy label on it, we could just provide the necessary supporting infrastructure, or we could be part of it. I mean, I would just tell you, Paul, we're wide open to that. The key to me is to get these stations built. So that people - one of the biggest barriers and purchasing an EV is space range anxiety. And so you need, I think, the right amount of fast charging stations, which again, are lost leaders to be built, so that you have more easy penetration. So it's kind of a chicken or the egg type thing and it can take a lot of different forms. As long as it's - yes, the short answer is yes. But I mean you want to make sure the process is followed. I mean one of the things that we'd want to show is okay, if this leads to more easy penetration, how does that benefit all of our customers? How much it's exactly, how much we're going to socialize? And you've heard me talk about incentives and subsidies and things like that. And I've always been okay with them, as long as they're transparent. So I would not want something that is kind of hidden, where people were not really sure what is being socialized and what isn't being socialized. And I don't think that would happen with these charging stations. But that's what we'd be advocating for, just a real transparent process. Because not everybody - when you say the word socialization, I mean, it gets people upset sometimes. But a selective amount of seeding I think is really important and perhaps we could play a role in that. Well, I think, I think to implement the Biden tax plan you're going to need to do sweep Paul. I don't think - I think it's - you might have some sort of form of compromise wrapped around other things if it's sports Congress and Senate. But I don't think there's going to be a tremendous amount of interest if the Republicans hold the Senate and implementing the full Biden tax plan. I think you need a Democratic Senate and then I think if you look at how the Senate would be taken over by Democrats, many of those candidates are running on moderate platform. So I think you'd have to be - it would also depend on how big the sweep is. Stay tuned, we should know sometimes. Not so sure. It'll be November 3, by the way, but we will know at some point. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Have a good day."

            "name": "Brian Van Abel",
            "content": "Thanks, Ben and good morning everyone. We had another strong quarter booking $1.14 per share for the third quarter of 2020 compared with $1.01 per share last year. More significant earnings drivers for the quarter include the following. Higher electric margins increased earnings by $0.20 per share, primarily driven by riders and rate outcomes. O&M expensive were flat for the quarter, primarily driven by our cost management efforts. And the lower effective tax rate increase earnings by $0.07 per share. As a reminder, production tax credits lower the ETR. However, PTGs are flawed back to customers through lower electric margin and are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation and interest expense, which reduced earnings by $0.12 per share, reflecting our capital investment program. In addition, other items combined to reduce earnings by $0.02 per share. Next, I want to discuss the status of COVID-19 impacts in our mitigation efforts. As expected, COVID-19 had an adverse impact as third quarter weather-adjusted electric sales declined by 2.4%. Although, these impacts are better than projected in our guidance assumptions, we now assume annual electric sales will decline approximately 3% for 2020. As a reminder, we have a sales drop mechanism for all electric classes in Minnesota, and the coupling for the electric residential and non-demand small C&I classes in Colorado, which covers about 45% of our total retail electric sales. Since sales have come in better than projected and weather has been favorable, we've adjusted our O&M contingency plans accordingly. We continue to closely monitor bad debt expense and work with customers on payment plans. At this point, we expect bad debt expense will increase approximately $25 million over normal levels, which remains in line with previous forecasts. We received approval for certain pandemic related expenses in all states, except for North Dakota, where our request remains on the Commission review. We've also made strong progress on reducing O&M expenses to mitigate COVID-19 impacts. Based on our year-to-date results and updated sales projections, we now expect annual O&M expenses will decline 1% to 2% in 2020 compared to our initial guidance of a 2% increase. Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. In Texas, the Commission approved our rate case settlement that reflects an electric rate increase of $88 million, a ROE of 9.45% and equity ratio of 54.6% for AC/DC purposes, an acceleration of the depreciation life of the Tolk coal plant. In October, the Colorado Commission accepted the ALJs recommended decision to approve our natural gas rate case settlement without modification reflecting a net rate increase of $77 million, a ROE of 9.2%, an equity ratio of 55.6% and the historic test year of an adjustment for the Tungsten the BlackRock projects. We view both the Texas and Colorado decisions as constructive regulatory outcomes. My preference is to avoid rate cases when possible. So in July, we filed for rider recovery of our wildfire and advanced grid investments in Colorado instead of filing a comprehensive rate case. The riders will cover 2021 through 2025 and provide regulatory flexibility. We're still in the early phases of these proceedings. In September, we filed the 2021 sale proposal in Minnesota is as an alternative path to the rate case we plan to file in early November. We expect the commission to decide in December whether it will accept the sale or proceed as a multi-year rate case. And as Ben noted we're initiating our 2021 earnings guidance range of $2.90 to $3 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%. Our 2021 EPS guidance is based on several assumptions which are detailed in our earnings release. I want to highlight several of these items here. We've seen constructive regulatory outcomes in all proceedings. We anticipate modest impact from COVID-19. We project electric sales growth of approximately 1%, which reflects a modest recovery over the COVID depressed sales levels in 2020. We expect O&M expenses to increase approximately 1%, which reflects increased costs for new wind projects and lower O&M levels in 2020 due to COVID mitigation. Please note that wind O&Ms recover to regulatory mechanisms in most jurisdictions and is offset by fuel savings. And finally, we anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately negative 9%, largely driven by increased levels of wind PTCs, which are credited to customers and generally have no material impact on earnings. In our earnings release, you'll find more detail about our updated $22.6 billion five-year base capital forecasts. The base forecasts reflect significant grid investment including our advanced grid initiative and additional investment in the transmission system to maintain absolute health and reliability and enable renewable generation. It also includes a modest level of renewable, expenditure to improve the customer experience and the natural gas combined cycle plant at our Sherco facility to ensure reliability as we have proposed to retire all of our Minnesota coal plants by 2030. Our base capital plan results in annual rate base growth of approximately 6.3% using 2020 as a base. We also have potential incremental CapEx of approximately $750 million for wind repowering projects and $650 million for a solar facility, which are pending Commission approval as part of the Minnesota relief and recovery filing. We're confident the Commission will see the customer benefits of these projects. If approved, rate base growth will be 6.9%. In addition, we think there's other potential upside CapEx that could materialize in the future. Our capital investment plan supports are 5% to 7% long-term earnings growth objective and our goal to deliver EPS and dividend growth in the upper half of the range. We've also updated our financing plan, which reflects a combination of internal cash generation and debt issuances to fund the majority of our capital expenditures. In addition, we expected to issue $250 million of equity and $400 million of DRIP and benefits equity consistent with our previous forecasts. Importantly, our financing plan maintains our current credit metrics. We anticipate that the incremental capital, if approved by the Minnesota Commission will be financed with approximately 50% equity and 50% debt. This incremental equity will allow us to fund the creative capital investments, which will benefit our customers on maintaining solid credit ratings and favorable access to the capital markets. And with that, I'll wrap up. We're effectively mitigating COVID-19 impacts. We continue to provide reliable service to our customers, while ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and communities. The Colorado and Texas Commissions approved constructive rate case settlements. Our relief and recovery proposal in Minnesota will create jobs, help jubilate our local economies and result in significant customer benefits. We narrowed our 2020 guidance range to $2.75 to $2.81 per share based on solid year-to-date results and progress on contingency plans. We announced a robust updated capital investment program that provides strong, transparent rate base growth and significant customer value. We initiated 2021 earnings guidance at $2.90 to $3 per share consistent with our long-term objective. And finally, we remain confident we can deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within our 5% to 7% objective range. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator we will now take questions. Yeah, and the details on the Biden tax and are still a little bit light, but I'll hit on a couple of high points, right, if you think whether tax rate increased from 21% to 28%. Just like the TCJA, where we went from 35 %to 21%, our customers saw a savings of 3% to 4%. So if we go the other way, we expect to see a onetime customer impact of 1.5%, 2%. In a while it's never positive to see that impacts our customer bills, we do think it's manageable. And we did set that precedent in all the regulatory proceedings going through the TCJA in terms of through the majority of our jurisdictions we the customers saw timely refund or saving. We expect similar treatment if the tax rate goes up. On the credit metric side, certainly in increasing the tax rates would help on the credit metric side. You'd probably expect for us to see 100 to 150 basis point increase in our credit metrics. But that depends on the details. I know there is a talk about an AMT related to book income, which would be detrimental in that sense, but that 100 to 150 basis points benefit to our credit metrics really related to if AMT goes back to the prior regime. So those are the two big components from the tax perspective. Yeah, you're absolutely right. It also actually helps from just the L2 from our customers. So you're right about that. Yeah. Sure and good morning, Jim. So we kind of break it down between residential and C&I. Residential, we expect it to be fairly flat for this year. We are seeing good strong customer growth of about 1% across the consolidated family. So we expect that customer growth to continue and a little bit of I'll call it a reduction in the use per customer. On the C&I side, I think what you see is we expecting, call it, around the 2% increase in C&I sales. And the best way to think about that is really a - we don't expect in April and May to happen next year, but we do expect to know C&I sales to be impacted. So if you kind of took April and May out kind of the worst parts of COVID this year is kind of gives you a sense of what we're thinking for next year. Hey, Paul, yeah, that is correct. That is in the base numbers. Well, I think the big part is in Colorado, we're really starting to roll out our advanced grid initiatives. And we also have some transition investments that we need to do in Colorado. In longer term where we had - we talked about it before that we have significant transition investments in all our articles longer term really to enable the generation transition. In Wisconsin we do have some - the solar farm that we just announced, a $100 million solar farm with Wisconsin which is for Wisconsin size that is material, and we do have some transmission projects in Wisconsin. So those are really the big drivers for those articles. Yeah, you're rolling for the big win spend in Minnesota this year, so when you roll forward from 20 to 24 or 21 to 25 is what you're seeing. Yeah, go on in service. So then if you think of the incremental plan, right, we would like to tell Minnesota R&R, that's all Minnesota spend and significant customer value in the developed proved that will increase the overall CapEx for Minnesota. Sure. Good morning, Ryan. Yeah, we announced to get more million from buyouts approved in Minnesota which is very good to see and deliver significant customer benefits than that solar buyout in Colorado was filed and again, significant customer benefits, even though it's a pretty small dollar amount, from a capital perspective. Yeah, it's something that we spend a lot of time in the corporate development team in terms of discussions and just conversations with the IPPs that we do business with. A couple things right that we watch, if you want to kind of talk about the election opportunities, right, if you could see an extension of PTCs, maybe that provides more repowering opportunities. If PTCs are extended, certainly a change in the corporate tax rate could impact how these IPPs view their wind farms. So this is something that we'll continue to look at and in conversations with. I speak about this as just something that we continue to have conversations is really a long-term opportunity, because it is about finding kind of the sweet spot in terms of ensuring that we deliver significant customer value and finding the price point that works for us actually quite well. That would say it's relatively routable, certainly some conversations picked up during kind of the impaction of COVID as some of the developers had challenges. There was a PPA that was bid into our Minnesota relief and recovery win RFP, those PPA buyout - was bid in. We were close to getting there, but we couldn't get to the customer savings number that we wanted to deliver and that RFP and so we'll continue to negotiate with that counterparty to see if we can actually reach an agreement that provides our customers significant savings. So like I said, it's important for us to deliver the savings for our customers. Yeah, thank you all for participating in our earnings calls this morning. If you have any follow up questions, please contact Paul Johnson in our Investor Relations team. Thank you everyone."

Reporters can contact media relations with inquiries, and individual investors and others can reach out to Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nPaul Johnson: Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2020 second quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Bob Frenzel, President and Chief Operating Officer; Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Amanda Rome, Executive Vice President and General Counsel. This morning, we'll review our second quarter results, share recent business and regulatory developments and discuss how we're managing through uncertainty around COVID. The slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder, some of the comments we make during today's call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to different from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our SEC filings. Today, we will discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures, including items, ongoing earnings, electric and natural gas margins. Information on comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release. Now, I'll turn the call over to Ben Fowke.\nBen Fowke: Well, thanks, Paul and good morning everyone. We had a strong quarter, booking earnings of $0.54 per share for the second quarter of 2020, compared with $0.46 per share last year. Our year-to-date earnings are on track with our financial plan, and we are mitigating the impact of COVID-19. As a result, we are reaffirming our 2020 guidance. We continue to help our customers and protect our employees during the pandemic. We're stepping up our charitable giving to help our communities. Our business continuity plans have been executed extremely well. We're keeping employees safe, while providing reliable service to our customers. And we're helping to restart the economy through our capital investment programs that create jobs in our communities. Earlier this year, the Minnesota Commission opened a relief and recovery docket and invited utilities in the state to submit potential projects that would create jobs and help jump-start the economy. In June, we filed a plan that proposes $3 billion of capital investment. This includes approximately $1.8 billion of incremental capex for wind repowering, a 460-megawatt solar facility, expanded EV infrastructure and about $1.2 billion of accelerated transmission, distribution and natural gas investments. We recently announced a solicitation for repowering of wind projects that are either owned by Xcel Energy or under PPAs. We estimate 800 megawatts to 1,000 megawatts of potential repowering projects and expect to make a commission recommendation by year-end. We are also proposing options to mitigate customer bills. Overall, feedback has been very positive, and we look forward to working through the process with the commission. Now, as you might have heard, the US Treasury recently announced a one-year extension of the Safe Harbor for renewable projects. Wind projects that began construction in 2016 now have until the end of 2021 to complete construction and received PTCs at the 100% level. While we were confident that our projects would qualify for a 100% PTC level regardless of this change, the extension assures us benefit for our customers should any projects slip into 2021. Importantly, this change also presents the opportunity to move Dakota Range from the originally planned 80% PTC level to a 100% PTC level. While this will not impact earnings, it will significantly reduce costs, which is a great outcome for our customers. Advancing our strategic priority of leading the clean energy transition, we and our co-owners recently announced the early retirement of the second coal unit at Craig. While we only have a small ownership stake in Craig, we are proud to help drive the early retirement of another coal unit. We're also making significant strides to improve ESG transparency and disclosure. We recently issued our TCFD report and risk assessment, which describes the resilience of our climate strategy using different scenarios. The addition of this report enhanced our disclosures and results in a full TCFD compliance for Xcel Energy. Another strategic priority is to keep our customer bills low. As a result, it was very satisfying to see that SPS's electric rates in Texas and New Mexico were the lowest in the country for 2019 as recently reported by S&P Global. Providing strong customer service and reliability and an attractive price is a hallmark of Xcel Energy, and we're very proud of this recognition. We're also excited that after 10 years, we've reached a settlement agreement with Boulder that will result in a new franchise agreement and also a partnership to explore grid site options to meet our carbon goals. The approval process for the settlement will include a vote by City Council in August, a ballot referendum and vote by the people at Boulder in November. If approved, the franchise will go into effect in January of 2021. Finally, I was recently elected Chairman of EEI. It will be an honor to lead the industry in such an important and challenging time, and I intend to focus on three areas. My first priority is the industry's ongoing COVID-19 response related to the workforce, customers and recovery from the pandemic. Second, I intend to focus on clean energy innovation. I'm asking EEI to develop federal and state policy proposals that will bring dispatchable zero carbon technologies into the marketplace to enable the industry to meet our long-term carbon goals. Finally, I've asked EEI to focus on what our industry can do to promote racial justice and increasing our commitment to advance diversity and inclusion. Like our country, our entire industry has been shaken by the death of George Floyd. Mr. Floyd died only a few miles from our corporate headquarters, and Minneapolis was the first city to experience widespread protest and rioting. I think, as a society, we have a lot of work to do. We need to look hard at ourselves, our unconscious biases and our business practices. I asked some hard questions about how we can improve our diversity. I'm confident that Xcel Energy can play a leadership role in driving positive change for our country and our communities. So with that, let me turn the call over to Brian who will provide more detail on our financial results and our outlook. Brian?\nBrian Van Abel: Thanks, Ben, and good morning everyone. We had a strong quarter, booking $0.54 per share for the second quarter of 2020, compared with $0.46 per share last year. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter include the following: lower O&M expenses primarily driven by our cost management efforts increased earnings by $0.05 per share; higher electric margins increased earnings by $0.02 per share, which reflects riders and rate increases that offset the negative $0.07 per share impact from declining sales largely due to COVID-19; higher AFUDC equity increased earnings by $0.03 per share; and finally, our lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.07 per share. However, the majority of the lower ETR is due to an increase in production tax credits, which flow back to customers through electric margin and is largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation and interest expense, reflecting our capital investment program and other items, which combined reduced earnings by $0.09 per share. Next, I want to discuss the status of COVID-19 impacts and mitigation efforts. As expected, COVID-19 had a major impact on second quarter sales. Our second quarter weather-adjusted electric sales declined by 7.1%. However, these impacts are better than projected in our base case scenario, which is embedded in our guidance assumptions. On a weather-adjusted basis, April retail electric sales declined 9.6%. May showed improvement as retail electric sales declined 6.7%, and June showed further improvement as retail electric sales declined 4.7%. This monthly trend reflects the economic shutdown that started in mid-March and the gradual opening up of the economy in May and June. As a reminder, we have a sales true-up mechanism for all electric classes in Minnesota and decoupling for the electric residential and non-demand small C&I classes in Colorado. This covers about 45% of our total retail electric sales. Since second quarter sales came in better than projected in our base case scenario, we have additional cushion should economic or lapse occur the recovery faltered. Conversely, if sales continue to come in better than expected, we will adjust our contingency plans accordingly. We're also closely monitoring bad debt expense and working with customers on payment plans. While it is difficult to project where we'll land, bad debt expense increased approximately $25 million in the 2008-2009 time period as a reference point. Our commission to Minnesota, Wisconsin, Texas, New Mexico and Michigan have issued orders to defer pandemic-related expenses. We also reached a settlement in Colorado with the Staff and OCC that would allow us to COVID-19-related bad debt expense, pending a commission decision. Finally, our filings in North Dakota and South Dakota remain under commission review. We've also made strong progress in our efforts to reduce O&M cost to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19. Based on our contingency plans, we expect annual O&M expenses will decline 4% to 5% in 2020, which should offset COVID-19 impacts in the base case scenario. We're also prepared to implement additional contingency plans, if the impacts exceed our base case scenario. And as we've discussed in the first quarter, there are limitations to what we can offset. We remain focused on providing strong customer service and reliability, and we will not make short-term decisions that have a negative long-term impact on our customers or shareholders. The last COVID-19 topic I want to cover is liquidity. We finished our planned debt issuances for the year, and we were able to access the capital markets on strong terms and issued bonds at record local bonds. We also closed on the sale of the Mankato Energy Center, which provided approximately $650 million of cash proceeds after carving out the gain for charitable contributions. As a result, we now have available liquidity of approximately $4.5 billion. And finally, we issued an equity forward last year, which we expect to settle later this year, bringing our total liquidity through approximately $5.2 billion. Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. In New Mexico, the Commission approved our constructive settlement that reflects a rate increase of $31 million, a ROE of 9.45%, an equity ratio of 54.8%, and accelerated depreciation of the Tolk coal plant to reflect in earlier retirement. In Texas, we reached a constructive unopposed blackbox settlement, which reflects an electric rate increase of $88 million, a ROE of 9.45% and an equity ratio of 54.6% for AFUDC purposes, and acceleration of the depreciation life of the Tolk coal plant. We anticipate a commission decision in the third quarter. And in July, we also reached a constructive settlement in our Colorado natural gas rate case, which reflects net rate increase of $77 million, a ROE of 9.2%, an equity ratio of 55.6% and a historic test year as an adjustment for the Tungsten to Black Hawk project. We anticipate a commission decision later this year. On our last call, we discussed our preference to avoid rate cases impossible, especially in light of COVID-19. So we recently filed for rider recovery of our wildfire and advanced grid investments in Colorado, another filing of comprehensive rate case. The riders will cover 2021 through 2025 and provide regulatory flexibility. And as part of our Minnesota relief and recovery filing, we express our interest in seeking an alternative path to avoid a rate case filing this year. We think this would be a constructive outcome for all parties. We've had initial discussions, and we'll keep you posted. With that, I'll wrap up. We are effectively mitigating COVID-19 impacts. We continue to provide reliable energy service to our customers, while ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and communities. We reached constructive settlements in our Texas and Colorado rate cases. We avoided an electric rate case in Colorado by filing for wildfire and advanced grid riders. We filed our relief and recovery proposal in Minnesota, which will create jobs, help rejuvenate our local economies and result in significant customer benefits. We announced an earlier retirement of another coal plant and achieved TCFD full compliance. We reached a settlement with Boulder that should end municipalization efforts. We are reaffirming our 2020 guidance range of $2.73 to $2.83 per share based on our solid year-to-date results and progress on contingency plans. Finally, we remain committed to delivering long-term earnings and dividend growth within our 5% to 7% objective range. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.\nJeremy Tonet: Just wanted to touch base, I guess, on your retail sales expectations at this point. Didn't know if you had any data from July, if you could provide us any more color. It seems so far in the second quarter, you guys are trended somewhere between the base case and the mild case. I'm just wondering if you could give us any feeling, I guess, from what you can see so far how the third quarter might be shaping up initially between those two scenarios?\nBen Fowke: Yeah, happy to. But as you know, we don't have AMI. So we have some visibility into July information, particularly we have some sample customers. And what we're seeing on the C&I side is we're seeing a slight improvement, as we look at some of the specific data that we have. We've seen some improvement in the oil and gas slowed down in SPS, something we're watching closely. If you look at the results down there, the kind of bottomed out in May, and we've seen improvement relative still below about 5% from where it was pre-COVID levels, but good to see the C&I improvement there. We're also watching our Colorado C&I. If you look at our earnings release and our presentation, you can see that the C&I sales from May to June didn't improve as much as they did from April to May, so that some are focusing on in Q3, but we are seeing positive trends there. In the residential, I think we're still continuing to see that strength that we saw in 2Q. So overall, positive trends going into Q3, but if you look at our base scenario, we did have significant improvement in the depths in Q2 to Q3. So some, we are watching closely.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks. And just with regards to the Minnesota relief and recovery proposal, I'm just wondering if you might be able to share any more as far as any early feedback that you might have received so far or just kind of expectations going forward at this point.\nBob Frenzel: Hey, Jeremy, it's Bob. Thanks for the question. Coincidentally, we actually had a Minnesota planning meeting yesterday with the department and the commission to talk through the Relief and Recovery Act. We think this is a really interesting example of coordination between investor-owned utilities and the political community to try and solve some of the problems that are affecting our communities from the pandemic. I think the commentary yesterday was kicked off by Lieutenant Governor with a positive tone. I feel like we had some positive tone from some of the commissioners with a special interest to an expeditious resolution and timeline. So we'll know more as we work through the rest of the summer in terms of timeline, but I think yesterday's planning meeting felt fairly positive.\nJeremy Tonet: Yeah. It's encouraging. That's great. Thanks. And if I could just sneak in a last one here, it seems like your guide, D&A interest and AFUDC equity, all kind of changed a little bit there. I was wondering if you could help us with some of the drivers.\nBrian Van Abel: Yeah, certainly. When you put them altogether bottom line, it impacts pretty immaterial for the year. Puts and takes, depreciation changes are coming out of our rate cases. We had some depreciation rate changes that were implemented. Obviously, interest expense, we set a record low coupons in Minnesota. We issued a 30-year bond at 2.6%, which is the lowest 30-year first mortgage bond for utilities, so really good results there out of the team. And then, on the other pieces of rider revenue, right, just a little bit of delays in implementation of wind farms, but net-net, pretty immaterial impact when you take them all together.\nJeremy Tonet: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Next, we will go to Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, team. Good morning. Hey, thanks for the time guys. So let me take the other side of what Jeremy was just talking about. Let's talk about cost reductions, and let's talk about that in the context of your progress year-to-date and what this means going forward in the future years, right? I hear you guys talking about staying out in Colorado, for instance, leveraging riders a little bit more, but give us a little bit of context and where you are against the plan given the 4% to 5% articulated and then, what that means for sustainability and prospects to stay out in these states?\nBen Fowke: Let me -- I'm going to let Brian give you the details on that drilling, but let me just say, I really proud of how the entire team -- entire Xcel workforce has really stepped up to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19, while still providing us important, obviously, product that we deliver. And we've done in a number of different ways, but what most impressed me is the innovation and creativity to use of technology and to improve our business. So I'm optimistic that a lot of that -- we've got to work through, but a lot of this will give us a lot of momentum as we go into 2021. With that, I'll ask Brian to give some more details.\nBrian Van Abel: Yeah. Thanks, Brian. And good morning, Julien. Yeah, so from a run rate, right? We've put in the contingency plans in the sense of the end of March, as we saw the fit. And so, we had nine months from a year-to-date perspective. We're about a little over $50 million ahead of 2019, so executing out just slightly ahead of plan when we look at what our plans are for Q2. So that puts us in a good position for the balance of the year. Now, obviously, if sales come in a little bit better, we can adjust those contingency plans for the year. And Ben said it well. The team has done a great job of developing and executing those plans for this year, and we've really turned our attention to what is sustainable in 2021 and beyond. But I think we've got -- when you talk about regulatory flexibility and rate case sales, we're also -- the other side of the equation is everything we've learned over the past few months from the impact of COVID-19 is we're incorporating into our sales forecast for 2021 and incorporating that in our sales forecast for 2021. And so, we're looking at both sides of the equation. And so, a big focus for the team in Q3 from an O&M sustainability perspective, which will deliver further guidance and clarity in Q3 on that.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. But net-net, fairly confident that consistently earn at authorized levels to the extent to which that you're successful staying out in these cases inclusive of, for instance, the Colorado?\nBen Fowke: Yeah. I think that's a fair assumption. You broke up a little bit. I think you said you would expect another authorized levels with the regulatory proceedings, just to make sure I heard you correctly.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Yeah.\nBen Fowke: Where exactly are you, Julien?\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: We will talk about that later.\nBen Fowke: We have enjoyed your notes from the road, Julien.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: There you go. So in Colorado and speaking of Colorado, what are your prospects for stimulus here as you think about the -- potentially mirroring your efforts in Minnesota?\nBob Frenzel: Hey, Julien; it's Bob. So if you're in Colorado, we're having good weather out there. We've had a nice warm summer. I think you saw some of our weather-adjusted sales were pretty strong in Colorado. As far as relief and recovery goes, what we've done in Minnesota we believe has been relatively unique for the country, but we're certainly open to the ideas and trying to partner in other jurisdictions. I'll give a lot of credit to the administration and the commission and the department in Minnesota for their leadership and their partnership with us on the R&R plan and getting the utilities in the state to step up and try and help our communities and our customers. And if we can find that kind of partnership, we are absolutely looking and willing to do that. As -- if the pandemic continues or if we see some resurgence, there may be more opportunities down the road for us on something similar in other jurisdictions. We wouldn't rule it out.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Great. Best of luck. Thanks guys. Nice travel.\nBob Frenzel: Stay safe wherever you are.\nOperator: And next, we'll go to Travis Miller with Morningstar.\nTravis Miller: I wonder if you could talk a little bit more when you said in Minnesota, the alternative path, what that might look like in one of the full three year rate cycle filings?\nBen Fowke: Yeah, Travis. And as we kind of put it in our relief and recovery plan, the alternative path is really looking at a potential stay out for 2021. Going into 2020, we were able to reach a constructive stay out with the parties, which the commission approved and that was really focused in a couple of key components around sales true-up and deferral of the annuity amortization, a couple of key components. And now, we're just starting to -- we put that in the relief and recovery plan. I think there is another path there, and we've just started the initial discussions around that. And certainly, we will look to see if we can find a good constructive settlement that works for our customers and us.\nTravis Miller: Okay. What do you include potentially something like a rate base true-up, something like that as well or are there other mechanisms that we keep you that allowed or slightly below the allowed ROE?\nBrian Van Abel: Well, for Minnesota, the two big components, if you look out similar to -- at least sitting here today, similar to the settlement that we reach for this year as the big component of sales true-up and then, the deferral of some amortizations. We do have riders recover a lot of our investments with our renewable investments -- long-term renewable rider. And we have our transmission cost rider, which covers some investments. So we have rider mechanisms that help recover the investments we're making for our customers.\nTravis Miller: Okay. Got it. And then, just confirming that you guys are still on track for that five-year 7% rate base growth and the $22 billion capex. Any changes for those numbers?\nBen Fowke: I would say -- Travis, this is Ben. Yeah, we are on track, and we're targeting the upper half. We'll update all of that in the third quarter when we update you on our five-year capital forecast, but I think you will be pleased with what we're projecting.\nTravis Miller: Okay. And then just real quick, does that include the $3 billion in Minnesota or would that be incremental?\nBrian Van Abel: That would be -- well, first of all, $1.8 billion is incremental; the other is an acceleration, but yeah, I mean, that's not necessary to -- for us. So that would be incremental.\nTravis Miller: Okay. Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Next, we will go to Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.\nSteve Fleishman: Hi, good morning. So just good to hear your voice Ben and have fun being the Chair of EEI. So on the Minnesota kind of recovery investment, has the commission give some indication on the basis of the decisions they are going to make in terms of like, is it based on the amount of jobs created versus the rate impact or just how are they going to make that decision?\nBen Fowke: Well, I think they will take a number of factors into consideration. But I think as you know our steel for fuel strategy accomplishes capital investment, job growth and helps with rate. So. to the extent we can emphasize that, I think the better will be. There will be a solicitation and we'll bring those projects in. We are anticipating that we will have a very good price point for the solar that we're planning. And Brian and Bob, I don't know if you want to add anything else.\nBob Frenzel: Yes, Steve, I think it's still a little bit early innings. But I think the comfort level with the investment, the economic development, the job creation, that portfolio coupled with the relief opportunities as Brian mentioned on rates and stay out mechanisms, I think is a big package. We haven't got a full time line out of them. We had a big planning meeting yesterday, which was favorable with some positive comments from the commission and even the administration. And so we're comfortable and confident where we sit. We don't have a lot of details other than that to share with you right now.\nSteve Fleishman: All right. Do you have any sense of the rate impact of the $3 billion. Or you're kind of waiting to see your bidding and all that?\nBob Frenzel: I think we still need to run through the solicitation process on the renewable portions, for sure, which will run through August and into September before we make some decisions. But we're pretty confident that we know the impacts of the things we would put forward. And we know a little bit of what other people would do as well. So we're pretty comfortable with the cost side of that.\nBen Fowke: Steve, we wouldn't put forward our wind repowering if it wasn't NPV positive to the consumer. So I think the real -- will that offset the acceleration of some of the distribution and transmission spend that we're talking about, and I think likely it will, but to Bob's point, we will run through those numbers.\nBrian Van Abel: Yes, Steve, just some further color on the repowering. We had the long road repowering approved and we have now or should be upfront the commission hopefully in Q3 and those show the front end customer savings and you got the repowering which is now really good in this environment. And so we're working through similar analysis on our currently owned wind farms that we think would be good candidates for that.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. And since most of these things are related to things that you own or like you're pre-assuming it gets approved pretty highly likely it would be you who actually would make some investment?\nBen Fowke: Yes. That's correct. Third parties.\nBrian Van Abel: I think that's...\nSteve Fleishman: And just last question. Yes, okay. And last question is related to -- so if that is all true, yes...\nBrian Van Abel: One thing to be clear on those -- there are parties that could submit PPAs for either a PPA extension or a BOT. So some combination of our investment plus others.\nSteve Fleishman: Great. And I apologize. Last question on this which is just how should we think about financing plan for as much as the incremental, you know, more time...\nBrian Van Abel: Yes. Steve as we talked about before and really in the filing, we think about $1.8 billion is the incremental part, the other $1.2 billion roughly is accelerated. But as we go through this process, we expect the commission indicated yesterday that they look to find a way to move through this pretty quickly. And at the same time we're developing our five-year capital plans for '21 through '25. And so, we'll put that all together and roll out our five-year financing plan if we have enough clarity to include this in our five-year capital plan by October. But generally, what we spoke about before, timing and size matters for incremental capital, and if it's significant enough and lines up, we will generally fund that with our consolidated capital structure. Now, as we've spoken about before, it's important to maintain that financial strength and the credit quality of the company.\nOperator: Next we'll go to Sophie Karp with KeyBanc.\nSophie Karp: Hi, good morning. Congrats on the quarter and thank you for taking my question.\nBen Fowke: Thank you, Sophie.\nSophie Karp: So just to build on this -- on the rate strategy this year and the questions around that, I'm wondering if we think about more, I guess stay out rates since obviously your right decision given the COVID situation. But if this continues to be the case and the COVID is kind of here to stay and is effective economic consequences will be ongoing for a while, could we see a pivot in the overall strategy where you move away from periodically cases and kind of switch on a more permanent basis to alternative mechanisms and just kind of move away from the strategy of being a -- say a rate case filer to more of a paying outflow for the period for longer? That's my question. Thank you.\nBob Frenzel: Sophie, it's, Bob. Good to hear your voice. You were a little broke up there, but let me try and address the question, which I think is, how do you think strategically about rate cases in the context of the pandemic in longer term is sort of my takeaway. And you know, we have a lot of rider mechanisms in our various states and we're making billions of dollars of investments on behalf of our customers and infrastructure around clean energy transition and grid modernization and we also have to keep the utility financially healthy. So that's the backdrop that we work with. We are obviously working with our regulators right now on mechanisms by which we would need to file rate cases and we're actively engaged in conversations with stakeholders in Minnesota and Colorado. I think you saw us settle our gas case and then file a couple of riders, which we think would allow us to stay out of our electric case in Colorado and that's a bit of the strategy. If we continue to invest in areas that have real time in rider recovery, you've seen us execute on decoupling in sales true-up mechanisms in our businesses and that's helpful as well. And so strategically, I think we're in the right places. We're always going to look for mechanisms by which we can mitigate our cost structure, keep our bills low for our customers, while we keep to invest in the infrastructure that we need to. So we'll continue to be creative, probably with our commitment and the goal would be to not go into rate cases, if we could avoid them, but we have to keep the utility financially healthy and so we balance all of that.\nBen Fowke: Yes. And Sophie, just building on what Bob said, I mean, whether it's traditional rate cases or expansion of riders or some combination, the bottom line is we are going to achieve our clean energy objectives, our levels of reliability and our customer improvements in customer experience all while keeping total bills below the pace of CPI. That's our objective. And that's what we're on track for and that's what I think we still remain on forecast to do. So -- because that's the key thing, is to make these investments, while not -- while keeping our product affordable.\nSophie Karp: Thank you. And then a follow-up if I may, on the O&M. So you entered this year guiding for O&M growth year-over-year and then the COVID situation you had to flip that and basically find cost cuts right to offset the impact and it seems like it's going well. Could you give us some sense of the shape of that throughout the year. Are you kind of even into it now and plan to ramp up in the second half or are you pretty much trying a run rate at this point and we should expect a steady kind of O&M trajectory throughout the year? How should we think about this?\nBrian Van Abel: Hey, Sophie, this is Brian. I think the way you said it, you assume a steady run rate pretty ratably over the quarter. So I think you're thinking about it right, we continue to see that run rate.\nOperator: Next we'll go to Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.\nPaul Patterson: Just a few quick follow-ups. So back in Minnesota -- and I'm sorry if I didn't completely understand it. How much did you guys -- were you guys saying that this capex might be going to third parties or contracts, how much of the total is subject to that?\nBrian Van Abel: The $1.8 billion incremental is -- that's our spend. But what Paul was saying is when we do a solicitation, we'll have our own wind projects that we own that we bid into that and -- but we will also encourage independence to bid in as well and they can bid in either as a build, own, transfer, which would result in our ownership or they could bid in with an expansion of a power purchase agreement and we'll take a look at all of those. But at the end of the day, our incremental CapEx will come from ownership in wind projects, perhaps our own and perhaps BOT's, the solar facility that we're talking about at our coal plant and Becker, Minnesota, advances in EV infrastructure. And I think that covers the incremental and then we look at the acceleration of that $1.2 billion of grid spend.\nBob Frenzel: Paul we're not going to -- we're not going to know what other parties are going to build until we get through the process, which would be more towards the end of August.\nPaul Patterson: Okay. And then when we think incremental, just to be clear. That doesn't mean bringing something in from the future. This is just incremental, in other words it wouldn't happen anyway, it doesn't change the trajectory of your capex outlook from -- in other words, you are not moving something from the future to now. It's as an accelerated would suggest. When you say incremental, it would -- it wouldn't have occurred otherwise. Is that the way to think about it?\nBrian Van Abel: Yes, that's the way to think about it, Paul.\nPaul Patterson: Okay. I think I understand. And then with respect to the...\nBrian Van Abel: Paul, just on the -- I mean, look, I think the way to think about it is, the $1.2 billion that we're not calling incremental, that's an acceleration of something that's already in our forecast. The $1.8 billion would not be in our existing forecast. Now over the course of 15 years, might it have happen. Yes, that's how we're defining that.\nPaul Patterson: That's really helpful. I appreciate it. And then with respect to the CPI goal, is that still 2%?\nBrian Van Abel: Yes, I mean I think it extends a little bit by jurisdiction. Is that...\nBob Frenzel: Yes. That's roughly at Xcel level, a good way to think about it.\nPaul Patterson: Okay. And then, just in general, I mean, this has been touched on by other people, but I'm just wondering if this -- if things continues down the road, is there any potential maybe to upsize this, if we have a weaker economy. If -- do you follow what I'm saying, is there any sort of discussion of a potential like, hey, maybe this is a good jobs idea or economic stimulus idea and we could see something maybe a bigger than this?\nBen Fowke: I think I'll let the team weigh in on this Paul, but I think it's probably would come from other jurisdictions.\nPaul Patterson: Okay. And you already sort of addressed that. Okay. I really appreciate it. Thank you so much.\nBen Fowke: Thank you. Have a good day.\nOperator: We'll go to Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs.\nInsoo Kim: Thank you. I just have one quick question. In your guidance for the year end base case assumption, what type of assumption are you making on deferral treatment of COVID-related costs?\nBrian Van Abel: Around -- yes, bad debt deferrals. Hey Insoo, this is Brian. As we talked about in Q1, we assume that we get constructive treatment around the regulatory deferrals. When we think about our bad debt expense, we have roughly about $25 million increase and we look at what happened in 2008 and 2009 and that's everything we've seen for the three months of impacts that remains pretty consistent as our thinking going into this. And if we think about it right, we have about 95% of our businesses covered with our six deferral orders, two are waiting for the Dakotas. So we feel like we've reached a constructive place with those deferral orders and we'll continue to evaluate the deferrals as you go through the balance of the year.\nInsoo Kim: Got it. So the bulk of -- at least the bulk of what's happened in terms of the approvals were somewhat embedded in making that guidance then.\nBrian Van Abel: Yes. That's correct.\nInsoo Kim: Got it. That's all. Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Brian Van Abel for any additional or closing remarks.\nBrian Van Abel: Yes. Thank you all for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions. Have a good day.\nOperator: And that does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Bob Frenzel",
            "content": "Hey, Jeremy, it's Bob. Thanks for the question. Coincidentally, we actually had a Minnesota planning meeting yesterday with the department and the commission to talk through the Relief and Recovery Act. We think this is a really interesting example of coordination between investor-owned utilities and the political community to try and solve some of the problems that are affecting our communities from the pandemic. I think the commentary yesterday was kicked off by Lieutenant Governor with a positive tone. I feel like we had some positive tone from some of the commissioners with a special interest to an expeditious resolution and timeline. So we'll know more as we work through the rest of the summer in terms of timeline, but I think yesterday's planning meeting felt fairly positive. Hey, Julien; it's Bob. So if you're in Colorado, we're having good weather out there. We've had a nice warm summer. I think you saw some of our weather-adjusted sales were pretty strong in Colorado.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Ben Fowke",
            "content": "Well, thanks, Paul and good morning everyone. We had a strong quarter, booking earnings of $0.54 per share for the second quarter of 2020, compared with $0.46 per share last year. Our year-to-date earnings are on track with our financial plan, and we are mitigating the impact of COVID-19. As a result, we are reaffirming our 2020 guidance. We continue to help our customers and protect our employees during the pandemic. We're stepping up our charitable giving to help our communities. Our business continuity plans have been executed extremely well. We're keeping employees safe, while providing reliable service to our customers. And we're helping to restart the economy through our capital investment programs that create jobs in our communities. Earlier this year, the Minnesota Commission opened a relief and recovery docket and invited utilities in the state to submit potential projects that would create jobs and help jump-start the economy. In June, we filed a plan that proposes $3 billion of capital investment. This includes approximately $1.8 billion of incremental capex for wind repowering, a 460-megawatt solar facility, expanded EV infrastructure and about $1.2 billion of accelerated transmission, distribution and natural gas investments. We recently announced a solicitation for repowering of wind projects that are either owned by Xcel Energy or under PPAs. We estimate 800 megawatts to 1,000 megawatts of potential repowering projects and expect to make a commission recommendation by year-end. We are also proposing options to mitigate customer bills. Overall, feedback has been very positive, and we look forward to working through the process with the commission. Now, as you might have heard, the US Treasury recently announced a one-year extension of the Safe Harbor for renewable projects. Wind projects that began construction in 2016 now have until the end of 2021 to complete construction and received PTCs at the 100% level. While we were confident that our projects would qualify for a 100% PTC level regardless of this change, the extension assures us benefit for our customers should any projects slip into 2021. Importantly, this change also presents the opportunity to move Dakota Range from the originally planned 80% PTC level to a 100% PTC level. While this will not impact earnings, it will significantly reduce costs, which is a great outcome for our customers. Advancing our strategic priority of leading the clean energy transition, we and our co-owners recently announced the early retirement of the second coal unit at Craig. While we only have a small ownership stake in Craig, we are proud to help drive the early retirement of another coal unit. We're also making significant strides to improve ESG transparency and disclosure. We recently issued our TCFD report and risk assessment, which describes the resilience of our climate strategy using different scenarios. The addition of this report enhanced our disclosures and results in a full TCFD compliance for Xcel Energy. Another strategic priority is to keep our customer bills low. As a result, it was very satisfying to see that SPS's electric rates in Texas and New Mexico were the lowest in the country for 2019 as recently reported by S&P Global. Providing strong customer service and reliability and an attractive price is a hallmark of Xcel Energy, and we're very proud of this recognition. We're also excited that after 10 years, we've reached a settlement agreement with Boulder that will result in a new franchise agreement and also a partnership to explore grid site options to meet our carbon goals. The approval process for the settlement will include a vote by City Council in August, a ballot referendum and vote by the people at Boulder in November. If approved, the franchise will go into effect in January of 2021. Finally, I was recently elected Chairman of EEI. It will be an honor to lead the industry in such an important and challenging time, and I intend to focus on three areas. My first priority is the industry's ongoing COVID-19 response related to the workforce, customers and recovery from the pandemic. Second, I intend to focus on clean energy innovation. I'm asking EEI to develop federal and state policy proposals that will bring dispatchable zero carbon technologies into the marketplace to enable the industry to meet our long-term carbon goals. Finally, I've asked EEI to focus on what our industry can do to promote racial justice and increasing our commitment to advance diversity and inclusion. Like our country, our entire industry has been shaken by the death of George Floyd. Mr. Floyd died only a few miles from our corporate headquarters, and Minneapolis was the first city to experience widespread protest and rioting. I think, as a society, we have a lot of work to do. We need to look hard at ourselves, our unconscious biases and our business practices. I asked some hard questions about how we can improve our diversity. I'm confident that Xcel Energy can play a leadership role in driving positive change for our country and our communities. So with that, let me turn the call over to Brian who will provide more detail on our financial results and our outlook. Brian? Yeah, happy to. But as you know, we don't have AMI. So we have some visibility into July information, particularly we have some sample customers. And what we're seeing on the C&I side is we're seeing a slight improvement, as we look at some of the specific data that we have. We've seen some improvement in the oil and gas slowed down in SPS, something we're watching closely. If you look at the results down there, the kind of bottomed out in May, and we've seen improvement relative still below about 5% from where it was pre-COVID levels, but good to see the C&I improvement there. We're also watching our Colorado C&I. If you look at our earnings release and our presentation, you can see that the C&I sales from May to June didn't improve as much as they did from April to May, so that some are focusing on in Q3, but we are seeing positive trends there. In the residential, I think we're still continuing to see that strength that we saw in 2Q. So overall, positive trends going into Q3, but if you look at our base scenario, we did have significant improvement in the depths in Q2 to Q3. So some, we are watching closely. Let me -- I'm going to let Brian give you the details on that drilling, but let me just say, I really proud of how the entire team -- entire Xcel workforce has really stepped up to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19, while still providing us important, obviously, product that we deliver. And we've done in a number of different ways, but what most impressed me is the innovation and creativity to use of technology and to improve our business. So I'm optimistic that a lot of that -- we've got to work through, but a lot of this will give us a lot of momentum as we go into 2021. With that, I'll ask Brian to give some more details. Yeah. I think that's a fair assumption. You broke up a little bit. I think you said you would expect another authorized levels with the regulatory proceedings, just to make sure I heard you correctly. Where exactly are you, Julien? We have enjoyed your notes from the road, Julien. Yeah, Travis. And as we kind of put it in our relief and recovery plan, the alternative path is really looking at a potential stay out for 2021. Going into 2020, we were able to reach a constructive stay out with the parties, which the commission approved and that was really focused in a couple of key components around sales true-up and deferral of the annuity amortization, a couple of key components. And now, we're just starting to -- we put that in the relief and recovery plan. I think there is another path there, and we've just started the initial discussions around that. And certainly, we will look to see if we can find a good constructive settlement that works for our customers and us. I would say -- Travis, this is Ben. Yeah, we are on track, and we're targeting the upper half. We'll update all of that in the third quarter when we update you on our five-year capital forecast, but I think you will be pleased with what we're projecting. Well, I think they will take a number of factors into consideration. But I think as you know our steel for fuel strategy accomplishes capital investment, job growth and helps with rate. So. to the extent we can emphasize that, I think the better will be. There will be a solicitation and we'll bring those projects in. We are anticipating that we will have a very good price point for the solar that we're planning. And Brian and Bob, I don't know if you want to add anything else. Steve, we wouldn't put forward our wind repowering if it wasn't NPV positive to the consumer. So I think the real -- will that offset the acceleration of some of the distribution and transmission spend that we're talking about, and I think likely it will, but to Bob's point, we will run through those numbers. Yes. That's correct. Third parties. Thank you, Sophie. Yes. And Sophie, just building on what Bob said, I mean, whether it's traditional rate cases or expansion of riders or some combination, the bottom line is we are going to achieve our clean energy objectives, our levels of reliability and our customer improvements in customer experience all while keeping total bills below the pace of CPI. That's our objective. And that's what we're on track for and that's what I think we still remain on forecast to do. So -- because that's the key thing, is to make these investments, while not -- while keeping our product affordable. I think I'll let the team weigh in on this Paul, but I think it's probably would come from other jurisdictions. Thank you. Have a good day."

            "name": "Brian Van Abel",
            "content": "Thanks, Ben, and good morning everyone. We had a strong quarter, booking $0.54 per share for the second quarter of 2020, compared with $0.46 per share last year. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter include the following: lower O&M expenses primarily driven by our cost management efforts increased earnings by $0.05 per share; higher electric margins increased earnings by $0.02 per share, which reflects riders and rate increases that offset the negative $0.07 per share impact from declining sales largely due to COVID-19; higher AFUDC equity increased earnings by $0.03 per share; and finally, our lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.07 per share. However, the majority of the lower ETR is due to an increase in production tax credits, which flow back to customers through electric margin and is largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation and interest expense, reflecting our capital investment program and other items, which combined reduced earnings by $0.09 per share. Next, I want to discuss the status of COVID-19 impacts and mitigation efforts. As expected, COVID-19 had a major impact on second quarter sales. Our second quarter weather-adjusted electric sales declined by 7.1%. However, these impacts are better than projected in our base case scenario, which is embedded in our guidance assumptions. On a weather-adjusted basis, April retail electric sales declined 9.6%. May showed improvement as retail electric sales declined 6.7%, and June showed further improvement as retail electric sales declined 4.7%. This monthly trend reflects the economic shutdown that started in mid-March and the gradual opening up of the economy in May and June. As a reminder, we have a sales true-up mechanism for all electric classes in Minnesota and decoupling for the electric residential and non-demand small C&I classes in Colorado. This covers about 45% of our total retail electric sales. Since second quarter sales came in better than projected in our base case scenario, we have additional cushion should economic or lapse occur the recovery faltered. Conversely, if sales continue to come in better than expected, we will adjust our contingency plans accordingly. We're also closely monitoring bad debt expense and working with customers on payment plans. While it is difficult to project where we'll land, bad debt expense increased approximately $25 million in the 2008-2009 time period as a reference point. Our commission to Minnesota, Wisconsin, Texas, New Mexico and Michigan have issued orders to defer pandemic-related expenses. We also reached a settlement in Colorado with the Staff and OCC that would allow us to COVID-19-related bad debt expense, pending a commission decision. Finally, our filings in North Dakota and South Dakota remain under commission review. We've also made strong progress in our efforts to reduce O&M cost to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19. Based on our contingency plans, we expect annual O&M expenses will decline 4% to 5% in 2020, which should offset COVID-19 impacts in the base case scenario. We're also prepared to implement additional contingency plans, if the impacts exceed our base case scenario. And as we've discussed in the first quarter, there are limitations to what we can offset. We remain focused on providing strong customer service and reliability, and we will not make short-term decisions that have a negative long-term impact on our customers or shareholders. The last COVID-19 topic I want to cover is liquidity. We finished our planned debt issuances for the year, and we were able to access the capital markets on strong terms and issued bonds at record local bonds. We also closed on the sale of the Mankato Energy Center, which provided approximately $650 million of cash proceeds after carving out the gain for charitable contributions. As a result, we now have available liquidity of approximately $4.5 billion. And finally, we issued an equity forward last year, which we expect to settle later this year, bringing our total liquidity through approximately $5.2 billion. Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. In New Mexico, the Commission approved our constructive settlement that reflects a rate increase of $31 million, a ROE of 9.45%, an equity ratio of 54.8%, and accelerated depreciation of the Tolk coal plant to reflect in earlier retirement. In Texas, we reached a constructive unopposed blackbox settlement, which reflects an electric rate increase of $88 million, a ROE of 9.45% and an equity ratio of 54.6% for AFUDC purposes, and acceleration of the depreciation life of the Tolk coal plant. We anticipate a commission decision in the third quarter. And in July, we also reached a constructive settlement in our Colorado natural gas rate case, which reflects net rate increase of $77 million, a ROE of 9.2%, an equity ratio of 55.6% and a historic test year as an adjustment for the Tungsten to Black Hawk project. We anticipate a commission decision later this year. On our last call, we discussed our preference to avoid rate cases impossible, especially in light of COVID-19. So we recently filed for rider recovery of our wildfire and advanced grid investments in Colorado, another filing of comprehensive rate case. The riders will cover 2021 through 2025 and provide regulatory flexibility. And as part of our Minnesota relief and recovery filing, we express our interest in seeking an alternative path to avoid a rate case filing this year. We think this would be a constructive outcome for all parties. We've had initial discussions, and we'll keep you posted. With that, I'll wrap up. We are effectively mitigating COVID-19 impacts. We continue to provide reliable energy service to our customers, while ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and communities. We reached constructive settlements in our Texas and Colorado rate cases. We avoided an electric rate case in Colorado by filing for wildfire and advanced grid riders. We filed our relief and recovery proposal in Minnesota, which will create jobs, help rejuvenate our local economies and result in significant customer benefits. We announced an earlier retirement of another coal plant and achieved TCFD full compliance. We reached a settlement with Boulder that should end municipalization efforts. We are reaffirming our 2020 guidance range of $2.73 to $2.83 per share based on our solid year-to-date results and progress on contingency plans. Finally, we remain committed to delivering long-term earnings and dividend growth within our 5% to 7% objective range. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions. Yeah, certainly. When you put them altogether bottom line, it impacts pretty immaterial for the year. Puts and takes, depreciation changes are coming out of our rate cases. We had some depreciation rate changes that were implemented. Obviously, interest expense, we set a record low coupons in Minnesota. We issued a 30-year bond at 2.6%, which is the lowest 30-year first mortgage bond for utilities, so really good results there out of the team. And then, on the other pieces of rider revenue, right, just a little bit of delays in implementation of wind farms, but net-net, pretty immaterial impact when you take them all together. Yeah. Thanks, Brian. And good morning, Julien. Yeah, so from a run rate, right? We've put in the contingency plans in the sense of the end of March, as we saw the fit. And so, we had nine months from a year-to-date perspective. We're about a little over $50 million ahead of 2019, so executing out just slightly ahead of plan when we look at what our plans are for Q2. So that puts us in a good position for the balance of the year. Now, obviously, if sales come in a little bit better, we can adjust those contingency plans for the year. And Ben said it well. The team has done a great job of developing and executing those plans for this year, and we've really turned our attention to what is sustainable in 2021 and beyond. But I think we've got -- when you talk about regulatory flexibility and rate case sales, we're also -- the other side of the equation is everything we've learned over the past few months from the impact of COVID-19 is we're incorporating into our sales forecast for 2021 and incorporating that in our sales forecast for 2021. And so, we're looking at both sides of the equation. And so, a big focus for the team in Q3 from an O&M sustainability perspective, which will deliver further guidance and clarity in Q3 on that. Well, for Minnesota, the two big components, if you look out similar to -- at least sitting here today, similar to the settlement that we reach for this year as the big component of sales true-up and then, the deferral of some amortizations. We do have riders recover a lot of our investments with our renewable investments -- long-term renewable rider. And we have our transmission cost rider, which covers some investments. So we have rider mechanisms that help recover the investments we're making for our customers. That would be -- well, first of all, $1.8 billion is incremental; the other is an acceleration, but yeah, I mean, that's not necessary to -- for us. So that would be incremental. Yes, Steve, just some further color on the repowering. We had the long road repowering approved and we have now or should be upfront the commission hopefully in Q3 and those show the front end customer savings and you got the repowering which is now really good in this environment. And so we're working through similar analysis on our currently owned wind farms that we think would be good candidates for that. I think that's... One thing to be clear on those -- there are parties that could submit PPAs for either a PPA extension or a BOT. So some combination of our investment plus others. Yes. Steve as we talked about before and really in the filing, we think about $1.8 billion is the incremental part, the other $1.2 billion roughly is accelerated. But as we go through this process, we expect the commission indicated yesterday that they look to find a way to move through this pretty quickly. And at the same time we're developing our five-year capital plans for '21 through '25. And so, we'll put that all together and roll out our five-year financing plan if we have enough clarity to include this in our five-year capital plan by October. But generally, what we spoke about before, timing and size matters for incremental capital, and if it's significant enough and lines up, we will generally fund that with our consolidated capital structure. Now, as we've spoken about before, it's important to maintain that financial strength and the credit quality of the company. Hey, Sophie, this is Brian. I think the way you said it, you assume a steady run rate pretty ratably over the quarter. So I think you're thinking about it right, we continue to see that run rate. The $1.8 billion incremental is -- that's our spend. But what Paul was saying is when we do a solicitation, we'll have our own wind projects that we own that we bid into that and -- but we will also encourage independence to bid in as well and they can bid in either as a build, own, transfer, which would result in our ownership or they could bid in with an expansion of a power purchase agreement and we'll take a look at all of those. But at the end of the day, our incremental CapEx will come from ownership in wind projects, perhaps our own and perhaps BOT's, the solar facility that we're talking about at our coal plant and Becker, Minnesota, advances in EV infrastructure. And I think that covers the incremental and then we look at the acceleration of that $1.2 billion of grid spend. Yes, that's the way to think about it, Paul. Paul, just on the -- I mean, look, I think the way to think about it is, the $1.2 billion that we're not calling incremental, that's an acceleration of something that's already in our forecast. The $1.8 billion would not be in our existing forecast. Now over the course of 15 years, might it have happen. Yes, that's how we're defining that. Yes, I mean I think it extends a little bit by jurisdiction. Is that... Around -- yes, bad debt deferrals. Hey Insoo, this is Brian. As we talked about in Q1, we assume that we get constructive treatment around the regulatory deferrals. When we think about our bad debt expense, we have roughly about $25 million increase and we look at what happened in 2008 and 2009 and that's everything we've seen for the three months of impacts that remains pretty consistent as our thinking going into this. And if we think about it right, we have about 95% of our businesses covered with our six deferral orders, two are waiting for the Dakotas. So we feel like we've reached a constructive place with those deferral orders and we'll continue to evaluate the deferrals as you go through the balance of the year. Yes. That's correct. Yes. Thank you all for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions. Have a good day."

Reporters can contact media relations with inquiries, individual investors and others can reach out to Investor Relations. Thank you. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I turn conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nPaul Johnson: Thank you. Good morning. And welcome to Xcel Energy's 2020 first quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Bob Frenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This morning we'll review our 2020 first quarter results, share business development and regulatory developments, discuss how we're managing through uncertainty around coronavirus. There's an expanded list of slides today that accompany our call on our Web site. As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain forward looking information, significant factors that could cost results to different than those anticipated are designated in earnings release and our filings with the SEC. On today's call, we will discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures, including ongoing earnings and electric and natural gas margins. Information on the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earning release. I will now turn the call over to Ben.\nBen Fowke: Well, thank you, Paul and good morning, everyone. You know, as I reflect back on the past few months, my heart really goes out to the individuals and families impacted by the coronavirus, the devoted health care professionals so bravely serving our communities and the businesses across all sectors experiencing tremendous economic challenges. At Xcel Energy, we understand how critical our work is to the health and safety of our communities and local businesses. I'm so pleased with how our employees and industry have responded during this unprecedented time, working to keep people safe, delivering reliable service to customers and providing support to those in need as we've done for over a 100 years. I also want to thank our employees for their dedication, spirit, and creativity in finding ways to support our communities and stimulate local economic growth. Now turning to the quarter. We've gotten off to a solid start, booking $0.56 per share for the first quarter of 2020 compared with $0.61 per share last year. We believe we can take actions that will allow us to weather the impacts of COVID-19. And as a result, we are reaffirming our 2020 guidance. Brian will discuss the financial results in more detail. At Xcel Energy, we're taking significant strides to help our customers and protect our employees, while continuing to deliver critical energy services. Some of our actions include both committing to not disconnecting residential customer service and arranging payment plans if they're having difficulty paying their bills. In Minnesota, we were proposing to reduce our approved field forecast by $25 million to give immediate relief to our customers. We stepped up our charitable giving and are helping our communities during this time of need.  And we are working closely with our regulators and state and local leadership to identify constructive solutions to support our communities and customers. We\u2019re keeping our employees safe by implementing work from home policies, providing personal protection equipment and following CDC social distancing guidelines and enhancing cleaning practices, conducting temperature checks at critical facilities, segregating crews and staggering work times. To ensure continued reliability, we've implemented business continuity plans, which allows us to prioritize work and are prepared to sequest our critical employees on site if necessary. From a financial standpoint, we've enhanced our liquidity and developed contingency plans to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. Finally, we expect to be part of the solution to help get the economy back on its feet by continuing to invest in our communities through our capital expenditure programs that create jobs and drive demand for equipment and supplies. While this is a fluid situation with considerable uncertainty, Xcel Energy has always shown a remarkable dedication to serving our customers during difficult times, and this set of challenges is no exception. Moving on to business development. We recently announced the opportunistic sale of the Mankato natural gas plant for $680 million. You recall we originally proposed this acquisition as a fully regulated assets. However, when the Minnesota commission rejected this proposal, we acquired Mankato as a non-regulated asset and stepped into the power purchase agreement. While we thought Mankato would provide significant long-term value, especially as we shut down coal assets, we've heard from several investors that having a non-regulated asset cloud at the Xcel Energy story. As a result, when several potential buyers expressed interest in acquiring the plant, we decided to sell it and preserve our status as one of the very few fully regulated pure play utilities. And since the earnings were back end loaded, we don't expect the sale to materially impact our earnings projections. And while it was not part of the rationale for the sale, the transaction will improve our liquidity in these uncertain times. We will use the proceeds to reduce funding needs and improve our credit metrics. In addition, we will book again, which we will use to fund charitable giving efforts, including supporting COVID-19 relief efforts throughout our communities. Finally, we recently announced some important promotions as part of our succession plan. Bob Frenzel was named President and Chief Operating Officer and Brian Van Abel was named Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bob has been our CFO for the past four years and has extensive experience in industry prior to joining Xcel Energy. While Brian has had increasing roles in finance, including treasurer, financial planning and analysis and corporate development. Both Bob and Brian are extremely intelligent and talented employees who have been instrumental in developing and executing our strategy and delivering a consistently strong financial. And while I don't plan to retire anytime soon, these promotions reflect a deep bench strength and thoughtful plan we have at Xcel Energy. So with that, let me turn the call over to Brian who\u2019ll provide more detail on our financial results and outlook, along with our actions to mitigate coronavirus impacts. Brian?\nBrian Van Abel: Thanks, Ben, and good morning everyone. We achieved solid results recording $0.56 per share for the first quarter of 2020 compared to $0.61 per share last year. The majority of the quarterly deviation is driven by weather. We experienced warmer than normal winter weather this year compared with cooler than normal weather last year, which results in $0.04 per share unfavorable comparison. While significant earnings drivers for the quarter include lower O&M expensive increased earnings by $0.03 per share, our lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.03 per share. However, majority of the lower ETR is due to an increase in production tax credits are sold back to customers through electric margin and tax reform impacts, both of which are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were, lower margins due largely to unfavorable weather, which reduced earnings by $0.03 per share and which offsets riders and regulatory outcomes. Increased depreciation and interest expense, reflecting our capital investment program reduced earnings by $0.05 per share and other items combined decreased earnings by $0.03 per share. Next, I want to discuss the potential impact to COVID-19 and the actions we are taking to mitigate our range of outcomes. Starting with sales, our first quarter of weather and leap-year adjusted electric sales declined by 1.1%, while natural gas sales increased by 0.4%. The coronavirus virus crisis had a minor impact in first quarter sales. The economic shutdown started in mid-March, so we did not experienced the full monthly impact. From March, our total residential sales increased slightly, while C&I sales declined 4%, resulting in a total retail electric sales decline of 3% on a weather adjusted basis. However, a better reference point on the monthly COVID-19 impact is what we saw in our preliminary April numbers in which almost all of our states were under relatively strict shelter in place orders. Residential sales increased 3.2% while C&I sales declined 13.7% and total retail electric sales declined 9.6% on a weather adjusted basis. And keep in mind we have a sales mechanism for all electric classes in Minnesota and decoupling for the electric residential and non-demand small C&I classes in Colorado. This covers about 45% of our total retail electric sales. And to help us prepare financially for the pandemic, we developed three sales scenarios as outlined in our presentation. The mild scenario assumes a severe impact through May followed by a relatively quick recovery in the third quarter. This results in the sales decline of approximately 2% compared to 2019. Our base case, and the case in which we are reaffirming our earnings guidance around as soon as the severe impact through the second quarter with the slower U-type shape recovery with lingering effects for the rest of 2020. This results in the sales decline of approximately 4% on a year-over-year basis. And lastly, the severe scenario, as soon as the severe impact lasts through the third quarter, followed by a portracted L-type shape for recovery. This is a challenging scenario with a deeper and longer bottom in our base case, resulting in a sales decline of approximately 8% for the year. We use these scenarios as we develop our contingency plans. We view the mild and severe case scenarios as having a low probability of occurring. We think the base case scenario is the most likely outcome, or at least within the band around the sales impact we've outlined, we have incorporated a base case into our guidance assumptions. There was considerable uncertainty on what will actually occur, particularly the duration of the downturn and the lingering effects, which [Technical Difficulty] feel confident in our ability to mitigate what we view as the most likely scenario, and the April sales results came in slightly better than our forecast giving us greater confidence. We're also closely monitoring our bad debt expense and working with our customers on payment plans that are having difficulty paying their bills. While it is difficult to project where we'll land, bad debt expense increased approximately $20 million in the 2008 to 2009 time period as a reference point. Additionally, our commissions in Wisconsin, Texas and Michigan, have issued orders to track and defer pandemic related expenses. We've also filed for deferred accounting treatment of incremental COVID-19 related expenses, including bad debt in Minnesota, Colorado, New Mexico, North Dakota and South Dakota. We're implementing contingency plans to reduce our overall cost structure and mitigate the impact of COVID-19. Some of these actions include cost reductions related to employee expenses, consulting, variable compensation, deferral of certain work activities and the implementation of hiring freeze. Based on our contingency plans, we now expect annual O&M expenses will decline 4% to 5% in 2020, which should offset the impacts of COVID-19 in the base scenario. We also have plans in place to ensure that we can implement additional contingency plans if the negative impacts of COVID-19 exceed our base case scenario. However, there are limitations to what we can offset. We will focus on providing strong customer service and reliability. And we will not make short term decisions that have a negative long-term impact on our customers or shareholders. Turning to supply chain. The situation is fluid but we have not had any material impact to our supply chain with the exception of our wind farms. In mid April, we were informed of supply chain disruptions, which will likely result in delays in completion of two of our wind farms into 2021. We are monitoring the situation closely and are striving to complete the project this year. However, we have fully documented our activities since 2016 and have maintained continuous efforts since then. So we are confident these wind farms will qualify for 100% PTC benefit even if they are completed in 2021. And the last topic I want to cover on COVID-19 is liquidity. We're in a very strong position after enhancing liquidity in March by entering into $700 million term loan with attractive terms, and we issued $600 million 10-year holding company bond. We now have available liquidity of approximately $3.1 billion. In addition, the sales proceeds from the Mankato plant will increase liquidity by approximately $650 million. And finally, we issued an equity forward last year, which we expect to settle later this year and will provide another approximately $740 million in cash. In total, this will provide liquidity of nearly $4.5 billion. We also plan to issue $1.9 billion of operating company debt throughout the year. As a result of our enhanced liquidity, we have the flexibility on issuance timing to ensure that capital markets are accessible at attractive terms. For more detail on liquidity, please see our earnings release. Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. We have three rate cases pending and the coronavirus has not resulted in any material delays in regulatory proceedings. In New Mexico, we reached a constructive unanimous settlement that reflects a rate increase of approximately $31 million, ROE of 9.45%, an equity ratio of 54.8% and acceleration of depreciation on the Tolk coal plant to reflect an earlier retirement. We are awaiting a hearing examiner recommendation and commission decision. In Texas, SPS and intervening parties have reached an unopposed constructive settlement agreement in principle. We are working with parties to document and file the settlement, which we expect to appear shortly. We anticipate a commission decision in the third quarter. In February 2020, we filed a natural gas case in Colorado seeking a net rate increase of $127 million based on an ROE of 9.95% and an equity ratio of 55.8%. It is fairly early in the process so there's not much to report, but the procedural schedule hasn't set with new rates expected to become effective in November based on statutory requirements. In terms of the earnings, there\u2019s considerable uncertainty around the coronavirus impacts. Therefore, we have implemented contingency plans to manage our cost structure and made regulatory filings that will help to offset the impact of COVID-19. As a result, we still expect to deliver 2020 earnings within our original guidance range of $2.73 to $2.83 per share based on our base case scenario, which we think is the most likely scenario. In addition, we can implement additional O&M contingency plans if the COVID-19 impacts exceed the base case. However, there are limitations to what we can offset as we balance short term and long-term for both our customers and investors. Our contingency plans are not offset the severe scenario, which would likely result in earnings below our guidance range but we feel the severe scenario has a low probability of occurring. With that, I will wrap up. We have implemented steps to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. We sold the Mankato facility for a modest gain. We increased our dividend 6.2%. We reached constructive rate case settlements in New Mexico and Texas. We remain committed to delivering on our 2014 guidance and our long-term earnings and dividend growth within our 5% to 7% objective range. We continue to provide reliable energy service to our customers, while ensuring the safety and wellbeing of our employees and communities. Despite the near term economic challenges, we're executing our strategy extremely well and we remain positive about the opportunities in front of us for the benefit of our customers, communities and shareholders. And finally, we believe we can help rejuvenate our local economies and work with our regulators and state leadership to help our communities and customers recover from the crisis. We're looking forward to being part of the solution. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions.\nOperator: Thank you [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nStephen Byrd: I wanted to just get an update at a high level in terms of the opportunity for additional PPA buyouts. Just what are you seeing in terms of the opportunity, or is that sort of a little bit on pause just given the COVID-19 dynamics? And just curious at a high level what your views are on that opportunity?\nBen Fowke: We're all focused on COVID-19, but we're still running a business and still looking for opportunities. Brian, do you want to give a little more detail?\nBrian Van Abel: And so as we think about it, we're in regular contact with our counterparties. Obviously, there could be potential here as you see what's happening. And if any of them have an interest of selling, we're certainly regular in contact. We have our proceeding of the Mower acquisition in front of the commission, and we hopefully see a decision of that in Q2 or Q3. But then we're also looking at how we use the ERP and our IRP processes to help jump start some of that too. Some of the discussions around our acquisitions in Minnesota is how can we better improve the process with the department, our stakeholders, to ensure that we're bringing it forward and have a comprehensive discussion. So we're certainly active on that stage. And you know, we've talked before it continues to be part of our plan, but we don't include any of that in our base capital plan.\nStephen Byrd: And just maybe at a high level in terms of resource planning. How do you think about the opportunity for further acceleration of renewables? I guess on the positive side, renewable costs keep dropping. We may -- there's always a potential for tax credits to get extended. The wind credit got extended again last year. On the negative side, I guess you have demand uncertainty from COVID. In Texas, we have uncertainty around the status of the energy sector overall. But how do you think about the potential for additional sort of renewables growth, additional shutdowns of some of your coal assets? Do you feel about the same as you felt before? Are there reasons to be more bullish or more cautious? How would you think about that?\nBrian Van Abel: I guess the short answer is probably a little more bullish. The cost, as you mentioned, Stephen, continued to come down. And so our feel for fuel strategy continues to be, I think, obviously economically attractive. And I think the test of that was the ability to get our renewables approved in Texas and in New Mexico and basically on economic terms. I think the other element too, Stephen, which makes me bullish is that, and this is where I think we can partner with our states and our commissions and state administrations, to be part of the solution in getting people back to work and that's potentially accelerating some of our capital opportunities. And using that to bring on more renewable at a great price point that actually helps save customers\u2019 money and employees\u2019 jobs, good jobs. So not unlike when we had the great recession and can tell you many times that we have people stop me, people typically working in our labor unions and actually thank myself and really the company for continuing to go forward with projects, because that was the only job we have. And that's something to be really proud of and I think we can replicate that again.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from David Peters with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nDavid Peters: I was wondering if you could just give a view of where you guys see yourself with earnings guidance range in any of this base scenario?\nBen Fowke: Where we are in the guidance range\u2026\nDavid Peters: Yes\u2026\nBen Fowke: I guess first I would say take a look at our track record over the last 15 years. I think we've demonstrated that we can deliver within the earnings guidance range, typically that's been at the middle or above. So we're quite proud of that and we expect we'll be able to do that this year. But if you look at what we've done in the past and our track record, on the first quarter earnings call, we don't give any additional guidance whether we're going to be the bottom, the top or whatever. So that's the first quarter. We're confident onto the base case scenario we'll be in the earnings guidance range. And as the months and quarters roll on as we've done in the past, we\u2019ll potentially get more color on it.\nDavid Peters: And then just preliminary sales data for April. Do you have a sense of which states are seeing more weakness than others, just understanding that you have decoupling in Minnesota and some protection in Colorado as well?\nBen Fowke: David, well, the question about what states were affected, what the divergence in the states for April. Is that basically what you're asking, you're kind of breaking up on\u2026\nDavid Peters: Yes, that's right.\nBen Fowke: I think as we look at it, we saw the most resiliency on the C&I side in SPS, and probably the biggest impact on the C&I side in Minnesota and Wisconsin, the northern territory. So I think that's the color certainly we'll watch it as we go over time. Now, part of what we saw in Minnesota is we did have a combined heat and power plant as we've talked about on our call before go online in May of last year. So that's part of what we see and we look at month over month, but overall commentary greatest weakness in C&I side, Minnesota and Wisconsin and less so in SPS and Colorado is roughly in the middle of those two.\nDavid Peters: And then last question I had is just I think you said the equity forward that you expect to settle around year end, but just on the Mankato sale. Does that impact the equity plans at all either for this year or next? Just kind of what you guys weighed out last year?\nBen Fowke: No, it doesn't. When I say we\u2019ll use it to reduce our financing costs for this year but we don't expect to not sell our equity forward this year. We do plan to settle it but what Mankato does is really it\u2019s infusion of cash of $650 million, and it\u2019ll provide some additional headroom on capital investment if we have an opportunity to potentially accelerate investments, and really help our communities, and customers, and the regulators accelerate some of this rebound from this crisis. So I think it gives us just an additional capital headroom. As we think about longer term, we think about our five year plan. We'll reevaluate that and overall financing plans as we get to Q3 and lay out a new five year capital plan.\nDavid Peters: And I think final question is the two renewable projects that you've mentioned that could flip into \u201821, which ones were that?\nBen Fowke: Those are the two Minnesota farms that we're looking at. But I would say we've done, as you'd expect from us, we've taken a very conservative approach and then made sure we've had all the documentation since 2016, and we've maintained continuous efforts since then. So we're highly competent even if they do slip a month or two into 2021 that will qualify for 100% PTCs.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan.\nJeremy Tonet: Just wanted to start off, I guess, do you have any regulatory obligations or guarantees associated with the wind that could impact our earnings, because of the project delay into \u201821 here? Just want to touch base on that point.\nBrian Van Abel: We have no obligations in terms of getting in service in 2020 and we're certainly working towards that, and that's our goal is to get them completed in 2020. But in terms of obligations and in term of timing we don't. There are obligations in terms of overall cost gap, but we're certainly working to mitigate any impacts on that as you start to see a delay in schedule. We're certainly working with our suppliers and our plant contractors to get those, to ensure that we bring it in under the original order PTC cost cap.\nBen Fowke: Yes, so we're pretty comfortable with that, Jeremy.\nBob Frenzel: In addition, the SPS has been projects that we have 100% PTC guarantee. But again, we think that those are getting into construction by the end of the year and we're fairly confident on 100% PTC.\nJeremy Tonet: And just a cleanup questions, Slide 17. It seemed like AFUDC equity ticked up a bit there. Just wondering if you could give a little bit more color on that?\nBen Fowke: Yes, from our regional guidance it did as you start to see some delays in some projects, and part of that was our Blazing Star 1 wind farm that we just put in service in April. That took as we were in the winter time, it took a little bit longer, so that's part of it. So just kind of across the board as you see part of it\u2019s wind farm and part of it some other investments that we're making. And there's also a little bit higher -- as we took steps to improve our liquidity also a little bit higher AFUDC rate.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Julian Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nAlex McKerrell: This is Alex McKerrell calling in for Julian. My first question is about your rate case filings that you have for this year. I was wondering, if you have any updates on whether or not you could potentially push out Minnesota again or potentially push out Colorado? And maybe how you're thinking about using existing trackers to track that rate base instead?\nBob Frenzel: We recognize that these are challenging times, and we do like to work with our regulators in advance. In both Colorado and Minnesota, we have been investing in infrastructure and assets that our customers value and our regulators support. But like in the past, we do think there are mechanisms that will allow us to not file those rate cases. And you can be assured that those conversations are happening with the staff in the commissions as applicable in the respective states. We like to not file those cases and we probably have more information for you on the second quarter call later this year.\nAlex McKerrell: My second question and my last question, just about your CAGR overtime. I was wondering if you're still anticipating potentially upper end of that long term guidance? And thank you again.\nBen Fowke: Yes, I think it's a great question. Again and I talked a little bit about it with an earlier question. But you look at what drives our 5% to 7% growth and it's investing in projects and opportunities that are very much aligned with our states, our communities, our regulators, our legislators. So, I don't see that changing and I don't see changes to our CapEx forecast unless to the upside going forward. So that's what drives the growth and that\u2019s where we'll get it from.\nBob Frenzel: One of the things I think we've done as a company is on sunny days prepare for the stormy days, and we've got great dry powder on our balance sheet and Brian mentioned the other things we did. We also continue to invest in our system, keeping it strong and reliable. And so that allows you to weather situations like that and potentially come back stronger and a partner with our states as we look to jump start the economy when we get, all get through this.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Travis Miller with Morningstar.\nTravis Miller: The question on the contingency plans, I think you might have answered this real quickly. But on the O&M side how much of these contingency plans have you been able to accomplish so far? We've been talking about first in the four or five months of the year. And then any change in the CapEx plan within those contingency plans? I think you just answered no, but just want to clarify the O&M side and then the CapEx side.\nBrian Van Abel: We've really see no plans in our CapEx for this year. On the O&M side this crisis hit relatively recently so working through all those plans. And we have a plan for balance of the year in terms of implementing them. I think Ben said it pretty well is you often hear Ben and Bob talk about dry powder and you know that's been used in the context of our financial dry powder with our strong balance sheet, our conservative dividend payout ratio, but we also have operational dry powder. And you know we've invested in the system and then in the good days and as the time of crisis here, we\u2019re able to weather it. And we look at, when we think about the O&M contingency plans, we're putting in place, whether it's we\u2019ve implemented the hiring freeze, we're looking at reducing employee expesens and that will happen over time, reducing consulting spend or other programs. And as we think about it we're targeting, as I talked about, targeting 4% to 5% purely mitigate that base case scenario. So we do have the ability to flex up all those, but it's a little bit worse.\nTravis Miller: So evenly spread more or less throughout the year?\nBrian Van Abel: That's a fair assumption.\nTravis Miller: And then on the renewable development. How much are those delays project specific and how much are you seeing just across the entire industry supply chain issues or other financing delays, construction delays, stuff like that industry wide versus couple of projects you mentioned?\nBob Frenzel: We work with our OEM vendors as well as our balance of plant providers to execute the schedules. We have seen some supply chain disruptions started when China shut down for a while. We've had mild disruptions from other plants where we get some of our components. We think that's an industry wide phenomena. I think, as Brian mentioned, we've been exceptionally diligent in tracking our costs. We are really comfortable with our ability to meet the safe harbor provisions for achieving 100% PTC. These are projects that were originally scheduled to be later in this year anyway. And so while we're trying actively to get them completed in 2020, there's the potential that do slip into \u201921. But I do think it's stuff we're seeing around the industry and also not only is it our vendors but there's a logistics and a supply chain issue with ports and parts transport that we're seeing. It's not, I wouldn't say it's catastrophic by any stretch, it's just mild we just happen to have these later dated projects for us.\nBen Fowke: We're very, very confident. I've worked with outside firms to know we\u2019ll pass the continuous efforts test.\nTravis Miller: Any difference you're seeing between solar and wind in terms of what you just talked about with supply chain and other logistics?\nBrian Van Abel: Right now, Travis, we're only building wind farms on our own balance sheet. I haven't seen or heard a lot of solar delays. There's been a couple of public force majeure filings on some solar farms around the country, but I don't think we could speak with any authority on the solar side.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nSophie Karp: I was curious if you could provide a little bit more color on the supply chain disruptions that we've been talking about, particularly with these two wind farms. What you guys have seen in the supply chain? And also do you expect that the issues may in fact sort of other areas, maybe traditional power generation, transmission, distribution businesses where it might affect the the availability of parts and things like that as we move forward and the lockdowns and disruptions continue? Thank you.\nBob Frenzel: We haven't seen any supply chain disruptions on any of our other components other than maybe toilet paper and hand sanitizer and face mask. But on the wind farms themselves, a lot of the components are manufactured in overseas and assembled here. And so depending on the progress of the pandemic and which country it hit, which factories has caused, two, three, four week delays in various places, which compounded equals maybe a six, or seven, or eight week delay on our projects and that was enough to push them across, potentially push them across the go line. We're seeing not just constraints on the OEM sidebut we do see logistics constraints around ports and air travel and shipping as well, and so that's caused some of the problems. I can't say that we've seen any other disruptions on any of our other components, we just haven't. Those discrete items are suffer watching closely. As Ben and Brian has said, we feel very confident in our ability to qualify for the PTCs at 100%, and we're working diligently with our vendors and our transportation providers to get all the components here and get them constructed by the end of the year.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude today's question and answer session. At this time, I turn the conference back to Brian Van Abel for any additional or closing remarks.\nBrian Van Abel: Yes, thank you. And thank you for all participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our investor relations team for any follow up questions, and have a good day. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. We appreciate participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Ben Fowke",
            "content": "Well, thank you, Paul and good morning, everyone. You know, as I reflect back on the past few months, my heart really goes out to the individuals and families impacted by the coronavirus, the devoted health care professionals so bravely serving our communities and the businesses across all sectors experiencing tremendous economic challenges. At Xcel Energy, we understand how critical our work is to the health and safety of our communities and local businesses. I'm so pleased with how our employees and industry have responded during this unprecedented time, working to keep people safe, delivering reliable service to customers and providing support to those in need as we've done for over a 100 years. I also want to thank our employees for their dedication, spirit, and creativity in finding ways to support our communities and stimulate local economic growth. Now turning to the quarter. We've gotten off to a solid start, booking $0.56 per share for the first quarter of 2020 compared with $0.61 per share last year. We believe we can take actions that will allow us to weather the impacts of COVID-19. And as a result, we are reaffirming our 2020 guidance. Brian will discuss the financial results in more detail. At Xcel Energy, we're taking significant strides to help our customers and protect our employees, while continuing to deliver critical energy services. Some of our actions include both committing to not disconnecting residential customer service and arranging payment plans if they're having difficulty paying their bills. In Minnesota, we were proposing to reduce our approved field forecast by $25 million to give immediate relief to our customers. We stepped up our charitable giving and are helping our communities during this time of need.  And we are working closely with our regulators and state and local leadership to identify constructive solutions to support our communities and customers. We're keeping our employees safe by implementing work from home policies, providing personal protection equipment and following CDC social distancing guidelines and enhancing cleaning practices, conducting temperature checks at critical facilities, segregating crews and staggering work times. To ensure continued reliability, we've implemented business continuity plans, which allows us to prioritize work and are prepared to sequest our critical employees on site if necessary. From a financial standpoint, we've enhanced our liquidity and developed contingency plans to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. Finally, we expect to be part of the solution to help get the economy back on its feet by continuing to invest in our communities through our capital expenditure programs that create jobs and drive demand for equipment and supplies. While this is a fluid situation with considerable uncertainty, Xcel Energy has always shown a remarkable dedication to serving our customers during difficult times, and this set of challenges is no exception. Moving on to business development. We recently announced the opportunistic sale of the Mankato natural gas plant for $680 million. You recall we originally proposed this acquisition as a fully regulated assets. However, when the Minnesota commission rejected this proposal, we acquired Mankato as a non-regulated asset and stepped into the power purchase agreement. While we thought Mankato would provide significant long-term value, especially as we shut down coal assets, we've heard from several investors that having a non-regulated asset cloud at the Xcel Energy story. As a result, when several potential buyers expressed interest in acquiring the plant, we decided to sell it and preserve our status as one of the very few fully regulated pure play utilities. And since the earnings were back end loaded, we don't expect the sale to materially impact our earnings projections. And while it was not part of the rationale for the sale, the transaction will improve our liquidity in these uncertain times. We will use the proceeds to reduce funding needs and improve our credit metrics. In addition, we will book again, which we will use to fund charitable giving efforts, including supporting COVID-19 relief efforts throughout our communities. Finally, we recently announced some important promotions as part of our succession plan. Bob Frenzel was named President and Chief Operating Officer and Brian Van Abel was named Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bob has been our CFO for the past four years and has extensive experience in industry prior to joining Xcel Energy. While Brian has had increasing roles in finance, including treasurer, financial planning and analysis and corporate development. Both Bob and Brian are extremely intelligent and talented employees who have been instrumental in developing and executing our strategy and delivering a consistently strong financial. And while I don't plan to retire anytime soon, these promotions reflect a deep bench strength and thoughtful plan we have at Xcel Energy. So with that, let me turn the call over to Brian who'll provide more detail on our financial results and outlook, along with our actions to mitigate coronavirus impacts. Brian? We're all focused on COVID-19, but we're still running a business and still looking for opportunities. Brian, do you want to give a little more detail? Where we are in the guidance range... I guess first I would say take a look at our track record over the last 15 years. I think we've demonstrated that we can deliver within the earnings guidance range, typically that's been at the middle or above. So we're quite proud of that and we expect we'll be able to do that this year. But if you look at what we've done in the past and our track record, on the first quarter earnings call, we don't give any additional guidance whether we're going to be the bottom, the top or whatever. So that's the first quarter. We're confident onto the base case scenario we'll be in the earnings guidance range. And as the months and quarters roll on as we've done in the past, we'll potentially get more color on it. David, well, the question about what states were affected, what the divergence in the states for April. Is that basically what you're asking, you're kind of breaking up on... I think as we look at it, we saw the most resiliency on the C&I side in SPS, and probably the biggest impact on the C&I side in Minnesota and Wisconsin, the northern territory. So I think that's the color certainly we'll watch it as we go over time. Now, part of what we saw in Minnesota is we did have a combined heat and power plant as we've talked about on our call before go online in May of last year. So that's part of what we see and we look at month over month, but overall commentary greatest weakness in C&I side, Minnesota and Wisconsin and less so in SPS and Colorado is roughly in the middle of those two. No, it doesn't. When I say we'll use it to reduce our financing costs for this year but we don't expect to not sell our equity forward this year. We do plan to settle it but what Mankato does is really it's infusion of cash of $650 million, and it'll provide some additional headroom on capital investment if we have an opportunity to potentially accelerate investments, and really help our communities, and customers, and the regulators accelerate some of this rebound from this crisis. So I think it gives us just an additional capital headroom. As we think about longer term, we think about our five year plan. We'll reevaluate that and overall financing plans as we get to Q3 and lay out a new five year capital plan. Those are the two Minnesota farms that we're looking at. But I would say we've done, as you'd expect from us, we've taken a very conservative approach and then made sure we've had all the documentation since 2016, and we've maintained continuous efforts since then. So we're highly competent even if they do slip a month or two into 2021 that will qualify for 100% PTCs. Yes, so we're pretty comfortable with that, Jeremy. Yes, from our regional guidance it did as you start to see some delays in some projects, and part of that was our Blazing Star 1 wind farm that we just put in service in April. That took as we were in the winter time, it took a little bit longer, so that's part of it. So just kind of across the board as you see part of it's wind farm and part of it some other investments that we're making. And there's also a little bit higher -- as we took steps to improve our liquidity also a little bit higher AFUDC rate. Yes, I think it's a great question. Again and I talked a little bit about it with an earlier question. But you look at what drives our 5% to 7% growth and it's investing in projects and opportunities that are very much aligned with our states, our communities, our regulators, our legislators. So, I don't see that changing and I don't see changes to our CapEx forecast unless to the upside going forward. So that's what drives the growth and that's where we'll get it from. We're very, very confident. I've worked with outside firms to know we'll pass the continuous efforts test."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Brian Van Abel",
            "content": "Thanks, Ben, and good morning everyone. We achieved solid results recording $0.56 per share for the first quarter of 2020 compared to $0.61 per share last year. The majority of the quarterly deviation is driven by weather. We experienced warmer than normal winter weather this year compared with cooler than normal weather last year, which results in $0.04 per share unfavorable comparison. While significant earnings drivers for the quarter include lower O&M expensive increased earnings by $0.03 per share, our lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.03 per share. However, majority of the lower ETR is due to an increase in production tax credits are sold back to customers through electric margin and tax reform impacts, both of which are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were, lower margins due largely to unfavorable weather, which reduced earnings by $0.03 per share and which offsets riders and regulatory outcomes. Increased depreciation and interest expense, reflecting our capital investment program reduced earnings by $0.05 per share and other items combined decreased earnings by $0.03 per share. Next, I want to discuss the potential impact to COVID-19 and the actions we are taking to mitigate our range of outcomes. Starting with sales, our first quarter of weather and leap-year adjusted electric sales declined by 1.1%, while natural gas sales increased by 0.4%. The coronavirus virus crisis had a minor impact in first quarter sales. The economic shutdown started in mid-March, so we did not experienced the full monthly impact. From March, our total residential sales increased slightly, while C&I sales declined 4%, resulting in a total retail electric sales decline of 3% on a weather adjusted basis. However, a better reference point on the monthly COVID-19 impact is what we saw in our preliminary April numbers in which almost all of our states were under relatively strict shelter in place orders. Residential sales increased 3.2% while C&I sales declined 13.7% and total retail electric sales declined 9.6% on a weather adjusted basis. And keep in mind we have a sales mechanism for all electric classes in Minnesota and decoupling for the electric residential and non-demand small C&I classes in Colorado. This covers about 45% of our total retail electric sales. And to help us prepare financially for the pandemic, we developed three sales scenarios as outlined in our presentation. The mild scenario assumes a severe impact through May followed by a relatively quick recovery in the third quarter. This results in the sales decline of approximately 2% compared to 2019. Our base case, and the case in which we are reaffirming our earnings guidance around as soon as the severe impact through the second quarter with the slower U-type shape recovery with lingering effects for the rest of 2020. This results in the sales decline of approximately 4% on a year-over-year basis. And lastly, the severe scenario, as soon as the severe impact lasts through the third quarter, followed by a portracted L-type shape for recovery. This is a challenging scenario with a deeper and longer bottom in our base case, resulting in a sales decline of approximately 8% for the year. We use these scenarios as we develop our contingency plans. We view the mild and severe case scenarios as having a low probability of occurring. We think the base case scenario is the most likely outcome, or at least within the band around the sales impact we've outlined, we have incorporated a base case into our guidance assumptions. There was considerable uncertainty on what will actually occur, particularly the duration of the downturn and the lingering effects, which [Technical Difficulty] feel confident in our ability to mitigate what we view as the most likely scenario, and the April sales results came in slightly better than our forecast giving us greater confidence. We're also closely monitoring our bad debt expense and working with our customers on payment plans that are having difficulty paying their bills. While it is difficult to project where we'll land, bad debt expense increased approximately $20 million in the 2008 to 2009 time period as a reference point. Additionally, our commissions in Wisconsin, Texas and Michigan, have issued orders to track and defer pandemic related expenses. We've also filed for deferred accounting treatment of incremental COVID-19 related expenses, including bad debt in Minnesota, Colorado, New Mexico, North Dakota and South Dakota. We're implementing contingency plans to reduce our overall cost structure and mitigate the impact of COVID-19. Some of these actions include cost reductions related to employee expenses, consulting, variable compensation, deferral of certain work activities and the implementation of hiring freeze. Based on our contingency plans, we now expect annual O&M expenses will decline 4% to 5% in 2020, which should offset the impacts of COVID-19 in the base scenario. We also have plans in place to ensure that we can implement additional contingency plans if the negative impacts of COVID-19 exceed our base case scenario. However, there are limitations to what we can offset. We will focus on providing strong customer service and reliability. And we will not make short term decisions that have a negative long-term impact on our customers or shareholders. Turning to supply chain. The situation is fluid but we have not had any material impact to our supply chain with the exception of our wind farms. In mid April, we were informed of supply chain disruptions, which will likely result in delays in completion of two of our wind farms into 2021. We are monitoring the situation closely and are striving to complete the project this year. However, we have fully documented our activities since 2016 and have maintained continuous efforts since then. So we are confident these wind farms will qualify for 100% PTC benefit even if they are completed in 2021. And the last topic I want to cover on COVID-19 is liquidity. We're in a very strong position after enhancing liquidity in March by entering into $700 million term loan with attractive terms, and we issued $600 million 10-year holding company bond. We now have available liquidity of approximately $3.1 billion. In addition, the sales proceeds from the Mankato plant will increase liquidity by approximately $650 million. And finally, we issued an equity forward last year, which we expect to settle later this year and will provide another approximately $740 million in cash. In total, this will provide liquidity of nearly $4.5 billion. We also plan to issue $1.9 billion of operating company debt throughout the year. As a result of our enhanced liquidity, we have the flexibility on issuance timing to ensure that capital markets are accessible at attractive terms. For more detail on liquidity, please see our earnings release. Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. We have three rate cases pending and the coronavirus has not resulted in any material delays in regulatory proceedings. In New Mexico, we reached a constructive unanimous settlement that reflects a rate increase of approximately $31 million, ROE of 9.45%, an equity ratio of 54.8% and acceleration of depreciation on the Tolk coal plant to reflect an earlier retirement. We are awaiting a hearing examiner recommendation and commission decision. In Texas, SPS and intervening parties have reached an unopposed constructive settlement agreement in principle. We are working with parties to document and file the settlement, which we expect to appear shortly. We anticipate a commission decision in the third quarter. In February 2020, we filed a natural gas case in Colorado seeking a net rate increase of $127 million based on an ROE of 9.95% and an equity ratio of 55.8%. It is fairly early in the process so there's not much to report, but the procedural schedule hasn't set with new rates expected to become effective in November based on statutory requirements. In terms of the earnings, there's considerable uncertainty around the coronavirus impacts. Therefore, we have implemented contingency plans to manage our cost structure and made regulatory filings that will help to offset the impact of COVID-19. As a result, we still expect to deliver 2020 earnings within our original guidance range of $2.73 to $2.83 per share based on our base case scenario, which we think is the most likely scenario. In addition, we can implement additional O&M contingency plans if the COVID-19 impacts exceed the base case. However, there are limitations to what we can offset as we balance short term and long-term for both our customers and investors. Our contingency plans are not offset the severe scenario, which would likely result in earnings below our guidance range but we feel the severe scenario has a low probability of occurring. With that, I will wrap up. We have implemented steps to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. We sold the Mankato facility for a modest gain. We increased our dividend 6.2%. We reached constructive rate case settlements in New Mexico and Texas. We remain committed to delivering on our 2014 guidance and our long-term earnings and dividend growth within our 5% to 7% objective range. We continue to provide reliable energy service to our customers, while ensuring the safety and wellbeing of our employees and communities. Despite the near term economic challenges, we're executing our strategy extremely well and we remain positive about the opportunities in front of us for the benefit of our customers, communities and shareholders. And finally, we believe we can help rejuvenate our local economies and work with our regulators and state leadership to help our communities and customers recover from the crisis. We're looking forward to being part of the solution. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions. And so as we think about it, we're in regular contact with our counterparties. Obviously, there could be potential here as you see what's happening. And if any of them have an interest of selling, we're certainly regular in contact. We have our proceeding of the Mower acquisition in front of the commission, and we hopefully see a decision of that in Q2 or Q3. But then we're also looking at how we use the ERP and our IRP processes to help jump start some of that too. Some of the discussions around our acquisitions in Minnesota is how can we better improve the process with the department, our stakeholders, to ensure that we're bringing it forward and have a comprehensive discussion. So we're certainly active on that stage. And you know, we've talked before it continues to be part of our plan, but we don't include any of that in our base capital plan. I guess the short answer is probably a little more bullish. The cost, as you mentioned, Stephen, continued to come down. And so our feel for fuel strategy continues to be, I think, obviously economically attractive. And I think the test of that was the ability to get our renewables approved in Texas and in New Mexico and basically on economic terms. I think the other element too, Stephen, which makes me bullish is that, and this is where I think we can partner with our states and our commissions and state administrations, to be part of the solution in getting people back to work and that's potentially accelerating some of our capital opportunities. And using that to bring on more renewable at a great price point that actually helps save customers' money and employees' jobs, good jobs. So not unlike when we had the great recession and can tell you many times that we have people stop me, people typically working in our labor unions and actually thank myself and really the company for continuing to go forward with projects, because that was the only job we have. And that's something to be really proud of and I think we can replicate that again. We have no obligations in terms of getting in service in 2020 and we're certainly working towards that, and that's our goal is to get them completed in 2020. But in terms of obligations and in term of timing we don't. There are obligations in terms of overall cost gap, but we're certainly working to mitigate any impacts on that as you start to see a delay in schedule. We're certainly working with our suppliers and our plant contractors to get those, to ensure that we bring it in under the original order PTC cost cap. We've really see no plans in our CapEx for this year. On the O&M side this crisis hit relatively recently so working through all those plans. And we have a plan for balance of the year in terms of implementing them. I think Ben said it pretty well is you often hear Ben and Bob talk about dry powder and you know that's been used in the context of our financial dry powder with our strong balance sheet, our conservative dividend payout ratio, but we also have operational dry powder. And you know we've invested in the system and then in the good days and as the time of crisis here, we're able to weather it. And we look at, when we think about the O&M contingency plans, we're putting in place, whether it's we've implemented the hiring freeze, we're looking at reducing employee expesens and that will happen over time, reducing consulting spend or other programs. And as we think about it we're targeting, as I talked about, targeting 4% to 5% purely mitigate that base case scenario. So we do have the ability to flex up all those, but it's a little bit worse. That's a fair assumption. Right now, Travis, we're only building wind farms on our own balance sheet. I haven't seen or heard a lot of solar delays. There's been a couple of public force majeure filings on some solar farms around the country, but I don't think we could speak with any authority on the solar side. Yes, thank you. And thank you for all participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our investor relations team for any follow up questions, and have a good day. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to Xcel Energy's Year-end 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. Questions will only be taken from institutional investors. Reporters can contact Media Relations with inquires and individual investors and others can reach out to Investor Relations. And now at this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Paul Johnson, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nPaul Johnson: Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2021 year-end conference call. Joining me today are Bob Frenzel, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have others from our management team here to help answer any questions you might have. This morning, we will review our 2021 results and share recent business and regulatory developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder, some of the comments made during today's call may contain forward-looking information significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our SEC filings. Today, we will discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures. Information on the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release. And with that, I'll turn it over to Bob.\nBob Frenzel: Thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Before we walk through year-end results, I want to reflect on the devastating wildfires that tour through Boulder County, Colorado just before the New Year. It's been a long four weeks since this historic tragedy ravaged our communities and resulted in two people losing their lives and over 1,200 homes and buildings being destroyed or damaged. Our hearts and thoughts are with all members of these communities who lost their homes, suffered damage or were displaced, including 17 of our own employees and their families. I'm truly grateful for our hundreds of employees, contractors and partners who exercised incredible diligence in keeping each other and our customers safe while working around the clock to get the lights and the heat back on especially over a holiday weekend with below zero temperatures and more than a foot of fresh snow in some areas. More than 100,000 electric customers experienced a sustained outage and service was largely restored within 48 hours. Our wildfire protocols require that we turn off natural gas service to over 13,000 customers as a safety precaution. And once it was safe, our employees with mutual aid assistance went door-to-door to manually relight pilot lights, restoring service within just three days. In addition to our crews, I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to our many employees and community members who volunteered alongside emergency responders, handing out space heaters and water bottles and collecting clothing donations. I'm so proud of how our team and partners led with compassion and deliver for our customers and communities in this extreme time of need. Officials continue to investigate the cause of the fire, but they confirmed there were no down power lines in the ignition area. Our systems remain resilient even as when 100-mile per hour winds propelled the fires due to our previously approved wildfire mitigation plan and our continued focus on operational excellence. As we always do, our team rallied to the call guided by our four values connected, committed, trustworthy and safe. Moving on to our 2021 results. We had another very successful year, continuing to execute on our strategy while delivering strong financial and operational performance. First and foremost, throughout the pandemic, we continue to provide safe, reliable service to our customers and support to our employees and our communities. Financially, we delivered EPS of $2.96 representing 17th consecutive year of meeting or exceeding our earnings guidance. We raised our annual dividend for the 18th straight year, increasing it by $0.11 per share. We reached constructive rate case settlements in Colorado, Texas, New Mexico, Wisconsin, North Dakota and Michigan. We also reached constructive settlements in several additional regulatory proceedings in Colorado, including Yuri storm cost recovery, our resource plan and the pathway transmission project, and we anticipate commission decisions on these settlements by the end of the first quarter. Our nuclear fleet remains the top-performing fleet in the country, achieved a capacity factor of over 92% last year. We also installed over 300,000 smart meters as part of our advanced grid program and plan to install more than 1 million in 2022. Continue to lead the country in carbon reduction, in 2021, our estimated carbon emissions were approximately 50% below 2005 levels, and we remain on track to achieve 80% carbon reduction by 2030. As planned, we completed four wind farms with 800 megawatts of capacity, which provides significant environmental benefits and cost savings for our customers. We also accelerated our time line for transitioning out of coal and now expect to be coal-free by the end of 2034. 2021, we extended our clean energy leadership to our natural gas business, committing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by 2030 and deliver net zero natural gas service by 2050 for Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. We continue to execute on our electric vehicle vision, implementing 12 new programs for our customers receiving approval for our New Mexico plan and preparing for increased levels of electric vehicle adoption across our eight states. We're also recognized for our continued ESG leadership, named among the world's both ethical companies, the best veteran employers and for disability inclusion in the workplace. And finally, we introduced a compensation-based diversity metric and earned a perfect score on the Corporate Equality Index for the 6th consecutive year. I'm proud to lead a team that can deliver on financial, operational, environmental, customer and diversity goals simultaneously. Looking ahead, we're well positioned for sustainable organic growth over the next decade, including affordable renewable additions in our proposed Minnesota and Colorado resource plans. The transmission needed to enable those carbon-free resources and responsible transitions as we retire our coal plants. Together, our resource plans will add nearly 10,000 megawatts of renewables to our system and achieve an 85% carbon reduction by 2030. In December, we reached a settlement in our Colorado resource plan that will accelerate the retirement of our Comanche 3 coal unit to 2034 in advance our Pawnee plant conversion to natural gas to 2026, while maintaining plans to add approximately 4,000 megawatts of renewables and reduced carbon 87% by 2030. We also reached a settlement in our $1.7 billion pathway transmission project in Colorado. The pathway will provide 560 miles of double-circuit 345 kV lines to enable 5,500 megawatts of new renewables in the state. The settlement includes a certificate of need, rider recovery and a potential for a 90-mile line extension with an additional investment of $250 million to enable access to some of the richest wind resources in the region. We expect decisions on both the Minnesota and the Colorado resource plans and the pathway transmission project in the first quarter of the year. As we've previously discussed, our capital investment plan is not dependent on changes in federal policy. However, the energy provisions that were included in the build better legislation would provide substantial customer benefits and help enable the clean energy transition. While that legislation has stalled, there is some discussion that a more modest version could potentially move forward this year. This could include new and extended tax credits for wind, solar, hydrogen, storage, nuclear and transmission along with a direct pay option for the tax credits. Continue to advocate for these provisions, which will be beneficial for our customers and as President, Biden has suggested there may be congressional support for energy and climate bill with a more modest price tag than the original build-back better bill. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\nBrian Van Abel: Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. We had another strong year, booking $2.96 per share for 2021 compared with $2.79 per share in 2020. The most significant earnings drivers for the year include the following: higher electric and natural gas margins increased earnings by $0.41 per share, primarily driven by riders and regulatory outcomes to recover our capital investments. In addition, a lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.17 per share. Production tax credits lowered the ETR, however, PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin and are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation expense, which reduced earnings by $0.24 per share, reflecting our capital investment program. Lower AFUDC decreased earnings by $0.10 per share, largely due to placing several large wind farms into service last year. Higher other taxes, primarily property taxes decreased earnings by $0.03 per share and other items combined to reduce earnings by $0.04 per share. Turning to sales. Weather-adjusted electric sales increased by 1.7% in 2021 as the economy recovered from the pandemic. We anticipate weather-adjusted sales growth of approximately 1% in 2022. Shifting to expenses. Our O&M spend was flat in 2021. This continues an existing trend as we kept our O&M flat since 2014, while adding significant renewables and capital investment. We expect O&M will increase 1% to 2% in 2022, driven by wind farm additions, increased spending on electric vehicle programs and other customer initiatives. Turning to regulatory. We reached an unopposed settlement in our Colorado electric case, which will provide a net rate increase of $177 million based on an ROE of 9.3%, an equity ratio of 55.7% in the 2021 test year. Every settlement is based on compromises, and we feel this is a constructive outcome for all parties. Hearings were completed last week, and we expect the commission decision in March. We also reached a black box settlement principle in our Texas Electric case, which provides a rate increase of approximately $89 million. The agreement also accelerates the depreciation life of the coal plant to 2034. The commission decision is anticipated later this year. Moving to Minnesota. In December, the commission approved interim rates of $247 million for electric customers and $25 million for natural gas customers. The commission granted interim rates as requested for our natural gas operations but lowered our electrical request by $41 million due to the lingering impacts of the pandemic on residential customers. They made similar adjustments for CenterPoint and Minnesota Power. The schedules for both cases are included in the earnings release, and we expect commission decisions in mid-2023. Earlier this week, we filed a natural gas case in Colorado, seeking a net rate increase of $107 million in 2022 with incremental step increases of $40 million in 2023 and $41 million in 2024. The request was driven by significant capital investments for customer growth, safety, reliability and resiliency and is based on a 10.25% ROE, an equity ratio of 55.6%, in the 2022 current test year. Our average Colorado residential customers' natural gas bill was 24% below the national average in 2020, among the lowest in the country. We anticipate a commission decision later this year and final rates to be implemented in November 2022. Shifting to earnings. We've updated our 2022 guidance assumptions largely to reflect 2021 actual results. Details are included in our earnings release. In addition, we are reaffirming our 2022 earnings guidance range of $3.10 to $3.20 per share, which is consistent with our long-term 5% to 7% EPS growth objective. With that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. We delivered 2021 earnings guidance within our guidance range, the 17th consecutive year and increased our dividend for the 18th consecutive year. We continue to execute on our steel-for-fuel strategy by adding 800-megawatt wind to our system. We remain on track to achieve 80% carbon reduction by 2030 and plan to be coal-free by 2034. We reached constructive rate case settlements in Colorado, Texas, New Mexico, Wisconsin, North Dakota and Michigan. We also reached constructive settlements and several additional regulatory proceedings in Colorado, including storm Yuri cost recovery, our resource plan and the pathway transmission project. We've kept our O&M expenses flat since 2014. We reaffirmed our 2022 earnings guidance, and we remain confident we can deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth in the upper half of our 5% to 7% objective range. We continue leading the clean energy transition and keeping this well for our customers. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from the line of Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs.\nInsoo Kim: Just first question, maybe for Brian, touching on your O&M growth forecast comment now 1% to 2% versus 1% that you had given in the third quarter earnings. Could you elaborate a little bit more on what's driving this, whether it's more demand-driven or are we seeing some impact of cost inflation that's getting impacted here? And also how confident you think some of those other offsets that you've included in the drivers could get you to keep you on pace?\nBrian Van Abel: Good morning, Insoo. Yes, and if we look at our -- I'll start just with the updates on the guidance changes. And most are just updating to actuals when we look at 2020 year-end versus the guidance we gave in Q3 for 2022. And that's exactly what it is for O&M. Our O&M number in 2022 didn't change. But what happened is our O&M for the end of the year ended up lower than it was. So what you're seeing is just an update to actuals. We had lower benefits costs in Q4 of 2021 and also manage through some of the weather impacts that we saw in 2021. So, we're comfortable with our O&M guidance in 2022 that 1% to 2%, like I said, is just a function of where '21 landed.\nInsoo Kim: Yes, I did see that. And I think the '21 levels were still below the 2019 level. So that makes sense. Okay. Second question, the -- it seems like in the fourth quarter, you did a pretty healthy amount of ATM equity, $350 million or so. How does that fit into your five-year plan of up to $800 million that you've laid out? And just out on the front loading, it seems of a lot of equity up frontiers, especially given we don't know what will happen with spill back better or any of the energy-related provisions, but you have said in the past that direct pay provision could meaningfully reduce your equity needs. Thanks.\nBrian Van Abel: Yes. Good question, Insoo. And I look at our 2022 to 2026 capital plans and financing plans is just at the five-year. And so -- but we've been transparent in terms of the incremental capital is generally financed, we call 50-50. And if you think about where we were last year, meaning our last five-year plan, '21 through '25 rolling forward, we added about $2.5 billion of capital. And so the way I think about it is, yes, we're opportunistic in issuing some equity and add that to the $800 million of equity in our plan today because DRIP was it the same in both, and it was about $1.15 billion. So if you look at the $2.5 billion of capital we added, so it's right on kind of right in line with how we talk about financing incremental capital. So hopefully, that makes sense is kind of look and plan over plan. But you're absolutely right. As we think about the potential for clean energy legislation and the opportunity that gives us that absolutely still rings true in terms of being able to significantly reduce our equity needs going forward if that does pass. And or vice versa, we could really potentially accelerate investment without the need for incremental equity. So, I think it gives us a lot of flexibility going forward if it does happen.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Julian Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Congrats on continued progress here, especially in Colorado. I just wanted to bring up this pathway project, kudos on pending a deal there. I'm just curious if you could elaborate here on how that fits into the potential upside that you guys articulated earlier, the $0.5 billion to $1 billion that potential incremental for '22 to '26. And also, if you could clarify, the settlement seems like, it's 1.7, it's what you asked for, but you also alluded to this potential further network upgrades. Is that something else that we should be looking for to come out of the settlement or what have you?\nBob Frenzel: Julien, it's Bob, great to hear you this morning. Appreciate the interest in the Colorado Pathway Project. It's obviously very strategic for us, as we look to transition that state to an 87% carbon reduction and greater than 80% renewables by the end of the decade. I think if you went back and looked at the filings, what we asked for was a base plan of about $1.7 billion of capital to enable that almost 600-mile project. That $1.7 billion also had in the filings in the original filings is we call it an extension that would enable access to the best wind resources in the state. I think it was, it's conditional approval based on whether or not we have projects that show up in our RFP in that region and whether we'll build it or not. When I think about the incremental capital that we laid out, there's a couple of pieces in the pathway program that would take that $1.7 billion, somewhere higher. The first one is this $250 million extension. And then, as we've said since the outset of the Pathway project, we have to, at some point, ultimately interconnect all of the assets that get proposed to us in the RFP. And those interconnections come with additional upgrades on the transmission system to enable voltage support and stability. And those may -- depending on the ultimate locations of the projects that are picked, those could happen out in the Eastern planes of Colorado that could be more in the Metroplex. We don't know exactly where that's going to happen until the final projects are picked. And that's -- we know they'll cost some money. We just don't know what it is and where exactly it will happen. So that's where the incremental capital comes from, but we expect it to be needed.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Maybe just to clarify that...\nBrian Van Abel: I would say just in terms of timing and visibility in the incremental spend, like Bob said, we know what needs to happen. We just don't know the timing and type of it yet. But once we get through the RFP process later this year and have identified the actual resources and where they're going to be located, whether it's wind or solar, then we'll have a really good visibility into what the transmission upgrades will be needed and when they'll be needed, probably latter half of this five-year plan early in kind of the second five.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: But maybe to clarify that further, you talked about this $1 billion to $0.5 billion to $1 billion transmission upside in the current five-year plan. It sounds like you're edging towards the higher end of that incremental piece. And then ultimately, if I can push you a little bit on this, you've alluded to this in the remarks, I mean, whether it's Colorado or the Minnesota or Colorado IRPs, when do we get a more fully baked view on your CapEx? I know you said that, that's coming in the first quarter here, but it sounds like considering the RFPs, et cetera, that may be more of an EEI or even next year at this time, kind of update to get a more fully fleshed view?\nBrian Van Abel: Yes. I think let me answer your first question around, well, that, call it, in the transmission settlement, the conditional approval of that extension of $250 million, that certainly is helpful when we look at that $0.5 billion to $1 billion. And that's a really -- I mean, as Bob said in his opening remarks, that's really goes to a very resource-rich wind region that would be beneficial for our customers. And really, the parties just want to make sure that we get projects appearing there, and that's why it's conditional approval. So if you assume that's already part of the $500 million to $1 billion, you could see how there's -- will be incremental opportunities that will push that number closer to the midpoint or higher. On your second question around really timing. So what's going to happen, we'll get decisions in both Minnesota and Colorado on the resource plans from the commission in Q1. And then, we'll move into the RFP phase, which is likely going to be two, three, four months beyond those decisions, and then we have to work through that process. So Colorado could move a bit quicker in terms of getting clarity around from Colorado as we think about that process. Minnesota might be a little bit later than that. But there will be opportunities as we work through it and get through the RFP phase and make filings with commission where there'll be more visibility kind of throughout the process.\nOperator: All right. Next question will come from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning. Just wanted to kind of start off with MISO MTEP process here. And just seeing if you could share any other thoughts on the time line? And what is the potential for the process to bear fruit for the current plan? Or where could that come in, in the future?\nBob Frenzel: Jeremy, it's Bob. Thanks for the question. Similar to Colorado, we're really excited about the opportunity for transmission expansion in all of our regions as it will enable additional renewable penetration that we can deliver to our customers. In particular, in MISO, we've been very active with the MISO steering committee and the MISO transmission owners. Recently, we've agreed to cost allocation mechanisms across MISO and new proposed tariffs, which we expect to deliver next month, which puts us on a schedule for MISO to release what they would say is MTEP 2021 by, I'll call it, midyear. And our expectation for MTEP21 is a subset of the projects that are included in MISO's future ones. So if you go back to the original source document, MISO released three futures of the world. We've been largely talking about future one and future three. Future one was about a $30 billion transmission expansion in the Upper Midwest or throughout MISO region. And then future three was really the other goalpost was about $100 billion investment needed to enable a significant carbon reduction across all of MISO footprint. Our expectation for future one is that as a company, we're probably likely to get about 20% of the transmission opportunities that are included in future one. We expect MTEP21 to be a subset of future one, so a smaller subset than the $30 billion worth of projects.\nPaul Johnson: And Jeremy, it's probably important to point out, too, that we don't have any material MISO transmission in our first five-year forecast.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you for that. And then, maybe just pivoting over to Minnesota and the yearly proceeding there, I was wondering if you might be able to provide any comments or thoughts there? And does this provide any indications or takeaways related to the Minnesota rate case?\nBob Frenzel: Yes, it's Bob. I'm not certain I would put a lot of linkage between those two proceedings. As I think about Yuri in the Minnesota case, I think about so the unprecedented event that happened last February. And it's not unexpected to have parties question, the investments that we made to enable our system reliability at the time. In Minnesota, in particular, working through that regulatory proceeding, we filed what I would say is extensive testimony and -- just last week, we filed rebuttal testimony. We obviously disagree with the positions of the OAG and the department on the disallowances they proposed. And look, we'll continue to work with the commission through the proceeding. But I wouldn't put a lot of linkage between a Yuri proceeding and the Minnesota electric or gas cases.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Understood. Just a last one for me here. You might be able to provide more color on the process for converting Pawnee to natural gas by 2026. And what the potential cost for conversions could be and over what time frame should we expect this to occur?\nBrian Van Abel: Yes, I expect that conversion cost to be relatively small. And that's really one of the reasons why we propose to convert Pawnee versus Comanche just because the conversion costs are that. And right in 2026, I expect the conversions really to be in the back half of this five-year forecast. So that's really -- assuming we get approval for it, we think it is certainly the right path to ensure that we have system reliability with converting the pony to gas and having that. But in terms of conversion, it is not significant.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll next go to Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey, good morning, team. Thanks for taking my question. Bob, maybe just to kick things off, I have two questions. First, just on the macro, I appreciate the commentary on bill, back better. Sorry if I missed it, but you didn't touch on AMT. I'm just wondering if -- I know industry sort of leaders in the last few weeks, last few months as sort of lobbied against it. Is that something that you think perhaps comes out in the process of negotiations or what are your latest thoughts there?\nBrian Van Abel: Durgesh, good morning, and thanks for the question. Let's -- I think it really depends is what is the size -- assuming something can get done and there seems to be pretty good support for the clean energy provisions. But the question is then what is the pay for and what's the size of the clean energy provisions, right? You've heard around this number of a $500-plus billion climate provision package being put forth. There also seems to be pretty good support for the Medicare/prescription drug change, which is a revenue raiser of about $300 billion. So I really think I haven't from -- certainly from what we have heard is AMT is not off the table. I think it all depends on what size of the package they can get support from. I mean for us, certainly, if the climate provisions were passed and like Bob said in his opening remarks, we strongly support those clean energy provisions. They are great for our customers in terms of driving this clean transition, meaning able to do it more affordably. But if AMT wasn't included in that, that is just better for us as we talk about the overall impacts of the clean energy provisions plus AMT -- but if we actually just didn't have AMT, that improves our cash flow metrics probably by about 15 basis points, so relatively minor. But I think to your question, is more to come as we think about how this could play out and really how they look paying for the overall smaller package.\nBob Frenzel: Dugresh, I'd just add one more thing to what Brian said is. One, I think we've concluded that the AMP in and of itself isn't all that impactful for Xcel Energy as it allows the use of existing renewable credits to fund it. I think the other thing that we would look to, though, as an industry in mitigating the AMP is really the fact that, on one hand, the federal government is giving you a lot of tax credits to incentivize development of renewable assets. And then on the other hand, if you have an AMT funding requirements, you're almost notifying some of the incentives that come with those tax credits. So where I think the discussion would go with lawmakers is can we use tax credits funded in the clean energy provisions to offset the AMT provisions. And ultimately, if you think about AMT and our industry, it's paid for by our customers. And so it's just -- it's an increase in tax to our existing customers. And I think that would be an area that we would negotiate with lawmakers as well. So it's still included in what we see as provisions in the build, back, better plan, but all subject to negotiation.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. Thank you for that color. And then just one quick clarification, if I may. On the MISO process, you mentioned mid-2022. I think we've sort of seen some bids around May. Did that move or are we still expecting some sort of CapEx announcement, project announcements in May?\nBob Frenzel: Well, I think May is probably the target. I might have been hedging a bit by saying it could slip into June, but I think it's -- we're talking about maybe a month to -- and I'm not saying it's going to slip. I just -- I was hedging my own comments.\nOperator: All right. Next question will come from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.\nDave Arcaro: It's Dave Arcaro on for Stephen. Thanks so much for taking my question. I was wondering in Colorado, have your views of fire risk changed in light of the catastrophic fires we saw? And wondering if there are adjustments that you might make or consider to your wildfire mitigation plans in the state?\nBob Frenzel: Hey, Steve, thanks for the question. Obviously, a tragedy in Colorado and the Marshall Fire and with everything like that, we learned from it. We've been focused as a company on climate-driven resiliency for a long time, and we followed in Colorado, our wildfire mitigation program back in 2019, and we're executing under that program. I'm sure there's always ways that we can learn from these strategies and improve the risk for the customers for sure. The commissions open a proceeding and we're going to actively participate with them on exploring your exact question on things that are in the approved wildfire plan and things we might want to consider in the future, but that -- we're early stages in that.\nDave Arcaro: Understood. Thanks for that color. And then I was curious on sales growth in the quarter, saw weather normal resi sales down a decent amount. I was just wondering if you might be able to comment around that and just comfort level with the 2022 sales growth outlook where you sit today?\nBrian Van Abel: Yes. I think I kind of look at it over the balance of the year of 2021. If you recall, going into the year, we thought sales growth was going to be about 1%. We ended up -- ended at 1.7% on a weather-normalized basis. And really, our C&I forecast was pretty close. What was higher than expected was on the residential side. And what we saw is that residential stickiness through most of 2021. So I think you saw some of that give back in Q4, a little bit of that weakness when you look over the Q-over-Q numbers. So as I think about 2022, that was our expectation even going into 2020 to continued C&I strength. Our economies, our service territories have stronger forecasted GSP than the national GDP. We have forecasting strong job growth. So I feel good on the C&I side. And we do expect those residential numbers to decline a little bit as you go to return to more a little bit more, call it, return to normal. So, we do feel comfortable with where we're sitting for 2022 on the overall basis with stronger C&I sales offsetting some of the residential decline.\nBob Frenzel: The other point to make, too, is that we did have some pretty extreme weather in the fourth quarter. And while we feel comfortable with our weather normalization process, when the weather extremes get kind of more extreme, it makes it a little bit more difficult to determine the weather versus the sales impact. So, there could be a little bit of noise there.\nOperator: All right. Next, we'll go to Paul Fremont with Mizuho.\nPaul Fremont: Great. I just wanted to sort of look at the additional equity issuance. And is it fair to sort of infer that with that additional equity issuance that you would at least be somewhat into the incremental CapEx spend that you guys have identified on a go-forward basis?\nBrian Van Abel: Paul, I think if you're talking about the ATM that we did in Q4, the way I think about it is the plan -- the '22 to '26 plan that we have in front of us is the equity needed for that plan. And really, the equity last year was related to that last five-year plan, and I'll explain it a little bit. Is when we rolled the forward five-year plans, we added $2.5 billion of capital. And for us, credit quality and balance sheet strength is important. And we've always talked about funding incremental capital with about 50% equity. And if you kind of look at what we did at the end of Q4 plus that $800 million gets you just under 50% equity funding when we look at kind of the two plants together. So I think we're comfortable there for us. Like I said, credit quality and credit strength is important at Xcel and our operating companies. It's important to have access to capital. And so when you look at our current five-year plan going forward, right, that equity financings hold true. And certainly, like I said, if something happens on the clean energy provision, federally, we'll revisit those as that gives us a lot more flexibility in terms of financing.\nBob Frenzel: Paul, it's important to recognize what we did in 2021 was always part of our '21 plan. So it's not any change to what we had envisioned going forward.\nPaul Fremont: Okay. And then -- in the past, I guess, you guys have talked about contract buyouts. There seems to be sort of less focus on that. But can you give us any update on contract buyout opportunities? Or do you see any within that '22 to '26 period?\nBrian Van Abel: I don't think -- I wouldn't characterize it as any less focus. The corporate development team reports directly to me, and we're in constant discussions with developers. I think a little bit is what you see as we're in a resource plans in our two major jurisdictions, and working through those proceedings and then we have RFPs coming up, and that could be an avenue for developers to bid in potential opportunities within those RFPs. And I think it'd be -- I think our commissions, given that we have those RFPs coming up, that's the preference they had if sitting here today, if we had any projects to bring forward, they'd prefer to see them in those RFPs. But we always focus on it. I've talked -- and I've always talked about it as being opportunistic. And it will be opportunistic because it has to work for our customers. We won't bring forward an opportunity to our commissions if it doesn't save our customers' money.\nBob Frenzel: Paul, we've been successful in the strategy. I think we've deployed more than $0.5 billion in capital in this strategy. And I think there's another $0.5 billion to $1 billion more opportunities for us, but they are, as Brian said, very opportunistic and likely to see some of that as we go through the resource planning processes and Colorado over the next year or so.\nPaul Fremont: Great. And then my last question. When you talk about sales growth of 1% this year, on a normalized basis beyond this year, would you -- what would be sort of an expectation, a more normalized expectation for the outer years?\nBrian Van Abel: I think longer term, it's beyond this year as we continue to recover, and our sales are still below where we were pre-COVID levels. I think longer term, it's relatively flat with the exception is EV adoption as that starts to increase and pick up, we'll start to see some sales growth. We see our EV goal of 20% of EVs in our service territory by 2030, adding about 7/10th of a percent over a decade. So, I think it's relatively flat until we start to see some more EV penetration in larger numbers over the longer term.\nOperator: Your next question will be from Travis Miller with Morningstar.\nTravis Miller: Good morning everyone. Thank you. You answered my question on the Colorado wildfires. Just one quick follow-up to that. Have you heard or been involved in discussions that kind of give more momentum to the whole clean energy transition, I mean, climate change and such following the wildfires? Is that accelerated or enhanced some of the clean energy discussion?\nBob Frenzel: Travis, it's Bob. Look, I think our stakeholders in Colorado, including the Company itself, have been very aggressively pushing a clean energy transition. In fact, our goals in Colorado have us reducing our carbon footprint by 87% by the end of the decade on the electric side. And just in November, we committed on the natural gas side to reduce emissions on the natural gas business by the end of the decade and then be net zero by mid-century in the gas business. So I think the conversations in Colorado continue on that front with that as the backdrop. I've seen articles in the paper that talk about climate change and things like that. But I think the path we're on is absolutely aligned with the policyholders and stakeholders in Colorado. So, there may be increased discussion, but I think the trajectory that we're on is the right one.\nTravis Miller: Sure. Okay. Great. And then second question same in Colorado, there see earned ROEs for the year we're in a low 8% range. Once you get that electric rate case in there, call it, in the first quarter, early second quarter, does that jump up? Does that get you to of a 9% type range closer to the allowed? Or is there something in Colorado, the rate structures, et cetera, where it's just very, very difficult for you to get to the nine-plus percent?\nBrian Van Abel: Travis, I don't see significant improvement into 2022. One is no rates won't be effective until April on the electric side. You did see us file a gas case here very recently. And we're still -- we do face regulatory lag there with the test year on the electric side really being kind of a midyear '21. So we'll continue to work with our stakeholders and the commissions on that side, but I don't see the ROE improving significantly in 2022.\nTravis Miller: Okay. And is it the historical test year that just makes a big difference, 100 basis points or so?\nBrian Van Abel: I mean I haven't done that math, but the historical test year, particularly when you're investing significant amount of capital into the system, helping drive this clean energy transition in that historical test year does put some pressure on your earned ROEs.\nOperator: All right, it looks like there are no further questions at this time. So, I'd like to turn it back over to Mr. Brian Van Abel for any additional or closing remarks.\nBrian Van Abel: Yes. Thank you all for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions.\nOperator: And that does conclude today's conference. We thank everyone again for their participation.",

            "name": "Bob Frenzel",
            "content": "Thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Before we walk through year-end results, I want to reflect on the devastating wildfires that tour through Boulder County, Colorado just before the New Year. It's been a long four weeks since this historic tragedy ravaged our communities and resulted in two people losing their lives and over 1,200 homes and buildings being destroyed or damaged. Our hearts and thoughts are with all members of these communities who lost their homes, suffered damage or were displaced, including 17 of our own employees and their families. I'm truly grateful for our hundreds of employees, contractors and partners who exercised incredible diligence in keeping each other and our customers safe while working around the clock to get the lights and the heat back on especially over a holiday weekend with below zero temperatures and more than a foot of fresh snow in some areas. More than 100,000 electric customers experienced a sustained outage and service was largely restored within 48 hours. Our wildfire protocols require that we turn off natural gas service to over 13,000 customers as a safety precaution. And once it was safe, our employees with mutual aid assistance went door-to-door to manually relight pilot lights, restoring service within just three days. In addition to our crews, I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to our many employees and community members who volunteered alongside emergency responders, handing out space heaters and water bottles and collecting clothing donations. I'm so proud of how our team and partners led with compassion and deliver for our customers and communities in this extreme time of need. Officials continue to investigate the cause of the fire, but they confirmed there were no down power lines in the ignition area. Our systems remain resilient even as when 100-mile per hour winds propelled the fires due to our previously approved wildfire mitigation plan and our continued focus on operational excellence. As we always do, our team rallied to the call guided by our four values connected, committed, trustworthy and safe. Moving on to our 2021 results. We had another very successful year, continuing to execute on our strategy while delivering strong financial and operational performance. First and foremost, throughout the pandemic, we continue to provide safe, reliable service to our customers and support to our employees and our communities. Financially, we delivered EPS of $2.96 representing 17th consecutive year of meeting or exceeding our earnings guidance. We raised our annual dividend for the 18th straight year, increasing it by $0.11 per share. We reached constructive rate case settlements in Colorado, Texas, New Mexico, Wisconsin, North Dakota and Michigan. We also reached constructive settlements in several additional regulatory proceedings in Colorado, including Yuri storm cost recovery, our resource plan and the pathway transmission project, and we anticipate commission decisions on these settlements by the end of the first quarter. Our nuclear fleet remains the top-performing fleet in the country, achieved a capacity factor of over 92% last year. We also installed over 300,000 smart meters as part of our advanced grid program and plan to install more than 1 million in 2022. Continue to lead the country in carbon reduction, in 2021, our estimated carbon emissions were approximately 50% below 2005 levels, and we remain on track to achieve 80% carbon reduction by 2030. As planned, we completed four wind farms with 800 megawatts of capacity, which provides significant environmental benefits and cost savings for our customers. We also accelerated our time line for transitioning out of coal and now expect to be coal-free by the end of 2034. 2021, we extended our clean energy leadership to our natural gas business, committing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by 2030 and deliver net zero natural gas service by 2050 for Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. We continue to execute on our electric vehicle vision, implementing 12 new programs for our customers receiving approval for our New Mexico plan and preparing for increased levels of electric vehicle adoption across our eight states. We're also recognized for our continued ESG leadership, named among the world's both ethical companies, the best veteran employers and for disability inclusion in the workplace. And finally, we introduced a compensation-based diversity metric and earned a perfect score on the Corporate Equality Index for the 6th consecutive year. I'm proud to lead a team that can deliver on financial, operational, environmental, customer and diversity goals simultaneously. Looking ahead, we're well positioned for sustainable organic growth over the next decade, including affordable renewable additions in our proposed Minnesota and Colorado resource plans. The transmission needed to enable those carbon-free resources and responsible transitions as we retire our coal plants. Together, our resource plans will add nearly 10,000 megawatts of renewables to our system and achieve an 85% carbon reduction by 2030. In December, we reached a settlement in our Colorado resource plan that will accelerate the retirement of our Comanche 3 coal unit to 2034 in advance our Pawnee plant conversion to natural gas to 2026, while maintaining plans to add approximately 4,000 megawatts of renewables and reduced carbon 87% by 2030. We also reached a settlement in our $1.7 billion pathway transmission project in Colorado. The pathway will provide 560 miles of double-circuit 345 kV lines to enable 5,500 megawatts of new renewables in the state. The settlement includes a certificate of need, rider recovery and a potential for a 90-mile line extension with an additional investment of $250 million to enable access to some of the richest wind resources in the region. We expect decisions on both the Minnesota and the Colorado resource plans and the pathway transmission project in the first quarter of the year. As we've previously discussed, our capital investment plan is not dependent on changes in federal policy. However, the energy provisions that were included in the build better legislation would provide substantial customer benefits and help enable the clean energy transition. While that legislation has stalled, there is some discussion that a more modest version could potentially move forward this year. This could include new and extended tax credits for wind, solar, hydrogen, storage, nuclear and transmission along with a direct pay option for the tax credits. Continue to advocate for these provisions, which will be beneficial for our customers and as President, Biden has suggested there may be congressional support for energy and climate bill with a more modest price tag than the original build-back better bill. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian. Julien, it's Bob, great to hear you this morning. Appreciate the interest in the Colorado Pathway Project. It's obviously very strategic for us, as we look to transition that state to an 87% carbon reduction and greater than 80% renewables by the end of the decade. I think if you went back and looked at the filings, what we asked for was a base plan of about $1.7 billion of capital to enable that almost 600-mile project. That $1.7 billion also had in the filings in the original filings is we call it an extension that would enable access to the best wind resources in the state. I think it was, it's conditional approval based on whether or not we have projects that show up in our RFP in that region and whether we'll build it or not. When I think about the incremental capital that we laid out, there's a couple of pieces in the pathway program that would take that $1.7 billion, somewhere higher. The first one is this $250 million extension. And then, as we've said since the outset of the Pathway project, we have to, at some point, ultimately interconnect all of the assets that get proposed to us in the RFP. And those interconnections come with additional upgrades on the transmission system to enable voltage support and stability. And those may -- depending on the ultimate locations of the projects that are picked, those could happen out in the Eastern planes of Colorado that could be more in the Metroplex. We don't know exactly where that's going to happen until the final projects are picked. And that's -- we know they'll cost some money. We just don't know what it is and where exactly it will happen. So that's where the incremental capital comes from, but we expect it to be needed. Jeremy, it's Bob. Thanks for the question. Similar to Colorado, we're really excited about the opportunity for transmission expansion in all of our regions as it will enable additional renewable penetration that we can deliver to our customers. In particular, in MISO, we've been very active with the MISO steering committee and the MISO transmission owners. Recently, we've agreed to cost allocation mechanisms across MISO and new proposed tariffs, which we expect to deliver next month, which puts us on a schedule for MISO to release what they would say is MTEP 2021 by, I'll call it, midyear. And our expectation for MTEP21 is a subset of the projects that are included in MISO's future ones. So if you go back to the original source document, MISO released three futures of the world. We've been largely talking about future one and future three. Future one was about a $30 billion transmission expansion in the Upper Midwest or throughout MISO region. And then future three was really the other goalpost was about $100 billion investment needed to enable a significant carbon reduction across all of MISO footprint. Our expectation for future one is that as a company, we're probably likely to get about 20% of the transmission opportunities that are included in future one. We expect MTEP21 to be a subset of future one, so a smaller subset than the $30 billion worth of projects. Yes, it's Bob. I'm not certain I would put a lot of linkage between those two proceedings. As I think about Yuri in the Minnesota case, I think about so the unprecedented event that happened last February. And it's not unexpected to have parties question, the investments that we made to enable our system reliability at the time. In Minnesota, in particular, working through that regulatory proceeding, we filed what I would say is extensive testimony and -- just last week, we filed rebuttal testimony. We obviously disagree with the positions of the OAG and the department on the disallowances they proposed. And look, we'll continue to work with the commission through the proceeding. But I wouldn't put a lot of linkage between a Yuri proceeding and the Minnesota electric or gas cases. Dugresh, I'd just add one more thing to what Brian said is. One, I think we've concluded that the AMP in and of itself isn't all that impactful for Xcel Energy as it allows the use of existing renewable credits to fund it. I think the other thing that we would look to, though, as an industry in mitigating the AMP is really the fact that, on one hand, the federal government is giving you a lot of tax credits to incentivize development of renewable assets. And then on the other hand, if you have an AMT funding requirements, you're almost notifying some of the incentives that come with those tax credits. So where I think the discussion would go with lawmakers is can we use tax credits funded in the clean energy provisions to offset the AMT provisions. And ultimately, if you think about AMT and our industry, it's paid for by our customers. And so it's just -- it's an increase in tax to our existing customers. And I think that would be an area that we would negotiate with lawmakers as well. So it's still included in what we see as provisions in the build, back, better plan, but all subject to negotiation. Well, I think May is probably the target. I might have been hedging a bit by saying it could slip into June, but I think it's -- we're talking about maybe a month to -- and I'm not saying it's going to slip. I just -- I was hedging my own comments. Hey, Steve, thanks for the question. Obviously, a tragedy in Colorado and the Marshall Fire and with everything like that, we learned from it. We've been focused as a company on climate-driven resiliency for a long time, and we followed in Colorado, our wildfire mitigation program back in 2019, and we're executing under that program. I'm sure there's always ways that we can learn from these strategies and improve the risk for the customers for sure. The commissions open a proceeding and we're going to actively participate with them on exploring your exact question on things that are in the approved wildfire plan and things we might want to consider in the future, but that -- we're early stages in that. The other point to make, too, is that we did have some pretty extreme weather in the fourth quarter. And while we feel comfortable with our weather normalization process, when the weather extremes get kind of more extreme, it makes it a little bit more difficult to determine the weather versus the sales impact. So, there could be a little bit of noise there. Paul, it's important to recognize what we did in 2021 was always part of our '21 plan. So it's not any change to what we had envisioned going forward. Paul, we've been successful in the strategy. I think we've deployed more than $0.5 billion in capital in this strategy. And I think there's another $0.5 billion to $1 billion more opportunities for us, but they are, as Brian said, very opportunistic and likely to see some of that as we go through the resource planning processes and Colorado over the next year or so. Travis, it's Bob. Look, I think our stakeholders in Colorado, including the Company itself, have been very aggressively pushing a clean energy transition. In fact, our goals in Colorado have us reducing our carbon footprint by 87% by the end of the decade on the electric side. And just in November, we committed on the natural gas side to reduce emissions on the natural gas business by the end of the decade and then be net zero by mid-century in the gas business.

But I think the path we're on is absolutely aligned with the policyholders and stakeholders in Colorado. So, there may be increased discussion, but I think the trajectory that we're on is the right one."

            "name": "Brian Van Abel",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. We had another strong year, booking $2.96 per share for 2021 compared with $2.79 per share in 2020. The most significant earnings drivers for the year include the following: higher electric and natural gas margins increased earnings by $0.41 per share, primarily driven by riders and regulatory outcomes to recover our capital investments. In addition, a lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.17 per share. Production tax credits lowered the ETR, however, PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin and are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation expense, which reduced earnings by $0.24 per share, reflecting our capital investment program. Lower AFUDC decreased earnings by $0.10 per share, largely due to placing several large wind farms into service last year. Higher other taxes, primarily property taxes decreased earnings by $0.03 per share and other items combined to reduce earnings by $0.04 per share. Turning to sales. Weather-adjusted electric sales increased by 1.7% in 2021 as the economy recovered from the pandemic. We anticipate weather-adjusted sales growth of approximately 1% in 2022. Shifting to expenses. Our O&M spend was flat in 2021. This continues an existing trend as we kept our O&M flat since 2014, while adding significant renewables and capital investment. We expect O&M will increase 1% to 2% in 2022, driven by wind farm additions, increased spending on electric vehicle programs and other customer initiatives. Turning to regulatory. We reached an unopposed settlement in our Colorado electric case, which will provide a net rate increase of $177 million based on an ROE of 9.3%, an equity ratio of 55.7% in the 2021 test year. Every settlement is based on compromises, and we feel this is a constructive outcome for all parties. Hearings were completed last week, and we expect the commission decision in March. We also reached a black box settlement principle in our Texas Electric case, which provides a rate increase of approximately $89 million. The agreement also accelerates the depreciation life of the coal plant to 2034. The commission decision is anticipated later this year. Moving to Minnesota. In December, the commission approved interim rates of $247 million for electric customers and $25 million for natural gas customers. The commission granted interim rates as requested for our natural gas operations but lowered our electrical request by $41 million due to the lingering impacts of the pandemic on residential customers. They made similar adjustments for CenterPoint and Minnesota Power. The schedules for both cases are included in the earnings release, and we expect commission decisions in mid-2023. Earlier this week, we filed a natural gas case in Colorado, seeking a net rate increase of $107 million in 2022 with incremental step increases of $40 million in 2023 and $41 million in 2024. The request was driven by significant capital investments for customer growth, safety, reliability and resiliency and is based on a 10.25% ROE, an equity ratio of 55.6%, in the 2022 current test year. Our average Colorado residential customers' natural gas bill was 24% below the national average in 2020, among the lowest in the country. We anticipate a commission decision later this year and final rates to be implemented in November 2022. Shifting to earnings. We've updated our 2022 guidance assumptions largely to reflect 2021 actual results. Details are included in our earnings release. In addition, we are reaffirming our 2022 earnings guidance range of $3.10 to $3.20 per share, which is consistent with our long-term 5% to 7% EPS growth objective. With that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. We delivered 2021 earnings guidance within our guidance range, the 17th consecutive year and increased our dividend for the 18th consecutive year. We continue to execute on our steel-for-fuel strategy by adding 800-megawatt wind to our system. We remain on track to achieve 80% carbon reduction by 2030 and plan to be coal-free by 2034. We reached constructive rate case settlements in Colorado, Texas, New Mexico, Wisconsin, North Dakota and Michigan. We also reached constructive settlements and several additional regulatory proceedings in Colorado, including storm Yuri cost recovery, our resource plan and the pathway transmission project. We've kept our O&M expenses flat since 2014. We reaffirmed our 2022 earnings guidance, and we remain confident we can deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth in the upper half of our 5% to 7% objective range. We continue leading the clean energy transition and keeping this well for our customers. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions. Good morning, Insoo. Yes, and if we look at our -- I'll start just with the updates on the guidance changes. And most are just updating to actuals when we look at 2020 year-end versus the guidance we gave in Q3 for 2022. And that's exactly what it is for O&M. Our O&M number in 2022 didn't change. But what happened is our O&M for the end of the year ended up lower than it was. So what you're seeing is just an update to actuals. We had lower benefits costs in Q4 of 2021 and also manage through some of the weather impacts that we saw in 2021. So, we're comfortable with our O&M guidance in 2022 that 1% to 2%, like I said, is just a function of where '21 landed. Yes. Good question, Insoo. And I look at our 2022 to 2026 capital plans and financing plans is just at the five-year. And so -- but we've been transparent in terms of the incremental capital is generally financed, we call 50-50. And if you think about where we were last year, meaning our last five-year plan, '21 through '25 rolling forward, we added about $2.5 billion of capital. And so the way I think about it is, yes, we're opportunistic in issuing some equity and add that to the $800 million of equity in our plan today because DRIP was it the same in both, and it was about $1.15 billion. So if you look at the $2.5 billion of capital we added, so it's right on kind of right in line with how we talk about financing incremental capital. So hopefully, that makes sense is kind of look and plan over plan. But you're absolutely right. As we think about the potential for clean energy legislation and the opportunity that gives us that absolutely still rings true in terms of being able to significantly reduce our equity needs going forward if that does pass. And or vice versa, we could really potentially accelerate investment without the need for incremental equity. So, I think it gives us a lot of flexibility going forward if it does happen. I would say just in terms of timing and visibility in the incremental spend, like Bob said, we know what needs to happen. We just don't know the timing and type of it yet. But once we get through the RFP process later this year and have identified the actual resources and where they're going to be located, whether it's wind or solar, then we'll have a really good visibility into what the transmission upgrades will be needed and when they'll be needed, probably latter half of this five-year plan early in kind of the second five. Yes. I think let me answer your first question around, well, that, call it, in the transmission settlement, the conditional approval of that extension of $250 million, that certainly is helpful when we look at that $0.5 billion to $1 billion. And that's a really -- I mean, as Bob said in his opening remarks, that's really goes to a very resource-rich wind region that would be beneficial for our customers. And really, the parties just want to make sure that we get projects appearing there, and that's why it's conditional approval. So if you assume that's already part of the $500 million to $1 billion, you could see how there's -- will be incremental opportunities that will push that number closer to the midpoint or higher. On your second question around really timing. So what's going to happen, we'll get decisions in both Minnesota and Colorado on the resource plans from the commission in Q1. And then, we'll move into the RFP phase, which is likely going to be two, three, four months beyond those decisions, and then we have to work through that process. So Colorado could move a bit quicker in terms of getting clarity around from Colorado as we think about that process. Minnesota might be a little bit later than that. But there will be opportunities as we work through it and get through the RFP phase and make filings with commission where there'll be more visibility kind of throughout the process. Yes, I expect that conversion cost to be relatively small. And that's really one of the reasons why we propose to convert Pawnee versus Comanche just because the conversion costs are that. And right in 2026, I expect the conversions really to be in the back half of this five-year forecast. So that's really -- assuming we get approval for it, we think it is certainly the right path to ensure that we have system reliability with converting the pony to gas and having that. But in terms of conversion, it is not significant. Durgesh, good morning, and thanks for the question. Let's -- I think it really depends is what is the size -- assuming something can get done and there seems to be pretty good support for the clean energy provisions. But the question is then what is the pay for and what's the size of the clean energy provisions, right? You've heard around this number of a $500-plus billion climate provision package being put forth. There also seems to be pretty good support for the Medicare/prescription drug change, which is a revenue raiser of about $300 billion. So I really think I haven't from -- certainly from what we have heard is AMT is not off the table. I think it all depends on what size of the package they can get support from. I mean for us, certainly, if the climate provisions were passed and like Bob said in his opening remarks, we strongly support those clean energy provisions. They are great for our customers in terms of driving this clean transition, meaning able to do it more affordably. But if AMT wasn't included in that, that is just better for us as we talk about the overall impacts of the clean energy provisions plus AMT -- but if we actually just didn't have AMT, that improves our cash flow metrics probably by about 15 basis points, so relatively minor. But I think to your question, is more to come as we think about how this could play out and really how they look paying for the overall smaller package. Yes. I think I kind of look at it over the balance of the year of 2021. If you recall, going into the year, we thought sales growth was going to be about 1%. We ended up -- ended at 1.7% on a weather-normalized basis. And really, our C&I forecast was pretty close. What was higher than expected was on the residential side. And what we saw is that residential stickiness through most of 2021. So I think you saw some of that give back in Q4, a little bit of that weakness when you look over the Q-over-Q numbers. So as I think about 2022, that was our expectation even going into 2020 to continued C&I strength. Our economies, our service territories have stronger forecasted GSP than the national GDP. We have forecasting strong job growth. So I feel good on the C&I side. And we do expect those residential numbers to decline a little bit as you go to return to more a little bit more, call it, return to normal. So, we do feel comfortable with where we're sitting for 2022 on the overall basis with stronger C&I sales offsetting some of the residential decline. Paul, I think if you're talking about the ATM that we did in Q4, the way I think about it is the plan -- the '22 to '26 plan that we have in front of us is the equity needed for that plan. And really, the equity last year was related to that last five-year plan, and I'll explain it a little bit. Is when we rolled the forward five-year plans, we added $2.5 billion of capital. And for us, credit quality and balance sheet strength is important. And we've always talked about funding incremental capital with about 50% equity. And if you kind of look at what we did at the end of Q4 plus that $800 million gets you just under 50% equity funding when we look at kind of the two plants together. So I think we're comfortable there for us. Like I said, credit quality and credit strength is important at Xcel and our operating companies. It's important to have access to capital. And so when you look at our current five-year plan going forward, right, that equity financings hold true. And certainly, like I said, if something happens on the clean energy provision, federally, we'll revisit those as that gives us a lot more flexibility in terms of financing. I don't think -- I wouldn't characterize it as any less focus. The corporate development team reports directly to me, and we're in constant discussions with developers. I think a little bit is what you see as we're in a resource plans in our two major jurisdictions, and working through those proceedings and then we have RFPs coming up, and that could be an avenue for developers to bid in potential opportunities within those RFPs. And I think it'd be -- I think our commissions, given that we have those RFPs coming up, that's the preference they had if sitting here today, if we had any projects to bring forward, they'd prefer to see them in those RFPs. But we always focus on it. I've talked -- and I've always talked about it as being opportunistic. And it will be opportunistic because it has to work for our customers. We won't bring forward an opportunity to our commissions if it doesn't save our customers' money. I think longer term, it's beyond this year as we continue to recover, and our sales are still below where we were pre-COVID levels. I think longer term, it's relatively flat with the exception is EV adoption as that starts to increase and pick up, we'll start to see some sales growth. We see our EV goal of 20% of EVs in our service territory by 2030, adding about 7/10th of a percent over a decade. So, I think it's relatively flat until we start to see some more EV penetration in larger numbers over the longer term. Travis, I don't see significant improvement into 2022. One is no rates won't be effective until April on the electric side. You did see us file a gas case here very recently. And we're still -- we do face regulatory lag there with the test year on the electric side really being kind of a midyear '21. So we'll continue to work with our stakeholders and the commissions on that side, but I don't see the ROE improving significantly in 2022. I mean I haven't done that math, but the historical test year, particularly when you're investing significant amount of capital into the system, helping drive this clean energy transition in that historical test year does put some pressure on your earned ROEs. Yes. Thank you all for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions."

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.\nPaul Johnson: Good morning and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2021 third quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today are Bob Frenzel, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Amanda Rome, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and a few others. This morning, we will review our 2021 results, share recent business and regulatory developments, update our capital and financing plan, and provide 2022 guidance. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder, some comments made during today's call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and in our SEC filings. Today, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, including ongoing earnings, electric and natural gas margins. Information on comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in the earnings release. With that, I'll turn over to Bob.\nRobert Frenzel: Thank you, Paul and good morning everybody. Today, we reported solid third quarter earnings of $1.13 per share compared with $1.14 per share last year. And given our strong year-to-date results, we're narrowing our 2021 guidance to $2.94 to $2.98 per share. We're also initiating 2022 guidance of $3.10 to $3.20 per share, which reflects our 5% to 7% long-term EPS growth objective. Consistent with our past tradition, we've updated our base investment plan, reflecting $26 billion of capital expenditures over the next five years, which provides significant benefits to our customers and supports community vitality. This investment plan delivers rate base growth of 6.5% off of a projected 2021 year-end rate base. This plan is robust, but there are certain investment opportunities that are not included in our base plan, including potential renewable generation assets authorized in our Minnesota or Colorado resource plan proceedings and additional transmission capital that's needed to integrate new renewable generation additions in Colorado beyond the base Colorado power pathway proposal. The base plan also does not include any capital for green hydrogen production for our LDC or generation needs, which we believe could be material over the balance of the decade. We have our hydrogen pilot at the Prairie Island nuclear plant, and we're exploring five to eight additional greenfield and brownfield projects. And with favorable state backdrops in Minnesota and in Colorado, which have passed clean fuel legislation as well as a potential for a federal hydrogen production tax credit, we believe that our favorable renewable generation conditions will help us push beyond pilots and into green hydrogen production resources that can be valuable to a clean energy future. I'm very excited about our investment plan, which supports continued execution of our long-term strategy and clean energy leadership. It provides for sustainability of our local communities, enhances reliability and resiliency, advances our fleet transition, keeps customer bills low, and delivers attractive returns for our investors. We're well positioned for sustainable organic growth over the next decade, including renewable additions in our proposed Minnesota and Colorado resource plans and the transmission needed to enable those carbon-free resources. Together, our resource plans are going to add nearly 10,000 megawatts of renewables to our system and achieve an 85% carbon reduction by 2030, while keeping customer bills at or below the rate of inflation. We expect decisions on both the Minnesota and the Colorado resource plans in the first quarter of next year. The clean energy transition is also going to need substantial transmission investment. We continue to make good progress in the Colorado power pathway transmission project, which is essential for us to deliver on our Colorado energy resource plan. It will enable over 5,500 megawatts of new renewables in the state, and it's vital as we explore further western market integration over time. To-date, comments from most parties have been generally supportive, and we expect the commission decision in the first quarter of 2022. In the Midwest, MISO has experienced some minor delays, but we still expect MTEP21 to be announced in the first half of next year. We also had a strong operational quarter. Our industry-leading nuclear fleet set another record, with two units having run over 700 consecutive days prior to their refueling outages. Another highlight this quarter was the dedication of the 300-megawatt Bighorn solar facility at the EVRAZ steel mill in Pueblo, Colorado. In partnership with Lightsource BP and state and local leaders, we've enabled the largest on-site solar array in the country serving a single customer. This is a really creative solution between multiple parties to ensure the continued operation and expansion of the steel mill and its 1,100 employees. It reduces carbon emissions and creates valuable property tax base that helps sustain the local economy. We also continue to partner with our states and OEMs to electrify the transportation sector. This quarter, we implemented new programs for our Colorado customers that will help us to achieve our goal of enabling 1.5 million electric vehicles across our states by 2030. We appreciate the collaboration with so many stakeholders as we collectively work to reduce carbon emissions and enable sustainable communities. We remain well-positioned with a sound strategy, a robust five-year capital plan, and sustainable long-term growth trajectory that provides attractive returns to our investors, while keeping bills low for our customers. These plans are not dependent on changes in federal policy. However, it's our understanding that Biden administration has reached an agreement on a framework for the reconciliation package, which would include extensions for investment tax credits and production tax credits, a solar and a hydrogen production tax credit, a storage and a transmission investment tax credit and direct pay options for all tax credits. This proposed plan creates significant customer benefits by lowering the cost of our proposed resource plans and potentially accelerating our clean energy transition. Our steel for fuel program has demonstrated our geographic advantages in renewables. Proposed tax credit expenses for ITCs and PTCs, including the solar production tax credit, will make future projects even more competitive, providing additional benefit to our customers. Additionally, a direct pay option would provide greater financial flexibility, increased corporate cash flow and credit metrics, which would reduce our financing needs. A PTC for green hydrogen would also bring significant value and technology advancement and costs. It could help accelerate the time frame in which we could begin incorporating hydrogen into power generation and into our natural gas distribution operations at a cost that's more economic for our customers. While discussions continue at the federal level on the final bill, we are optimistic that this plan will be passed and will have significant benefits to our customers. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\nBrian Van Abel: Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. We had a solid third quarter, recording $1.13 per share compared with $1.14 per share last year. On a year-to-date basis, our earnings are $0.13 per share ahead of last year. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter include the following; higher electric and natural gas margins increased earnings by $0.04 per share primarily driven by riders and regulatory outcomes to recover our capital investments. Lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.02 per share. And in addition, the lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.01 per share. As a reminder, production tax credits lowered the ETR. However, PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin and are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation expense, which reduced earnings by $0.03 per share reflecting our capital investment program. Lower AFUDC decreased earnings by $0.02 per share, largely due to placing several large wind farms into service last year and other items combined to reduce earnings by $0.03 per share. Turning to sales. Weather-adjusted electric sales increased by 2.4% in the third quarter, while our year-to-date electric sales increased 1.9%. Given our year-to-date results and the continued economic rebound in our states, we're updating our full year weather-adjusted electric sales growth to approximately 1.5% to 2%. Shifting to expenses. O&M expenses declined 1.9% for the quarter and increased 2.6% on a year-to-date basis. Quarterly O&M expense comparisons are noisy with the COVID impacts from last year, but overall, we expect our O&M expenses to increase approximately 1% for the year. Turning to regulatory, we reached a comprehensive settlement in Colorado, and are making strong progress on potential Texas rate case settlement. As a reminder, last quarter we reached constructive settlements in our Wisconsin, New Mexico and North Dakota rate cases. In October, we reached a comprehensive settlement with the Colorado staff in the Colorado Energy office that proposes to resolve several regulatory proceedings. Key terms include: we will fully recover all Winter Storm Uri deferred fuel costs over 24 months for electric and over 30 months from the natural gas LDC customers, with no carrying charges through a rider. Please note, the Uri Storm cost estimate for Colorado was revised to $550 million. We will refund to electric customers approximately $41 million of previously deferred revenue associated with the 2020 decoupling program. We'll forgo recovery of approximately $14 million of replacement power costs incurred due to an extended Comanche three outage during 2020. And we will not seek recovery of approximately $11 million of deferred COVID-19 bad debt expense. We are pleased that we were able to reach this comprehensive settlement, which represents compromises from all the parties and take steps to mitigate the customer impact of the Uri cost recovery. We expect a commission decision in the first half of 2022. In terms of pending rate cases, we are making progress in settlement discussions in our Texas case. As a result, the hearing schedule has been abated, and we are hopeful that we'll ultimately be able to reach a settlement agreement. We expect a decision on our Colorado electric case in March of next year with new rates effective in April. As a reminder, we're seeking a net rate increase of approximately $343 million based on an ROE of 10% and equity ratio of 55.6% in the 2022 forecast test year. The case is largely driven by capital investment. In October, we filed the Minnesota electric rate case seeking a net increase of $677 million over three years. The filing is based on a requested ROE of 10.2% and equity ratio of 52.5% in forecast test years. We requested interim rates of $288 million to be implemented in January 2022. Finally, we plan to file a Minnesota gas rate case in early November with interim rates going into effect in January of 2022. We also plan to file a stay-out option as we look to help mitigate bill impacts of Uri cost recovery for our customers. As Bob mentioned, we have issued a robust $26 billion 5-year capital forecast, which is detailed in our earnings release. Our base capital plan results in rate base growth of approximately 6.5% using 2021 as a base. The base forecast reflects significant grid investment in our Colorado power pathway proposal and other transmission system investments to maintain asset health and reliability and enable renewable generation. The plan reflects a modest level of renewables including our proposed Sherco solar facility. It also includes two natural gas peaking plants to ensure reliability as we retire coal plants, along with investments to improve the customer experience. Beyond our base capital forecast, we anticipate potential incremental capital investment for renewables associated with the Minnesota and Colorado resource plans. Our proposed resource plans include approximately 2,000 megawatts of renewable additions from 2024 to 2026, which would result in incremental capital investment of $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion, assuming 50% ownership. In addition, we anticipate the need for incremental $500 million to $1 billion of related transmission for the Colorado IRP. Combined, we could see a potential incremental investment to support the clean energy transition of $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion in the latter part of this five-year forecast. We've also updated our financing plan, which reflects a combination of internal cash generation and debt issuances to fund the majority of our capital expenditures. We expect to issue $800 million of equity and $450 million of DRIP and benefits equity over the next five years. The financing plan maintains our current credit metrics and strong balance sheet, which is important for maintaining a low cost of capital for our customers. We expect the equity would likely be issued through an ATM over the five years. We anticipate that any incremental capital would be financed with approximately 50% equity and 50% debt. This incremental equity will allow us to fund accretive capital investments, which will benefit our customers while maintaining our solid credit ratings and favorable access to the capital markets. However, our equity needs could be significantly reduced if the reconciliation package is passed with the current framework. Shifting to earnings, we are initiating our 2022 earnings guidance range of $3.10 to $3.20 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%. Key assumptions are detailed in our earnings release. In addition, we've updated the base of our growth rate to $2.96 per share, which represents the midpoint of our revised 2021 guidance range. This represents 6.5% growth in the base between 2020 and 2021. With that, I'll wrap-up with a quick summary. We reached a comprehensive settlement in Colorado that resolved several regulatory proceedings. We are making progress towards the settlement of our Texas rate case. We narrowed our 2021 guidance range to $2.94 to $2.98 per share. We announced a robust updated capital investment program that provides strong, transparent rate base growth and customer value. We initiated 2022 earnings guidance consistent with our long-term growth objective. And finally, we remain confident we can deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within the upper half of our 5% to 7% objective range as we continue leading the clean energy transition and keeping bills low for our customers. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.\nRobert Frenzel: Hey Jeremy\nBrian Van Abel: Good morning Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: Thanks. I just want to start off on the load side, if I could. What types of customers drove the C&I growth there? And how did residential perform relative to your expectations heading into the quarter? Just trying to see how you think these respective classes would be trending into 2022, particularly with retained residential load.\nBrian Van Abel: Yes, so I think residential has been stickier than the, call it, forecasted going into this year. And we expected to give back some of the, call it, the residential gains that we saw last year, but it's been sticky. If you look at a year-to-date basis, residential is up 1.8%. So, I think that's -- that was one of the big drivers of our updated guidance for the year. And a lot of that is in Colorado, if you look at where Colorado has been. We also see strong customer growth on the residential side across all of our service territories. Residential permits or building permits are significantly up. On the C&I side, I think it's -- we're really seeing good rebound in -- across all C&I sectors in our opcos. But really, the Permian Basin is coming back. We focus a lot on what's happening with our oil and gas customers in SPS. And we look at some substations that directly serve those loads, and that load is up 25% even relative to pre-pandemic levels. And so we're hearing our -- those customers are disciplined, but continue to drill. And also, they're looking at electrification. They're feeling ESG pressure and that is a big focus on electrifying drill rigs, pumps, compressors, certainly good load growth for us. So, I think we're pleasantly surprised with the strength of our sales and confident that it will continue into next year.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. And just on residential for next year, do you expect more kind of a give back? Or have we kind of hit a new normal as far as kind of partial work from home, what have you?\nBrian Van Abel: I think we expect a slow give back. I think there'll be an amount of stickiness long term that will be there as you think about return to work, and I'll give you our example. We have a telecommuting policy for our employees when they come back to work. so they'll be able to work from home on a part-time basis. And I think we'll see that stickiness for a long time, but I do think it will start to come down from last year and this year a little bit.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it, that's helpful. Certainly, the Northern Delaware there and New Mexico, really a lot of activity, good to see it coming through for you there. And then I just want to pivot, I guess, it's a bit early for MISO's MTEP process. But just wondering what your current thoughts are, what you might be able to say as far as the first wave of projects that could come out there. Could you frame your expectations of the timing of the release, the volume of the investments expected, potential start/completion of project announced.\nRobert Frenzel: Hey Jeremy, it's Bob. I agree that the analysis and the output of MTEP21 has been probably slower than we expected. We do expect a series of MTEPs over the next number of years that will continue to highlight the need for transmission expansion in the upper Midwest. My expectations for 2021 are reasonable maybe modest. I think we'll see more in 2022 and 2023. I think the time line for construction is probably at the very tail of this five-year plan, but probably more in the back half of the decade for these projects. It's going to take a while to get through once you file the proceeding. It's going to take a while to get through permitting and things like that, and then actual construction. So, probably outside of our five-year forecast, but really in the five to 10 years after that.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Just one last one, if I could. For the incremental CapEx, how do you expect line of sight to develop here as the IRP process continues? Could the opportunity be fully defined in 2022? Or do you expect it to take more time?\nBrian Van Abel: Yes, I expect 2022 for it to really shape up. Call it a year from now, we should have a real good clarity. Q1 of next year, we expect the Phase 1s of those resource plans in both Minnesota and in Colorado to be approved by their commissions and -- with a substantial amount of renewable opportunity and growth in each of our jurisdictions, as I highlighted in my prepared remarks. We'll go through Phase two processes through Q2 and Q3 of next year, and we expect to be back here next year having some pretty good clarity on the outcomes.\nRobert Frenzel: And for clarification, Phase two is the request for proposal to determine how much is PPA versus BOTs and ownership.\nJeremy Tonet: That\u2019s very helpful. That\u2019s it for me. Thanks.\nRobert Frenzel: Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nInsoo Kim: Thank you. My first question, and apologies if I missed it, is on the Minnesota side of things for Uri cost recovery process. Where are we in that process? And similar to what you got on the Colorado side, do you think that there is a potential for a constructive settlement there?\nBrian Van Abel: Yes. So, Insoo, this is Brian. So, in terms of Uri in Minnesota, the commission has approved recovery of the cost over 27 months, subject to a prudency review. There is some disputed amounts. If you remember, the Department of Commerce disputed about $20 million of our costs and the OAG disputed about $34 million of our costs. So, we'll work through that proceeding. We'd expect to see intervenor testimony late December and then a commission decision mid-next year. Now, we feel like we've acted prudently and filed commission-approved hedging policies. And we feel good about working through the process of the commission and expect to reach a constructive outcome.\nInsoo Kim: Got it. And a second question just a little bit longer term, maybe for Bob. You're seeing a lot of other utilities in their generation transformation plan, putting out time line for coal retirement from the 2030s and even 2040 period to the late 2020s and whatnot. I know in your Colorado and Minnesota jurisdictions, you have the IRPs that have been filed that are -- that call for acceleration and have robust plans in place. But just how much further acceleration opportunity do you think is possible, given the current regulatory frameworks that are in place? And maybe from a financial and reliability perspective as well, and what other helper items do you think are needed to that could further support acceleration?\nRobert Frenzel: Yes, that's a great question. And look, we've been a leader in coal plant transitions over the last decade. And we expect, over the next decade, to close the majority of the coal plants on our systems across the country. We'll be out of coal in the Upper Midwest by the end of this decade. We're -- we have plans and approved plans to close a coal plant almost every single year this decade, which we've done a great job of transitioning to communities and the employees as part of that program. Our philosophy has been long runways, Insoo, making sure that we take care of the communities, the property tax base. We get a chance to do economic development and bring businesses back to those communities that have supported us and those assets for decades. So, with the proposal on the table for production tax credits that are part of the reconciliation bill, I think you're going to see with a 10-year window, we've got a long runway to manage this transition. And I think for the company, we are going to potentially accelerate areas that might have been a bit behind, as best we can. But these resource plans are very much in the works. And so we expect to work through these resource plans, and we file about every three years. So, come 2024, so we'd have another bite at the apple to think about the remaining assets on our fleet in those transitions. I think at the core, though, we need to identify that next generation of generation. We were the first company to announce we'd be carbon-free by 2050. I think what we need is another type of emissions-free generation. And I think the infrastructure bill triples DOE funding for research and development. I think that's critical for the industry to progress past where we expect to be, which is about an 80%, 85% carbon reduction by the end of the decade.\nInsoo Kim: That makes sense. Thank you so much.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey good morning team. Thanks for the time. Perhaps just a pickup on the reconciliation \nRobert Frenzel: Hey Julien.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey good morning. Maybe just a pickup on the reconciliation point. I wanted to follow-up on this. Just how are you thinking about the potential for expanding repowering here, depending on the various combinations on PTCs here? I mean, it seems like your position might be particularly enviable when it comes to leveraging an expanded PTC. Could you elaborate a little bit more specifically on some of the opportunities that could emerge there? I mean, I know we've been talking about repowering in various forms here for a bit.\nRobert Frenzel: Yes. Look, repowering is a great opportunity for us. We've been leaders in wind for 15 years. So, we've got some assets that have moved past their PTC dates, and we've got a lot of wind on our system already. We have four repowerings underway already that were approved as part of the R&R plan here in Minnesota. And I think that this bill again, which lacks a lot of definition and clarity but would provide people who've owned wind for a long time to repower those assets. So, we haven't delved into the details on our side on our legacy assets and what this would open up for repowering, but I think the opportunity could be pretty substantial.\nBrian Van Abel: Yes. And I think if you -- Julien, this is Brian. You heard me talk before. If you look at our PPA buyout strategy as particularly the ones who have been successful have been on the wind side where we bought them out and repowered them. So, I think a long-term extension of wind PTCs, even solar PTCs, new solar PTCs longer term, open up that PPA buyout opportunity or kind of just extend the runway for that longer term, right? We're obviously opportunistic, and you got to make it work for the customers and show a customer benefit and make it work from a financial perspective. But I think that's a longer-term opportunity that this reconciliation package in a 10-year extension of credit springs.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it, excellent. And then I mean at risk of staying on the subject of reconciliation here, can you elaborate is there anything else that you all are looking at particularly closely and scrutinizing in terms of potential angles for you all specifically here? I mean, I know we talked about transmission a little bit ago, perhaps maybe elsewhere. What else are you seeing in that reconciliation bill that could really move the needle beyond the PTC in front of us?\nRobert Frenzel: Yes. Look, I think the bill lacks a lot of clarity. And our understanding even towards the goal line, we were putting in $100 billion or so of government infrastructure proposals that lack a lot of clarity from our side. But I see real opportunity in hydrogen, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, storage and transmission with potential development, and obviously with the potential for a nuclear production tax credit, you're talking about significant opportunities on the customer bill side as our plants run through the next decades we've applied for in the Minnesota resource plan. So, opportunities are out there. We really honestly, without a lot of clarity on the bills, lack some definition, but that's the stuff we're going to be working on through the course of the next couple of months, and then we'll have more clarity as we get more insight into the bill text.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes. No, I appreciate your prepared remarks. But it sounds like -- just to clarify that, on the nuclear front, it sounds like you could potentially tap into that depending exactly on how it's framed here for your regulated assets.\nRobert Frenzel: That's correct, yes.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent, good to hear. All right. Well, I'll pass it on. Thank you guys very much.\nRobert Frenzel: Thanks Julien.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nSteve Fleishman: Hey good morning. So, just I think, Brian, you said in your remarks that your equity needs could be lower if reconciliation passes. Could you explain that more?\nBrian Van Abel: Yes absolutely, Steve. I said that could significantly be reduced if the current framework passes. Now it's still a little light on details in terms of what gets passed. But you see we have $1.2 billion of equity in our plan, and you could see that cut significantly down, right? The direct pay opportunity reduces, call it, the tax inefficiency and provides probably, call it, 75 to 100 basis points of improved cash flow. And so we look at that and what we can do from a financing perspective. It gives us a lot of opportunity to reduce those equity needs. So, we're pretty excited about the overall plan, really good from customers. And we look at that long-term tax credit extension and what that can do for our customers.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. And then I know this is also -- sorry, same topic. I know it's early, but the -- it looks like they've added the provision of a minimum corporate tax of 15% on larger companies like yours. And I think renewables credits are excluded from that, which is good, but I don't know if there might be other issues related to that for you. So, could you talk a little bit about how to think about that provision? And I think bonus went away with the Trump changes, but just thoughts on that issue and whether that could be a pressure?\nBrian Van Abel: Yes. So, it's a new regime, and we spent the last -- yesterday looking through the legislative tax and assessing that. And we think it's, for us, very manageable in terms of -- really it's -- the way it's qualified is a book alternative minimum tax, so different than the old AMT that existed. But overall, we feel comfortable with how it work and we can manage through it. And so when we look at the overall package, we view it as very positive for us. So, -- but again, like I said, it's a new regime and details will continue to come out, but that's our initial read on it.\nSteve Fleishman: Great, that's very helpful. Last question, just high level, you obviously have the two big rate cases, Minnesota, Colorado. You've had a lot of success in regulatory for a while now. I guess the one thing that might be different today is just there are a lot of upward rate pressures. Those are decent-sized rate filings. There's fuel costs are rising and Uri and things like that. Just could you talk about does this make that different this time?\nRobert Frenzel: Steve, it's Bob and thanks for the question. One of the key tenets of our strategy is affordability for our customers. You hear how resource planning will drive over the long-term, continued transitions in renewables that will drive customer bills relatively lower. We always work for ways to mitigate the customer impacts. These cases are largely capital cases under approved capital investment plans. And we have deferred -- at least in the Minnesota side, for over six years, we haven't had a case. And we've offered ways to mitigate some of the impacts of this case in particular. If you remember, we deferred cases throughout the pandemic and feel like we've been very judicious in watching our O&M expenses and trying to continue the investment plans that drive a clean energy transition, but ultimately end up in investing in capital that will ultimately need to get recovered. So, our plans, we've offered mitigation on interim rates. We think that the bill increases are manageable. I think under the proposal, we'd be down at about $1.25 a month for residential customers, so I think very manageable in total bill impacts. And so other areas we improve, we work hard on, if you think about our steel for fuel program and the success of adding wind in the Upper Midwest that -- we talked about this at the outset, but that addition of those megawatts has provided a natural gas hedge. We think we saved our customers over $300 million per year by having wind blowing instead of procuring natural gas on the margin. So, a very successful steel for fuel program, which doesn't necessarily show up, but it's mitigated bills over the last years and certainly with this uptick in natural gas pricing.\nSteve Fleishman: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey good morning. Thank you for taking my question.\nRobert Frenzel: Good morning.\nDurgesh Chopra: You've answered, I guess, all the questions I had. Maybe just elaborate a little bit on the last point you made about natural gas prices? Obviously, you've had a ton of discussions with investors on that front. So perhaps your hedges, your gas assets how are they placed, impact on customer bills, anything that you can share with us?\nBrian Van Abel: Yes. So, really -- Bob's point was really around our own wind investments providing significant fuel reductions. And if we look at what the cost would have been had we not had those wind farms, it would have been a $300 million higher impact to our customers on a year-to-date basis this year. So that's really what Bob's point is. I think the broader question is around kind of how these higher commodity costs potentially impact our customers. And when we think about it on the electric side. I think we're really well positioned, right? Bob already made the point about our wind strategy, our steel for fuel strategy. But also look, right, natural gas is a relatively small portion of the overall customer bills on the electric side. And we also have length. And you look at in NSP and SPS, this is something that doesn't quite come through clearly, but we've had light this year and we can sell into the market. And we've provided over $300 million in market sales that we credit back to our customers and help offset some of those higher commodity costs. So, I think we're really well-positioned on the electric side and don't see a significant impact on our customers. On the LDC side, certainly, there's less you can do there, given that commodity costs are a higher portion of our customers' bill. But the -- on the -- going into the winter, right, we have physical storage. We have financial products. And so I think we're -- when we look at it for -- take Colorado for example, I think our forecast for an impact, the average impact on the residential customer bill is about $15 per month for this winter. So, we think it's manageable, but we obviously look for every opportunity we can to help mitigate these customer bill impacts.\nDurgesh Chopra: Thanks. The $15. Did you 1-5 dollar per month, right?\nBrian Van Abel: 1-5, yes, not 5-0.\nDurgesh Chopra: Yes. So what would that be percentage-wise?\nBrian Van Abel: It's about 20% over the -- in the winter months.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. Thank you so much.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nSophie Karp: Hi, good morning and thank you for taking my question. Maybe a couple of housekeeping items, if I may. You guys are showing some equity needs in your financing plan for 2026. Can you give us some color on what shape and form those might come in as? And what should we expect in terms of timing?\nBrian Van Abel: Yes, I think we show -- we get about $450 million of equity through our dividend reinvestment benefits program. So, that's -- and then the other piece, we say $800 million, that's likely we do it through an at-the-market program, just through an ATM. We have flexibility over that five-year timeframe as we look at our capital needs.\nRobert Frenzel: Sophie, if you're -- if you want for modeling purpose, you could kind of assume something ratable assuming -- again, assuming that the -- that could be significantly reduced through a direct pay program that could potentially be approved by the government by year end.\nSophie Karp: Got it. And then just overall, the CapEx is going higher, right? And so how should we think about the rate base growth in this scenario? And I can appreciate there's lots of puts and takes here with uncertainties with what the Washington is going to do. But in general, how should we think about that and the corresponding kind of regulatory lag and earnings growth with this new forecast? And if you guys are not prepared to talk about this now, like when do you think you will roll out those numbers?\nBrian Van Abel: Yes. No, I think we're pretty excited about our new capital plan. I think we -- as Bob mentioned, it drives a lot of benefit for our customers. And it's -- based off of our kind of 2021 rate basis, it will afford us a 6.5% rate base growth for our five-year plan. And then if you look at that, call it, potential incremental capital that we need on the transmission system and some renewables that could come out of the resource plans, that could push north of 7%, to about 7.3% if we executed on that. And a lot of this, right, depending on the type of capital, it could be recovered through riders if it's transmission or renewables or built into our multiyear plan in Colorado. So, we're comfortable with the overall capital plan and have kind of plans in place to address the regulatory recovery of it.\nRobert Frenzel: And Sophie, if you look at the slides we do detailed rate base growth by year. So, if you want to see that, you can check that out.\nSophie Karp: Got it. Thank you. And lastly, if I may, on Colorado. So, a pretty good outcome I guess with the settlement there on the fuel cost recovery. Should we think about potentially that opening the door on the settlement in the rate case you have there or is it too early to say?\nRobert Frenzel: Well, I think you're hitting on one of the key points of the settlement. I mean we put four proceedings behind us as part of the settlement so that we could get to the more strategic conversation, Sophie. The power pathway and the resource plan are certainly right in front of us and ripe for fourth quarter conversations. And then as you mentioned, longer term the electric rate case in Colorado could also be in there. So, yes, I think what it says is we've got pathways to settlement in Colorado, we can reach constructive outcomes, we wanted to clear the underbrush a bit and get to the bigger and more strategic issues.\nSophie Karp: Thank you. I appreciate the comments. I'll jump back into the queue.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Travis Miller with Morningstar. Please go ahead. Please go ahead.\nTravis Miller: Good morning. Thank you.\nRobert Frenzel: Hey Travis.\nBrian Van Abel: Hey Travis.\nTravis Miller: I wanted to kind of build on the customer affordability and rate-making a little bit. If you look holistically across all the regulatory rate-making proposals and such that you have out there, and we put kind of buckets around those components of the allowed ROE or cost of capital, another bucket being operating cost recovery, another bucket being CapEx, where are you seeing the most pushback in terms of keeping customer bill affordable on that?\nBrian Van Abel: I think ROE has always been, call it, an area of dispute in the rate case, right? So, I think that -- I don't think that's unique to us. I think that's pretty common across other utilities. That's one of the big levers that they look at in determining what the appropriate ROE is. Now, we feel pretty good that from where we stand, our ROEs that have been authorized over the past few years have been below the national average. So, when we think about ROE risk there, we think of more potential upside and getting closer to the national average, right, as we know we're leading the clean energy transition, helping our states lead with their policy goals. So, I think there's an opportunity there for us on the ROE side. Now, for us, I think we're pretty proud about our O&M story. Now, if you go all the way back to 2014 and look at where we are today, we're basically flat from an O&M perspective. So, we saved -- if you just apply the 2% inflation growth in that number, maybe several hundred millions of dollars that we've avoided and saved our customers annually. So, I think -- overall, I think we have a really clean story. Our cases are primarily capital-driven, investing in the needs of the system. So, I think overall -- obviously, you have sometimes just lumpy if you hadn't filed a case in six years, and it comes a big headline number. But we look forward to working with our parties and the commissions on working through these rate cases and really delivering a great product in the end.\nRobert Frenzel: Hey Travis, it's Bob. Just one more thing to add on to what Brian said, which I completely agree with. We've got -- and I mentioned this earlier, we've got such a favorable renewables regime where we sit that we've been able to both mitigate commodity increases, whether that's coal or natural gas over time, deliver on our steel for fuel premise and drive the fuel component of customer bills down and provide sort of a mitigant in terms of volatility. And that provides real value both on the residential side. But when you talk to our industrial customers, stability and predictability is what they really want as they're making investments in their own business. And by being able to have a favorable regime for that, we can deliver renewables at significantly more beneficial cost than a lot of the country. And that's helped mitigate our total bills for all of our customer classes.\nTravis Miller: Okay, great. I really appreciate it and you had answered all my other questions.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.\nPaul Patterson: Hey, good morning.\nRobert Frenzel: Hey Paul.\nBrian Van Abel: Good morning.\nPaul Patterson: Just really quick clarification question on, I guess it's Jeremy. The just on a high level, that 1% sales growth -- and I realize that it's been shifting around and what have you. Of course, we've had COVID. But just going forward at 2022, just from my understanding, would you say that 1% is kind of what you see as being now a new normal number? Not so much between the classes of customers, just a general projection in 2023, et cetera. Do you think that that's sort of your new run rate in terms of sales growth?\nBrian Van Abel: I think it might be looking beyond 2022. I think 2022, we're still starting to see still a little bit of a rebound from the depths of COVID. So, I don't know if that's a full 1%, probably between 0% and 1% on a longer five-year forecast. I think that's -- there's upside opportunities. I'll hedge when I give that number. There's upside opportunities, right, from electric vehicles. And we're just getting into the discussion of beneficial electrification. So, I think longer term, there's a lot of opportunities on the electric sales side. But I think for this front 5, you're probably talking in the 0% to 1% after 2022.\nPaul Patterson: Okay, that's great. And then in terms of inflation, no change in that since we talked about it last quarter, so I don't want to go over it again. But unless there has been a change in your outlook, has there been any change or any new thoughts about it?\nBrian Van Abel: No, but I mean I'm sure you read the same headlines as we all do with the near-term inflationary pressures. But no real changes from our commentary in Q2 as we think about it longer term.\nPaul Patterson: Got you. Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Ashar Khan with Verition. Please go ahead.\nAshar Khan: Hi, good morning. If I heard correctly in response to Steve's question you said that if this reconciliation bill passes and the direct payout provision, that you can eliminate most of your equity needs of $1.1 billion that you have in the plan. Is that accurate? I just want to reconcile.\nBrian Van Abel: No, I said we could significantly reduce our equity needs.\nAshar Khan: Significantly. Okay, significantly is more than 50%?\nBrian Van Abel: I think significantly is significantly. And we do -- we really have to see the details of this plan, right? It's a framework, and the details are light. So, once we get through all the nuts and bolts of it, we'll come back. Assuming it gets passed, which we are optimistic that it gets passed, we'll come back with the full details on it.\nAshar Khan: Okay, okay. So, but then if that significantly happens hopefully, then that should imply a higher growth rate because we have less dilution. Is that -- would that be a reasonable assumption, one leading to the other?\nBrian Van Abel: There are some puts and takes. You could see a little bit lower rate base growth depending on the details of it. So, there's puts and takes, but I think overall, we're positive about where the reconciliation package stands, both for our customers and for us as a company.\nAshar Khan: As -- okay, as shareholders. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: It appears there are no further questions. at this time. I'd like to turn the conference to CFO, Brian Van Abel for any additional or closing remarks.\nBrian Van Abel: Yes, thank you all for participating in our earnings call this morning. With any questions, please contact our Investor Relations team.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Robert Frenzel",
            "content": "Thank you, Paul and good morning everybody. Today, we reported solid third quarter earnings of $1.13 per share compared with $1.14 per share last year. And given our strong year-to-date results, we're narrowing our 2021 guidance to $2.94 to $2.98 per share. We're also initiating 2022 guidance of $3.10 to $3.20 per share, which reflects our 5% to 7% long-term EPS growth objective. Consistent with our past tradition, we've updated our base investment plan, reflecting $26 billion of capital expenditures over the next five years, which provides significant benefits to our customers and supports community vitality. This investment plan delivers rate base growth of 6.5% off of a projected 2021 year-end rate base. This plan is robust, but there are certain investment opportunities that are not included in our base plan, including potential renewable generation assets authorized in our Minnesota or Colorado resource plan proceedings and additional transmission capital that's needed to integrate new renewable generation additions in Colorado beyond the base Colorado power pathway proposal. The base plan also does not include any capital for green hydrogen production for our LDC or generation needs, which we believe could be material over the balance of the decade. We have our hydrogen pilot at the Prairie Island nuclear plant, and we're exploring five to eight additional greenfield and brownfield projects. And with favorable state backdrops in Minnesota and in Colorado, which have passed clean fuel legislation as well as a potential for a federal hydrogen production tax credit, we believe that our favorable renewable generation conditions will help us push beyond pilots and into green hydrogen production resources that can be valuable to a clean energy future. I'm very excited about our investment plan, which supports continued execution of our long-term strategy and clean energy leadership. It provides for sustainability of our local communities, enhances reliability and resiliency, advances our fleet transition, keeps customer bills low, and delivers attractive returns for our investors. We're well positioned for sustainable organic growth over the next decade, including renewable additions in our proposed Minnesota and Colorado resource plans and the transmission needed to enable those carbon-free resources. Together, our resource plans are going to add nearly 10,000 megawatts of renewables to our system and achieve an 85% carbon reduction by 2030, while keeping customer bills at or below the rate of inflation. We expect decisions on both the Minnesota and the Colorado resource plans in the first quarter of next year. The clean energy transition is also going to need substantial transmission investment. We continue to make good progress in the Colorado power pathway transmission project, which is essential for us to deliver on our Colorado energy resource plan. It will enable over 5,500 megawatts of new renewables in the state, and it's vital as we explore further western market integration over time. To-date, comments from most parties have been generally supportive, and we expect the commission decision in the first quarter of 2022. In the Midwest, MISO has experienced some minor delays, but we still expect MTEP21 to be announced in the first half of next year. We also had a strong operational quarter. Our industry-leading nuclear fleet set another record, with two units having run over 700 consecutive days prior to their refueling outages. Another highlight this quarter was the dedication of the 300-megawatt Bighorn solar facility at the EVRAZ steel mill in Pueblo, Colorado. In partnership with Lightsource BP and state and local leaders, we've enabled the largest on-site solar array in the country serving a single customer. This is a really creative solution between multiple parties to ensure the continued operation and expansion of the steel mill and its 1,100 employees. It reduces carbon emissions and creates valuable property tax base that helps sustain the local economy. We also continue to partner with our states and OEMs to electrify the transportation sector. This quarter, we implemented new programs for our Colorado customers that will help us to achieve our goal of enabling 1.5 million electric vehicles across our states by 2030. We appreciate the collaboration with so many stakeholders as we collectively work to reduce carbon emissions and enable sustainable communities. We remain well-positioned with a sound strategy, a robust five-year capital plan, and sustainable long-term growth trajectory that provides attractive returns to our investors, while keeping bills low for our customers. These plans are not dependent on changes in federal policy. However, it's our understanding that Biden administration has reached an agreement on a framework for the reconciliation package, which would include extensions for investment tax credits and production tax credits, a solar and a hydrogen production tax credit, a storage and a transmission investment tax credit and direct pay options for all tax credits. This proposed plan creates significant customer benefits by lowering the cost of our proposed resource plans and potentially accelerating our clean energy transition. Our steel for fuel program has demonstrated our geographic advantages in renewables. Proposed tax credit expenses for ITCs and PTCs, including the solar production tax credit, will make future projects even more competitive, providing additional benefit to our customers. Additionally, a direct pay option would provide greater financial flexibility, increased corporate cash flow and credit metrics, which would reduce our financing needs. A PTC for green hydrogen would also bring significant value and technology advancement and costs. It could help accelerate the time frame in which we could begin incorporating hydrogen into power generation and into our natural gas distribution operations at a cost that's more economic for our customers. While discussions continue at the federal level on the final bill, we are optimistic that this plan will be passed and will have significant benefits to our customers. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian. Hey Jeremy Hey Jeremy, it's Bob. I agree that the analysis and the output of MTEP21 has been probably slower than we expected. We do expect a series of MTEPs over the next number of years that will continue to highlight the need for transmission expansion in the upper Midwest. My expectations for 2021 are reasonable maybe modest. I think we'll see more in 2022 and 2023. I think the time line for construction is probably at the very tail of this five-year plan, but probably more in the back half of the decade for these projects. It's going to take a while to get through once you file the proceeding. It's going to take a while to get through permitting and things like that, and then actual construction. So, probably outside of our five-year forecast, but really in the five to 10 years after that. And for clarification, Phase two is the request for proposal to determine how much is PPA versus BOTs and ownership. Thank you. Yes, that's a great question. And look, we've been a leader in coal plant transitions over the last decade. And we expect, over the next decade, to close the majority of the coal plants on our systems across the country. We'll be out of coal in the Upper Midwest by the end of this decade. We're -- we have plans and approved plans to close a coal plant almost every single year this decade, which we've done a great job of transitioning to communities and the employees as part of that program. Our philosophy has been long runways, Insoo, making sure that we take care of the communities, the property tax base. We get a chance to do economic development and bring businesses back to those communities that have supported us and those assets for decades. So, with the proposal on the table for production tax credits that are part of the reconciliation bill, I think you're going to see with a 10-year window, we've got a long runway to manage this transition. And I think for the company, we are going to potentially accelerate areas that might have been a bit behind, as best we can. But these resource plans are very much in the works. And so we expect to work through these resource plans, and we file about every three years. So, come 2024, so we'd have another bite at the apple to think about the remaining assets on our fleet in those transitions. I think at the core, though, we need to identify that next generation of generation. We were the first company to announce we'd be carbon-free by 2050. I think what we need is another type of emissions-free generation. And I think the infrastructure bill triples DOE funding for research and development. I think that's critical for the industry to progress past where we expect to be, which is about an 80%, 85% carbon reduction by the end of the decade. Hey Julien. Yes. Look, repowering is a great opportunity for us. We've been leaders in wind for 15 years. So, we've got some assets that have moved past their PTC dates, and we've got a lot of wind on our system already. We have four repowerings underway already that were approved as part of the R&R plan here in Minnesota. And I think that this bill again, which lacks a lot of definition and clarity but would provide people who've owned wind for a long time to repower those assets. So, we haven't delved into the details on our side on our legacy assets and what this would open up for repowering, but I think the opportunity could be pretty substantial. Yes. Look, I think the bill lacks a lot of clarity. And our understanding even towards the goal line, we were putting in $100 billion or so of government infrastructure proposals that lack a lot of clarity from our side. But I see real opportunity in hydrogen, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, storage and transmission with potential development, and obviously with the potential for a nuclear production tax credit, you're talking about significant opportunities on the customer bill side as our plants run through the next decades we've applied for in the Minnesota resource plan. So, opportunities are out there. We really honestly, without a lot of clarity on the bills, lack some definition, but that's the stuff we're going to be working on through the course of the next couple of months, and then we'll have more clarity as we get more insight into the bill text. That's correct, yes. Thanks Julien. Steve, it's Bob and thanks for the question. One of the key tenets of our strategy is affordability for our customers. You hear how resource planning will drive over the long-term, continued transitions in renewables that will drive customer bills relatively lower. We always work for ways to mitigate the customer impacts. These cases are largely capital cases under approved capital investment plans.

The power pathway and the resource plan are certainly right in front of us and ripe for fourth quarter conversations. And then as you mentioned, longer term the electric rate case in Colorado could also be in there. So, yes, I think what it says is we've got pathways to settlement in Colorado, we can reach constructive outcomes, we wanted to clear the underbrush a bit and get to the bigger and more strategic issues. Hey Travis. Hey Travis, it's Bob. Just one more thing to add on to what Brian said, which I completely agree with.

            "name": "Brian Van Abel",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. We had a solid third quarter, recording $1.13 per share compared with $1.14 per share last year. On a year-to-date basis, our earnings are $0.13 per share ahead of last year. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter include the following; higher electric and natural gas margins increased earnings by $0.04 per share primarily driven by riders and regulatory outcomes to recover our capital investments. Lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.02 per share. And in addition, the lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.01 per share. As a reminder, production tax credits lowered the ETR. However, PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin and are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation expense, which reduced earnings by $0.03 per share reflecting our capital investment program. Lower AFUDC decreased earnings by $0.02 per share, largely due to placing several large wind farms into service last year and other items combined to reduce earnings by $0.03 per share. Turning to sales. Weather-adjusted electric sales increased by 2.4% in the third quarter, while our year-to-date electric sales increased 1.9%. Given our year-to-date results and the continued economic rebound in our states, we're updating our full year weather-adjusted electric sales growth to approximately 1.5% to 2%. Shifting to expenses. O&M expenses declined 1.9% for the quarter and increased 2.6% on a year-to-date basis. Quarterly O&M expense comparisons are noisy with the COVID impacts from last year, but overall, we expect our O&M expenses to increase approximately 1% for the year. Turning to regulatory, we reached a comprehensive settlement in Colorado, and are making strong progress on potential Texas rate case settlement. As a reminder, last quarter we reached constructive settlements in our Wisconsin, New Mexico and North Dakota rate cases. In October, we reached a comprehensive settlement with the Colorado staff in the Colorado Energy office that proposes to resolve several regulatory proceedings. Key terms include: we will fully recover all Winter Storm Uri deferred fuel costs over 24 months for electric and over 30 months from the natural gas LDC customers, with no carrying charges through a rider. Please note, the Uri Storm cost estimate for Colorado was revised to $550 million. We will refund to electric customers approximately $41 million of previously deferred revenue associated with the 2020 decoupling program. We'll forgo recovery of approximately $14 million of replacement power costs incurred due to an extended Comanche three outage during 2020. And we will not seek recovery of approximately $11 million of deferred COVID-19 bad debt expense. We are pleased that we were able to reach this comprehensive settlement, which represents compromises from all the parties and take steps to mitigate the customer impact of the Uri cost recovery. We expect a commission decision in the first half of 2022. In terms of pending rate cases, we are making progress in settlement discussions in our Texas case. As a result, the hearing schedule has been abated, and we are hopeful that we'll ultimately be able to reach a settlement agreement. We expect a decision on our Colorado electric case in March of next year with new rates effective in April. As a reminder, we're seeking a net rate increase of approximately $343 million based on an ROE of 10% and equity ratio of 55.6% in the 2022 forecast test year. The case is largely driven by capital investment. In October, we filed the Minnesota electric rate case seeking a net increase of $677 million over three years. The filing is based on a requested ROE of 10.2% and equity ratio of 52.5% in forecast test years. We requested interim rates of $288 million to be implemented in January 2022. Finally, we plan to file a Minnesota gas rate case in early November with interim rates going into effect in January of 2022. We also plan to file a stay-out option as we look to help mitigate bill impacts of Uri cost recovery for our customers. As Bob mentioned, we have issued a robust $26 billion 5-year capital forecast, which is detailed in our earnings release. Our base capital plan results in rate base growth of approximately 6.5% using 2021 as a base. The base forecast reflects significant grid investment in our Colorado power pathway proposal and other transmission system investments to maintain asset health and reliability and enable renewable generation. The plan reflects a modest level of renewables including our proposed Sherco solar facility. It also includes two natural gas peaking plants to ensure reliability as we retire coal plants, along with investments to improve the customer experience. Beyond our base capital forecast, we anticipate potential incremental capital investment for renewables associated with the Minnesota and Colorado resource plans. Our proposed resource plans include approximately 2,000 megawatts of renewable additions from 2024 to 2026, which would result in incremental capital investment of $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion, assuming 50% ownership. In addition, we anticipate the need for incremental $500 million to $1 billion of related transmission for the Colorado IRP. Combined, we could see a potential incremental investment to support the clean energy transition of $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion in the latter part of this five-year forecast. We've also updated our financing plan, which reflects a combination of internal cash generation and debt issuances to fund the majority of our capital expenditures. We expect to issue $800 million of equity and $450 million of DRIP and benefits equity over the next five years. The financing plan maintains our current credit metrics and strong balance sheet, which is important for maintaining a low cost of capital for our customers. We expect the equity would likely be issued through an ATM over the five years. We anticipate that any incremental capital would be financed with approximately 50% equity and 50% debt. This incremental equity will allow us to fund accretive capital investments, which will benefit our customers while maintaining our solid credit ratings and favorable access to the capital markets. However, our equity needs could be significantly reduced if the reconciliation package is passed with the current framework. Shifting to earnings, we are initiating our 2022 earnings guidance range of $3.10 to $3.20 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%. Key assumptions are detailed in our earnings release. In addition, we've updated the base of our growth rate to $2.96 per share, which represents the midpoint of our revised 2021 guidance range. This represents 6.5% growth in the base between 2020 and 2021. With that, I'll wrap-up with a quick summary. We reached a comprehensive settlement in Colorado that resolved several regulatory proceedings. We are making progress towards the settlement of our Texas rate case. We narrowed our 2021 guidance range to $2.94 to $2.98 per share. We announced a robust updated capital investment program that provides strong, transparent rate base growth and customer value. We initiated 2022 earnings guidance consistent with our long-term growth objective. And finally, we remain confident we can deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within the upper half of our 5% to 7% objective range as we continue leading the clean energy transition and keeping bills low for our customers. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions. Good morning Jeremy. Yes, so I think residential has been stickier than the, call it, forecasted going into this year. And we expected to give back some of the, call it, the residential gains that we saw last year, but it's been sticky. If you look at a year-to-date basis, residential is up 1.8%. So, I think that's -- that was one of the big drivers of our updated guidance for the year. And a lot of that is in Colorado, if you look at where Colorado has been. We also see strong customer growth on the residential side across all of our service territories. Residential permits or building permits are significantly up. On the C&I side, I think it's -- we're really seeing good rebound in -- across all C&I sectors in our opcos. But really, the Permian Basin is coming back. We focus a lot on what's happening with our oil and gas customers in SPS. And we look at some substations that directly serve those loads, and that load is up 25% even relative to pre-pandemic levels. And so we're hearing our -- those customers are disciplined, but continue to drill. And also, they're looking at electrification. They're feeling ESG pressure and that is a big focus on electrifying drill rigs, pumps, compressors, certainly good load growth for us. So, I think we're pleasantly surprised with the strength of our sales and confident that it will continue into next year. I think we expect a slow give back. I think there'll be an amount of stickiness long term that will be there as you think about return to work, and I'll give you our example. We have a telecommuting policy for our employees when they come back to work. so they'll be able to work from home on a part-time basis. And I think we'll see that stickiness for a long time, but I do think it will start to come down from last year and this year a little bit. Yes, I expect 2022 for it to really shape up. Call it a year from now, we should have a real good clarity. Q1 of next year, we expect the Phase 1s of those resource plans in both Minnesota and in Colorado to be approved by their commissions and -- with a substantial amount of renewable opportunity and growth in each of our jurisdictions, as I highlighted in my prepared remarks. We'll go through Phase two processes through Q2 and Q3 of next year, and we expect to be back here next year having some pretty good clarity on the outcomes. Yes. So, Insoo, this is Brian. So, in terms of Uri in Minnesota, the commission has approved recovery of the cost over 27 months, subject to a prudency review. There is some disputed amounts. If you remember, the Department of Commerce disputed about $20 million of our costs and the OAG disputed about $34 million of our costs. So, we'll work through that proceeding. We'd expect to see intervenor testimony late December and then a commission decision mid-next year. Now, we feel like we've acted prudently and filed commission-approved hedging policies. And we feel good about working through the process of the commission and expect to reach a constructive outcome. Yes. And I think if you -- Julien, this is Brian. You heard me talk before. If you look at our PPA buyout strategy as particularly the ones who have been successful have been on the wind side where we bought them out and repowered them. So, I think a long-term extension of wind PTCs, even solar PTCs, new solar PTCs longer term, open up that PPA buyout opportunity or kind of just extend the runway for that longer term, right? We're obviously opportunistic, and you got to make it work for the customers and show a customer benefit and make it work from a financial perspective. But I think that's a longer-term opportunity that this reconciliation package in a 10-year extension of credit springs. Yes absolutely, Steve. I said that could significantly be reduced if the current framework passes. Now it's still a little light on details in terms of what gets passed. But you see we have $1.2 billion of equity in our plan, and you could see that cut significantly down, right? The direct pay opportunity reduces, call it, the tax inefficiency and provides probably, call it, 75 to 100 basis points of improved cash flow. And so we look at that and what we can do from a financing perspective. It gives us a lot of opportunity to reduce those equity needs. So, we're pretty excited about the overall plan, really good from customers. And we look at that long-term tax credit extension and what that can do for our customers. Yes. So, it's a new regime, and we spent the last -- yesterday looking through the legislative tax and assessing that. And we think it's, for us, very manageable in terms of -- really it's -- the way it's qualified is a book alternative minimum tax, so different than the old AMT that existed. But overall, we feel comfortable with how it work and we can manage through it. And so when we look at the overall package, we view it as very positive for us. So, -- but again, like I said, it's a new regime and details will continue to come out, but that's our initial read on it. Yes. So, really -- Bob's point was really around our own wind investments providing significant fuel reductions. And if we look at what the cost would have been had we not had those wind farms, it would have been a $300 million higher impact to our customers on a year-to-date basis this year. So that's really what Bob's point is. I think the broader question is around kind of how these higher commodity costs potentially impact our customers. And when we think about it on the electric side. I think we're really well positioned, right? Bob already made the point about our wind strategy, our steel for fuel strategy. But also look, right, natural gas is a relatively small portion of the overall customer bills on the electric side. And we also have length. And you look at in NSP and SPS, this is something that doesn't quite come through clearly, but we've had light this year and we can sell into the market. And we've provided over $300 million in market sales that we credit back to our customers and help offset some of those higher commodity costs. So, I think we're really well-positioned on the electric side and don't see a significant impact on our customers. On the LDC side, certainly, there's less you can do there, given that commodity costs are a higher portion of our customers' bill. But the -- on the -- going into the winter, right, we have physical storage. We have financial products. And so I think we're -- when we look at it for -- take Colorado for example, I think our forecast for an impact, the average impact on the residential customer bill is about $15 per month for this winter. So, we think it's manageable, but we obviously look for every opportunity we can to help mitigate these customer bill impacts. 1-5, yes, not 5-0. It's about 20% over the -- in the winter months. Yes, I think we show -- we get about $450 million of equity through our dividend reinvestment benefits program. So, that's -- and then the other piece, we say $800 million, that's likely we do it through an at-the-market program, just through an ATM. We have flexibility over that five-year timeframe as we look at our capital needs. Yes. No, I think we're pretty excited about our new capital plan. I think we -- as Bob mentioned, it drives a lot of benefit for our customers. And it's -- based off of our kind of 2021 rate basis, it will afford us a 6.5% rate base growth for our five-year plan. And then if you look at that, call it, potential incremental capital that we need on the transmission system and some renewables that could come out of the resource plans, that could push north of 7%, to about 7.3% if we executed on that. And a lot of this, right, depending on the type of capital, it could be recovered through riders if it's transmission or renewables or built into our multiyear plan in Colorado. So, we're comfortable with the overall capital plan and have kind of plans in place to address the regulatory recovery of it. Hey Travis. I think ROE has always been, call it, an area of dispute in the rate case, right? So, I think that -- I don't think that's unique to us. I think that's pretty common across other utilities. That's one of the big levers that they look at in determining what the appropriate ROE is. Now, we feel pretty good that from where we stand, our ROEs that have been authorized over the past few years have been below the national average. So, when we think about ROE risk there, we think of more potential upside and getting closer to the national average, right, as we know we're leading the clean energy transition, helping our states lead with their policy goals. So, I think there's an opportunity there for us on the ROE side. Now, for us, I think we're pretty proud about our O&M story. Now, if you go all the way back to 2014 and look at where we are today, we're basically flat from an O&M perspective. So, we saved -- if you just apply the 2% inflation growth in that number, maybe several hundred millions of dollars that we've avoided and saved our customers annually. So, I think -- overall, I think we have a really clean story. Our cases are primarily capital-driven, investing in the needs of the system. So, I think overall -- obviously, you have sometimes just lumpy if you hadn't filed a case in six years, and it comes a big headline number. But we look forward to working with our parties and the commissions on working through these rate cases and really delivering a great product in the end. Good morning. I think it might be looking beyond 2022. I think 2022, we're still starting to see still a little bit of a rebound from the depths of COVID. So, I don't know if that's a full 1%, probably between 0% and 1% on a longer five-year forecast. I think that's -- there's upside opportunities. I'll hedge when I give that number. There's upside opportunities, right, from electric vehicles. And we're just getting into the discussion of beneficial electrification. So, I think longer term, there's a lot of opportunities on the electric sales side. But I think for this front 5, you're probably talking in the 0% to 1% after 2022. No, but I mean I'm sure you read the same headlines as we all do with the near-term inflationary pressures. But no real changes from our commentary in Q2 as we think about it longer term. No, I said we could significantly reduce our equity needs. I think significantly is significantly. And we do -- we really have to see the details of this plan, right? It's a framework, and the details are light. So, once we get through all the nuts and bolts of it, we'll come back. Assuming it gets passed, which we are optimistic that it gets passed, we'll come back with the full details on it. There are some puts and takes. You could see a little bit lower rate base growth depending on the details of it. So, there's puts and takes, but I think overall, we're positive about where the reconciliation package stands, both for our customers and for us as a company. Yes, thank you all for participating in our earnings call this morning. With any questions, please contact our Investor Relations team."

        "content": "Operator: Good day everyone. Welcome to Xcel Energy's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, I would like to introduce your host for today's call, Paul Johnson, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.\nPaul Johnson: Thanks Nicole. Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2021 second quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer; Bob Frenzel, President and Chief Operating Officer; Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Amanda Rome, Executive Vice President and General Counsel. This morning, we will review our 2021 results and share recent business and regulatory developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder, some comments made during today's call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our SEC filings. Today, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, including ongoing earnings, electric and natural gas margins. Information on compatible GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in the earnings release. In addition, please note this is Ben Fowke's last earnings call. He will retire as CEO in August but will continue as Executive Chair of the Board. Ben has been an outstanding CEO and will be missed. I'll now turn the call over to Bob.\nRobert Frenzel: Thank you, Paul and good morning everybody. Before we dive into quarterly results, I just want to take a few minutes to recognize Ben and thank him for his leadership. He's been a leader at Xcel Energy for two decades as Treasurer, CFO, President, and Chief Operating Officer, and then CEO and Chairman of the Board. And since he assumed the CEO role in 2011, we've been a national leader in reliability, customer service and safety, all hallmarks of excellent utility operations, and our operational performance has improved over that period. For example, we transformed our nuclear plants into one of the top-ranked fleets in the nation, while lowering our cost structure by 20%. And under Ben's leadership, we delivered for the environment, became a national leader in wind energy and highlighted by our steel for fuel strategy. We've tripled our total wind capacity from 3,400 megawatts to over 10,000 megawatts and our owned wind growing from 300 megawatts to more than 4,000 megawatts. We've significantly reduced the level of coal in our fuel mix from 50% to 21%, and we reduced our carbon emissions by 51% compared to our 2005 baseline. We were the first major U.S. utility to establish 100% carbon-free goal while remaining a stalwart champion for reliability and affordability. We've delivered excellence for our financial stakeholders as well. We've tripled Xcel Energy's market cap from $12 billion to $37 billion, and our stock prices increased from $24 per share to almost $70 per share, reflecting a TSR of 300% and outpacing our peer group. We've met or exceeded our earnings guidance every year and increased our dividend in line with our earnings growth. And beyond Xcel Energy, Ben's recently served as Chairman of EEI, leading through pandemic uncertainties, driving focus on the need for increased levels of research and development for new technologies and inspiring his peers to define diversity and inclusion priorities for their organizations. He's had a tremendous run as CEO and will leave a lasting legacy at Xcel Energy, for the utility industry, and I would go so far as to say for the country. So thank you, Ben. And congratulations on your upcoming retirement in August. I look forward to your continued leadership at the Board level and partnering with you on important federal policy efforts related to infrastructure and clean energy. Looking ahead and I'm honored with the opportunity to lead this great company, and I recognize the Lebron James-sized shoes that I'm filling. Since joining Xcel Energy five years ago, Ben and I have worked closely on the development and the execution of our strategy, and that will not change. We'll continue to lead the clean energy transition, enhance our customers' experience and will constantly work to keep our customers bill low and deliver an affordable product. We've had a fantastic leadership team and significant bench strength, and I'm confident in our ability to capitalize on the growth opportunities in front of us while maintaining our commitment to reliability and affordability. I'm excited about our growth opportunities over the next decade, driven by our generation resource plans, transmission expansion, distribution investments and our electric vehicle vision. As we move forward, innovation is more critical than ever as we prepare to move from 80% carbon reduction by 2030 to 100% carbon-free electricity. I'll be focused on clean technologies in both our electric and our natural gas businesses as well as how we engage with customers in new ways through a more flexible grid. I also expect innovative work practices will continue to drive efficiency and produce strong operational results. And safety is another area where I plan to help drive innovation. As one of our core values, safety is already a priority, but we can do even better. I want us to move beyond traditional metrics and embrace a heightened focus on prevention and culture change, eliminating the most serious events by encouraging trust, transparency, and learning. In the coming months, I look forward to continued engagement with our customers, our communities, our regulators, our investors and of course, our workforce. We have the best employees in the business, and I'm proud of what we've accomplished, and I'm excited for the future successes that we'll achieve together. And to our investors, we appreciate the trust that you place in us, and we'll continue to be good stewards of your investments. Now, turning to the quarter. Today, we reported solid quarterly earnings of $0.58 per share compared to $0.54 per share last year. We're off to a good start, and we are reaffirming our 2021 guidance. We made significant progress on various regulatory initiatives, including three constructive rate case settlements that Brian will discuss in more detail. In addition, we've advanced our plans for adding incremental renewables. In Wisconsin, the commission approved our proposal for the 74-megawatt Mustang solar project for $100 million, which will be the largest solar facility in Western Wisconsin. In June, the Minnesota Commission approved our proposal to buy out a repowered 120-megawatt wind farm PPA for $210 million from ALLETE. This repowered project will save our customers money while extending the life of a renewable energy resource. And the Minnesota Commission continues to evaluate our $575 million proposal to build a 460-megawatt solar facility, takes advantage of existing transmission as we phase out of coal. We are confident the commission will see the customer and economic benefits and expect a decision later this year or early in Q1 of next year. Additionally, as part of our continued commitment to foster a skilled and diverse workforce, we proposed a training program in Minnesota to help those in underrepresented communities develop the skills to succeed in energy-related construction careers. Program graduates will have the opportunity to be considered for participation in our Sherco solar proposal and other future projects. In June, we filed an alternative Minnesota resource plan, which achieves an 85% carbon reduction by 2030. This proposal addresses the concerns of various parties by removing the Sherco combined cycle from consideration and replacing it with two combustion turbines. The key components of the revised plan include an early retirement of both the King and the Sherco three coal units in 2028 and 2030, respectively; a life extension for our Monticello nuclear plant; construction of new transmission lines in order to take advantage of the interconnection rights from the retiring coal units; and the addition of 3,150 megawatts of universal solar, 2,650 megawatts of wind, 800 megawatts of new hydrogen-ready CTs and 300 megawatts of repowered blackstart CTs, 1,900 megawatts of flexible peaking resources and 250 megawatts of new storage. We've provided the commission with an outstanding resource plan that will reduce carbon while maintaining reliability and customer affordability. We expect a decision on the Minnesota resource plan later this year or early next. In addition, we continue to make good progress and are in the discovery phase of the Colorado resource plan and associated transmission power pathway project. We expect the commission decision on both proposals in early 2022. And between Minnesota and Colorado resource plans, we anticipate adding nearly 10,000 megawatts of new renewables to our system to meet our 80% carbon reduction goal by 2030. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian. \nBrian Van Abel: Thanks Bob and good morning everyone. We had a good second quarter, recording $0.58 per share compared with $0.54 per share last year. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter include the following: higher electric and natural gas margins increased earnings by $0.19 per share, primarily driven by riders and regulatory outcomes to recover our capital investments. In addition, a lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.06 per share. As a reminder, production tax credits lowered the ETR. However, PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin and are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation and interest expense, which reduced earnings by $0.09 per share, reflecting our capital investment programs; increased O&M expenses, which reduced earnings by $0.07 per share; and lower AFUDC decreased earnings by $0.05 per share, largely due to placing several large wind farms into service last year. Turning to sales, weather-normalized electric sales increased by 5.3% in the second quarter. This reflects a comparison to last year when the pandemic restrictions in our states were at their highest levels, and our sales were most suppressed due to COVID impacts. Our year-to-date weather and leap year-adjusted electric sales increased 1.6%. We continue to anticipate modest annual weather-adjusted sales growth of approximately 1%. Shifting to expenses. O&M increased $50 million for the quarter, which largely reflects the timing of expenses between the two periods. Last year, we had significant O&M reductions in the second and third quarter to offset the impact of lower sales from COVID, while the fourth quarter was at higher levels. So, the quarterly O&M comparisons will be chunky this year. Turning to regulatory filings, we reached constructive settlements in three rate cases. In Wisconsin, we agreed to a rate increase of $66 million over 2022 to 2023 based on an ROE of 9.8% in 2022, 10.0% in 2023 and an equity ratio of 52.5%. In New Mexico, we agreed to a rate increase of $62 million, reflecting an ROE of 9.35% and an equity ratio of 54.7%. We also accelerated the depreciation life of our Tolk coal plant to 2032 as we plan for its early retirement. In North Dakota, we agreed to a rate increase of $7 million based on an ROE of 9.5% and an equity ratio of 52.5%. We anticipate commission decisions in these cases later this year. In July, we filed a Colorado electric rate case, seeking a net rate increase of $343 million based on an ROE of 10% and an equity ratio of 55.6% and the 2022 forecast test year. The rate case is largely driven by capital investment, and we anticipate a commission decision in the spring of 2022. We also have a pending Texas electric rate case. We're seeking a net rate increase of $74 million after reflecting fuel savings and PTCs from the Sagamore wind farm. The request is driven by capital investment and is based on an ROE of 10.35% and an equity ratio of 54.6%. Commission decision is expected in the first quarter of 2022 for the surcharge back to March 2021. As far as future filings go, we anticipate filing a Minnesota electric rate case in November with interim rates going into effect in January of 2022. We also plan to file a Minnesota natural gas case later this year. With that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. We received commission approval for the Mustang solar project and the ALLETE wind PPA repowering buyout. We provided an alternative to our Minnesota resource plan, which will deliver 85% carbon reduction by 2030, provide transparency into our long-term opportunities. We reached constructive rate case settlements in Wisconsin, New Mexico and North Dakota. We filed our Colorado electric rate case. We reaffirmed our 2021 guidance range. And finally, we remain confident we can deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth in our 5% to 7% objective range. Now, before we open up for questions, I'll turn it over to Ben for some closing comments.\nBen Fowke: Well, thanks Brian and good morning everyone. It's really been an amazing decade as CEO, and before that, as CFO. I'm really proud of the tremendous accomplishments we made as a company. I'm extremely proud of the incredible efforts and contributions our employees make in serving our customers and our local communities. I've also really enjoyed the interactions I've had with our investors and the financial community. I appreciate your interest in the company, your feedback and your suggestions, I'm going to miss that. Now it's really hard to retire from a role that I've truly enjoyed, but I'm leaving the company in great hands. I know that Bob, Brian and the rest of the management team will continue to do an outstanding job leading Xcel Energy well into the future. I also plan on attending EEI this fall. And I look forward to seeing a lot of you there. So, thank you all. And with that, operator, let's open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi good morning. Ben, congratulations and best of luck moving forward.\nBen Fowke: Thank you very much. I appreciate it. \nJeremy Tonet: I just want to start off, I guess, with the renewables. And if you could expand, I guess, on how the pipeline looks for incremental renewables after that Sherco and wind repowering? And also, I guess, how local stimulus efforts might influence this going forward?\nRobert Frenzel: Hey Jeremy, good morning. It's Bob and thanks for the note this morning. Yes, we filed resource plans in both Colorado and in Minnesota. And as we work through those proceedings, I'd say by first quarter next year, we'll have real visibility into the outcomes of both of those. And we'll move forward with what we'll call resource acquisition plans where we propose projects, and we solicit input from others for projects that are coming. I think if your question is around where we are in the R&R recovery plan in Minnesota, in particular, the four wind repowerings were approved in December. The ALLETE repowering project was just approved in June, and we still have the Sherco solar project that is proposed that we hope for approval by end of this year or maybe early next.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. Maybe just pivoting over to Uri, if we could. Just want to see the early stages of your Winter Storm Uri recovery proceedings, how they're progressing, and what changes, if any, do you expect operationally going forward?\nRobert Frenzel: Sure. So, we have approvals in, I think, four of our states at this point, and we're still working through proceedings in three others. I think the largest of those is both Minnesota and Colorado. We're still working through the proceedings on as well as Texas. Our expectation is we acted in accordance with all of our regulatory regulations, prior policies and procedures. And so we do expect a full recovery of our incurred costs on Winter Storm Uri. Yes, I think looking forward, Colorado has opened a docket to explore alternate mechanisms for us and others in the state to look at, and they've proposed an alternative. We've commented it's a NOPR, so they're looking for inputs, and we've commented to the NOPR. And we expect some resolution and some hearings in that process in the third or fourth quarter of this year.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. I'll leave it there. Thank you.\nRobert Frenzel: Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America Securities. \nRobert Frenzel: Hey Julien, good morning.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey good morning and congrats, Ben. It's been a pleasure. I will see you soon. I'm sure.\nBen Fowke: Thanks.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: But if I can -- absolutely. I look forward to seeing you at EEI. If I can pivot to the transmission side in brief here, you all talked previously about this Colorado being potentially expanded over time. Obviously, you're looking for the first phase here to be approved, as you talked about in the prepared remarks. But can you talk about subsequent co-ownership partners and just ultimately, expansion of what you guys have underway here, if there's been any progress?\nRobert Frenzel: Yes. Certainly happy to. But before I get started, I actually I think the congratulations are in order for you and [indiscernible] and look forward to your pending next year. So, congrats.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Thank you so much. I sincerely appreciate that.\nRobert Frenzel: On transmission, in particular, in Colorado, we put forward what we think is a pretty progressive plan, Julien. Historically, we'd have generation be put forward first and then you'd follow-up with the transmission that's necessary. I think where we are and certainly in Colorado and where I think a lot of the country is actually is, is we need to build a substantial amount of transmission to relieve congestion to enable the renewables that we see are necessary to complete this clean energy transition. So, in Colorado, we've put forth what we call the power pathway. That's largely, I'll call it, a super highway of transmission lines through the Eastern Plains of Colorado to connect the good solar and wind resources of the Eastern half of Colorado with the load centers, predominantly in Denver and in the I-25 corridor. So, that path, along with the Colorado resource plan, are progressing in parallel, two separate dockets but in parallel. We expect resolution on both of them by late this year, probably early next year. And your comment on -- we've got a base plan, and I call that sort of we're going to build the freeway. But we also have to build the on and offramps and things like that. So, while the base plan for the freeway itself, I think, is about -- and Brian, correct me if I'm wrong, somewhere in the $1.7-ish billion range. But we need to build voltage and VAR stability. We need to build -- once we find out exactly where the generation resources are going to exist, then we need to build support along that freeway for how those transmissions will integrate with the broader bulk electric system. And that's sort of where that incremental and variation in sort of the base plan versus the other things that we'll need to do once we identify exactly where the resources are. So, like I just mentioned to Jeremy, we'll conclude the phase one of the resource plan in Q1 of next year. At that point, we'll go into resource acquisition. And that's where we picked the resource in exact locations, and then we can have a better, more granular answer to your question on what's the total pathway cost above and beyond sort of the base system. Does that make sense?\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes, totally. I get it. Excellent. And if I can pivot to a slightly related question, if you don't mind. What are you seeing in terms of the impacts across your portfolio here vis-\u00e0-vis inflation, cost structure, logistics? Just as you guys look at your renewable build here and perhaps just some of the timing on, for instance, Sherco here? Perhaps not necessarily related, but just as you think about some of those decision-making truths.\nBrian Van Abel: Hey Julien, it's Brian. Good to hear from you. Yes. Certainly, we're seeing inflation. If you're just looking at the headlines, right, we're not immune to some of the headlines that everyone is seeing. For us, it's inflationary pressures of commodities such as steel, copper and labor. But really, we think it's transitory in nature. And I think really, it's -- I think we found that it was pretty easy to shut down the economy, and it's a lot more challenging to restart the economy from the supply chain and the demand that has followed the shutdown of the economy, something that we are focused on and proactively managing from a supply chain perspective. So, I don't see any significant impacts as we sit here today. Now, specifically, if I want to touch on a couple of the major projects we have in flight. Now, the four wind repowerings that we have, we feel really good about those in Minnesota. Now, those are partial repowerings, so I think blades in the inside of the nacelles. We're not replacing the steel towers. We're not facing steel price risk there. And so we don't really face any significant inflationary pressures on those. So, feel good about that. The large-scale solar farm that we have in front of the Minnesota commission, I'm sure everyone is aware of the solar panel pricing that has been increasing this year. But we look at that. We have a lot of flexibility in terms of construction and when we place that in service in terms of what year. So, we feel really good about that project, too. So overall, something we're certainly focused on and watching but don't see any real impacts as we sit here today. \nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Awesome. And just to clarify from your guide here, the shift in O&M is offset by the gas sales? Just some more nuance there for 2021.\nRobert Frenzel: The shift, I would say, gas sales, certainly good to see an uptick in gas sales from 0% to 1%. But if you remember, gas is a pretty small piece of our business, so a 1% change in gas margins is about $4 million. So, I wouldn't say it necessarily fully offsets it.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay, fair enough. Hey thanks again guys. We'll see you soon.\nRobert Frenzel: Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll take our final question from Ryan Levine from Citi.\nRyan Levine: Thank you. A couple of questions, one on transmission to follow-up on some of those points. It looks like in your presentation, you highlight $300 million of CPCN for that project. It looked like previously, there was a $250 million number that was out there for the May Valley-Longhorn expansion. Are you seeing cost inflation on that particular project? Or is there another dynamic that may cause the change in number?\nRobert Frenzel: No. Look, I think we're still in very early innings on sort of exact routings and pathways. I wouldn't read too much into that, Ryan.\nRyan Levine: Okay. I mean, are there a lot of different pathways that you're -- no pun intended, around the way that, that project can get built out? Or is it fairly visible from your mind in terms of how the project will be contracted?\nRobert Frenzel: Well, look, I think we haven't gone through local permitting. We've got a lot of just local land processes we'll have to go through. So, -- and we're early stages in engineering of that project. I think we felt it was really important to make sure that the transmission and the generation proceeded in parallel. And so I think that as we go through time, as we get better engineering, as we get better insight into the land processes, those routes will be very specific. There's still a pretty big range of capital expenditures for that. A lot of it's based on final routing and final land approval costs. So, I guess then, I wouldn't read too much into that particular leg extension.\nRyan Levine: Okay. And then lastly, in terms of some of the recent legislation in Colorado pertaining to gas, are you anticipating any material impact to your business around some of the recent SB21-246 and the 1238 and 1286 and some of the others that have recently passed?\nRobert Frenzel: Can you repeat those again, Ryan? That's quite a litany of bill numbers. Let me just -- I'll talk a little bit about the clean heat plan in Colorado and maybe even to a parallel path, the innovative gas act that was also approved here in Minnesota. Look, I think both of those bills recognize that we're in early innings of lowering our customers' emissions from the gas LDC businesses and not dissimilar to what we went through in the mid-90s with renewables. I mean, the technology is nascent and the solutions are relatively expensive. But we also recognize we need to start somewhere. And so I think that the legislation in both places recognize those facts. And look, we are -- we'll do pilots. We'll introduce technology. We'll look at beneficial electrification and energy efficiency programs, all tools that maybe aren't readily available under the current regulation schemes today. But these pieces of legislation allow for some of that innovation to happen on the gas LDC side. I think the legislation also recognizes it's really important to respect the reliability and affordability. And I think each state addressed it slightly differently. But there's a cap in Colorado and regulatory approval for plans. And in Minnesota, similarly, their regulatory approval for the pilots, that makes sure that they're cost-justified and beneficial for our customers as well as we think about lowering their emissions profile from the gas LDC business. So, we're -- we were very active in both of those pieces of legislation, and we are working with the regulatory agencies to look at how we write the regulations for those pieces of legislation. And then we'll be active as we put proposals forward to help our customers reduce their footprint emissions profile in each state. So, yes, I think there's opportunity here, and we're going to continue to work with our commissions and our stakeholders.\nRyan Levine: I appreciate it.\nRobert Frenzel: You bet.\nOperator: And it looks like we have a question from David Peters from Wolfe Research.\nDavid Peters: Hey good morning. I echo the congrats to Ben. Just one question for me. As you guys make progress working through your IRPs in Colorado and Minnesota and then the transmission opportunities as well, it just seems like there's a lot of incremental capex opportunities above some of the more basic blocking and tackling. Just how would you kind of characterize that within the context of the kind of 5% to 7% growth targets you've targeted here recently?\nRobert Frenzel: Hey David, thanks for the question. This is Bob. I guess similar to Julien I might have to start with congratulations to you for your recent [indiscernible] yourself. So, we have two of those on the call today.\nDavid Peters: Thank you.\nRobert Frenzel: In terms of incremental capital, yes, I think there's some projects still out there that we're working through regulatory processes on, the largest of which is the Sherco solar, which we talked about. I think longer term, we've got base proposals on our resource plans and for our transmission planning. Stuff that's not included in the near-term is obviously MISO and SPP transmission expansion plans, and those are generally outside of our five-year forecast but definitely in sort of a 10-year vision forecast. And then we expect our base -- rate base growth plan to be right around 7%. And so any incremental -- and I think there's a couple of incremental projects that could take us above that. I think we'd expect to keep our 5% to 7% earnings growth rate, and we can reevaluate that regularly, and we do. But I think right now, we're just comfortable with being at the high end of our guidance range.\nBrian Van Abel: Yes. And Dave, I'd just add to that. I think what you hear from us, what we're really focused on doing is providing our investors with that long-term transparency as we work through our resource plans in Minnesota and Colorado this year, looking at almost 10 gigawatts renewables by 2030 between those two. Plus the associated transmission that comes in Colorado and what we could expect to see out of MISO here is giving investors that transparency into extending and really feeling good about the long-term growth rate, not through this five but through -- and talk about it through the decade, so something we're focused on.\nDavid Peters: Great. Thank you for the color.\nOperator: And we have a question from Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates.\nRobert Frenzel: Hey good morning Paul.\nPaul Patterson: Hey good morning. Congratulations Ben.\nBen Fowke: Thanks so much.\nPaul Patterson: Absolutely. So, just -- there have been some comments out of Colorado from some of the commissioners regarding rates and sort of the cumulative impact, et cetera. And you mentioned on the call, I think, that you don't see any significant -- you think that the inflation issues that we have currently are sort of transitory. But I'm wondering, in terms of your goals, and I think there's pretty much to be -- somewhat below the rate of inflation. Are we still on track with that with respect to your outlook in the various jurisdictions? Has there been any change in that because of the transitory impact or anything else that we should think about?\nRobert Frenzel: Paul, it's Bob, and I'll let Brian chime in if I miss anything. But in particular, with respect to Colorado, I think that our customers' bills in Colorado are about a third, 35% less than the national average and have been basically flat for the past five years. And although we filed a rate case out there, we expect even after the rate case, they're still going to be 25% below the national average.\nBrian Van Abel: If we got everything we asked for.\nRobert Frenzel: Yes, if we got everything in the case that we asked for, they'll still be 25% below the national average. But your longer-term question is, do we think we continue this transition to a cleaner energy economy cost affordably. And the answer to that is yes. And the impacts that we're seeing for inflation, we would say, are still relatively transitory. I think some of the macro economists would sort of agree with that comment. We think that we can transition our states at less than the rate of inflation over the next 10 years to an 80% carbon reduction. Colorado, in particular, will be 85% carbon reduction, less than the cost of inflation. So, I think our strategic thesis holds, and we don't see this current spat of restarting the economy as derailing our longer term plans.\nBrian Van Abel: Yes. And I would say, you see that in our resource plans, right, where we kind of show the bill impacts over the next decade in both Colorado and Minnesota. And we do -- we run those resource plans in the cases we put forward to the commission with current tax policy. And there's a lot of discussion in D.C. about a long-term extension of federal tax credits around clean energy, and we certainly support -- fully support Senator Wyden's Clean Energy for America Act. And when we run that analysis, that's really good for our customers in terms of those extension of credits. It only brings down the cost as we make this transition.\nPaul Patterson: Okay. And just your long-term -- just for -- obviously, it could change, but your long-term inflation expectations are around 2% still. Is that about right?\nBrian Van Abel: Yes, longer term.\nPaul Patterson: Okay. Awesome. Thanks so much guys.\nRobert Frenzel: You bet.\nOperator: And we have a question from Ashar Khan with Verition.\nAshar Khan: Ben, I just wanted to dial in to congratulate you. Known you for a long time, and the company did wonderfully well and hope Bob can continue in that spate. So, congrats again. And if I can ask one industry question. I know you've been heading the EEI and trying to get the nuclear PTCs across the board in the legislative front. Could you give us any update where we stand on that endeavor?\nBen Fowke: Well, it will likely be part of the $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation process. And there's a lot of moving parts with that. The first part of that will be just getting the budget resolutions to the various committees. And that will establish how much funding those committees have to pursue broad topics, which we believe will ultimately include the nuclear PTC. We like to see that in August. And then, of course, the actual legislation would take place in the fall. Again, there's a lot of moving parts. As you know, it's a 50-50 Senate and a very narrow margin in the house. So, it's a balancing act. But we are definitely advocating for that. We're advocating, as Brian mentioned, Senator Wyden's bill. We think direct pay, PTC for solar, these are things that are going to really help the clean energy transition to be affordable for our customers and the industry in general. And I look forward to seeing you perhaps at EEI.\nAshar Khan: Certainly. Thank you so much.\nBen Fowke: You got it.\nOperator: And it appears we have no further questions at this time. I will turn the conference back over to Brian Van Abel, CFO.\nBrian Van Abel: Yes. Thanks all for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions. Thanks everyone.\nOperator: And once again, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. We appreciate your participation today.",

            "name": "Robert Frenzel",
            "content": "Thank you, Paul and good morning everybody. Before we dive into quarterly results, I just want to take a few minutes to recognize Ben and thank him for his leadership. He's been a leader at Xcel Energy for two decades as Treasurer, CFO, President, and Chief Operating Officer, and then CEO and Chairman of the Board. And since he assumed the CEO role in 2011, we've been a national leader in reliability, customer service and safety, all hallmarks of excellent utility operations, and our operational performance has improved over that period. For example, we transformed our nuclear plants into one of the top-ranked fleets in the nation, while lowering our cost structure by 20%. And under Ben's leadership, we delivered for the environment, became a national leader in wind energy and highlighted by our steel for fuel strategy. We've tripled our total wind capacity from 3,400 megawatts to over 10,000 megawatts and our owned wind growing from 300 megawatts to more than 4,000 megawatts. We've significantly reduced the level of coal in our fuel mix from 50% to 21%, and we reduced our carbon emissions by 51% compared to our 2005 baseline. We were the first major U.S. utility to establish 100% carbon-free goal while remaining a stalwart champion for reliability and affordability. We've delivered excellence for our financial stakeholders as well. We've tripled Xcel Energy's market cap from $12 billion to $37 billion, and our stock prices increased from $24 per share to almost $70 per share, reflecting a TSR of 300% and outpacing our peer group. We've met or exceeded our earnings guidance every year and increased our dividend in line with our earnings growth. And beyond Xcel Energy, Ben's recently served as Chairman of EEI, leading through pandemic uncertainties, driving focus on the need for increased levels of research and development for new technologies and inspiring his peers to define diversity and inclusion priorities for their organizations. He's had a tremendous run as CEO and will leave a lasting legacy at Xcel Energy, for the utility industry, and I would go so far as to say for the country. So thank you, Ben. And congratulations on your upcoming retirement in August. I look forward to your continued leadership at the Board level and partnering with you on important federal policy efforts related to infrastructure and clean energy. Looking ahead and I'm honored with the opportunity to lead this great company, and I recognize the Lebron James-sized shoes that I'm filling. Since joining Xcel Energy five years ago, Ben and I have worked closely on the development and the execution of our strategy, and that will not change. We'll continue to lead the clean energy transition, enhance our customers' experience and will constantly work to keep our customers bill low and deliver an affordable product. We've had a fantastic leadership team and significant bench strength, and I'm confident in our ability to capitalize on the growth opportunities in front of us while maintaining our commitment to reliability and affordability. I'm excited about our growth opportunities over the next decade, driven by our generation resource plans, transmission expansion, distribution investments and our electric vehicle vision. As we move forward, innovation is more critical than ever as we prepare to move from 80% carbon reduction by 2030 to 100% carbon-free electricity. I'll be focused on clean technologies in both our electric and our natural gas businesses as well as how we engage with customers in new ways through a more flexible grid. I also expect innovative work practices will continue to drive efficiency and produce strong operational results. And safety is another area where I plan to help drive innovation. As one of our core values, safety is already a priority, but we can do even better. I want us to move beyond traditional metrics and embrace a heightened focus on prevention and culture change, eliminating the most serious events by encouraging trust, transparency, and learning. In the coming months, I look forward to continued engagement with our customers, our communities, our regulators, our investors and of course, our workforce. We have the best employees in the business, and I'm proud of what we've accomplished, and I'm excited for the future successes that we'll achieve together. And to our investors, we appreciate the trust that you place in us, and we'll continue to be good stewards of your investments. Now, turning to the quarter. Today, we reported solid quarterly earnings of $0.58 per share compared to $0.54 per share last year. We're off to a good start, and we are reaffirming our 2021 guidance. We made significant progress on various regulatory initiatives, including three constructive rate case settlements that Brian will discuss in more detail. In addition, we've advanced our plans for adding incremental renewables. In Wisconsin, the commission approved our proposal for the 74-megawatt Mustang solar project for $100 million, which will be the largest solar facility in Western Wisconsin. In June, the Minnesota Commission approved our proposal to buy out a repowered 120-megawatt wind farm PPA for $210 million from ALLETE. This repowered project will save our customers money while extending the life of a renewable energy resource. And the Minnesota Commission continues to evaluate our $575 million proposal to build a 460-megawatt solar facility, takes advantage of existing transmission as we phase out of coal. We are confident the commission will see the customer and economic benefits and expect a decision later this year or early in Q1 of next year. Additionally, as part of our continued commitment to foster a skilled and diverse workforce, we proposed a training program in Minnesota to help those in underrepresented communities develop the skills to succeed in energy-related construction careers. Program graduates will have the opportunity to be considered for participation in our Sherco solar proposal and other future projects. In June, we filed an alternative Minnesota resource plan, which achieves an 85% carbon reduction by 2030. This proposal addresses the concerns of various parties by removing the Sherco combined cycle from consideration and replacing it with two combustion turbines. The key components of the revised plan include an early retirement of both the King and the Sherco three coal units in 2028 and 2030, respectively; a life extension for our Monticello nuclear plant; construction of new transmission lines in order to take advantage of the interconnection rights from the retiring coal units; and the addition of 3,150 megawatts of universal solar, 2,650 megawatts of wind, 800 megawatts of new hydrogen-ready CTs and 300 megawatts of repowered blackstart CTs, 1,900 megawatts of flexible peaking resources and 250 megawatts of new storage. We've provided the commission with an outstanding resource plan that will reduce carbon while maintaining reliability and customer affordability. We expect a decision on the Minnesota resource plan later this year or early next. In addition, we continue to make good progress and are in the discovery phase of the Colorado resource plan and associated transmission power pathway project. We expect the commission decision on both proposals in early 2022. And between Minnesota and Colorado resource plans, we anticipate adding nearly 10,000 megawatts of new renewables to our system to meet our 80% carbon reduction goal by 2030. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian. Hey Jeremy, good morning. It's Bob and thanks for the note this morning. Yes, we filed resource plans in both Colorado and in Minnesota. And as we work through those proceedings, I'd say by first quarter next year, we'll have real visibility into the outcomes of both of those. And we'll move forward with what we'll call resource acquisition plans where we propose projects, and we solicit input from others for projects that are coming. I think if your question is around where we are in the R&R recovery plan in Minnesota, in particular, the four wind repowerings were approved in December. The ALLETE repowering project was just approved in June, and we still have the Sherco solar project that is proposed that we hope for approval by end of this year or maybe early next. Sure. So, we have approvals in, I think, four of our states at this point, and we're still working through proceedings in three others. I think the largest of those is both Minnesota and Colorado. We're still working through the proceedings on as well as Texas. Our expectation is we acted in accordance with all of our regulatory regulations, prior policies and procedures. And so we do expect a full recovery of our incurred costs on Winter Storm Uri. Yes, I think looking forward, Colorado has opened a docket to explore alternate mechanisms for us and others in the state to look at, and they've proposed an alternative. We've commented it's a NOPR, so they're looking for inputs, and we've commented to the NOPR. And we expect some resolution and some hearings in that process in the third or fourth quarter of this year. Thank you. Hey Julien, good morning. Yes. Certainly happy to. But before I get started, I actually I think the congratulations are in order for you and [indiscernible] and look forward to your pending next year. So, congrats. On transmission, in particular, in Colorado, we put forward what we think is a pretty progressive plan, Julien. Historically, we'd have generation be put forward first and then you'd follow-up with the transmission that's necessary. I think where we are and certainly in Colorado and where I think a lot of the country is actually is, is we need to build a substantial amount of transmission to relieve congestion to enable the renewables that we see are necessary to complete this clean energy transition. So, in Colorado, we've put forth what we call the power pathway. That's largely, I'll call it, a super highway of transmission lines through the Eastern Plains of Colorado to connect the good solar and wind resources of the Eastern half of Colorado with the load centers, predominantly in Denver and in the I-25 corridor. So, that path, along with the Colorado resource plan, are progressing in parallel, two separate dockets but in parallel. We expect resolution on both of them by late this year, probably early next year. And your comment on -- we've got a base plan, and I call that sort of we're going to build the freeway. But we also have to build the on and offramps and things like that. So, while the base plan for the freeway itself, I think, is about -- and Brian, correct me if I'm wrong, somewhere in the $1.7-ish billion range. But we need to build voltage and VAR stability. We need to build -- once we find out exactly where the generation resources are going to exist, then we need to build support along that freeway for how those transmissions will integrate with the broader bulk electric system. And that's sort of where that incremental and variation in sort of the base plan versus the other things that we'll need to do once we identify exactly where the resources are. So, like I just mentioned to Jeremy, we'll conclude the phase one of the resource plan in Q1 of next year. At that point, we'll go into resource acquisition. And that's where we picked the resource in exact locations, and then we can have a better, more granular answer to your question on what's the total pathway cost above and beyond sort of the base system. Does that make sense? The shift, I would say, gas sales, certainly good to see an uptick in gas sales from 0% to 1%. But if you remember, gas is a pretty small piece of our business, so a 1% change in gas margins is about $4 million. So, I wouldn't say it necessarily fully offsets it. Thank you. No. Look, I think we're still in very early innings on sort of exact routings and pathways. I wouldn't read too much into that, Ryan. Well, look, I think we haven't gone through local permitting. We've got a lot of just local land processes we'll have to go through. So, -- and we're early stages in engineering of that project. I think we felt it was really important to make sure that the transmission and the generation proceeded in parallel.

            "name": "Brian Van Abel",
            "content": "Thanks Bob and good morning everyone. We had a good second quarter, recording $0.58 per share compared with $0.54 per share last year. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter include the following: higher electric and natural gas margins increased earnings by $0.19 per share, primarily driven by riders and regulatory outcomes to recover our capital investments. In addition, a lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.06 per share. As a reminder, production tax credits lowered the ETR. However, PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin and are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation and interest expense, which reduced earnings by $0.09 per share, reflecting our capital investment programs; increased O&M expenses, which reduced earnings by $0.07 per share; and lower AFUDC decreased earnings by $0.05 per share, largely due to placing several large wind farms into service last year. Turning to sales, weather-normalized electric sales increased by 5.3% in the second quarter. This reflects a comparison to last year when the pandemic restrictions in our states were at their highest levels, and our sales were most suppressed due to COVID impacts. Our year-to-date weather and leap year-adjusted electric sales increased 1.6%. We continue to anticipate modest annual weather-adjusted sales growth of approximately 1%. Shifting to expenses. O&M increased $50 million for the quarter, which largely reflects the timing of expenses between the two periods. Last year, we had significant O&M reductions in the second and third quarter to offset the impact of lower sales from COVID, while the fourth quarter was at higher levels. So, the quarterly O&M comparisons will be chunky this year. Turning to regulatory filings, we reached constructive settlements in three rate cases. In Wisconsin, we agreed to a rate increase of $66 million over 2022 to 2023 based on an ROE of 9.8% in 2022, 10.0% in 2023 and an equity ratio of 52.5%. In New Mexico, we agreed to a rate increase of $62 million, reflecting an ROE of 9.35% and an equity ratio of 54.7%. We also accelerated the depreciation life of our Tolk coal plant to 2032 as we plan for its early retirement. In North Dakota, we agreed to a rate increase of $7 million based on an ROE of 9.5% and an equity ratio of 52.5%. We anticipate commission decisions in these cases later this year. In July, we filed a Colorado electric rate case, seeking a net rate increase of $343 million based on an ROE of 10% and an equity ratio of 55.6% and the 2022 forecast test year. The rate case is largely driven by capital investment, and we anticipate a commission decision in the spring of 2022. We also have a pending Texas electric rate case. We're seeking a net rate increase of $74 million after reflecting fuel savings and PTCs from the Sagamore wind farm. The request is driven by capital investment and is based on an ROE of 10.35% and an equity ratio of 54.6%. Commission decision is expected in the first quarter of 2022 for the surcharge back to March 2021. As far as future filings go, we anticipate filing a Minnesota electric rate case in November with interim rates going into effect in January of 2022. We also plan to file a Minnesota natural gas case later this year. With that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. We received commission approval for the Mustang solar project and the ALLETE wind PPA repowering buyout. We provided an alternative to our Minnesota resource plan, which will deliver 85% carbon reduction by 2030, provide transparency into our long-term opportunities. We reached constructive rate case settlements in Wisconsin, New Mexico and North Dakota. We filed our Colorado electric rate case. We reaffirmed our 2021 guidance range. And finally, we remain confident we can deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth in our 5% to 7% objective range. Now, before we open up for questions, I'll turn it over to Ben for some closing comments. Hey Julien, it's Brian. Good to hear from you. Yes. Certainly, we're seeing inflation. If you're just looking at the headlines, right, we're not immune to some of the headlines that everyone is seeing. For us, it's inflationary pressures of commodities such as steel, copper and labor. But really, we think it's transitory in nature. And I think really, it's -- I think we found that it was pretty easy to shut down the economy, and it's a lot more challenging to restart the economy from the supply chain and the demand that has followed the shutdown of the economy, something that we are focused on and proactively managing from a supply chain perspective. So, I don't see any significant impacts as we sit here today. Now, specifically, if I want to touch on a couple of the major projects we have in flight. Now, the four wind repowerings that we have, we feel really good about those in Minnesota. Now, those are partial repowerings, so I think blades in the inside of the nacelles. We're not replacing the steel towers. We're not facing steel price risk there. And so we don't really face any significant inflationary pressures on those. So, feel good about that. The large-scale solar farm that we have in front of the Minnesota commission, I'm sure everyone is aware of the solar panel pricing that has been increasing this year. But we look at that. We have a lot of flexibility in terms of construction and when we place that in service in terms of what year. So, we feel really good about that project, too. So overall, something we're certainly focused on and watching but don't see any real impacts as we sit here today. Yes. And Dave, I'd just add to that. I think what you hear from us, what we're really focused on doing is providing our investors with that long-term transparency as we work through our resource plans in Minnesota and Colorado this year, looking at almost 10 gigawatts renewables by 2030 between those two. Plus the associated transmission that comes in Colorado and what we could expect to see out of MISO here is giving investors that transparency into extending and really feeling good about the long-term growth rate, not through this five but through -- and talk about it through the decade, so something we're focused on. If we got everything we asked for. Yes. And I would say, you see that in our resource plans, right, where we kind of show the bill impacts over the next decade in both Colorado and Minnesota. And we do -- we run those resource plans in the cases we put forward to the commission with current tax policy. And there's a lot of discussion in D.C. about a long-term extension of federal tax credits around clean energy, and we certainly support -- fully support Senator Wyden's Clean Energy for America Act. And when we run that analysis, that's really good for our customers in terms of those extension of credits. It only brings down the cost as we make this transition. Yes, longer term. Yes. Thanks all for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions. Thanks everyone."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to Xcel Energy's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, I would like to introduce your host for today's call, Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nPaul Johnson: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2021 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer; Bob Frenzel, President and Chief Operating Officer; Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Amanda Rome, Executive Vice President and General Counsel.  This morning, we will review our '21 -- 2021 results and share recent business and regulatory developments. There are slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder, some of the comments during today's call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our SEC filings.  Today, we will discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures, including ongoing earnings and electric and natural gas margins. Information on the compatible -- comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release.  With that, I'll turn it over to Ben.\nBen Fowke: Well, thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported strong first quarter earnings of $0.67 per share compared with $0.56 per share last year. We're off to a good start, and we are reaffirming our 2021 guidance range. But I want to start out by thanking our employees for their outstanding work to ensure that our customers did not experience any material outages during Winter Storm Uri. I'm proud of our strong performance of our power plants, and our electric and natural gas systems during that serious event. I think there are a lot of lessons learned from Uri, the need to invest in resiliency, the increased interdependency between the gas and electric sectors and the need to have 24/7 dispatchable generation available are a few that come to mind.  So despite strong operational performance, we incurred $1 billion of incremental fuel costs during the winter storm. It's important to recognize that we followed all the policies and procedures regarding natural gas purchasing and hedging as approved by regulators in our states. We're in the process of seeking recovery for incremental fuel cost and we'll propose to defer the cost recovery over 1 year or 2 to mitigate the impact on our customers.  Well turning to our investment plans. In February, we filed our proposal to buy out a repowered 120-megawatt wind PPA from ALLETE for $210 million. The buyout will save our customers money while extending the life of our renewable energy resource. We also filed our proposal to build 460 megawatts of solar facilities near our retiring Sherco Coal plant for an estimated investment of $575 million. The project takes advantage of existing transmission and will bring good, high-paying local construction jobs to our economy.  We requested a commission decision on both projects later this year and are confident the commission will see the customer and economic benefits. In March, we filed our resource plan in Colorado, which details our plans to reduce carbon emissions by 85% and increase renewables to 80% of our fuel mix by 2030. The plan includes the early retirement of 2 coal units at Hayden in 2027 and 2028, the conversion of Pawnee to natural gas in 2028, the early retirement of Comanche 3 in 2040 with reduced operations beginning in 2030. Now under the plan, we will add 2,300 megawatts of wind, 1,600 megawatts of universal scale solar, 400 megawatts of storage, 1,300 megawatts of flexible resources and 1,200 megawatts of distributed solar resources through our renewable energy programs.  In addition, we are continuing to make progress on the Minnesota resource plan and expect a decision later this year. Between the Minnesota and Colorado resource plans, we anticipate adding nearly 10,000 megawatts of renewables to our system to meet our 80% carbon reduction goal by 2030. We also filed our pathway transmission expansion plan in Colorado. The proposal request approval to build 560 miles of 345 kV transmission lines creating a backbone that will enable 5,500 megawatts of incremental renewables and help Colorado achieve its 2030 carbon reduction goals. The estimated cost of the backbone is $1.7 billion, with an incremental investment of up to $1 billion for network upgrades, voltage support and addition transmission line and interconnection work. We expect decisions on the Colorado pathway project later this year.  Turning to the NSP system. MISO recently presented its long-range transmission planning roadmap, which identified potential scenarios for future system development based on constrained areas and options for regional transmission expansion. This conceptional roadmap highlighted an initial set of projects in the MISO footprint, which could drive $30 billion of investment and a full rollout could result in up to $100 billion of investment. While this is very preliminary, a high level conceptual framework, it does highlight the need for significant transmission over the next 15 years. The transmission expansion and resource plans will provide transparency into our long-term opportunities and will likely lead to robust capital investment in the second half of this decade.  Now as you know, one of my highest priorities is ensuring Xcel Energy is a positive force for racial justice and reconciliation. We are deeply committed to supporting our communities in advancing racial equity, rebuilding following civil unrest and addressing COVID-19 impacts, which continue to disproportionately affect black communities. I'm proud that our company is engaged in a community dialogue and we are investing in organizations that are having a real impact. We've got more work to do as a company, a community, and a country towards creating a more just society. But by working together, we can all be part of the solution.  We're also proud of the recognition we're receiving for our actions. For example, Xcel Energy was named among the world's most admired companies by Fortune Magazine for the eighth consecutive year, ranking second among gas and electric companies. And we continue to be cited as a top company for LGBTQ equality, earning a perfect score in the human rights campaign's 2021 Corporate Equality Index and a Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality designation for the fifth consecutive year.  So with that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\nBrian Van Abel: Thanks, Ben. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We had a good start to the year, booking $0.67 per share compared to $0.56 per share last year. Most significant earnings drivers for the year include the following: higher electric and natural gas margins increased earnings by $0.18 per share, primarily driven by riders and rate outcomes to recover our capital investments and increase margin from our small trading operation, reflecting higher market prices. In addition, a lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.06 per share. As a reminder, though, production tax credits lower the ETR. PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin and are largely earnings neutral.  Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation and interest expense which reduced earnings by $0.09 per share, reflecting our capital investment program. Lower AFUDC decreased earnings by $0.02 per share, largely due to placing several larger wind farms into service last year. In addition, other items combined to decrease earnings by $0.02 per share.  Turning to sales. Weather and leap year adjusted electric sales declined by 1.9% in the first quarter. Our sales forecast assumed that there was a lingering impact from COVID-19, and we expected a slight decline in Q1. However, the adverse impacts of COVID on sales were largely felt starting in the second quarter of last year. As a result, we anticipate a positive quarter-over-quarter sales comparison next quarter. And for the year, we continue to anticipate modest weather-adjusted sales growth of approximately 1%. Shifting to expenses. O&M increased slightly for the quarter. We expect annual O&M expenses to be relatively flat in 2021, reflecting incremental costs for new wind farms, offset by a decline in base O&M.  Now turning to our regulatory filings. In January, we filed a New Mexico electric rate case seeking a net rate increase of $48 million after reflecting fuel savings and PTCs from the Sagamore wind farm. A commission decision and implementation of final rates are anticipated in the fourth quarter of this year. In February, we filed a Texas electric rate case seeking a net rate increase of $74 million after reflecting fuel savings and PTCs from the Sagamore wind farm. A commission decision is expected in the first quarter of 2022 with a surcharge back to March 2021.  The Texas and New Mexico rate cases are driven by the Sagamore wind farm, investment in transmission and distribution due to significant growth, the loss of a wholesale customer, changes in depreciation to reflect the planned early retirement of our coal plant, a requested ROE of 10.35% and an equity ratio of 54.6%. In November 2020, we filed a request in North Dakota seeking an electric rate increase of approximately $19 million based on a requested ROE of 10.2% and an equity ratio of 52.5%. Interim rates were implemented in January and the decision is expected later this year.  As far as future filings go, we anticipate filing a Colorado electric rate case this summer with rates going into effect in the first half of 2022. We are working with parties to reach settlement agreements regarding our plans for Wisconsin rate case. And finally, we also anticipate filing a Minnesota electric rate case in November, with interim rates going into effect in January of 2022.  Shifting to renewables. We continue to achieve important milestones in our PPA buyout strategy. In March, we closed on the acquisition of the 99-megawatt repowered Mower wind farm. We expect Mower will provide significant customer savings in carbon reduction for our customers. We've gotten off to a great start for the year and are reaffirming our 2021 earnings guidance of $2.90 to $3 per share. We've updated our guidance assumptions, and we expect incremental interest expense due to the lag in recovery of the $1 billion of unplanned fuel costs associated with Winter Storm Uri. As we work with our commissions to recover the fuel costs, we're not seeking to recover the carrying costs from our customers, as we help to manage the overall bill impacts. We continue to expect to deliver earnings around the midpoint of the guidance range.  With that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. We continue to execute on our PPA buyout strategy with the acquisition of the Mower wind farm and filing of the elite PPA repowering buyout. We filed our solar proposal in Minnesota. We filed our Colorado resource plan and transmission expansion plan, which will provide transparency into our long-term opportunities and will likely lead to robust capital investment in the second half of the decade. We reaffirmed our guidance range and finally, we remain confident we can deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within our 5% to 7% objective range.  This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And we will begin with Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.\nJeremy Tonet: I was just wondering, how does your Colorado generation transition impact transmission needs overall? Given the national attention on transmission, currently, what type of receptivity do you expect to this proposal? And are there similar investments you're evaluating across the rest of your footprint?\nBen Fowke: Well, yes, I mean, I think the response has been very favorable. And I think there's a recognition that if we're going to achieve, in the case of Colorado, an 85% carbon reduction with almost 80% of it coming from renewable energy, that we're going to need a strong backbone to be able to do that. And Jeremy, when you factor in the price of all that, it still comes out in an incredibly affordable price point for our customers, which quite frankly, might be made all the more affordable with some of the policies that are coming out of the Biden Infrastructure Plan.  If you think about it, if we -- if the extension of PTCs, the direct refundability, the normalization opt-out for solar, an ITC for transmission, that promises to make our plan, which, of course, includes 10,000 megawatts of renewables, that much more affordable for our customers. And when you keep your product affordable, you create headroom for additional investments in the grid, like the transmission you're referring to. So I'm really optimistic that we've got a tremendous opportunity in front of us with transmission aided by the policies that I mentioned that will keep the price point low. And that's in all of our regions. The MISO studies are preliminary, but I think you can see that, that's an enormous investment opportunity. And hopefully, the slides we've attached for you are helpful in demonstrating where some of that build could happen.\nJeremy Tonet: That's very helpful. And you outlined a lot of great CapEx opportunities out there over a long period of time. And just wondering how we should think about this CapEx as you laid it out there. As it relates to your growth rates, do you see this kind of firming up the 5% to 7% over a longer time period? Or do you think that there could be upside at some point? Just wondering how this all kind of comes together in your mind.\nBen Fowke: Well, we firmly believe we can be in the upper half of that 5% to 7% range. The things I'm describing only are helpful for that. But I mean you made a great point. When we talk about a long-term growth rate, we're not talking about 3 to 5 years, we're talking about a long time. So I'm quite confident that the opportunities we have in front of us will give you -- should give you comfort that we've got transparent plans to hit that. And again, we believe that we can be in the upper range of that range, upper half, right.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful. Just one last one, if I could. If you could speak to recent sales trends across territories, particularly SPS and how do you see reopening trends impacting sales over the balance of the year here?\nBrian Van Abel: Yes. Jeremy. Yes, good question. I think from a -- we talk about -- I'll talk about SPS specifically, when we talk about a little bit broader. We're in touch with our major customers in the oil patch area, and I would say they're cautiously optimistic. And we monitor some of our substations that serve those loads specifically, and they're reaching pre-pandemic levels. So that's a good sign. We're also hearing from them that there's a -- from the oil majors, that there's a big focus on electrifying rigs and pumps as they look at ways they can improve their carbon footprint.  So I would say, optimistic with what we're hearing down there. Overall, I think our territories, we're starting to come out of the COVID restrictions. And we have no restrictions in the Dakotas in Wisconsin and Texas, and Minnesota and Colorado are starting to ease up. In Minnesota here, we're at about a 75% capacity for bars and restaurants. So we look at all the leading indicators in our economies. And I would say there's positive growth in signs for this year. And I think we feel pretty good about our 1% year-over-year sales growth on the electric side.\nOperator: We will now hear from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.\nStephen Byrd: So thinking more on transmission, just building on some of the prior questions. Just you laid out in MISO some potential additional growth. And I was just curious if you could just talk a little bit about the sort of the process steps in MISO from here. How will this develop over time? How might this impact your thinking and your CapEx over time?\nRobert Frenzel: Stephen, it's Bob here. Good to hear from you. Look, with MISO and their MTEP21 plan, we expect all transmission owners to work through the process at MISO over the course of 2021. Ultimately, with a goal of by the end of the year, coming out with a series of recommended projects all over the territory. Obviously, being one of the largest TOs in MISO, transmission owners, we'd expect a lot of those projects to be in our service territory areas, particularly since those are the high-density renewable areas in the territories as well. So that goes forward.  Those projects are generally long-dated items, and we don't have capital for new major transmission lines in MISO in our 5-year forecast. But when Ben talks about the elongation of our growth and the investment that this industry needs to make the clean energy transition, we see that as the back half of the decade that's going to perpetuate the growth profile that we shared earlier.\nBen Fowke: Stephen, I'd just add that -- I would just add that the throttle has always been the cost to the consumer. And as I mentioned to a question earlier, we already had an affordable plan. I mean, taking advantage of very low-cost renewables, which even with transmission build, that still is great for our customers. You make that even less expensive, more affordable with the tax policies that are -- that I think have a pretty good shot of getting passed. And that's creating a lot of headroom for our investment, while keeping our product affordable, allowing us to then focus on things like electrification, which is also going to get ramped up with -- under the Biden administration proposal. It really is, I think, very, very bullish for Xcel Energy and great for our customers. I'm really excited about it.\nStephen Byrd: Bob, you were saying...\nRobert Frenzel: Add one more opportunity, right? And on the SPP side, while they haven't been as outspoken and probably aren't as long as the process, as Ben mentioned earlier, that region of the country is renewables rich, has the opportunity to be an energy exporter to the country, and that's going to need transmission investment. So we think the MISO studies will provide some, I'll call it, no regrets projects early. But MISO and SPP also are going to have a lot more longer-dated capital projects to enable the resource-rich regions of this country to export to either the East or the West Coast. And we have a lot of ROFRs in place. So that's the other thing. We really -- we have right of first refusals, as you probably know, in some of our key states. So excited about it. Yes.\nStephen Byrd: So adding these together, I guess, if the combination of it, you get federal support in the form of an extension of tax credits for wind and solar, maybe new storage tax credit. That really helps reduce the cost in the second half of the decade anyway because you already have kind of a visibility on those tax credits in the first half, and that lines up with potentially, for example, more transmission spending in place like MISO so that could kind of work together.\nRobert Frenzel: Yes, I mean, I think we had some pretty conservative numbers in our resource plans on how -- what the price point would be by 2030, and it's very affordable. Now if you have this, it becomes that much more affordable, creating the headroom to, again, make those investments in the grid that we'll be able to do and keep our product affordable, which opens up electrification opportunities in other sectors.\nStephen Byrd: That's really helpful. One just follow-up. You've -- in your resource plans, you've often talked about sort of the role of energy storage versus the role of peaking generation. You've raised a lot of good points about storage has a kind of limited duration, and you really do need peaking generation to ride through extended periods where renewables output might be low, for example. But I was just curious, as you think about the evolution of cost for storage, the potential for a federal tax credit for storage, would that sort of tip the balance a little bit more towards storage, a little bit less peaking? Or how are you all thinking about sort of the trade-offs between the two technologies?\nBen Fowke: Well, I think it's one of the reasons why, for example, in the Colorado resource plan, we -- I think we called for 1,300 megawatts of flexible resources. That's in addition to identified 400 megawatts of storage. So we'll let the economics aside, if it's gas or if it's batteries. That said, there are still going to be limitations to how much you can rely on batteries for longer term durations, like Winter Storm Uri. You need more than 4-hour battery storage or even 8 hours. But to the extent that it becomes affordable, I mean, we will definitely have more batteries on our system.\nRobert Frenzel: Stephen, there's legislation in Colorado that's moving around innovative technology for pilot programs on dispatchable, zero-carbon assets, long duration storage, and any one of those can solve the reliability and affordability needs of our customers. Right now, we look at what's available in the market, and that's short duration storage, 4, 8 hour stuff or gas CTs, but you might find a hydrogen fired opportunity or a long-dated energy storage opportunity that comes out of work -- that we're working on with EEI and other organizations over the next decade. So we can be flexible at this point. We don't have to build that stuff today. But over time, we're betting with technology, not against it.\nOperator: Now we'll take a question from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.\nDurgesh Chopra: I just wanted to clarify one thing, Brian. On the 2021 guidance slide, the lower depreciation expense, I think you explained it well, but just so I have it correct. So essentially you're deferring the depreciation expense on the balance sheet. And that's what's driving the expense lower and you're going to get recovery of it over the longer term? Is that what's going on?\nBrian Van Abel: Yes, Durgesh, it really is just the timing. Previously, we thought we'd get the Texas rate case order by the end of this year, so you'd recognize the revenue and the expense with it. Now given that procedural schedule is in Q1 in next year, so we just defer that expense for this year because we have a laid back date to March. So earnings neutral, but just a change in our expenses there.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. Okay. And then maybe just can you comment on the time line for recovery? It sounds like you're not asking for carrying costs on the storm Uri impacts. But maybe just time line for recovery of those dollars. I mean, you've got, I believe, authorization in one of your opcos, but just what to look for there in terms of time line and recovery?\nBrian Van Abel: Yes. So yes, you're right. In Wisconsin, it's over a 9-month period. But generally, what we've proposed in Minnesota and Colorado is over 2 years and really looking to help mitigate the bill impacts on our customers. So I think of that over the next couple of years, we'll work through the proceedings here in the summer. And we're also not asking our customers to recover those carrying costs because they're really trying to overall help mitigate the bill impacts. And we have a slide in there where it's over two years, it's anywhere from $2 to $10. So really looking at how we can help our customers here.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. So you said a decision on sort of the Colorado, Minnesota is during summer?\nBrian Van Abel: It should be, yes, yes, later this summer.\nOperator: Moving on to a question from Travis Miller with Morningstar.\nTravis Miller: Back to the Colorado pathway, I saw earlier this week that it was put on, I don't know what I think about as the anointed list of nationwide top transmission projects. I don't know what other words you can call it. But yes, how does that change kind of how you discuss this with regulators, the probability of getting the project approved. And then even beyond that, the probability of getting that incremental investment being on that list?\nBen Fowke: Well, I mean, I think -- I don't know how much it helps, but I mean the reception, as I mentioned before, has been very favorable to the project, and it's very much tied to our ability to hit those, I think, remarkable interim goals that we're shooting for in Colorado. So Brian or Bob, I don't know if you have anything to add to that.\nRobert Frenzel: No. Look, I think the initial reception to the filing was well received. We expect that filing to proceed alongside our resource plan, which as Ben mentioned, calls for more than 4,000 or 5,000 megawatts of renewables in the state of Colorado. And when we filed that plan, we had transmission owners in the state of Colorado alongside of us, very supportive, very excited about the opportunity, not only for us to hit our goals, but we're going to help state hit its goals with other energy providers in the state, being able to access the transmission for their renewable goals.  At this point, I think going to be -- we're going to build and own that pathway right now. It's our expectation that our owners are -- the other transmission owners are supportive. But at this point, I think they've declined to participate in the construction and ownership and operation of that asset. That could change over time. But right now, that's how we expect to move forward.\nTravis Miller: Okay. Just real quick one clarification on that additional investment. So the plan would be $1.7 billion, is that -- again, just remind me that's what you've filed for and then there could be another $1 billion or does the extra $1 billion included in that $1.7 billion?\nBrian Van Abel: Yes. The way I think about it, Travis, is, I'll call it the base double loop 345 circuit on the Eastern Plains of Colorado is about $1.7 billion. There's an additional extension on that loop that would drop it down into the southeastern most part of Colorado. That's another couple of hundred million dollars, $300 million. And then once we get the resource plan approved, and we know where assets are going to get firmly located, then we need to come back and look at how much voltage support we might need for those assets, where they're going to be specifically located and that comes with incremental capital costs.  But again, as Ben said, you take the renewables, you take the pathway, and it's probably an $8 billion initiative in Colorado, all going to keep our bills at or below the rate of inflation in Colorado. Really exciting to be able to transition that state to an 85% carbon reduction, 80% renewable penetration at that low cost.\nTravis Miller: Okay. Great. And if I could sneak one more in there on the project. What are your thoughts on suggestions about investment tax credits for certain high priority transmission projects or federal-backed loans? What are your thoughts in terms of that support?\nRobert Frenzel: Yes. Look, I think Ben captured it early in the conversation, but we've got a plan that's very affordable and reliable for our customers. Any incentives that come with that plan, make it more affordable and more -- and the opportunity to then look at other opportunities to accelerate either our own portfolio or potentially accelerate stuff like electric vehicles in the states and keeping customers' energy bills lower. So I think on balance, it's helpful. But we think we can do it at a very affordable price with or without it. And it's not contingent on legislation passing at the federal level.\nOperator: Now we'll take a question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: I'll make it quick and just to rehash this transmission point, I just want to just make sure we hear you clearly on this. With respect to the MISO process, what's your level of confidence on this looking more like MVP of the last decade versus being this future 1 proposal being the start of a fairly protracted effort to get these discrete projects underway? Obviously, these have been fairly contentious at times. So I just want to understand your sense of confidence around sort of a near-term reflection in processes of these projects.\nBen Fowke: Well, I mean, I'll let Brian and Bob comment, Julien, but I mean, it's going to take time. I mean, that's part of -- that's -- in Colorado, that's the advantage of -- we ultimately might be in an RTO, but you can definitely move quicker when you're not in an RTO process. So I recognize it's going to take time, but the need is compelling, and it will get done. And how it gets built and how it's allocated. I think it's important to keep in mind that we do have a right of first refusal in Minnesota. And I think that's very helpful. And I think we've got a demonstrated track record of building transmission at a very good cost. So I don't know if I'm answering your question fully. So I don't know if Brian and Bob have any additional commentary they'd like to share.\nRobert Frenzel: Julien, it's Bob. I think about it in tranches. There's probably some no regret stuff that come out of MTEP21. I think we'll probably see more transmission expansion planning through MISO that will get to maybe some of the harder stuff as you're mentioning. So the MVP projects were a point in time and lined up very well. I think that there's some projects that MISO and the transmission owners in MISO recognize or needed sooner rather than later. And I think that's the stuff you'll see come out of MTEP21. And I am hopeful in working with the MISO that we'll see those by the end of the year. I think there's more -- when they talk about the large numbers, $30 billion, $100 billion, that stuff could take a little longer, might be a little bit more contentious. But as Ben said, absolutely positively need this to meet state's goals and company's goals, and I think it will happen.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: All right. Excellent. And guys, one further follow-up, if I can. It might be somewhat evident, but the decision to file in Colorado here, do you want to walk through that a little bit? I'll leave it open-ended. And especially on earning your ROE.\nBrian Van Abel: Yes, Julien. I mean, we look at a couple of things, right? We had originally filed for an AGIS rider and a wildfire rider. We still have our deferral on AGIS CPCN costs, and we have a deferral on our wildfire investments. But really, we're putting those on our balance sheet. You don't want those deferrals to get too large. So that's one piece of it. But also we have some regulatory lag in the Colorado electric jurisdiction. And so as we look at it and look at that and look at kind of how the economies are really coming out of COVID and in terms of the strength we're starting to see there that I think it's really the time to file. And I add to that, we talk about our advanced meter investments that we're making in Colorado, and we're really ramping that up this year of deploying about 400,000 meters, is the first large deployment. And again, it's about getting that cash in the door versus deferral on it and putting it on our balance sheet and kind of kicking the can down the road.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: All right. Great. But I'll put it this way, you expect to be able to earn relatively close to your authorized into the future, wherever that may land?\nBrian Van Abel: I would expect we'd close that gap, right? This -- I mean, we'll file this case here this summer, but we won't get an outcome until next year. So you will see some regulatory lag in Colorado this year and improvement next year as we get those rates into effect.\nOperator: Moving on to a question from Paul Fremont with Mizuho.\nPaul Fremont: Congratulations, number one. Number two, if I look at Colorado pathway, how would you allocate the $700 million of investment? Would it be fairly even for the period '21 through '25? Is it back-end loaded? I just want to get a sense of when that $700 million would hit.\nBrian Van Abel: Yes. Paul, I think of it more kind of in the -- a little bit more back-end loaded. You'd have a little bit of spend as we go through the recovery -- we go through the proceeding, get an approval late this year. And so you start to spend next year, but really the ramp-up is in the back half of our 5-year forecast.\nPaul Fremont: Great. So like the last two years, is most -- it would be the lion's share?\nBrian Van Abel: Yes. That's a fair way to think about it.\nOperator: Next question is from Ryan Levine, Citi.\nRyan Levine: I was hoping to just follow-up on some of the comments on the PPA buyouts. Curious how those potential future transactions have been progressing and what the pace is? And in the context of the Biden infrastructure plan and the Biden bill, if any of the tax provisions there could accelerate or decelerate some of the opportunities for PPA ties?\nBrian Van Abel: Ryan, yes, good question. I think, I take a step back and say, we've delivered. If we look at what we've delivered or have pending approval is about $750 million of CapEx related to PPA buyouts. And that's -- and we've if you look at the amount of customer savings, it's comparable to that. So it's been a great strategy for our customers and a great strategy for us. And now you've heard me talk about, we'll continue to stay in contact with our counterparties and still think up to $500 million to $1 billion of PPA buyout opportunities are absolutely possible.  And I think about what we could see coming out of the potential infrastructure plan with a longer-term extension of credits, now I look at what we've been. The 2 wind farm PPA buyouts that we have approved in Minnesota, they were PPA buyouts with the repowering, and that repowering with an additional 10 years of PTCs helps us deliver affordable projects and customer savings. And so I think that absolutely presents an opportunity over the longer-term if we get a long-term extension of credit. So we'll continue to look for the opportunities and we'll transact when we find an opportunity where it works for our customers and works for our shareholders.\nRobert Frenzel: Ryan, it's Bob. I'll just say that as we move through the resource planning process in both Colorado and Minnesota, those are other opportunities that present themselves during those proceedings. And so as Brian said, we still got a goal to execute on this strategy, and we think there's opportunity.\nRyan Levine: And then on a similar vein in the context of some of the EV incentives or federal build-out, curious your thoughts on how that could impact your business and impact to some of the service territories if some of those broader federal mandates were to be rolled out?\nBen Fowke: Well, I think it's very supportive of the goal we have for getting EVs on the road and everything that comes with that. And one of the things that we all know is that the range anxieties that consumers have, justifiably so, would certainly be diminished if you had 500,000 charging stations out there as proposed under the plan. So it's only going to be helpful, and EVs are great load for us, and they benefit all customers. And really, I think we're pioneering subscription rates and other things that encourage, not required, but encourage customers to charge off peak. And I think that minimizes the -- we'll have infrastructure needs, but that will minimize it again for the benefit of all customers, keeping prices low. And I just think the economics associated with the electrification of transport are pretty compelling. And this is only going to help accelerate that. So it's very positive.\nRyan Levine: Is there any numbers you can put around the potential CapEx around additional infrastructure that Xcel may have to deploy to support the federal EV programs, if they were to be passed?\nBrian Van Abel: Yes, Ryan, the way we think about it, right, we have -- our stated goal for Xcel is 1.5 million EVs in our service territory by 2030. And that's about 20% penetration of EVs. And with that, we have $500 million of capital in our current 5-year forecast. And I would say we have some industry-leading EV programs with what we're accomplishing in Colorado and Minnesota and really helping our states reduce carbon emissions in the transport sector. Then we kind of pivot to the back half of that forecast. So it's another about $1.5 billion in terms of estimates. And that's for that 20% penetration. And if the federal incentives help drive that penetration faster, you can kind of ratably, I would say, scale that up. So we view it as a really good opportunity here longer-term as we pivot and help take out the carbon emissions from the transport sector with how clean our fleet is.\nBen Fowke: All contributed to keeping the prices low, too. I mean, because, again, EVs, even if you don't own one, somebody that does helps with our programs, all customers will benefit from that, and that tends to increase the denominator and keep costs low, which, again, that's the virtuous cycle, allows us to make other investments.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude your question-and-answer session. I will turn the call back to Brian Van Abel, CFO, for closing remarks.\nBrian Van Abel: Thank you all for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference for today. We do thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Robert Frenzel",
            "content": "Stephen, it's Bob here. Good to hear from you. Look, with MISO and their MTEP21 plan, we expect all transmission owners to work through the process at MISO over the course of 2021. Ultimately, with a goal of by the end of the year, coming out with a series of recommended projects all over the territory. Obviously, being one of the largest TOs in MISO, transmission owners, we'd expect a lot of those projects to be in our service territory areas, particularly since those are the high-density renewable areas in the territories as well. So that goes forward.  Those projects are generally long-dated items, and we don't have capital for new major transmission lines in MISO in our 5-year forecast. But when Ben talks about the elongation of our growth and the investment that this industry needs to make the clean energy transition, we see that as the back half of the decade that's going to perpetuate the growth profile that we shared earlier. Add one more opportunity, right? And on the SPP side, while they haven't been as outspoken and probably aren't as long as the process, as Ben mentioned earlier, that region of the country is renewables rich, has the opportunity to be an energy exporter to the country, and that's going to need transmission investment. So we think the MISO studies will provide some, I'll call it, no regrets projects early. But MISO and SPP also are going to have a lot more longer-dated capital projects to enable the resource-rich regions of this country to export to either the East or the West Coast. And we have a lot of ROFRs in place. So that's the other thing. We really -- we have right of first refusals, as you probably know, in some of our key states. So excited about it. Yes. Yes, I mean, I think we had some pretty conservative numbers in our resource plans on how -- what the price point would be by 2030, and it's very affordable. Now if you have this, it becomes that much more affordable, creating the headroom to, again, make those investments in the grid that we'll be able to do and keep our product affordable, which opens up electrification opportunities in other sectors. Stephen, there's legislation in Colorado that's moving around innovative technology for pilot programs on dispatchable, zero-carbon assets, long duration storage, and any one of those can solve the reliability and affordability needs of our customers. Right now, we look at what's available in the market, and that's short duration storage, 4, 8 hour stuff or gas CTs, but you might find a hydrogen fired opportunity or a long-dated energy storage opportunity that comes out of work -- that we're working on with EEI and other organizations over the next decade. So we can be flexible at this point. We don't have to build that stuff today. But over time, we're betting with technology, not against it. No. Look, I think the initial reception to the filing was well received. We expect that filing to proceed alongside our resource plan, which as Ben mentioned, calls for more than 4,000 or 5,000 megawatts of renewables in the state of Colorado. And when we filed that plan, we had transmission owners in the state of Colorado alongside of us, very supportive, very excited about the opportunity, not only for us to hit our goals, but we're going to help state hit its goals with other energy providers in the state, being able to access the transmission for their renewable goals.  At this point, I think going to be -- we're going to build and own that pathway right now. It's our expectation that our owners are -- the other transmission owners are supportive. But at this point, I think they've declined to participate in the construction and ownership and operation of that asset. That could change over time. But right now, that's how we expect to move forward. Yes. Look, I think Ben captured it early in the conversation, but we've got a plan that's very affordable and reliable for our customers. Any incentives that come with that plan, make it more affordable and more -- and the opportunity to then look at other opportunities to accelerate either our own portfolio or potentially accelerate stuff like electric vehicles in the states and keeping customers' energy bills lower. So I think on balance, it's helpful. But we think we can do it at a very affordable price with or without it. And it's not contingent on legislation passing at the federal level. Julien, it's Bob. I think about it in tranches. There's probably some no regret stuff that come out of MTEP21. I think we'll probably see more transmission expansion planning through MISO that will get to maybe some of the harder stuff as you're mentioning. So the MVP projects were a point in time and lined up very well. I think that there's some projects that MISO and the transmission owners in MISO recognize or needed sooner rather than later. And I think that's the stuff you'll see come out of MTEP21. And I am hopeful in working with the MISO that we'll see those by the end of the year. I think there's more -- when they talk about the large numbers, $30 billion, $100 billion, that stuff could take a little longer, might be a little bit more contentious. But as Ben said, absolutely positively need this to meet state's goals and company's goals, and I think it will happen. Ryan, it's Bob. I'll just say that as we move through the resource planning process in both Colorado and Minnesota, those are other opportunities that present themselves during those proceedings. And so as Brian said, we still got a goal to execute on this strategy, and we think there's opportunity."

            "name": "Ben Fowke",
            "content": "Well, thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported strong first quarter earnings of $0.67 per share compared with $0.56 per share last year. We're off to a good start, and we are reaffirming our 2021 guidance range. But I want to start out by thanking our employees for their outstanding work to ensure that our customers did not experience any material outages during Winter Storm Uri. I'm proud of our strong performance of our power plants, and our electric and natural gas systems during that serious event. I think there are a lot of lessons learned from Uri, the need to invest in resiliency, the increased interdependency between the gas and electric sectors and the need to have 24/7 dispatchable generation available are a few that come to mind.  So despite strong operational performance, we incurred $1 billion of incremental fuel costs during the winter storm. It's important to recognize that we followed all the policies and procedures regarding natural gas purchasing and hedging as approved by regulators in our states. We're in the process of seeking recovery for incremental fuel cost and we'll propose to defer the cost recovery over 1 year or 2 to mitigate the impact on our customers.  Well turning to our investment plans. In February, we filed our proposal to buy out a repowered 120-megawatt wind PPA from ALLETE for $210 million. The buyout will save our customers money while extending the life of our renewable energy resource. We also filed our proposal to build 460 megawatts of solar facilities near our retiring Sherco Coal plant for an estimated investment of $575 million. The project takes advantage of existing transmission and will bring good, high-paying local construction jobs to our economy.  We requested a commission decision on both projects later this year and are confident the commission will see the customer and economic benefits. In March, we filed our resource plan in Colorado, which details our plans to reduce carbon emissions by 85% and increase renewables to 80% of our fuel mix by 2030. The plan includes the early retirement of 2 coal units at Hayden in 2027 and 2028, the conversion of Pawnee to natural gas in 2028, the early retirement of Comanche 3 in 2040 with reduced operations beginning in 2030. Now under the plan, we will add 2,300 megawatts of wind, 1,600 megawatts of universal scale solar, 400 megawatts of storage, 1,300 megawatts of flexible resources and 1,200 megawatts of distributed solar resources through our renewable energy programs.  In addition, we are continuing to make progress on the Minnesota resource plan and expect a decision later this year. Between the Minnesota and Colorado resource plans, we anticipate adding nearly 10,000 megawatts of renewables to our system to meet our 80% carbon reduction goal by 2030. We also filed our pathway transmission expansion plan in Colorado. The proposal request approval to build 560 miles of 345 kV transmission lines creating a backbone that will enable 5,500 megawatts of incremental renewables and help Colorado achieve its 2030 carbon reduction goals. The estimated cost of the backbone is $1.7 billion, with an incremental investment of up to $1 billion for network upgrades, voltage support and addition transmission line and interconnection work. We expect decisions on the Colorado pathway project later this year.  Turning to the NSP system. MISO recently presented its long-range transmission planning roadmap, which identified potential scenarios for future system development based on constrained areas and options for regional transmission expansion. This conceptional roadmap highlighted an initial set of projects in the MISO footprint, which could drive $30 billion of investment and a full rollout could result in up to $100 billion of investment. While this is very preliminary, a high level conceptual framework, it does highlight the need for significant transmission over the next 15 years. The transmission expansion and resource plans will provide transparency into our long-term opportunities and will likely lead to robust capital investment in the second half of this decade.  Now as you know, one of my highest priorities is ensuring Xcel Energy is a positive force for racial justice and reconciliation. We are deeply committed to supporting our communities in advancing racial equity, rebuilding following civil unrest and addressing COVID-19 impacts, which continue to disproportionately affect black communities. I'm proud that our company is engaged in a community dialogue and we are investing in organizations that are having a real impact. We've got more work to do as a company, a community, and a country towards creating a more just society. But by working together, we can all be part of the solution.  We're also proud of the recognition we're receiving for our actions. For example, Xcel Energy was named among the world's most admired companies by Fortune Magazine for the eighth consecutive year, ranking second among gas and electric companies. And we continue to be cited as a top company for LGBTQ equality, earning a perfect score in the human rights campaign's 2021 Corporate Equality Index and a Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality designation for the fifth consecutive year.  So with that, I'll turn it over to Brian. Well, yes, I mean, I think the response has been very favorable. And I think there's a recognition that if we're going to achieve, in the case of Colorado, an 85% carbon reduction with almost 80% of it coming from renewable energy, that we're going to need a strong backbone to be able to do that. And Jeremy, when you factor in the price of all that, it still comes out in an incredibly affordable price point for our customers, which quite frankly, might be made all the more affordable with some of the policies that are coming out of the Biden Infrastructure Plan.  If you think about it, if we -- if the extension of PTCs, the direct refundability, the normalization opt-out for solar, an ITC for transmission, that promises to make our plan, which, of course, includes 10,000 megawatts of renewables, that much more affordable for our customers. And when you keep your product affordable, you create headroom for additional investments in the grid, like the transmission you're referring to. So I'm really optimistic that we've got a tremendous opportunity in front of us with transmission aided by the policies that I mentioned that will keep the price point low. And that's in all of our regions. The MISO studies are preliminary, but I think you can see that, that's an enormous investment opportunity. And hopefully, the slides we've attached for you are helpful in demonstrating where some of that build could happen. Well, we firmly believe we can be in the upper half of that 5% to 7% range. The things I'm describing only are helpful for that. But I mean you made a great point. When we talk about a long-term growth rate, we're not talking about 3 to 5 years, we're talking about a long time. So I'm quite confident that the opportunities we have in front of us will give you -- should give you comfort that we've got transparent plans to hit that. And again, we believe that we can be in the upper range of that range, upper half, right. Stephen, I'd just add that -- I would just add that the throttle has always been the cost to the consumer. And as I mentioned to a question earlier, we already had an affordable plan. I mean, taking advantage of very low-cost renewables, which even with transmission build, that still is great for our customers. You make that even less expensive, more affordable with the tax policies that are -- that I think have a pretty good shot of getting passed. And that's creating a lot of headroom for our investment, while keeping our product affordable, allowing us to then focus on things like electrification, which is also going to get ramped up with -- under the Biden administration proposal. It really is, I think, very, very bullish for Xcel Energy and great for our customers. I'm really excited about it. Well, I think it's one of the reasons why, for example, in the Colorado resource plan, we -- I think we called for 1,300 megawatts of flexible resources. That's in addition to identified 400 megawatts of storage. So we'll let the economics aside, if it's gas or if it's batteries. That said, there are still going to be limitations to how much you can rely on batteries for longer term durations, like Winter Storm Uri. You need more than 4-hour battery storage or even 8 hours. But to the extent that it becomes affordable, I mean, we will definitely have more batteries on our system. Well, I mean, I think -- I don't know how much it helps, but I mean the reception, as I mentioned before, has been very favorable to the project, and it's very much tied to our ability to hit those, I think, remarkable interim goals that we're shooting for in Colorado. So Brian or Bob, I don't know if you have anything to add to that. Well, I mean, I'll let Brian and Bob comment, Julien, but I mean, it's going to take time. I mean, that's part of -- that's -- in Colorado, that's the advantage of -- we ultimately might be in an RTO, but you can definitely move quicker when you're not in an RTO process. So I recognize it's going to take time, but the need is compelling, and it will get done. And how it gets built and how it's allocated. I think it's important to keep in mind that we do have a right of first refusal in Minnesota. And I think that's very helpful. And I think we've got a demonstrated track record of building transmission at a very good cost. So I don't know if I'm answering your question fully. So I don't know if Brian and Bob have any additional commentary they'd like to share. Well, I think it's very supportive of the goal we have for getting EVs on the road and everything that comes with that. And one of the things that we all know is that the range anxieties that consumers have, justifiably so, would certainly be diminished if you had 500,000 charging stations out there as proposed under the plan. So it's only going to be helpful, and EVs are great load for us, and they benefit all customers.

            "name": "Brian Van Abel",
            "content": "Thanks, Ben. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We had a good start to the year, booking $0.67 per share compared to $0.56 per share last year. Most significant earnings drivers for the year include the following: higher electric and natural gas margins increased earnings by $0.18 per share, primarily driven by riders and rate outcomes to recover our capital investments and increase margin from our small trading operation, reflecting higher market prices. In addition, a lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.06 per share. As a reminder, though, production tax credits lower the ETR. PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin and are largely earnings neutral.  Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation and interest expense which reduced earnings by $0.09 per share, reflecting our capital investment program. Lower AFUDC decreased earnings by $0.02 per share, largely due to placing several larger wind farms into service last year. In addition, other items combined to decrease earnings by $0.02 per share.  Turning to sales. Weather and leap year adjusted electric sales declined by 1.9% in the first quarter. Our sales forecast assumed that there was a lingering impact from COVID-19, and we expected a slight decline in Q1. However, the adverse impacts of COVID on sales were largely felt starting in the second quarter of last year. As a result, we anticipate a positive quarter-over-quarter sales comparison next quarter. And for the year, we continue to anticipate modest weather-adjusted sales growth of approximately 1%. Shifting to expenses. O&M increased slightly for the quarter. We expect annual O&M expenses to be relatively flat in 2021, reflecting incremental costs for new wind farms, offset by a decline in base O&M.  Now turning to our regulatory filings. In January, we filed a New Mexico electric rate case seeking a net rate increase of $48 million after reflecting fuel savings and PTCs from the Sagamore wind farm. A commission decision and implementation of final rates are anticipated in the fourth quarter of this year. In February, we filed a Texas electric rate case seeking a net rate increase of $74 million after reflecting fuel savings and PTCs from the Sagamore wind farm. A commission decision is expected in the first quarter of 2022 with a surcharge back to March 2021.  The Texas and New Mexico rate cases are driven by the Sagamore wind farm, investment in transmission and distribution due to significant growth, the loss of a wholesale customer, changes in depreciation to reflect the planned early retirement of our coal plant, a requested ROE of 10.35% and an equity ratio of 54.6%. In November 2020, we filed a request in North Dakota seeking an electric rate increase of approximately $19 million based on a requested ROE of 10.2% and an equity ratio of 52.5%. Interim rates were implemented in January and the decision is expected later this year.  As far as future filings go, we anticipate filing a Colorado electric rate case this summer with rates going into effect in the first half of 2022. We are working with parties to reach settlement agreements regarding our plans for Wisconsin rate case. And finally, we also anticipate filing a Minnesota electric rate case in November, with interim rates going into effect in January of 2022.  Shifting to renewables. We continue to achieve important milestones in our PPA buyout strategy. In March, we closed on the acquisition of the 99-megawatt repowered Mower wind farm. We expect Mower will provide significant customer savings in carbon reduction for our customers. We've gotten off to a great start for the year and are reaffirming our 2021 earnings guidance of $2.90 to $3 per share. We've updated our guidance assumptions, and we expect incremental interest expense due to the lag in recovery of the $1 billion of unplanned fuel costs associated with Winter Storm Uri. As we work with our commissions to recover the fuel costs, we're not seeking to recover the carrying costs from our customers, as we help to manage the overall bill impacts. We continue to expect to deliver earnings around the midpoint of the guidance range.  With that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. We continue to execute on our PPA buyout strategy with the acquisition of the Mower wind farm and filing of the elite PPA repowering buyout. We filed our solar proposal in Minnesota. We filed our Colorado resource plan and transmission expansion plan, which will provide transparency into our long-term opportunities and will likely lead to robust capital investment in the second half of the decade. We reaffirmed our guidance range and finally, we remain confident we can deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within our 5% to 7% objective range.  This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions. Yes. Jeremy. Yes, good question. I think from a -- we talk about -- I'll talk about SPS specifically, when we talk about a little bit broader. We're in touch with our major customers in the oil patch area, and I would say they're cautiously optimistic. And we monitor some of our substations that serve those loads specifically, and they're reaching pre-pandemic levels. So that's a good sign. We're also hearing from them that there's a -- from the oil majors, that there's a big focus on electrifying rigs and pumps as they look at ways they can improve their carbon footprint.  So I would say, optimistic with what we're hearing down there. Overall, I think our territories, we're starting to come out of the COVID restrictions. And we have no restrictions in the Dakotas in Wisconsin and Texas, and Minnesota and Colorado are starting to ease up. In Minnesota here, we're at about a 75% capacity for bars and restaurants. So we look at all the leading indicators in our economies. And I would say there's positive growth in signs for this year. And I think we feel pretty good about our 1% year-over-year sales growth on the electric side. Yes, Durgesh, it really is just the timing. Previously, we thought we'd get the Texas rate case order by the end of this year, so you'd recognize the revenue and the expense with it. Now given that procedural schedule is in Q1 in next year, so we just defer that expense for this year because we have a laid back date to March. So earnings neutral, but just a change in our expenses there. Yes. So yes, you're right. In Wisconsin, it's over a 9-month period. But generally, what we've proposed in Minnesota and Colorado is over 2 years and really looking to help mitigate the bill impacts on our customers. So I think of that over the next couple of years, we'll work through the proceedings here in the summer. And we're also not asking our customers to recover those carrying costs because they're really trying to overall help mitigate the bill impacts. And we have a slide in there where it's over two years, it's anywhere from $2 to $10. So really looking at how we can help our customers here. It should be, yes, yes, later this summer. Yes. The way I think about it, Travis, is, I'll call it the base double loop 345 circuit on the Eastern Plains of Colorado is about $1.7 billion. There's an additional extension on that loop that would drop it down into the southeastern most part of Colorado. That's another couple of hundred million dollars, $300 million. And then once we get the resource plan approved, and we know where assets are going to get firmly located, then we need to come back and look at how much voltage support we might need for those assets, where they're going to be specifically located and that comes with incremental capital costs.  But again, as Ben said, you take the renewables, you take the pathway, and it's probably an $8 billion initiative in Colorado, all going to keep our bills at or below the rate of inflation in Colorado. Really exciting to be able to transition that state to an 85% carbon reduction, 80% renewable penetration at that low cost. Yes, Julien. I mean, we look at a couple of things, right? We had originally filed for an AGIS rider and a wildfire rider. We still have our deferral on AGIS CPCN costs, and we have a deferral on our wildfire investments. But really, we're putting those on our balance sheet. You don't want those deferrals to get too large. So that's one piece of it. But also we have some regulatory lag in the Colorado electric jurisdiction. And so as we look at it and look at that and look at kind of how the economies are really coming out of COVID and in terms of the strength we're starting to see there that I think it's really the time to file. And I add to that, we talk about our advanced meter investments that we're making in Colorado, and we're really ramping that up this year of deploying about 400,000 meters, is the first large deployment. And again, it's about getting that cash in the door versus deferral on it and putting it on our balance sheet and kind of kicking the can down the road. I would expect we'd close that gap, right? This -- I mean, we'll file this case here this summer, but we won't get an outcome until next year. So you will see some regulatory lag in Colorado this year and improvement next year as we get those rates into effect. Yes. Paul, I think of it more kind of in the -- a little bit more back-end loaded. You'd have a little bit of spend as we go through the recovery -- we go through the proceeding, get an approval late this year. And so you start to spend next year, but really the ramp-up is in the back half of our 5-year forecast. Yes. That's a fair way to think about it. Ryan, yes, good question. I think, I take a step back and say, we've delivered. If we look at what we've delivered or have pending approval is about $750 million of CapEx related to PPA buyouts. And that's -- and we've if you look at the amount of customer savings, it's comparable to that. So it's been a great strategy for our customers and a great strategy for us. And now you've heard me talk about, we'll continue to stay in contact with our counterparties and still think up to $500 million to $1 billion of PPA buyout opportunities are absolutely possible.  And I think about what we could see coming out of the potential infrastructure plan with a longer-term extension of credits, now I look at what we've been. The 2 wind farm PPA buyouts that we have approved in Minnesota, they were PPA buyouts with the repowering, and that repowering with an additional 10 years of PTCs helps us deliver affordable projects and customer savings. And so I think that absolutely presents an opportunity over the longer-term if we get a long-term extension of credit. So we'll continue to look for the opportunities and we'll transact when we find an opportunity where it works for our customers and works for our shareholders. Yes, Ryan, the way we think about it, right, we have -- our stated goal for Xcel is 1.5 million EVs in our service territory by 2030. And that's about 20% penetration of EVs. And with that, we have $500 million of capital in our current 5-year forecast. And I would say we have some industry-leading EV programs with what we're accomplishing in Colorado and Minnesota and really helping our states reduce carbon emissions in the transport sector. Then we kind of pivot to the back half of that forecast. So it's another about $1.5 billion in terms of estimates. And that's for that 20% penetration. And if the federal incentives help drive that penetration faster, you can kind of ratably, I would say, scale that up. So we view it as a really good opportunity here longer-term as we pivot and help take out the carbon emissions from the transport sector with how clean our fleet is. Thank you all for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions."

Questions will be taken from institutional investors, reporters can contact media relations with inquiries and individual investors and others can reach out to Investor Relations. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to your host today, Mr. Paul Johnson, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.\nPaul Johnson: Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2022 fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Bob Frenzel, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer questions if needed. This morning we will review our 2022 results and highlights and share recent business developments and regulatory developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder, some of our comments during today's call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our SEC filings. Today, we will also discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures. Information on the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release. I'll now turn the call over to Bob Frenzel.\nBob Frenzel: Thanks Paul, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter call. We had another very successful year at Xcel Energy, continuing to execute on our strategy while delivering strong financial and operational performance. For our investors, we delivered EPS of $3.17 representing the 18th consecutive year of meeting or exceeding our initial earnings guidance. In February, we raised our annual dividend for the 19th straight year increasing at $0.12 per share or 6.6%. More recently, in November, we extended our long-term investment plan which features a 10-year capital outlook with an approximate 7% rate base growth. We ranked in the top quartile in customer reliability or CAIDI and our residential electric builds are more than 20% below the national average. And amidst the backdrop of significant commodity increases this year, Xcel Energy's 4,500 megawatts of owned wind farms continue to be an industry-leader in net capacity factor performance, generated approximately $1 billion of fuel-related customer savings in 2022 and almost $3 billion since 2017. Our nuclear fleet remains the top performing fleet in the country and achieved a capacity factor of 96% last year. We had an active regulatory year and resolved multiple rate cases and Uri storm cost recovery proceedings. The commissions in Minnesota and Colorado approved resource plans that will add nearly 10,000 megawatts of utility scale renewables to our systems through this decade. The Minnesota Commission approved our 460 megawatt Sherco Solar project. The Colorado Commission approved our $2 billion Power Pathway transmission project and MISO awarded us $1.2 billion of transmission projects and we accelerated our timeline for transitioning out of coal and now expect to be coal free by the end of 2030, all of which contribute to our leadership in clean energy transition for our customers. We continue to lead in carbon reduction as well. In 2022, our estimated carbon emissions were approximately 52% below 2005 levels and we remain on track to achieve 80% carbon reduction across the company by 2030. The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act will reduce the cost of renewables for our customers, improves cash flow and credit metrics for the company and enhances the competitiveness of our renewable offerings. We continue to execute on our electric vehicle vision, implementing multiple new programs for our customers. We also filed comprehensive transportation plans in Minnesota and Wisconsin that are pending commission approval. We've advanced our ESG leadership and have been recognized by multiple entities, including an upgraded rating by MSCI from AA to AAA. And finally, we were named among the world's most ethical, admired and responsible companies and we're recognized for being the best veteran employer as well as for our disability inclusion in the workplace. I'm really proud to lead a team that can deliver on operational, financial, environmental and diversity goals, all simultaneously. Looking ahead, we're well-positioned for sustainable organic growth over the next decade, including affordable renewable additions in our resource plans, the transmission needed to enable those carbon-free resources and responsible community transitions as we retire our coal plants. We've recently issued a requests for proposals in Minnesota, Colorado and at SPS seeking approximately 6,000 megawatts of new renewable generation, a portion of the 10,000 megawatts that have been approved in our jurisdiction. We'll submit our recommended portfolios of generation assets to our commissions by the middle of this year and anticipate decisions in the second half of this year. We also expect to issue additional RFPs in Minnesota and Colorado this year and next year for the remainder of our approved needs. As we've discussed in the past, we believe that we have a geographical advantage in the clean energy transition due to the strong wind and solar resources in our service territory. This access to low cost renewable energy should also give us further advantage in developing green hydrogen and other clean fuel projects, which are becoming more feasible as a result of federal support from the Infrastructure and Jobs Act and the IRA. Late last year, we submitted hydrogen hub concept papers for both the Rocky Mountain and the Upper Midwest regions to the Department of Energy to compete for awards from the $8 billion hydrogen hub program. In December, we received favorable notice from the DOE for our concepts and we're encouraged to submit full applications in April. In addition, our pink hydrogen production pilot at our Prairie Island nuclear generating station is expected to be operational this year. Finally, we expect to bring forward opportunities this year to utilize clean fuels and green hydrogen blending at both our gas-fired generation stations and in our gas networks for Home and Building heating. As we continue to utilize innovative technologies to decarbonize our business, we are well-positioned to take advantage of potentially significant hydrogen capital investment opportunities in the future. As the penetration of renewable assets in our states increases, we're also interested in pursuing advanced storage opportunities to balance our electric system needs. Today, we're excited to announce a new partnership with Form Energy to develop two long-duration energy storage pilot projects. Form Energy's 100-hour battery technology could be a critical component to our decarbonization strategy providing the resiliency and reliability that we need on the system to support our significant renewable portfolio. We plan to deploy a 10 megawatt multi-day storage system at a retiring coal plant in both Minnesota and Colorado. These projects are expected to be online as early as 2025. And as we wrap up, I want to thank the thousands of employees who worked in below zero temperatures, and sustained high winds in several feet wet, heavy snow to keep the lights on and the houses warm during our recent winter storms. Your efforts exemplify our company values of connected, committed, trustworthy and safe. And I believe that our dedicated employees and partners are what distinguishes Xcel Energy with our customers. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\nBrian Van Abel: Thanks Bob. Good morning, all. We had another strong year recording earnings of $3.17 per share for 2022 compared with $2.96 per share in 2021. This represents EPS growth of 7.1%, slightly above our long-term growth rate target of 5% to 7%. The most significant earnings drivers for the year included the following; higher electric and natural gas margins increased earnings by $1.05 per share, primarily driven by regulatory outcomes and riders to recover capital investments. In addition, a lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.15 per share, but keep in mind, production tax credits lowered the ETR, PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation expense which reduced earnings by $0.40 per share reflecting our capital investment program, higher O&M expense which decreased earnings by $0.24 per share, higher interest expense and other taxes, primarily property taxes, decreased earnings by $0.23 per share and other items combined to reduce earnings by $0.12 per share. Turning to sales, our weather-adjusted electric sales increased by 1.8%, largely due to higher C&I sales driven by strong economic activity in our service territories. We anticipate a modest slowing of our sales with growth of 1% in 2023. Shifting to expense, O&M expenses increased $170 million for the year, driven by cost related to technology and customer programs, storms, vegetation management inflation and additional actions due to weather. We also invested in our employees to ensure we retained our top talent. While we expect inflationary pressures to remain, we continue to focus on our continuous improvement programs, which we expect to drive increased productivity and efficiency. As a result, we anticipate O&M expenses will decline approximately 2% in 2023. We\u2019ve made progress on a number of regulatory proceedings. In the Minnesota Natural Gas rate case, the ALJ recommended the commission approve our settlement which reflects a rate increase of $21 million, an ROE of 9.57%, an equity ratio of 52.5%, a decoupling mechanism and a property tax tracker. We anticipate the commission decision later this year. In the Minnesota electric rate case, the commission accepted our proposal to reduce our request for MISO capacity revenue and established a tracker. Hearings were completed in December and we continue to meet with the parties to see if we can reach a constructive settlement. However, we have a strong case and are comfortable with a fully litigated outcome absent this settlement. We anticipate a commission decision later in 2023. In November of 2022, we filed an electric rate case in Colorado seeking a net increase of $262 million based on an ROE of 10.25%, an equity ratio of 55.7% in the 2023 forward test year. We anticipate a commission decision and implementation of final rates in the third quarter. We also filed a New Mexico electric rate case seeking a rate increase of $78 million based on an ROE of 10.75%, equity ratio of 54.7%, the forecast test year in the early retirement of the total coal plant. We anticipate a commission decision and implementation of final rates in the fourth quarter. As far as future filings, we plan to file our Texas rate case later in the quarter and Wisconsin in the second quarter. As we have discussed in the past, the Inflation Reduction Act provides significant customer benefits, key elements include the following; tax credit transferability will provide $1.8 billion of liquidity increasing cash flow and reducing equity needs. We've met with companies in our service territory and expect to enter into bilateral tax credit sale contracts later this year. Our FFO to debt metrics improved by 100 basis points during the forecast time period. The solar PTC and tax credit transferability improved the competitiveness of our renewable bids and we anticipate pricing will decline on solar projects by 25% to 40% and wind projects by 50% to 60% due to the new and extended tax credits, which is great for our customers as we embark on this clean energy transition. Finally, we don't anticipate any material impact from AMT as a result of makers' depreciation and existing tax credits on our balance sheet. We are reaffirming our 2023 earnings guidance range of $3.30 to $3.40 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%. We have updated our key assumptions to reflect actual year-end results which are detailed in our earnings release. With that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. We had a strong operational and financial year in 2022. We delivered 2022 earnings within our guidance range, the 18th consecutive year and increased our dividend for the 19th consecutive year. We received approval of our resource plans in Colorado and Minnesota, which will result in approximately 10,000 megawatts of new renewables. The Inflation Reduction Act has passed a significant benefits for our customers in the company. We are reaffirming 2023 guidance, consistent with our long-term earnings growth rate. We remain confident we can continue to deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within the upper half of our 5% to 7% objective range as we lead the clean energy transition and keep bills low for our customers. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] First question is coming from Mr. Nick Campanella calling from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open, sir.\nNick Campanella: Hi, thanks for taking the question. So, I guess just on the O&M and the '23 guide that really stuck out to us and I heard some of your comments in the prepared remarks just talking about continuous improvement. Can you maybe just give us a little bit more on what levers you're pulling that's leading to that O&M reduction and is this -- we are more one-time in nature to '23 or sustainable through the plan? Thank you.\nBrian Van Abel: Hi, Nick. Yes, good question. And a couple -- let me make a couple of points on it. One is a little bit of a function of where actuals in 2022 ended up in terms of updating our 2023 O&M guidance, but we're really proud of the continuous improvement efforts that we've had underway and they've been underway for a long-time from 2014 to 2021, we kept O&M flat and that's something I'm really proud of our employees who are doing and there is a really good benefit to our customers. We did have inflationary pressures in 2022 but also took actions given the good weather year to reinvest in 2022 in the system and our employees. As I think about 2023, a couple of things. One is, now we're investing a lot in technology and how do we make us more efficient in our plants, we have some of the digital operations factory which is really using AI in our plants to move from more reactive, proactive maintenance. We're investing significantly in, call it, real time scheduling in other opportunities to use AI. We also are starting to get on a treadmill of shutting down our coal plants, we have a broader coal unit a year that will start to shut down which provides us with a tailwind as we think not only in '23 but through basically the end of this decade in terms of as we lead this clean energy transition. And then we also do see some abatement of, call it, the high diesel costs, we had a storm year that was above normal in 2022, for example, we had quintuple the number of storm days in December. So there are some things that happened in '22 that won't happen in '23 that should help us achieve it. So, a long answer, but a lot there to unpack and hopefully that helped provide some color on it.\nNick Campanella: Yes, that's great. Thank you so much. That's helpful. And on the Minnesota Electric case, it sounds like you're confident in taking this the full distance to an order. But I just wanted to be clear, is the settlement more unlikely at this point and how should we be thinking about that taking into consideration, where we are in the docket today?\nBobFrenzel: Nick, it's Bob, thanks for the question. And as we said in the prepared remarks, we filed this case over a year-ago, we probably actively working with parties since the September timeframe and we've reduced our total initial ask dramatically through extension of asset lives through the MISO capacity revenues and for bringing down the actual sales that we experienced in the state. So we think that reduced revenue ask is really a tailwind for us in the case, there's probably some pretty decent -- recent decisions in Minnesota, you saw the Minnesota Power case the other day and our gas settlement that Brian mentioned in his prepared remarks are data points that we feel confident in taking this, as you say, all the way, but we're always open to engaging with all the parties and if there is an opportunity to move forward with a settlement, we would certainly think to do so.\nOperator: Thank you very much, sir. We now go to David Arcaro calling from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDavid Arcaro: Thanks so much for taking my questions. I was wondering if you might be able to give any preview of what we could expect from the Clean Heat Plan filing later this year in Colorado, whether there might be potential CapEx investments additions to the plan and what new technologies and opportunities that might be to invest there?\nBobFrenzel: Hi, David, it's Bob. That's a great question. Look, we're excited about the Clean Heat Plan opportunity, it's really an opportunity for us I think to share and align our vision for a net zero future on the gas business with our commissions in a more formal way. I'm not certain that I would expect to see a significant amount of sort of new investment opportunities as part of that process, but really an opportunity to align on our multipronged strategy to decarbonize the gas business. As I think about it, we're working with upstream providers to reduce methane on the purchase gas that we buy for our customers. We're working on our own system, we have been for over the past decade in methane leak reduction, we've done a terrific job there, but there is always more to work to tighten up our own system and then we work on customer programs that encourage energy efficiency that encourage maybe fuel switching and beneficial electrification and then I think the big opportunity from an investment perspective is really the comments I made around clean fuel in my prepared remarks. We are working with multiple parties in the Colorado jurisdiction on a Rocky Mountain hydrogen hub, we think it's a really attractive project, a multistate MOU has been signed with several of the Western states and the governors and all the energy offices of those states are working together. So I think clean fuel's a real opportunity for us and for our customers to advance the clean energy transition and to help us realize a net zero future in the gas business.\nBrian Van Abel: Yes, David and I'd just add a couple of points there. One is, we don't have anything in our current five-year plan related to hydrogen investment opportunities. So to the point, if there's an opportunity to pull that forward and move faster on hydrogen, absolutely an upside opportunity as we think about it over the next five years. But also lot of, call it, industry discussion about natural gas commodity cost and the volatility we think longer-term now us owning renewables and creating green hydrogen blending it into the LDC creates more price certainty for our customers and takes that volatility out, so I think that's a longer-term opportunity and benefit as we think about how do we help our natural gas customers and improve the certainty of our overall bills.\nBobFrenzel: And then just broadly, and I mentioned this in my prepared remarks was probably worth saying again, which is, we are benefited by the geography that we sit in having great access to low cost wind and low cost solar, not only should we be able to do this for our customers beneficially but you're looking at opportunity of making the Rocky Mountain region or the upper Midwest regions, energy exports centers where we're creating a product that can be broadly transmitted to the rest of the country whether that's electricity via wire or whether that's green hydrogen via pipe or trucking, we should be a destination for those installations which overtime should help economic development in our states and add to employment backlogs as well.\nDavid Arcaro: That's really helpful color. Thanks for that, lot of initiatives, it sounds like related to that program that you'll be rolling out. And then separately on the announcement with Form Energy and long-duration storage, it's nice to see that crystallizing here. I was wondering if you might have a sense for how much long-duration storage might make sense on your system over time? Is there a certain number of megawatts or a proportion relative to your generation fleet that might make sense. Wondering how you might see the scale up to the extent these initial projects are successful and make it through the regulatory process?\nBobFrenzel: Yes, thanks, David. As we go through resource plans with each of our states, we find that we have increasing need for as we have higher penetration of renewals and increasing need for, what we'll call, dispatchable energy resources, and historically, those would have been combustion turbines maybe they are fired with a clean fuel like hydrogen or synthetic natural gas. Over time as long-duration storage might become more feasible and cost effective, you can see duration -- long-duration storage being a part of that solution, and I think if I were to add-up and I'm going to do this math on the fly, but we have several thousand megawatts in our resource plans for firm dispatchable generation. And if we had an asset, lithium-ion batteries are interesting and they have a utilization for our systems, but so do the long-duration storage. These are 20 megawatts projects, there's probably several hundreds in our resource plans that could be realizable within the next five to 10 years if the technology proves out.\nBrian Van Abel: Yes, and I would just add to that, we're really excited about this technology, shows that we're leading and really demonstrating that we're on the forefront of this clean energy transition and we've always talked about we know how to get to our 2030 goals of 80% plus carbon reduction and so this is really about taking that last 15% to 20% out of the sack and providing one of the solutions. So if you think about that and when you look at our resource mix in 2030, you can start to size what do we need to do beyond that in terms of storage capabilities that will be one of the solutions.\nOperator: Thank you so much, sir. We now go to Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning. It's actually Rich [indiscernible] on for Jeremy. Thank you for the time today. Maybe starting with changes to one of your drivers. I know we hit O&M already but just curious if you can parse the full range of what are effectively true-ups for '22 actuals versus new expectations for '23, are any of these changes you're putting in higher or lower within the guidance range at this point in time?\nBobFrenzel: I'll just read up to start, right, we're still feeling our midpoint of the guidance range, early in the year is where we expect to be and in terms of specific changes, right, gas sales is up a little bit, but that's really a function of where we landed on the year-end and really gas sales for us 1% is less than $5 million in terms of a change. The increase in the rider revenue that's a function of we had a good wind in PTC year in 2022, so that's relatively earnings neutral, we do see a little bit of a benefit depreciation and interest expenses lower. Let's see the forecasted rates for 2023 are lower than in Q3. But overall, we look at it is relatively neutral as we think about the puts and takes and so we're now targeting midpoint of the guidance range and now looking-forward to having a discussion 12 months from now and our goal is to deliver for the 19th straight year.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great, thanks for the color there. And then turning back to Colorado and a lot of their focus on the gas system planning side that you addressed this a little bit from the Clean Heat Plan perspective, but I'm curious for your higher level thoughts on how this might impact your electric operations in state as well?\nBobFrenzel: Hi, Rich, it's Bob. Look, I did mentioned as part of our Clean Heat Plan in our long-term strategy for decarbonizing on behalf of our customers that we do expect some amount of beneficial electrification to happen whether that's water heaters or cooking or home heating, but we believe that the asset value of the distribution system is incredibly valuable for our customers and has the ability to deliver a significant amount of energy on the coldest days in Colorado, our design temperature that we planned for in Colorado is minus 30, so it's still a very cold weather climate, has a need for a very efficient delivery system which we believe the pipeline system is there. Now, I do think that we can put -- as part of our strategy is to look at clean fuels and green hydrogen and synthetic natural gas and the opportunity that presents for our customers to realize a good product at an affordable price, that's also sustainable, it's important. But electrically, with EV's and beneficial electrification as we think about the future of our electric business in Colorado, there's probably growth there that's driven by both of those aspects.\nOperator: Thank you very much, sir. We'll now move to Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hi, good morning, team. Thanks for the time and the opportunity, nicely done. So Brian just on the -- so, just first on bills, I just want to understand a little bit on the trajectory of bills, can you talk a little bit on what the rate increases are in customers this winter especially on the gas side? And then also just given the cresting that we've seen in some of the commodity prices here, how is that setting itself up to ultimately get reflected to back to your customers, if you think about the cadence of your hedging programs?\nBrian Van Abel: Yes. Hi, Julien. Good question, and we think about -- I'll talk a little bit about both sides of the business because we think about on the electric side really well-positioned from overall customer bill perspective. Now we're, call it, 85% electric and if you just look at our income statement and the cost of goods sold and fuel impacts on the electric side is modest given the inflationary environment we saw in 2022, Bob talked about it, right, it's really -- it's our wind build out that we've always talked about been the hedge for rising commodity costs and that's played out in 2022 and really good to see from a customer bill perspective. And also we went into the year, being on a national average, more than 20% lower on residential customer per bill. So, good place and a good place to be on the electric side. Obviously, on the natural gas LDC side, you have a lot fewer levers and lot fewer assets. And so you saw some of the headlines of 40% to 50% bill impacts for our customers, obviously, we do not like to see any sort of bill impacts of that magnitude, but you're absolutely right that that is starting to subside with where natural gas prices are going. And if you caught it, we've just, in the past two months, we\u2019ve twice updated our gas commodity clause in Colorado which lowered the gas -- the commodity portion of the customers' bills by about 30% that will start to feel in Q1 relative to Q4 because we're actually going to be over collected, so we proactively did that and the commission was appreciative of that. So we're certainly taking every opportunity we can to make sure that we have reflecting the lower commodity costs in our customers. So that's really where we see, I think longer-term, we feel really good about delivering bills at the level of inflation as we think about 2030 and beyond and what the IRA is doing for us and for our customers. So we feel good both near-term and longer-term as we think about it.\nBobFrenzel: Hi, Julien. I'll agree with everything Brian said and add, if you look at the long arc of history and look-forward over the last 10 years and into the next 10 years. I think that comment around bills at or below the inflation level is consistent on the electric and gas side, this has been a tough year on the gas side, we're empathetic and we've worked hard with the federal government to enable significant amount of -- record amounts of why heap and then actively getting that into people's hands that needed the most. Longer-term, clean-energy transition, I think we can do this as we said, because we are strategically advantage in our position, we can do this very cost-effectively across the country and we have a good starting point in total bills and what our customers feel 20% below the national average or more in our residential electric areas. And our gas business, I think you highlighted this in one of your reports is one of the top two or three lowest gas businesses in the country. So good starting point, but it doesn't mean we don't have work to do and obviously we're always empathetic to our customers who are feeling bill increases at the grocery store, at the fuel pump, at rents and mortgage payments and everything else. So, but thanks for the opportunity to talk about it.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes, absolutely. You bet, hi listen, just going back to one of the questions from earlier. On the settlement conversations versus fully litigated cases obviously with curve backdrop is an ideal for having rate increases altogether. Can you talk a little bit about expectations we will settle cases broadly speaking here, to what extent could Minnesota be an isolated data point in the current instance given the current fact pattern or are you seeing challenges more broadly, here again without pointing fingers at specific statements necessarily?\nBobFrenzel: Well, I'll start Julien and Brian can add-on if he's got anything to add. I think generally, we look for settlements. I think we're encouraged to look for settlements. I even think as you look at some of the recent data points in Minnesota, the commission is looking for settlement. So with that as backdrop, maybe this case is isolated, maybe we saw the path to reach a settlement with the parties and I think we're being encouraged to do so. I think broadly speaking, that's the case for most of our jurisdictions, and most of our staff, we need to make sure that we are delivering for our customers operationally, we're delivering for our customers and reliability, but we also need to make sure that we keep a financially healthy utility, credit metrics are really important preserving credit metrics and our operating companies is critical as we seek to raise capital cost advantageously and to deliver on the capital investment profile that we know we need to do. So, I think there is where the debate happens and again I think we've got a long track record of settling and so I would take your comment as encouraging to think that we're going to continue to settle cases going-forward.\nOperator: Thank you very much, sir. We'll now take questions from Travis Miller calling from Morningstar. Please go ahead, sir.\nTravis Miller: Obviously you had a good year with the C&I demand, wondering what's your outlook in that 1% total sales for C&I we see another big year or does that moderate a bit?\nBrian Van Abel: Hi, Travis. Yes, I can take that one. No, I think we continue to see similar to what we saw in 2022 where strong growth in the C&I, if I parse it out, we have -- what we're expecting is about 2% up in C&I for 2023 and about a 1% decline in residential rate, continued decline from the COVID levels that we saw the increase in residential. C&I particularly good growth in SPS and I think just under the 2022 sales, when you look at the C&I numbers, you see that Colorado C&I is negative, but if you actually make an adjustment, we helped a large customer installed 240 megawatts solar farm to ensure that they stated in Colorado, ensured those jobs stayed in Colorado. And so if you made that adjustment Colorado C&I would actually have been a plus 2% for the year. So strong economic activity in C&I growth across all of our service territories, we expect that albeit a little bit of slowing in 2023 but to remain there.\nTravis Miller: Okay, great. And then a follow up to the hydrogen hub discussion, I think if I heard you correctly, April was the next point in which you file some more information, at what point is it there or is it later on where you get start getting a sense for given your proposal of non-approval that a proposal for CapEx potential spending?\nBrian Van Abel: Yes, Travis, I think it's early innings with the departments. April is the next filing date for, I'll call it, full plans, I think the Department of Energy is looking at probably around two dozen. So it's going to take them a while to parse through that in award grants for the -- I'm going to guess four to six that move forward from that perspective. We think both of our projects are incredibly interesting, provide lots of regional benefits from multiple sources and multiple users, which I think is a criteria that the department is going to look at. But if you're going to ask me to guess, I'd say it's at least end of next year before we get any clarity on those April applications potentially longer.\nBobFrenzel: Yes, but expect us that's the hydrogen hub concept, which we're very interested in and I think we have a great opportunity to be significant participants, but also expect us to move forward with hydrogen pilots and opportunities both on the electric side and the gas side as we think about working through our Clean Heat Plan in Colorado, our Natural Gas Innovation Act in Minnesota and then also on the electric side as we think about how do we decarbonize the last 15% to 20% in our stack.\nTravis Miller: Sure, okay. End of next year being 2024?\nBobFrenzel: Correct.\nTravis Miller: Okay. And then just real quick on that, how many partners are in those two proposals, Rocky Mountain, Midwest proposals?\nBrian Van Abel: I think we'll get back to the specific number, Travis, but I'm going to guess it's in the five to 10 in each region.\nTravis Miller: Okay, let's just looking for a rough number. Okay, very good. That's all I had. Thanks.\nBobFrenzel: Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you very much, sir. We'll now take questions from Mr. Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nPaul Patterson: So, I hear you on the Minnesota regulatory environment, it's pretty much what I've been hearing. But one thing I was little surprised by or I just -- it's hard to keep track of everything, there were some articles about some sort of state goal being below the national average by 5% and I think industrial's made a filing about this sort of saying that the rates are in danger or what have you about being in line with that policy. And I was just wondering, could you just refresh my memory about what is state policy goal is and sort of following-up on Julien's question, that's just sort of the trajectory -- how you see those performance within that thing going-forward because we have changes and moderation in fuel prices are going forward, just you're do not moving pieces I guess I'm just sort of wondering if you could -- and frankly I'm just not up to speed on the wall that they're talking about?\nChristopher Clark: Hi, Paul, this is Chris Clark. I'm the President of our Minnesota company. Yes, there is a goal and statute that seeks to have our prices for our commercial and industrial class, be within 95% of the national average. I think the starting point here is really that we provide our customers a great value and I think the look that got some attention is simply a look at the rate. But if you actually look at our total bills for our C&I class, you'll see that over a 10-year period, they've been relatively flat and that's because the EIA data that gets pulled for rates is only one component of the bill. So I think when you look at what we achieved for our C&I class, if you take into account the conservation programs that have been really nation leading here in Minnesota and other credits, and things that those customers have done to be successful, you'll see that our C&I class rates are competitive, and in fact, we do a great job of attracting new business to our state. So, I think it's important when we look at the picture of how we're doing with our C&I rates and really take that into account. And as Brian and Bob have said, when we look at the plans for our clean energy transition, we're confident that we can deliver those results in line or less than CPI. And I think over the long-term, we've shown that we can continue to be a successful company and navigating this, keeping rates affordable for our customers and delivering great value.\nPaul Patterson: Okay, also a great answer that. The second question, I have -- and I apologize if I missed this I got just interrupted here. The iron battery deployment, I apologize if you've already discussed this but are you just going to own these and what's the cost of them or could you just give a little bit more flavor of the economics associated with these two projects?\nBrian Van Abel: Yes, good question. No, we haven't disclosed the cost of these batteries, yet. We haven't made the regulatory filings yet and we are looking forward to having a discussion on our stakeholders and the commission, but we certainly will O&M, we think there are a valuable grid asset and important to us to own them as we think about how do we start to deploy these new technologies as we look to decarbonize and get to 100% carbon-free. So obviously, with any new technology the cost of more expensive, but this is a 100 hour battery that we don't see other solutions out there that are viable and it also iron oxide, right, if you think about rare metals, this is something that's readily available as we think about supply chains and what's the ability to scale. So overall, we're pretty excited about this. I think it demonstrates our leadership as an innovative clean tech company and we're excited to work with our commissions, but certainly more to come in terms of disclosing the cost.\nPaul Patterson: Okay, great. Just any idea when you guys might make regulatory filing roughly speaking?\nBrian Van Abel: Later this year, it will be this year.\nPaul Patterson: Okay. I mean, you guys are deploying in 2025, right, so?\nBrian Van Abel: Yes.\nOperator: Thank you so much, sir. Our next question is coming from Mr. Anthony Crowdell of Mizuho. Please go ahead, sir.\nAnthony Crowdell: Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just hopefully two quick ones. I guess when you look at the four major rate filings you guys have, they're all asking for a forward test year. When we look at 2023 and beyond, what do you think is a reasonable assumption for structural lag? Can that be reduced from say 90 to a 100 basis points to maybe 50, 60?\nBrian Van Abel: Hi, Anthony, good question. As we think about it from an earned ROE perspective, that's always been a goal of ours, right, we had a goal in 2015 to hold it from 100 to 50 bps and we're successful. And then in 2018, '19 and then had some COVID hit and we scale back on regulatory filings. I think as we look forward, our goal is to close that and we had some success from 2021 to 2022, albeit modest about 15 bps. And so our goal is to continue to focus on closing that and probably that 50 basis point range as you mentioned is a good goal as we think about it going forward and something that we're always focused on improving the regulatory constructs in getting now as we think about either multiyear plans or longer-term plans really providing the benefit of price to our customers, I think is really important something we'll continue to forward work through.\nAnthony Crowdell: Great. And just one follow up on top of Julien's question. I think Bobby had mentioned you prefered the settlement route and not just specific to Minnesota, but just in general. It seems like lately some commissions may be or tinkering with settlements if I use that term, it seems that's maybe turning at a greater frequency, does that give you pause on achieving your settlement?\nBobFrenzel: Hi Anthony, it's Bob. Great to see your name in the inbox today. Now, it doesn't give me pause look, I think we've had a long history here. We continue to work proactively with staffs and commission. And sometimes we go before ALJs and there's always things that are around the edges, important, but I think generally speaking settlements are encouraged and I think commissions understand that they want to encourage settlements that they need to be respect the entirety of them without tinkering. I think you've seen some commentary in some of the jurisdictions you might have been thinking about to that fact.\nOperator: Thank you so much, sir. And as it appears to have no further questions, Brian I'd like to the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks. Thank you.\nBrian Van Abel: Yes, thank you all for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow up questions.\nOperator: Thank you so much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen that will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your attendance and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Bob Frenzel",
            "content": "Thanks Paul, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter call. We had another very successful year at Xcel Energy, continuing to execute on our strategy while delivering strong financial and operational performance. For our investors, we delivered EPS of $3.17 representing the 18th consecutive year of meeting or exceeding our initial earnings guidance. In February, we raised our annual dividend for the 19th straight year increasing at $0.12 per share or 6.6%. More recently, in November, we extended our long-term investment plan which features a 10-year capital outlook with an approximate 7% rate base growth. We ranked in the top quartile in customer reliability or CAIDI and our residential electric builds are more than 20% below the national average. And amidst the backdrop of significant commodity increases this year, Xcel Energy's 4,500 megawatts of owned wind farms continue to be an industry-leader in net capacity factor performance, generated approximately $1 billion of fuel-related customer savings in 2022 and almost $3 billion since 2017. Our nuclear fleet remains the top performing fleet in the country and achieved a capacity factor of 96% last year. We had an active regulatory year and resolved multiple rate cases and Uri storm cost recovery proceedings. The commissions in Minnesota and Colorado approved resource plans that will add nearly 10,000 megawatts of utility scale renewables to our systems through this decade. The Minnesota Commission approved our 460 megawatt Sherco Solar project. The Colorado Commission approved our $2 billion Power Pathway transmission project and MISO awarded us $1.2 billion of transmission projects and we accelerated our timeline for transitioning out of coal and now expect to be coal free by the end of 2030, all of which contribute to our leadership in clean energy transition for our customers. We continue to lead in carbon reduction as well. In 2022, our estimated carbon emissions were approximately 52% below 2005 levels and we remain on track to achieve 80% carbon reduction across the company by 2030. The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act will reduce the cost of renewables for our customers, improves cash flow and credit metrics for the company and enhances the competitiveness of our renewable offerings. We continue to execute on our electric vehicle vision, implementing multiple new programs for our customers. We also filed comprehensive transportation plans in Minnesota and Wisconsin that are pending commission approval. We've advanced our ESG leadership and have been recognized by multiple entities, including an upgraded rating by MSCI from AA to AAA. And finally, we were named among the world's most ethical, admired and responsible companies and we're recognized for being the best veteran employer as well as for our disability inclusion in the workplace. I'm really proud to lead a team that can deliver on operational, financial, environmental and diversity goals, all simultaneously. Looking ahead, we're well-positioned for sustainable organic growth over the next decade, including affordable renewable additions in our resource plans, the transmission needed to enable those carbon-free resources and responsible community transitions as we retire our coal plants. We've recently issued a requests for proposals in Minnesota, Colorado and at SPS seeking approximately 6,000 megawatts of new renewable generation, a portion of the 10,000 megawatts that have been approved in our jurisdiction. We'll submit our recommended portfolios of generation assets to our commissions by the middle of this year and anticipate decisions in the second half of this year. We also expect to issue additional RFPs in Minnesota and Colorado this year and next year for the remainder of our approved needs. As we've discussed in the past, we believe that we have a geographical advantage in the clean energy transition due to the strong wind and solar resources in our service territory. This access to low cost renewable energy should also give us further advantage in developing green hydrogen and other clean fuel projects, which are becoming more feasible as a result of federal support from the Infrastructure and Jobs Act and the IRA. Late last year, we submitted hydrogen hub concept papers for both the Rocky Mountain and the Upper Midwest regions to the Department of Energy to compete for awards from the $8 billion hydrogen hub program. In December, we received favorable notice from the DOE for our concepts and we're encouraged to submit full applications in April. In addition, our pink hydrogen production pilot at our Prairie Island nuclear generating station is expected to be operational this year. Finally, we expect to bring forward opportunities this year to utilize clean fuels and green hydrogen blending at both our gas-fired generation stations and in our gas networks for Home and Building heating. As we continue to utilize innovative technologies to decarbonize our business, we are well-positioned to take advantage of potentially significant hydrogen capital investment opportunities in the future. As the penetration of renewable assets in our states increases, we're also interested in pursuing advanced storage opportunities to balance our electric system needs. Today, we're excited to announce a new partnership with Form Energy to develop two long-duration energy storage pilot projects. Form Energy's 100-hour battery technology could be a critical component to our decarbonization strategy providing the resiliency and reliability that we need on the system to support our significant renewable portfolio. We plan to deploy a 10 megawatt multi-day storage system at a retiring coal plant in both Minnesota and Colorado. These projects are expected to be online as early as 2025. And as we wrap up, I want to thank the thousands of employees who worked in below zero temperatures, and sustained high winds in several feet wet, heavy snow to keep the lights on and the houses warm during our recent winter storms. Your efforts exemplify our company values of connected, committed, trustworthy and safe. And I believe that our dedicated employees and partners are what distinguishes Xcel Energy with our customers. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian. Nick, it's Bob, thanks for the question. And as we said in the prepared remarks, we filed this case over a year-ago, we probably actively working with parties since the September timeframe and we've reduced our total initial ask dramatically through extension of asset lives through the MISO capacity revenues and for bringing down the actual sales that we experienced in the state. So we think that reduced revenue ask is really a tailwind for us in the case, there's probably some pretty decent -- recent decisions in Minnesota, you saw the Minnesota Power case the other day and our gas settlement that Brian mentioned in his prepared remarks are data points that we feel confident in taking this, as you say, all the way, but we're always open to engaging with all the parties and if there is an opportunity to move forward with a settlement, we would certainly think to do so. Hi, David, it's Bob. That's a great question. Look, we're excited about the Clean Heat Plan opportunity, it's really an opportunity for us I think to share and align our vision for a net zero future on the gas business with our commissions in a more formal way. I'm not certain that I would expect to see a significant amount of sort of new investment opportunities as part of that process, but really an opportunity to align on our multipronged strategy to decarbonize the gas business. As I think about it, we're working with upstream providers to reduce methane on the purchase gas that we buy for our customers. We're working on our own system, we have been for over the past decade in methane leak reduction, we've done a terrific job there, but there is always more to work to tighten up our own system and then we work on customer programs that encourage energy efficiency that encourage maybe fuel switching and beneficial electrification and then I think the big opportunity from an investment perspective is really the comments I made around clean fuel in my prepared remarks. We are working with multiple parties in the Colorado jurisdiction on a Rocky Mountain hydrogen hub, we think it's a really attractive project, a multistate MOU has been signed with several of the Western states and the governors and all the energy offices of those states are working together. So I think clean fuel's a real opportunity for us and for our customers to advance the clean energy transition and to help us realize a net zero future in the gas business. And then just broadly, and I mentioned this in my prepared remarks was probably worth saying again, which is, we are benefited by the geography that we sit in having great access to low cost wind and low cost solar, not only should we be able to do this for our customers beneficially but you're looking at opportunity of making the Rocky Mountain region or the upper Midwest regions, energy exports centers where we're creating a product that can be broadly transmitted to the rest of the country whether that's electricity via wire or whether that's green hydrogen via pipe or trucking, we should be a destination for those installations which overtime should help economic development in our states and add to employment backlogs as well. Yes, thanks, David. As we go through resource plans with each of our states, we find that we have increasing need for as we have higher penetration of renewals and increasing need for, what we'll call, dispatchable energy resources, and historically, those would have been combustion turbines maybe they are fired with a clean fuel like hydrogen or synthetic natural gas. Over time as long-duration storage might become more feasible and cost effective, you can see duration -- long-duration storage being a part of that solution, and I think if I were to add-up and I'm going to do this math on the fly, but we have several thousand megawatts in our resource plans for firm dispatchable generation. And if we had an asset, lithium-ion batteries are interesting and they have a utilization for our systems, but so do the long-duration storage. These are 20 megawatts projects, there's probably several hundreds in our resource plans that could be realizable within the next five to 10 years if the technology proves out. I'll just read up to start, right, we're still feeling our midpoint of the guidance range, early in the year is where we expect to be and in terms of specific changes, right, gas sales is up a little bit, but that's really a function of where we landed on the year-end and really gas sales for us 1% is less than $5 million in terms of a change. The increase in the rider revenue that's a function of we had a good wind in PTC year in 2022, so that's relatively earnings neutral, we do see a little bit of a benefit depreciation and interest expenses lower. Let's see the forecasted rates for 2023 are lower than in Q3. But overall, we look at it is relatively neutral as we think about the puts and takes and so we're now targeting midpoint of the guidance range and now looking-forward to having a discussion 12 months from now and our goal is to deliver for the 19th straight year. Hi, Rich, it's Bob. Look, I did mentioned as part of our Clean Heat Plan in our long-term strategy for decarbonizing on behalf of our customers that we do expect some amount of beneficial electrification to happen whether that's water heaters or cooking or home heating, but we believe that the asset value of the distribution system is incredibly valuable for our customers and has the ability to deliver a significant amount of energy on the coldest days in Colorado, our design temperature that we planned for in Colorado is minus 30, so it's still a very cold weather climate, has a need for a very efficient delivery system which we believe the pipeline system is there. Now, I do think that we can put -- as part of our strategy is to look at clean fuels and green hydrogen and synthetic natural gas and the opportunity that presents for our customers to realize a good product at an affordable price, that's also sustainable, it's important. But electrically, with EV's and beneficial electrification as we think about the future of our electric business in Colorado, there's probably growth there that's driven by both of those aspects. Hi, Julien. I'll agree with everything Brian said and add, if you look at the long arc of history and look-forward over the last 10 years and into the next 10 years. I think that comment around bills at or below the inflation level is consistent on the electric and gas side, this has been a tough year on the gas side, we're empathetic and we've worked hard with the federal government to enable significant amount of -- record amounts of why heap and then actively getting that into people's hands that needed the most. Longer-term, clean-energy transition, I think we can do this as we said, because we are strategically advantage in our position, we can do this very cost-effectively across the country and we have a good starting point in total bills and what our customers feel 20% below the national average or more in our residential electric areas. And our gas business, I think you highlighted this in one of your reports is one of the top two or three lowest gas businesses in the country. So good starting point, but it doesn't mean we don't have work to do and obviously we're always empathetic to our customers who are feeling bill increases at the grocery store, at the fuel pump, at rents and mortgage payments and everything else. So, but thanks for the opportunity to talk about it. Well, I'll start Julien and Brian can add-on if he's got anything to add. I think generally, we look for settlements. I think we're encouraged to look for settlements. I even think as you look at some of the recent data points in Minnesota, the commission is looking for settlement. So with that as backdrop, maybe this case is isolated, maybe we saw the path to reach a settlement with the parties and I think we're being encouraged to do so. I think broadly speaking, that's the case for most of our jurisdictions, and most of our staff, we need to make sure that we are delivering for our customers operationally, we're delivering for our customers and reliability, but we also need to make sure that we keep a financially healthy utility, credit metrics are really important preserving credit metrics and our operating companies is critical as we seek to raise capital cost advantageously and to deliver on the capital investment profile that we know we need to do. So, I think there is where the debate happens and again I think we've got a long track record of settling and so I would take your comment as encouraging to think that we're going to continue to settle cases going-forward. Yes, but expect us that's the hydrogen hub concept, which we're very interested in and I think we have a great opportunity to be significant participants, but also expect us to move forward with hydrogen pilots and opportunities both on the electric side and the gas side as we think about working through our Clean Heat Plan in Colorado, our Natural Gas Innovation Act in Minnesota and then also on the electric side as we think about how do we decarbonize the last 15% to 20% in our stack. Correct. Appreciate it. Hi Anthony, it's Bob. Great to see your name in the inbox today. Now, it doesn't give me pause look, I think we've had a long history here. We continue to work proactively with staffs and commission. And sometimes we go before ALJs and there's always things that are around the edges, important, but I think generally speaking settlements are encouraged and I think commissions understand that they want to encourage settlements that they need to be respect the entirety of them without tinkering.

            "name": "Brian Van Abel",
            "content": "Thanks Bob. Good morning, all. We had another strong year recording earnings of $3.17 per share for 2022 compared with $2.96 per share in 2021. This represents EPS growth of 7.1%, slightly above our long-term growth rate target of 5% to 7%. The most significant earnings drivers for the year included the following; higher electric and natural gas margins increased earnings by $1.05 per share, primarily driven by regulatory outcomes and riders to recover capital investments. In addition, a lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.15 per share, but keep in mind, production tax credits lowered the ETR, PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation expense which reduced earnings by $0.40 per share reflecting our capital investment program, higher O&M expense which decreased earnings by $0.24 per share, higher interest expense and other taxes, primarily property taxes, decreased earnings by $0.23 per share and other items combined to reduce earnings by $0.12 per share. Turning to sales, our weather-adjusted electric sales increased by 1.8%, largely due to higher C&I sales driven by strong economic activity in our service territories. We anticipate a modest slowing of our sales with growth of 1% in 2023. Shifting to expense, O&M expenses increased $170 million for the year, driven by cost related to technology and customer programs, storms, vegetation management inflation and additional actions due to weather. We also invested in our employees to ensure we retained our top talent. While we expect inflationary pressures to remain, we continue to focus on our continuous improvement programs, which we expect to drive increased productivity and efficiency. As a result, we anticipate O&M expenses will decline approximately 2% in 2023. We've made progress on a number of regulatory proceedings. In the Minnesota Natural Gas rate case, the ALJ recommended the commission approve our settlement which reflects a rate increase of $21 million, an ROE of 9.57%, an equity ratio of 52.5%, a decoupling mechanism and a property tax tracker. We anticipate the commission decision later this year. In the Minnesota electric rate case, the commission accepted our proposal to reduce our request for MISO capacity revenue and established a tracker. Hearings were completed in December and we continue to meet with the parties to see if we can reach a constructive settlement. However, we have a strong case and are comfortable with a fully litigated outcome absent this settlement. We anticipate a commission decision later in 2023. In November of 2022, we filed an electric rate case in Colorado seeking a net increase of $262 million based on an ROE of 10.25%, an equity ratio of 55.7% in the 2023 forward test year. We anticipate a commission decision and implementation of final rates in the third quarter. We also filed a New Mexico electric rate case seeking a rate increase of $78 million based on an ROE of 10.75%, equity ratio of 54.7%, the forecast test year in the early retirement of the total coal plant. We anticipate a commission decision and implementation of final rates in the fourth quarter. As far as future filings, we plan to file our Texas rate case later in the quarter and Wisconsin in the second quarter. As we have discussed in the past, the Inflation Reduction Act provides significant customer benefits, key elements include the following; tax credit transferability will provide $1.8 billion of liquidity increasing cash flow and reducing equity needs. We've met with companies in our service territory and expect to enter into bilateral tax credit sale contracts later this year. Our FFO to debt metrics improved by 100 basis points during the forecast time period. The solar PTC and tax credit transferability improved the competitiveness of our renewable bids and we anticipate pricing will decline on solar projects by 25% to 40% and wind projects by 50% to 60% due to the new and extended tax credits, which is great for our customers as we embark on this clean energy transition. Finally, we don't anticipate any material impact from AMT as a result of makers' depreciation and existing tax credits on our balance sheet. We are reaffirming our 2023 earnings guidance range of $3.30 to $3.40 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%. We have updated our key assumptions to reflect actual year-end results which are detailed in our earnings release. With that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. We had a strong operational and financial year in 2022. We delivered 2022 earnings within our guidance range, the 18th consecutive year and increased our dividend for the 19th consecutive year. We received approval of our resource plans in Colorado and Minnesota, which will result in approximately 10,000 megawatts of new renewables. The Inflation Reduction Act has passed a significant benefits for our customers in the company. We are reaffirming 2023 guidance, consistent with our long-term earnings growth rate. We remain confident we can continue to deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within the upper half of our 5% to 7% objective range as we lead the clean energy transition and keep bills low for our customers. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions. Hi, Nick. Yes, good question. And a couple -- let me make a couple of points on it. One is a little bit of a function of where actuals in 2022 ended up in terms of updating our 2023 O&M guidance, but we're really proud of the continuous improvement efforts that we've had underway and they've been underway for a long-time from 2014 to 2021, we kept O&M flat and that's something I'm really proud of our employees who are doing and there is a really good benefit to our customers. We did have inflationary pressures in 2022 but also took actions given the good weather year to reinvest in 2022 in the system and our employees. As I think about 2023, a couple of things. One is, now we're investing a lot in technology and how do we make us more efficient in our plants, we have some of the digital operations factory which is really using AI in our plants to move from more reactive, proactive maintenance. We're investing significantly in, call it, real time scheduling in other opportunities to use AI. We also are starting to get on a treadmill of shutting down our coal plants, we have a broader coal unit a year that will start to shut down which provides us with a tailwind as we think not only in '23 but through basically the end of this decade in terms of as we lead this clean energy transition. And then we also do see some abatement of, call it, the high diesel costs, we had a storm year that was above normal in 2022, for example, we had quintuple the number of storm days in December. So there are some things that happened in '22 that won't happen in '23 that should help us achieve it. So, a long answer, but a lot there to unpack and hopefully that helped provide some color on it. Yes, David and I'd just add a couple of points there. One is, we don't have anything in our current five-year plan related to hydrogen investment opportunities. So to the point, if there's an opportunity to pull that forward and move faster on hydrogen, absolutely an upside opportunity as we think about it over the next five years. But also lot of, call it, industry discussion about natural gas commodity cost and the volatility we think longer-term now us owning renewables and creating green hydrogen blending it into the LDC creates more price certainty for our customers and takes that volatility out, so I think that's a longer-term opportunity and benefit as we think about how do we help our natural gas customers and improve the certainty of our overall bills. Yes, and I would just add to that, we're really excited about this technology, shows that we're leading and really demonstrating that we're on the forefront of this clean energy transition and we've always talked about we know how to get to our 2030 goals of 80% plus carbon reduction and so this is really about taking that last 15% to 20% out of the sack and providing one of the solutions. So if you think about that and when you look at our resource mix in 2030, you can start to size what do we need to do beyond that in terms of storage capabilities that will be one of the solutions. Yes. Hi, Julien. Good question, and we think about -- I'll talk a little bit about both sides of the business because we think about on the electric side really well-positioned from overall customer bill perspective. Now we're, call it, 85% electric and if you just look at our income statement and the cost of goods sold and fuel impacts on the electric side is modest given the inflationary environment we saw in 2022, Bob talked about it, right, it's really -- it's our wind build out that we've always talked about been the hedge for rising commodity costs and that's played out in 2022 and really good to see from a customer bill perspective. And also we went into the year, being on a national average, more than 20% lower on residential customer per bill. So, good place and a good place to be on the electric side. Obviously, on the natural gas LDC side, you have a lot fewer levers and lot fewer assets. And so you saw some of the headlines of 40% to 50% bill impacts for our customers, obviously, we do not like to see any sort of bill impacts of that magnitude, but you're absolutely right that that is starting to subside with where natural gas prices are going. And if you caught it, we've just, in the past two months, we've twice updated our gas commodity clause in Colorado which lowered the gas -- the commodity portion of the customers' bills by about 30% that will start to feel in Q1 relative to Q4 because we're actually going to be over collected, so we proactively did that and the commission was appreciative of that. So we're certainly taking every opportunity we can to make sure that we have reflecting the lower commodity costs in our customers. So that's really where we see, I think longer-term, we feel really good about delivering bills at the level of inflation as we think about 2030 and beyond and what the IRA is doing for us and for our customers. So we feel good both near-term and longer-term as we think about it. Hi, Travis. Yes, I can take that one. No, I think we continue to see similar to what we saw in 2022 where strong growth in the C&I, if I parse it out, we have -- what we're expecting is about 2% up in C&I for 2023 and about a 1% decline in residential rate, continued decline from the COVID levels that we saw the increase in residential. C&I particularly good growth in SPS and I think just under the 2022 sales, when you look at the C&I numbers, you see that Colorado C&I is negative, but if you actually make an adjustment, we helped a large customer installed 240 megawatts solar farm to ensure that they stated in Colorado, ensured those jobs stayed in Colorado. And so if you made that adjustment Colorado C&I would actually have been a plus 2% for the year. So strong economic activity in C&I growth across all of our service territories, we expect that albeit a little bit of slowing in 2023 but to remain there. Yes, Travis, I think it's early innings with the departments. April is the next filing date for, I'll call it, full plans, I think the Department of Energy is looking at probably around two dozen. So it's going to take them a while to parse through that in award grants for the -- I'm going to guess four to six that move forward from that perspective. We think both of our projects are incredibly interesting, provide lots of regional benefits from multiple sources and multiple users, which I think is a criteria that the department is going to look at. But if you're going to ask me to guess, I'd say it's at least end of next year before we get any clarity on those April applications potentially longer. I think we'll get back to the specific number, Travis, but I'm going to guess it's in the five to 10 in each region. Yes, good question. No, we haven't disclosed the cost of these batteries, yet. We haven't made the regulatory filings yet and we are looking forward to having a discussion on our stakeholders and the commission, but we certainly will O&M, we think there are a valuable grid asset and important to us to own them as we think about how do we start to deploy these new technologies as we look to decarbonize and get to 100% carbon-free. So obviously, with any new technology the cost of more expensive, but this is a 100 hour battery that we don't see other solutions out there that are viable and it also iron oxide, right, if you think about rare metals, this is something that's readily available as we think about supply chains and what's the ability to scale. So overall, we're pretty excited about this. I think it demonstrates our leadership as an innovative clean tech company and we're excited to work with our commissions, but certainly more to come in terms of disclosing the cost. Later this year, it will be this year. Yes. Hi, Anthony, good question. As we think about it from an earned ROE perspective, that's always been a goal of ours, right, we had a goal in 2015 to hold it from 100 to 50 bps and we're successful. And then in 2018, '19 and then had some COVID hit and we scale back on regulatory filings. I think as we look forward, our goal is to close that and we had some success from 2021 to 2022, albeit modest about 15 bps. And so our goal is to continue to focus on closing that and probably that 50 basis point range as you mentioned is a good goal as we think about it going forward and something that we're always focused on improving the regulatory constructs in getting now as we think about either multiyear plans or longer-term plans really providing the benefit of price to our customers, I think is really important something we'll continue to forward work through. Yes, thank you all for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow up questions."

After the presentation, we will open up for questions. Questions will only be taken from institutional investors. Reporters can contact Media Relations with inquiries, and individual investors and others can reach out to Investor Relations.  I will now hand the call over to Paul Johnston, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nPaul Johnson: Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2022 Third Quarter Earnings Call. Joining me today are Bob Frenzel, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have others in the room available to answer questions if needed.  This morning, we will discuss our 2022 results, share recent business and regulatory developments, update our capital and financing plans and provide 2023 guidance. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder, some of the comments made during today's call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our SEC filings.  Today, we will discuss certain measures that are non-GAAP metrics. Information on the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release. I'll now turn the call over to Bob.\nBob Frenzel: Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Let's start with our financial results. We had another solid quarter, recording earnings of $1.18 per share for 2022 compared to $1.13 per share in 2021. Our earnings are on track, and as a result, we are narrowing our '22 earnings guidance range to $3.14 to $3.19 per share. We're also initiating 2023 earnings guidance of $3.30 to $3.40 per share, which reflects our 5% to 7% long-term EPS growth objective.  Consistent with past practices, we've updated our base investment plan, which reflects $29.5 billion of capital expenditures over the next 5 years. This investment plan provides significant benefits to our customers, supports community vitality and resiliency and delivers rate base growth of 6.5%.  We're very excited about our investment plans, which support continued execution of our long-term strategy and clean energy leadership. It enhances reliability and resiliency, advances our generation fleet transition, allows for the electrification of transportation, keep customers' bills low and delivers attractive returns for investors. And while our base plan is robust, it does not include any potential renewable generation assets that are approved in our Minnesota and Colorado resource plans, or additional transmission capital is needed to integrate new renewable generation in Colorado beyond the Power Pathway Project. For these assets, we expect further regulatory clarification in the second half of 2023, which could result in incremental capital expenditures of $2 billion to $4 billion, which would result in rate base growth of 7.6% at the midpoint. Our updated capital plan, which reflects the benefits of the IRA, extends the growth rate and improves the quality of rate base, reduces financing risk, improves credit metrics, and delivers substantial customer and environmental benefits.  During the quarter, the Inflation Reduction Act was passed into law, which includes new and extended tax credits for wind, solar, hydrogen, storage, carbon sequestration and nuclear. It also includes tax credit transferability. Some of the key takeaways for the IRA include substantial customer benefits and a continuation of our clean energy leadership while keeping customer bills affordable. The inclusion of the new solar production tax credit makes our company-owned projects more affordable for our customers relative to the solar ITC. The hydrogen production tax credit should improve our competitive advantage in delivering low-cost, clean fuels for our combustion turbines for electric reliability and for blending into our local gas distribution systems that will help our customers lower their carbon footprint in the future. The nuclear production tax credit will provide additional customer credits depending on MISO marginal pricing thereby lowering the cost of electricity from our existing nuclear assets. The tax credit transferability will increase liquidity and improve credit metrics. An excellent example of the IRA tax benefits is our 460-megawatt Sherco Solar proposal that was recently approved by the Minnesota Commission with strong stakeholder support. This will be the largest solar facility in the Midwest and a top 5 installation in the United States, which will go into service in 2024 and 2025.  Following the IRA passage, the levelized cost of Sherco solar is projected to decline by over 30%, even after accounting for inflation and supply chain pressures. Due to the project qualified for both solar PTCs and community energy bonus as we are reinvesting in the community around our retiring coal facility. This is a substantial benefit to our customers.  Earlier this year, the commissions in both Minnesota and Colorado approved resource plans that will add nearly 10, 000 megawatts of utility scale renewables to our systems and achieve an 85% carbon reduction by 2030. These resource plans were approved prior to the passage of the IRA, but the final recommended portfolios are expected to capture the benefits of the IRA which will significantly reduce the levelized cost of these renewable projects for our customers. We've issued a request for proposal in Minnesota and plan to issue an RFP in Colorado later this year. After evaluation of proposals, we anticipate submitting our recommended portfolios to our respective commissions by the middle of next year and expect decisions in the second half of next year. We expect the recommended portfolios of generation assets will include a mixture of self-build, build-own-transfer projects as well as some power purchase agreements.  Our generation resource plans are consistent with our Steel for Fuel strategy, which provides a valuable hedge for our customers against rising commodity prices. As an example, our owned wind farms are projected to generate nearly $1 billion of fuel-related customer savings in 2022 alone and almost $3 billion since 2017. While these fuel savings were not included in our investment case, it shows the tremendous customer benefits of being an early leader in the clean energy transition. We also continue to advance our broader ESG leadership as MSCI recently upgraded Xcel Energy's rating from AA to AAA and categorized our company as leader in their nomenclature for managing the most significant ESG risks and opportunities. It's is an outstanding accomplishment and reflects our continued progress, including adopting a water management goal, greater disclosure of human capital management practices and an improved governance score. We were also named to investor business daily's 100 best ESG companies, which is further recognition of our ESG leadership.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\nBrian Van Abel: Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. We had a solid quarter, recording earnings of $1.18 per share for the third quarter of 2022 compared with $1.13 per share in 2021. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter included the following: higher electric and natural gas margins increased earnings by $0.33 per share, primarily driven by riders and regulatory outcomes to recover our capital investments. In addition, a lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.02 per share. Keep in mind, production tax credits lowered the ETR. However, PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin and are largely earnings neutral.  Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation expense, which reduced earnings by $0.10 per share, reflecting our capital investment program, higher O&M expense, which decreased earnings by $0.06 per share. Higher interest expense and other taxes, primarily property taxes, decreased earnings by $0.07 per share and other items combined to reduce earnings by $0.07 per share. Turning to our sales. Our year-to-date weather-adjusted electric sales increased by 2.2%, largely due to higher C&I sales driven by strong economic activity in our service territories. The year-to-date results are relatively consistent with our expectations of 2% sales growth for 2022, while we anticipate more modest sales growth of 1% for next year.  Shifting to expense. O&M expenses increased $43 million for the third quarter, driven by investments in technology and customer programs, storm costs, vegetation management and inflation. Like other businesses, we are facing inflationary pressures and now expect an annual O&M increase of approximately 4%. This represents a step increase due to cost pressures. However, we anticipate flat O&M in 2023.  We made progress on a number of regulatory proceedings. During the quarter, Minnesota Commission approved our Yuri storm settlement, including full recovery of all costs with the exception of a $19 million disallowance. We have now resolved Yuri cost recovery in all of our states with the exception of Texas. We also have pending electric and natural gas rate cases in Minnesota. And in a natural gas rate case, we reached a comprehensive settlement which reflects a rate increase of $21 million, an ROE of 9.57%, a currently authorized equity ratio of 52.5%, a decoupling mechanism and property tax tracker. We think this is a constructive settlement and anticipate a commission decision next year.  In the Minnesota electric rate case, we recently received intervener testimony. The Department of Commerce recommended a 3-year rate increase of $274 million based on an ROE of 9.25% and an equity ratio of 52.5%. In addition, the Department of Commerce recommendation reflects customer credits for the MISO capacity auction revenues and extension of the depreciable lives of the Monaco nuclear plant and our wind farms. We are meeting with parties to see if we can reach a constructive settlement.  In October, the Colorado Commission approved a rate increase of $64 million for our natural gas case, reflecting a historic test year with the year-end rate base and $16 million of incremental depreciation expense. The commission also approved a weighted average cost of capital of 6.7%, which will reflect as an ROE of 9.2% and an equity ratio of 53.8% based on the ranges they provided. As a result of the Colorado Commission denying the step increases, we are evaluating options of filing another rate case as the natural gas business remains a critical part of the energy infrastructure in Colorado that is valued by our customers. As far as future filings, we plan to file Colorado and New Mexico electric rate cases later this year and the Texas rate case in the first quarter of 2023. As Bob mentioned, we've issued a robust $29.5 billion 5-year base capital forecast with a rate base growth of 6.5% using 2022 as a base. The base plan reflects significant grid and resiliency investment, our Colorado Power pathway proposal and other transmission system investments to maintain asset health and reliability and enable renewable generation. The plan reflects a modest level of renewables including our Sherco Solar facility. It also includes natural gas peaking plants to ensure reliability as we retire coal plants, along with investments to improve the customer experience.  We also anticipate potential incremental capital investment for renewables associated with the Minnesota and Colorado resource plans. Our proposed resource plans include approximately 3,500 megawatts of additions from 2024 to 2027, which would result in capital investment of $1.5 billion to $3 billion, assuming 50% ownership. In addition, we anticipate the need for an incremental $500 million to $1 billion of related transmission for the Colorado IRP. Combined, we can see a potential incremental investment to support the clean energy transition of $2 billion to $4 billion. We've updated our financing plan, which reflects a combination of cash generation, debt and equity to fund the majority of our capital expenditures. The financing plan assumes $1.8 billion of tax credit transfers which improves our credit metrics, maintains a strong balance sheet and lowers the cost of renewable projects for our customers. Compared to our previous 5-year plan, transfer ability to reduce equity needs to $750 million, while we've increased CapEx by $3.5 billion. In addition, we anticipate that any incremental capital will be financed at roughly our current capital structure.  It is important to recognize that we've always maintained a conservative financing strategy, which reflects a strong balance sheet and credit metrics, a balanced financing plan and minimal levels of variable debt and longer maturities. This approach is critical in the current market of rising rates and will benefit our customers while maintaining our solid credit ratings and favorable access to the capital markets. Bob discussed IRA customer benefits, but I wanted to add a few more details. Tax credit transferability is projected to provide $1.8 billion of liquidity, which increases cash flow and reduces our equity needs. Our FFO to debt metrics improved by approximately 100 basis points during the forecast time period, even after adding $3. 5 billion of capital and reducing equity needs. The solar PTC and tax credit transferability improve the competitiveness of our renewable bids. We project the IRA will drive approximately $500 million of customer savings from our owned renewable projects over the next 5 years and nuclear PTCs could drive additional savings. We anticipate that pricing will decline on solar projects by 25% to 40% and wind projects by 50% to 60% later in this decade due to new and extended tax credits along with potential adders in the IRA. Finally, we don't anticipate any material impact from AMT as a result of makers\u2019 depreciation and existing tax credits on our balance sheet. Shifting to earnings. We've updated our 2022 guidance assumptions to reflect the latest information. We're also narrowing our 2022 earnings guidance range to $3.14 to $3.19 per share. We're also initiating our 2023 earnings guidance range of $3.30 to $3.40 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%. Key assumptions are detailed in our earnings release.  With that, I'll wrap it up with a quick summary. IRA was passed with significant benefits for our customers in the company. The Minnesota Commission approved our Sherco Solar project. We reached a constructive settlement in our Minnesota natural gas rate case. The Colorado Commission approved our natural gas rate case. We're narrowing our 2022 earnings guidance range. We announced our robust updated capital investment program that provides strong, transparent rate base growth and customer value. We initiated 2023 guidance consistent with our long-term earnings growth rate. And we remain confident we can continue to deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within the upper half of our 5% to 7% objective range as we lead the clean energy transition and keep those low for our customers.  This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Nicholas Campanella with Credit Suisse.\nNicholas Campanella : So I guess I'll just start it off. I mean, you're raising CapEx, you decreased equity needs. The CAGR is still the same. Can you just give us a sense of kind of what the offsets are in that plan. I believe that there is some offset to rate base with transferability in the various tax impacts, but any more clarity would be helpful.\nBrian Van Abel : Yes. Absolutely, Nick, and I'll handle that one. Yes. I mean when we look at the IRA, huge win for our customers and us. And really -- and when we think about our financing plan, it's around transferability. And there is an offset because a majority of those tax credits were on our balance sheet as a deferred tax asset, which would increase the cost of our renewable projects. So by being able to monetize them, we reduced that tax asset on our balance sheet, lower the overall LCOE for our wind projects and solar projects to our customers and improve our cash flow. So you do have lower rate base from that in a vacuum but it allows us to reduce our equity needs, increase CapEx and have basically a higher quality rate base as we think about it. Much of the steel in the ground and the tax assets on our balance sheet.\nPaul Johnson : And Nick, just as a clarification, those Tax credits are not currently on our balance sheet, but they would have been on our balance sheet without tax credit transferability in the future. \nNicholas Campanella : Got it. That's helpful. That's helpful. And then in the electric rate case in Minnesota, if I heard you correctly, I think you're engaging parties for a possible settlement. Can you just kind of give us a sense of overall confidence level and just getting it across the finish line? And then is there a drop dead kind of date that you need to get this done by if you were to? Like is there a hearing date we should have in mind?\nBob Frenzel: Yes, Nike, it's Bob. Thanks for the question. Look, I think on the Minnesota electric case, first and foremost, we've got the gas case behind us, and that sets a good framework for some of the items in the electric case. We're engaged with parties, I think rebuttal testimony as to in the middle -- or the hearings are in the middle of December. So I think we should target that as a deadline for settlement opportunities.\nOperator: We will now take the next question from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Arcaro: Maybe sticking on the regulatory arena, wondering on the Colorado gas rate case, when might be the next time you go in just in the wake of this recent decision? \nBob Frenzel: David, it's Bob. Thanks for the question. We filed the case back in January with the commission, and we're looking for a 3-year forward gas case. We have expected capital expenditures continuing next year and the year after, and we have real visibility into the case -- sorry, the commission granted us a historic test year case, means we likely need to go back in sometime in 2023 for a new gas case.\nDavid Arcaro: Yes. Got it. Makes sense. And then the other thing I wanted to check on was what's your latest thinking about the prospects for PPA buyouts and repowering opportunities in the wake of the IRA? Does that become a bigger opportunity for you to look at now?\nBrian Van Abel : Yes. Yes, I'll take that one. I think it absolutely does. And the way I think about it, it extends our PPA buyout opportunity for a long time, right? What we've been successful at, we bought out about $750 million of PPAs over the past number of years. And we were successful because we brought forward a win for our customers ,a win for us, right? We were able to buy out a PPA, put steel in the ground and save our customers' money. And we did that by buying out the PP and repowering it and qualifying for new set -- new strip of tax credits on the wind side.  So pre IRA, the buyout opportunities were stepping down as your tax credit stepped down. Now since we have a 10-year-plus runway of PTCs and also, we'll look at evaluating solar buyout opportunities, if you can repower on a solar PTC farm. So I think there's a much longer runway for buyout opportunities. And none of that is our capital forecast is in our 5-year plan as upside.  And I think that longer term, as you think about repowering, as you mentioned repowering is we put over 3,000 gigawatts or 3,000 megawatts of wind in service between '18 and '21. And we'll look at potentially repowering those in 2028, 2029, 2030 and save our customers' money, like we're doing with our 4 wind repowerings in Minnesota right now. So I think this really extends our opportunity on the PPA buyout and our own repowering opportunities.\nDavid Arcaro: Yes. That's helpful color. It seems like a big opportunity. Any just visibility into timing or clarity as to when those could crystallize in terms of hitting the CapEx plan?\nBrian Van Abel : I think what we could potentially see in the Colorado, like we talked about potentially seeing bids in the RFP and the Minnesota RFP is focused on solar. The Colorado 1 will be an all-source RFP so we could potentially see something in that RFP that we'll launch later this year that Bob mentioned, will -- you'll get visibility in call it, mid to later next year, could be the first time. Because when we were middle of kind of the resource plan and RFP processes, we want to follow those and make sure we align with the other acquisitions. So that's probably the first time I'd look at it. Longer term, it's much more opportunistic, right? You got to find a developer that is willing to transact at a price that's beneficial for our customers.\nOperator: We will now take the next question from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.\nBrian Van Abel : Jeremy, nice headline.\nJeremy Tonet: Just with life in the fastlane, just wondering -- thank you for all the details today on CapEx, but what could be incremental maybe on the horizon here, if I dare kind of asked what more could come in over time? And specifically, thoughts on additional MISO opportunities, whether that's competitive or upsizing future LRT portfolios?\nBob Frenzel: I appreciate the question. A couple of things. Brian highlighted what we would call incremental capital that we've been talking about for the better part of the year. And this is the competitively bid generation in both Minnesota and Colorado, as well as the incremental transmission that we would need on the power pathway in Colorado to integrate those renewables. That opportunity is $2 billion to $4 billion. At the midpoint of that, we probably have rate base growth in the mid-7s.  Additional to that, things -- early things we're starting to think about, I mean, you heard the previous caller's comments around PPA buyouts and repowerings that\u2019s certainly in our sites. We haven't put bookends around those for the community, but we certainly will. Secondly, as we think about generation in our Southwestern service territory, I think with the IRA, we see economics in solar and wind down there that can make an acceleration of renewables in the SPS territory, also not in our plan would be towards the back end of the 5-year plan, maybe in the middle of the 10-year plan.  We're still evaluating our resiliency expenditures. We feel very solid about what we're doing to harden our grids for climate change. But some of that will happen with the intelligence we need on the distribution grid to enable electrification and transportation and the potential beneficial electrification of gas. Those are the big buckets that I think we need to be continuing to think about. Brian, do you have anything.\nBrian Van Abel : Yes, I would just add a couple more to that. One is in our 5-year plan, we have nothing on hydrogen whether if there's an opportunity on the electric side or potential looking opportunities on the gas LDC side as we work through our clean heat plans. Then also storage. We're working on some interesting long-duration storage projects and also with the stand-alone ITC on store -- for our storage we're looking at opportunities there. So I think there's a good number of, call it, incremental opportunities that aren't captured in our plan as we think through the overall benefits of the IRA.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's great to hear. And I just wanted to go into '23 guide a little bit more there. I think there's 1% growth next year instead of 2% this year. Just wondering, is this primarily post-COVID normalization or some, I guess, conservatism here? And just thoughts, I guess, on achieving flat O&M in 2023, including, I guess, work that you've done this year to derisk the 23 outlook, if you could kind of give us thoughts as to how that factors into the '23 guide?\nBrian Van Abel : Yes. On the first part, just to make sure you're talking about sales, right?\nJeremy Tonet: Yes.\nBrian Van Abel : Yes. Yes. So I think the way you framed it up, it's a little bit of both, right? It's a little post-COVID normalization. We expect to residential use for customer to come down kind of like we saw in Colorado this year where resi UPC has come down more towards pre-pandemic levels. And I think we expect to see that in other jurisdictions while we do see continued economic growth. So you could call it conservative. We are certainly conservative with our sales forecast this year going into the year, we thought we were going to be flat, and we've been up 2% and have seen strong economic activity.  On the O&M side, yes, I think as we went through this year, right, we're certainly subject to the inflationary pressures, and we have been flat since 2014 on O& M. So that was 8 years of being flat, and we had some inflationary pressures, had storms this year, increased investments in our customer platforms and also, we're running our coal plants much more given the change between gas prices and coal, so higher chemical costs, higher plant costs. So as we think about it next year, and we had a good year this year, if you look at kind of the change in the guidance from Q2 to Q3, we invested it this year, right, and when we have good time. So that's why we think about next year in maintaining flat almost a rebaselining into this year, doubling down our continuous improvement programs and setting ourselves up for next year.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's all very helpful. One last one, if I could. If you might be able to speak on the  Colorado gas step increase denial there. Do you see this as a signal from the commission to continue regularly filing rate cases? And are there any takeaways on the electric side?\nBob Frenzel: I wouldn't have contagion, Jeremy, between the electric and the gas case. I think this year was particularly sensitive given the commodity increase in the impact of winter storm Yuri on the gas case. So no, I don't think I'd sort of read through too much to the electric side. We are continuing to invest in that system for safety and reliability and continued customer growth there. So we need to make sure that we're having the right balance of healthy financial metrics for the company. So we are going to file a rate case next year.\nBrian Van Abel : Yes. And I just think about longer term on the gas LDC side, like our net 0 plans for 2030 and 2050 and the LDC side are aligned with the climate science, they're aligned with the state goals, and we're looking forward to working through the clean heat plant in Colorado. Really, I think about resource planning on the gas side. And I think that will help us align with the commission and our stakeholders on how we achieve these carbon reduction targets on the LDC side because it is a critical asset for us and our customers really see demand and interest in it.\nBob Frenzel: And just to put a time line on that, you should see a clean heat plan filing from the company sometime in the second half of next year.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That all makes a lot of sense. Just checking.\nOperator: And we will now take the next question from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore.\nDurgesh Chopra: Solid quarter here. Thank you time. Just I actually had 2 questions, Brian, for you. Just one, I think you mentioned this in your remarks, but the jump in CFO between the 2 plants the $1.8 billion or $2 billion is included in that CFO number, right, from the tax. \nBrian Van Abel : Correct.\nDurgesh Chopra: Okay. Then maybe just because it's a newer concept, how does that actually work? Is there a market for it? And how should we think about you monetizing those taxes? I heard Paul say that that's for newer assets, if I'm not wrong. So maybe just any color that you could give us there, which will sort of help us profile the cash flows through the 5 years?\nBrian Van Abel : Yes, absolutely. And it's a great question because the market for PTCs and transferability doesn't exist because it's being stood up, and it's effective 1 -- so any credit generated starting January 1, 2023, so starting next year is eligible to be transferred. And we were instrumental in the language that was included. We worked very closely on that. So we've been very focused on this because it's so important for our customers to driving down the overall cost for renewables and the LCOE of projects. And for us, we spent a lot of time -- we're not waiting for a market to get set up, right? Longer term, I think a liquid exchange ultimately gets set up but we don't expect that in 2023. We've been going out ourselves talking to local companies that have a significant cash tax appetite to look at bilateral transactions. And I think there's a really good local angle here where we can save our customers' money. We've had very good reception in the discussions we've had. And so we feel very confident in being able to execute on this transferability. But even just being conservative, we've only assumed we transfer half of those credits in 2023, just in conservative nature. And that -- so it takes a little bit of while less set up in our financing plan. But from all the discussions we've had over the past month, we feel very bullish about being able to do this in the interest there from the other corporates.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. Sounds like the process is already underway. And just to be clear, these are tax credits in excess of what you wouldn't be able to offset your taxes currently. Am I thinking about that correctly, Brian?\nBrian Van Abel : Yes, you are. Yes.\nOperator: We will now take the next question from Ross Flower with UBS.\nRoss Fowler: So I just want to wind back a little bit to Nick's question on growth, right? You lowered the 22 base year to about 38.9%, which is lower than your previously forecasted growth and then your growing rate base out a little bit faster. If I look at your old forecast, it's sort of 6.4% to 6.5% through 25%, and now it's kind of 7.1% to 7.4% depending on the year through '25. And I know you mentioned transferability sort of brings that back a little bit. But now if I look at sort of your 3-year rate base growth out to 25%, it's about 7.3%, before it was sort of 6.5% or just under that. So it would seem to me that you're really pushing the high end of your EPS growth guidance here? Or am I not thinking about that correctly? And then I guess the second part of that question is the growth tails off a little bit in '26 and '27. Is that where you see most of that $2 billion to $4 billion in CapEx upside potential coming in?\nBrian Van Abel : Yes. So I think, Ross, the way we think about it is really 5 to 7, we publicly target the upper half of that guidance range for EPS growth. And when we look at it, we feel very confident in delivering there. We've delivered in the upper half of our guidance for the past 12 years when you look at our annual earnings guidance and delivering on our guidance for 17 straight years. So we feel good about the plan we put in place. Yes, it's -- we have generally been known to put a conservative plan in place, and we have a lot of incremental upside. And I think you hit the nail on the head. If you look at 1 of our slides, we show where we think that incremental capital is going to be in the back half of the plan or the back 2 years of the plan. So I think that's the way to think about it as we kind of have that continued year-over-year strong rate base growth.\nRoss Fowler: Okay. And maybe as we just look forward into winter, how are you thinking about natural gas fuel expenses there? Has any of that been sort of deferred through the regulatory process? Or how are you just thinking about build pressure generally? How do we keep that with customers because natural gas prices are up a lot year-over-year?\nBob Frenzel: Yes, Ross, it's Bob. We are certainly sensitive to the commodity impact on our natural gas customers in their bills this winter. We've been very active in energy efficiency programs. We've been very active in the federal and the state levels on identifying and trying to secure significant portions of LIHEAP funding and then working with our customers directly to find and enable those customers that may not even know they're LIHEAP eligible to benefit from some of the mechanisms that we have at the state and at the federal level to mitigate impacts on our customers. We start with some of the lowest rates in the country in our Colorado gas company but we recognize and are empathetic to everything is up from a starting point for customers who are feeling it at the pump, they're feeling it in rent and they're feeling it at the grocery store.  So we're empathetic. We're doing everything we can to mitigate the impacts. We have extended the cost of the winter storm Yuri costs in various jurisdictions anywhere from 2 to 5 years. So we have mitigated regulatory outcomes on that gas piece, but very active with our customers and communications as we go into the winter time.\nBrian Van Abel : And I'll just add, Bob, you talked on the LDC side. We can touch on the electric side, right, we're 85% roughly electric. And we've really set ourselves up well with our Steel for Fuel investments, right? We've always viewed those as being a hedge against rising gas commodity costs, and that's exactly what we see. Now we're going to provide our customers over $1 billion in fuel-related benefits or avoidance this year alone with our owned wind farms and we got those approved back when their gas is $2 to $3 -- in the $2 to $3 range. So think about how economic those wind investments are for our customers now.  So on the electric side, we feel good about where we are. And also on the electric side, we have the third lowest bills of any investor-owned utility in the country. So we're at a really good starting point too. And so obviously, what Bob said, we're very conscientious of customer bill impacts, and I spent a lot of time focusing on how we can mitigate and manage those for our customers.\nOperator: We will now take the next question from Steve Fleishman with Wolf Research.\nSteve Fleishman: So the 18% FFO to debt that you now see, I mean, that's obviously a great number, very strong, is that kind of your target now for FFO to debt going forward? Or how should we think about that?\nBrian Van Abel : Steve, the way I think about it is a little bit of balance between FFO to debt and then the holding company debt to total debt. And that metric right now for Moody's has us at about a 25% threshold on that and certainly going to have a conversation about what that right threshold is. But -- great to see our FFO to debt with strong improvement of 100-plus basis points relative to pre IRA. So -- but we look at both of those in combination because it really is important to have -- maintain that strong credit quality, not only at the holding company, but also to work with our commissions ensure we have strong credit quality at all the operating companies too, because it really is in the best interest of the customer.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. And just to clarify the comment that you made about the $2 billion to $4 billion incremental capital, I think you said you'd be able to finance it with the current capital structure. Could you just better clarify what that means? Does that mean you would finance it kind of consistent with the way your current capital structure is in terms of new debt and new equity or is it --\nBrian Van Abel : It is consistent with the consolidated capital structure.\nBob Frenzel: Yes.\nSteve Fleishman: So there would be more equity needed then to fund that if you --\nBrian Van Abel : Yes, I'll caveat that with all depending on the timing of that capital. if it's more backdated, you maybe have more flexibility. So that's just sitting here today, but it really depends on the timing and we really evaluate it once we get more visibility on magnitude and timing of that capital.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. Okay. Yes, because it just -- I mean I love strong balance sheet, just 18% is kind of off the charts these days. So it's -- but it's also obviously better to be strong than not.\nBrian Van Abel : Yes. We said the IRA was good for us and good for our customers. So we're glad to be able to speak about it in more depth on this earnings call. We only had about 12 hours last Q2 earnings call to talk about it in [digested tax], so happy to spend more time on it now.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. And then another question, just on all the data that you gave on the IRA savings for the cost of solar and wind. So like Sherco 30% lower and some of the data. Just I want to just make sure I understand the starting point there because there have been a lot of inflationary pressures for like the last 18 months. And so when you're seeing these savings, are you going back to before that? Are you going to kind of where you'd be now, is the baseline including those inflationary cost pressures that had already occurred? I just want to make sure I understand the baseline for that -- for these.\nBrian Van Abel : Absolutely. So Sherco -- I'll start with Sherco Solar. That includes from our initial -- very initial filing to the revised filing with higher capital costs to address the supply chain pressure. So that is -- includes all those pressures and then pre-IRA to post IRA. So that's that kind of actual capital costs, including pressures on the overall call it, panel pricing with everything --\nSteve Fleishman: So the 30% -- so the 30% goes back to the initial filing or to the revised.\nBrian Van Abel : The revised filing, so the revised filing, pre-IRA, post IRA. And then on the generics, assume capital cost is the same, assume today's capital cost or an inflated capital costs, right? So assume CapEx is the same. And a solar farm that would have qualified for a 10% ITC versus now you get a PTC for us, which is as a regulated utility, would choose the PTC. And then the range is based on NCFs if you qualify for any, call it, adders or bonuses, so just community energy.\nSteve Fleishman: So those are savings, yes.\nBrian Van Abel : Right. When that assumes say, a 2027 wind farm that would have qualified for 0 tax cut to 0 PTCs versus now 100% PTCs at the escalated value as you assume over time. So that's really where our customers are going to see when we add those several thousand megawatts or 5-plus thousand megawatts in that back half of the decade.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. That's great.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc.\nSophie Karp : I was curious if you could talk a little bit about this -- the collaboration with Bloom Energy on the zero-emission electrolyzer, I guess, produce hydrogen and try nuclear plants? Just curious if you could give any color on the milestones there. And also, can you describe why it makes sense to have this type of process at the nuclear plant, which is a base load plan and presumably could dispatch into the grade at all times as opposed to a wind facility that may have more variability.\nBob Frenzel: Sophie, it's Bob. Thanks for the question. Look, we were a recipient of a high-temperature gas -- or high-temperature electrification pilot from the Department of Energy related to our Prairie Island nuclear plant. And the concept is -- and I think you hit on really the big point is, as we increase wind or renewable or 0 cost energy on our system, we see our nuclear plants, particularly in the shoulder months starting to cycle up and down. And we have processes and procedures and approvals to do that.  But your point is, wouldn't you rather keep the plant at 100% power and not cycle it. And that's exactly what the concept of an electrolyzer off the back of a nuclear plant does. As you take the steam, you let the reactor run at 100% power, but you don't run the generator at 100%, use that excess steam to do steam reformation on the electrolyzer, raise the temperature and create hydrogen that way. So you do it when the plant would otherwise be cycling that allows you reactor stability by keeping the nuclear plant at 100% power while keeping the generation plant load following on the electric side. And your comment on the manufacturers, we chose a manufacturer for the electrolyzer and I think that was your comment.\nBrian Van Abel : Yes. And Sophie, I'll just add to it. We're working through the development of it, it should be online probably later in 2023. And as we think we -- this is a really interesting aspect of potentially how we could use our nuclear plants and create pink hydrogen. We're working with a consortium in our states around the hydrogen hub announcement and applying for a DOE grant. And so this is part of a broader opportunity as we think we work with our states, both in Minnesota and the Upper Midwest and also in Colorado and the surrounding states on another hydrogen hub.\nSophie Karp : I guess does it make a difference if it's the nuclear plant that you avoid cycling versus just hooking it up to a wind farm, I guess, from an operational standpoint, maybe it makes sense. But the marginal cost of the wind generation is 0, right, marginal cost of a nuclear plant is not 0. So economically, does that make a difference? Or since it\u2019s on the same grade, it doesn't, like how should we think about this?\nBrian Van Abel : And so this is 1 of the unique aspects of this, is high-temperature steam electrolysis. So we're taking waste steam off the nuclear plant to heat the water, which makes it 30% -- the electrolysis process 30% more efficient.\nOperator: We will now take the next question from Julian Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith : Appreciate it. Listen, I want to just pick up real quickly around the $2 billion to $4 billion real quickly with respect to the upside CapEx. How do you think about that materializing just on a high level perspective? I know you flagged the back half of the year, but can you talk about some of the dynamics here in the near term that would result in that upside in the back half, i.e., is a lot of predicated on the Colorado RFP process this year. How do you think about that, you're manifesting itself here in just in terms of procurement processes? And related to that, what about the upside to this 50% renewable assumption that we've used in the past? You alluded to it in your script remarks on that front. It seems like there could be some latitude whether to have the repowerings or greenfield opportunity.\nBrian Van Abel : Yes. Julien, let me hit on the first one. Yes, really two processes. One is the Minnesota RFP is already in flight. We launched it in -- later in Q3. And so that was a little bit of ahead of Colorado, so likely see a decision out of Minnesota in middle of '23 on the Minnesota, but that's a smaller RFP than Colorado. Colorado is the bigger RFP in terms of megawatts of renewables. And we'll look to launch that here later this year and then likely file the application with the Colorado Commission in, call it, mid to late Q3 is probably when you get some visibility into that and the decision, hopefully, by the end of next year on the Colorado Commission. So a little bit phased between Minnesota and Colorado.  On your question about the 50% assumption, we take a conservative assumption. And I think given the opportunity and the benefit that the IR has around the solar PTC and transferability, we expect to be extremely cost competitive and potentially have an opportunity to own more than 50%, and that's certainly our goal because we think it is long-term beneficial for our customers of ownership right? I mean the PPAs that were struck a few years ago aren't passing this benefit of transferability back to our customers as we are with our own wind farms. And we think about repowering our own wind farms longer term, it's more opportunity and benefit for our customers. So we think long-term ownership of these renewable assets is really good for our customers, and we're going to strive to tell as much as we possibly can.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith : Got it. And maybe let me just clarify a little bit. On the repowering side, are you thinking that that's pretty strictly going to be done through the RFP process here? And the time line and opportunities that sort of dictated through it or is there more of an opportunistic ability to approach customers on a one-off? I think you're implying the former.\nBrian Van Abel : Yes. When you say repowerings, so I think about our own repowerings in the kind of the latter part of this decade, and that would not be in this RFP. That's a couple of years out type of opportunity to bring forth with our commissions in terms of we can do something that can save our customers' money. So I would say that's outside of the RFP process.\nBob Frenzel: But I would come back to the PPA buyout concept. And we think that RFPs and preferred plans as part of our resource plans are an opportunity to bring some of the PPA buyout toward, and we have talked about that. So we have a history of doing it outside of an RFP process as well as that being an emphasis and a driver for it. So I would expect that some of this stuff to come to fruition over the next 9 months to 12 months as we work through the process with our commissioners and with the RFP results.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith : Got it. More of a holistic update, say, late next year, maybe by 4Q.\nBob Frenzel: Across -- all of the above. \nOperator: And we will now take the next question from Ryan Levine with Citigroup.\nRyan Levine: I just wanted to follow up on the hydrogen hub comments. To the extent that hydrogen hub is developed in your neighborhood or in your backyard, can you talk to the materiality for your business outlook in light of the IRA and your opportunities both on the gas and the electric side?\nBob Frenzel: Sure. This is Bob. Look, we're working on 2 applications for hydrogen hub. These proposals came out of the Infrastructure and Jobs Act that was passed around this time last year. The DOE is now in receptivity mode to receiving proposals. We've got 1 in the Upper Midwest, largely targeted around North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota and Wisconsin, and we've got both the states and MOUs, partnerships as well as a lot of the energy providers in those states working collaboratively to identify all the facets of what a hydrogen hub could look like.  And I'll just give you the example in the Upper Midwest, we're looking at fertilizer production. We're looking at LDC gas. We're looking at gas for electric CTs, we're looking at hydrogen production off the back of our nuclear facilities, all encapsulated into a system that allows for transportation and storage and consumption of hydrogen that's produced from clean energy. Similarly, in the Western states, so in Colorado, we're working with a consortium of states, so Wyoming, Utah and New Mexico and Colorado on a similar concept out West. And again, a significant -- we and our Colorado companies at the center of those conversations, again, on electricity, hydrogen for electricity, hydrogen for our LDC system, hydrogen for agriculture, hydrogen for transportation.  So we talk about investment opportunities. I don't think we've characterized them fully in terms of the hub concept. The DOE has talked about the hubs being sort of $8 billion, 4 to 5 of them. So you could think about them being $1 million to $2 billion each. And each of those are requested to have sort of matching investments from private industry to match the public funds. And we've also characterized what a hydrogen production that would match just 5% of our LDC is somewhere between $2 billion to $4 billion of investments between the renewables it takes to generate it as well as the electrolyzer, the balance of plant and the storage and transportation, so significant investments to create hydrogen for the benefit of our customers and to enable our clean energy transition. So I'd say it's a multibillion-dollar opportunity largely centered in the back half of the decade.\nRyan Levine: And just to be clear, you have some disclosure in Minnesota around hydrogen-ready combined CTs. Is there any of that spending that's already in your plan? Or is this all incremental?\nBob Frenzel: As part of the Minnesota resource plan, we have reliability assets, combustion turbines that we've committed to making hydrogen capable that would be included in our plan, but that's just the CT side. But none of the production of hydrogen is included in our plan.\nOperator: And we will now take the next question from Travis Miller with Morningstar.\nTravis Miller: You just answered my exact question on the hydrogen hub, so I won't repeat it. I appreciate all the detail there. Just 1 more in terms of the election, any key issues that you're looking at or key changes potentially in any of the state-level policies or legislatures?\nBob Frenzel: Travis, it's Bob. Thanks for the inquiry on hydrogen. Glad we can answer your question. On the election, I think we're about 10 days away, lots of activity on the television, lots of signs, lots of mailers, lots of e-mails and texts. We're obviously interested in outcomes. But I think as a company, we've been very successful working with all administrations. Our policies of energy transition, protecting our customers, enabling a good experience and having clean energy for all is really important. And I think we can work with any of our elected officials. We've got great relationships with those sitting officers today, and we look forward to continuing those into the future. But I don't see anything that's going to dramatically change our plans, our investment philosophy and our 10-year trajectory that we laid out today.\nTravis Miller: Okay. Great. I appreciate all the rest of the details on the call.\nOperator: And there are no further questions. So I will turn the call back to Brian Van Abel, CFO, for closing remarks.\nBrian Van Abel : Yes. Thank you all for participating in our earnings call this morning. We look forward to seeing everyone in a few weeks, and please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions.\nOperator: Thank you for joining today's call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bob Frenzel",
            "content": "Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Let's start with our financial results. We had another solid quarter, recording earnings of $1.18 per share for 2022 compared to $1.13 per share in 2021. Our earnings are on track, and as a result, we are narrowing our '22 earnings guidance range to $3.14 to $3.19 per share. We're also initiating 2023 earnings guidance of $3.30 to $3.40 per share, which reflects our 5% to 7% long-term EPS growth objective.  Consistent with past practices, we've updated our base investment plan, which reflects $29.5 billion of capital expenditures over the next 5 years. This investment plan provides significant benefits to our customers, supports community vitality and resiliency and delivers rate base growth of 6.5%.  We're very excited about our investment plans, which support continued execution of our long-term strategy and clean energy leadership. It enhances reliability and resiliency, advances our generation fleet transition, allows for the electrification of transportation, keep customers' bills low and delivers attractive returns for investors. And while our base plan is robust, it does not include any potential renewable generation assets that are approved in our Minnesota and Colorado resource plans, or additional transmission capital is needed to integrate new renewable generation in Colorado beyond the Power Pathway Project. For these assets, we expect further regulatory clarification in the second half of 2023, which could result in incremental capital expenditures of $2 billion to $4 billion, which would result in rate base growth of 7.6% at the midpoint. Our updated capital plan, which reflects the benefits of the IRA, extends the growth rate and improves the quality of rate base, reduces financing risk, improves credit metrics, and delivers substantial customer and environmental benefits.  During the quarter, the Inflation Reduction Act was passed into law, which includes new and extended tax credits for wind, solar, hydrogen, storage, carbon sequestration and nuclear. It also includes tax credit transferability. Some of the key takeaways for the IRA include substantial customer benefits and a continuation of our clean energy leadership while keeping customer bills affordable. The inclusion of the new solar production tax credit makes our company-owned projects more affordable for our customers relative to the solar ITC. The hydrogen production tax credit should improve our competitive advantage in delivering low-cost, clean fuels for our combustion turbines for electric reliability and for blending into our local gas distribution systems that will help our customers lower their carbon footprint in the future. The nuclear production tax credit will provide additional customer credits depending on MISO marginal pricing thereby lowering the cost of electricity from our existing nuclear assets. The tax credit transferability will increase liquidity and improve credit metrics. An excellent example of the IRA tax benefits is our 460-megawatt Sherco Solar proposal that was recently approved by the Minnesota Commission with strong stakeholder support. This will be the largest solar facility in the Midwest and a top 5 installation in the United States, which will go into service in 2024 and 2025.  Following the IRA passage, the levelized cost of Sherco solar is projected to decline by over 30%, even after accounting for inflation and supply chain pressures. Due to the project qualified for both solar PTCs and community energy bonus as we are reinvesting in the community around our retiring coal facility. This is a substantial benefit to our customers.  Earlier this year, the commissions in both Minnesota and Colorado approved resource plans that will add nearly 10, 000 megawatts of utility scale renewables to our systems and achieve an 85% carbon reduction by 2030. These resource plans were approved prior to the passage of the IRA, but the final recommended portfolios are expected to capture the benefits of the IRA which will significantly reduce the levelized cost of these renewable projects for our customers. We've issued a request for proposal in Minnesota and plan to issue an RFP in Colorado later this year. After evaluation of proposals, we anticipate submitting our recommended portfolios to our respective commissions by the middle of next year and expect decisions in the second half of next year. We expect the recommended portfolios of generation assets will include a mixture of self-build, build-own-transfer projects as well as some power purchase agreements.  Our generation resource plans are consistent with our Steel for Fuel strategy, which provides a valuable hedge for our customers against rising commodity prices. As an example, our owned wind farms are projected to generate nearly $1 billion of fuel-related customer savings in 2022 alone and almost $3 billion since 2017. While these fuel savings were not included in our investment case, it shows the tremendous customer benefits of being an early leader in the clean energy transition. We also continue to advance our broader ESG leadership as MSCI recently upgraded Xcel Energy's rating from AA to AAA and categorized our company as leader in their nomenclature for managing the most significant ESG risks and opportunities. It's is an outstanding accomplishment and reflects our continued progress, including adopting a water management goal, greater disclosure of human capital management practices and an improved governance score. We were also named to investor business daily's 100 best ESG companies, which is further recognition of our ESG leadership.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian. Yes, Nike, it's Bob. Thanks for the question. Look, I think on the Minnesota electric case, first and foremost, we've got the gas case behind us, and that sets a good framework for some of the items in the electric case. We're engaged with parties, I think rebuttal testimony as to in the middle -- or the hearings are in the middle of December. So I think we should target that as a deadline for settlement opportunities. David, it's Bob. Thanks for the question. We filed the case back in January with the commission, and we're looking for a 3-year forward gas case. We have expected capital expenditures continuing next year and the year after, and we have real visibility into the case -- sorry, the commission granted us a historic test year case, means we likely need to go back in sometime in 2023 for a new gas case. I appreciate the question. A couple of things. Brian highlighted what we would call incremental capital that we've been talking about for the better part of the year. And this is the competitively bid generation in both Minnesota and Colorado, as well as the incremental transmission that we would need on the power pathway in Colorado to integrate those renewables. That opportunity is $2 billion to $4 billion. At the midpoint of that, we probably have rate base growth in the mid-7s.  Additional to that, things -- early things we're starting to think about, I mean, you heard the previous caller's comments around PPA buyouts and repowerings that's certainly in our sites. We haven't put bookends around those for the community, but we certainly will. Secondly, as we think about generation in our Southwestern service territory, I think with the IRA, we see economics in solar and wind down there that can make an acceleration of renewables in the SPS territory, also not in our plan would be towards the back end of the 5-year plan, maybe in the middle of the 10-year plan.  We're still evaluating our resiliency expenditures. We feel very solid about what we're doing to harden our grids for climate change. But some of that will happen with the intelligence we need on the distribution grid to enable electrification and transportation and the potential beneficial electrification of gas. Those are the big buckets that I think we need to be continuing to think about. Brian, do you have anything. I wouldn't have contagion, Jeremy, between the electric and the gas case. I think this year was particularly sensitive given the commodity increase in the impact of winter storm Yuri on the gas case. So no, I don't think I'd sort of read through too much to the electric side. We are continuing to invest in that system for safety and reliability and continued customer growth there. So we need to make sure that we're having the right balance of healthy financial metrics for the company. So we are going to file a rate case next year. And just to put a time line on that, you should see a clean heat plan filing from the company sometime in the second half of next year. Yes, Ross, it's Bob. We are certainly sensitive to the commodity impact on our natural gas customers in their bills this winter. We've been very active in energy efficiency programs. We've been very active in the federal and the state levels on identifying and trying to secure significant portions of LIHEAP funding and then working with our customers directly to find and enable those customers that may not even know they're LIHEAP eligible to benefit from some of the mechanisms that we have at the state and at the federal level to mitigate impacts on our customers. We start with some of the lowest rates in the country in our Colorado gas company but we recognize and are empathetic to everything is up from a starting point for customers who are feeling it at the pump, they're feeling it in rent and they're feeling it at the grocery store.  So we're empathetic. We're doing everything we can to mitigate the impacts. We have extended the cost of the winter storm Yuri costs in various jurisdictions anywhere from 2 to 5 years. So we have mitigated regulatory outcomes on that gas piece, but very active with our customers and communications as we go into the winter time. Yes. Sophie, it's Bob. Thanks for the question. Look, we were a recipient of a high-temperature gas -- or high-temperature electrification pilot from the Department of Energy related to our Prairie Island nuclear plant. And the concept is -- and I think you hit on really the big point is, as we increase wind or renewable or 0 cost energy on our system, we see our nuclear plants, particularly in the shoulder months starting to cycle up and down. And we have processes and procedures and approvals to do that.  But your point is, wouldn't you rather keep the plant at 100% power and not cycle it. And that's exactly what the concept of an electrolyzer off the back of a nuclear plant does. As you take the steam, you let the reactor run at 100% power, but you don't run the generator at 100%, use that excess steam to do steam reformation on the electrolyzer, raise the temperature and create hydrogen that way. So you do it when the plant would otherwise be cycling that allows you reactor stability by keeping the nuclear plant at 100% power while keeping the generation plant load following on the electric side. And your comment on the manufacturers, we chose a manufacturer for the electrolyzer and I think that was your comment. But I would come back to the PPA buyout concept. And we think that RFPs and preferred plans as part of our resource plans are an opportunity to bring some of the PPA buyout toward, and we have talked about that. So we have a history of doing it outside of an RFP process as well as that being an emphasis and a driver for it. So I would expect that some of this stuff to come to fruition over the next 9 months to 12 months as we work through the process with our commissioners and with the RFP results. Across -- all of the above. Sure. This is Bob. Look, we're working on 2 applications for hydrogen hub. These proposals came out of the Infrastructure and Jobs Act that was passed around this time last year. The DOE is now in receptivity mode to receiving proposals. We've got 1 in the Upper Midwest, largely targeted around North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota and Wisconsin, and we've got both the states and MOUs, partnerships as well as a lot of the energy providers in those states working collaboratively to identify all the facets of what a hydrogen hub could look like.  And I'll just give you the example in the Upper Midwest, we're looking at fertilizer production. We're looking at LDC gas. We're looking at gas for electric CTs, we're looking at hydrogen production off the back of our nuclear facilities, all encapsulated into a system that allows for transportation and storage and consumption of hydrogen that's produced from clean energy. Similarly, in the Western states, so in Colorado, we're working with a consortium of states, so Wyoming, Utah and New Mexico and Colorado on a similar concept out West. And again, a significant -- we and our Colorado companies at the center of those conversations, again, on electricity, hydrogen for electricity, hydrogen for our LDC system, hydrogen for agriculture, hydrogen for transportation.  So we talk about investment opportunities. I don't think we've characterized them fully in terms of the hub concept. The DOE has talked about the hubs being sort of $8 billion, 4 to 5 of them. So you could think about them being $1 million to $2 billion each. And each of those are requested to have sort of matching investments from private industry to match the public funds. And we've also characterized what a hydrogen production that would match just 5% of our LDC is somewhere between $2 billion to $4 billion of investments between the renewables it takes to generate it as well as the electrolyzer, the balance of plant and the storage and transportation, so significant investments to create hydrogen for the benefit of our customers and to enable our clean energy transition. So I'd say it's a multibillion-dollar opportunity largely centered in the back half of the decade. As part of the Minnesota resource plan, we have reliability assets, combustion turbines that we've committed to making hydrogen capable that would be included in our plan, but that's just the CT side. But none of the production of hydrogen is included in our plan. Travis, it's Bob. Thanks for the inquiry on hydrogen. Glad we can answer your question. On the election, I think we're about 10 days away, lots of activity on the television, lots of signs, lots of mailers, lots of e-mails and texts. We're obviously interested in outcomes. But I think as a company, we've been very successful working with all administrations. Our policies of energy transition, protecting our customers, enabling a good experience and having clean energy for all is really important. And I think we can work with any of our elected officials. We've got great relationships with those sitting officers today, and we look forward to continuing those into the future. But I don't see anything that's going to dramatically change our plans, our investment philosophy and our 10-year trajectory that we laid out today."

            "name": "Brian Van Abel",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. We had a solid quarter, recording earnings of $1.18 per share for the third quarter of 2022 compared with $1.13 per share in 2021. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter included the following: higher electric and natural gas margins increased earnings by $0.33 per share, primarily driven by riders and regulatory outcomes to recover our capital investments. In addition, a lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.02 per share. Keep in mind, production tax credits lowered the ETR. However, PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin and are largely earnings neutral.  Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation expense, which reduced earnings by $0.10 per share, reflecting our capital investment program, higher O&M expense, which decreased earnings by $0.06 per share. Higher interest expense and other taxes, primarily property taxes, decreased earnings by $0.07 per share and other items combined to reduce earnings by $0.07 per share. Turning to our sales. Our year-to-date weather-adjusted electric sales increased by 2.2%, largely due to higher C&I sales driven by strong economic activity in our service territories. The year-to-date results are relatively consistent with our expectations of 2% sales growth for 2022, while we anticipate more modest sales growth of 1% for next year.  Shifting to expense. O&M expenses increased $43 million for the third quarter, driven by investments in technology and customer programs, storm costs, vegetation management and inflation. Like other businesses, we are facing inflationary pressures and now expect an annual O&M increase of approximately 4%. This represents a step increase due to cost pressures. However, we anticipate flat O&M in 2023.  We made progress on a number of regulatory proceedings. During the quarter, Minnesota Commission approved our Yuri storm settlement, including full recovery of all costs with the exception of a $19 million disallowance. We have now resolved Yuri cost recovery in all of our states with the exception of Texas. We also have pending electric and natural gas rate cases in Minnesota. And in a natural gas rate case, we reached a comprehensive settlement which reflects a rate increase of $21 million, an ROE of 9.57%, a currently authorized equity ratio of 52.5%, a decoupling mechanism and property tax tracker. We think this is a constructive settlement and anticipate a commission decision next year.  In the Minnesota electric rate case, we recently received intervener testimony. The Department of Commerce recommended a 3-year rate increase of $274 million based on an ROE of 9.25% and an equity ratio of 52.5%. In addition, the Department of Commerce recommendation reflects customer credits for the MISO capacity auction revenues and extension of the depreciable lives of the Monaco nuclear plant and our wind farms. We are meeting with parties to see if we can reach a constructive settlement.  In October, the Colorado Commission approved a rate increase of $64 million for our natural gas case, reflecting a historic test year with the year-end rate base and $16 million of incremental depreciation expense. The commission also approved a weighted average cost of capital of 6.7%, which will reflect as an ROE of 9.2% and an equity ratio of 53.8% based on the ranges they provided. As a result of the Colorado Commission denying the step increases, we are evaluating options of filing another rate case as the natural gas business remains a critical part of the energy infrastructure in Colorado that is valued by our customers. As far as future filings, we plan to file Colorado and New Mexico electric rate cases later this year and the Texas rate case in the first quarter of 2023. As Bob mentioned, we've issued a robust $29.5 billion 5-year base capital forecast with a rate base growth of 6.5% using 2022 as a base. The base plan reflects significant grid and resiliency investment, our Colorado Power pathway proposal and other transmission system investments to maintain asset health and reliability and enable renewable generation. The plan reflects a modest level of renewables including our Sherco Solar facility. It also includes natural gas peaking plants to ensure reliability as we retire coal plants, along with investments to improve the customer experience.  We also anticipate potential incremental capital investment for renewables associated with the Minnesota and Colorado resource plans. Our proposed resource plans include approximately 3,500 megawatts of additions from 2024 to 2027, which would result in capital investment of $1.5 billion to $3 billion, assuming 50% ownership. In addition, we anticipate the need for an incremental $500 million to $1 billion of related transmission for the Colorado IRP. Combined, we can see a potential incremental investment to support the clean energy transition of $2 billion to $4 billion. We've updated our financing plan, which reflects a combination of cash generation, debt and equity to fund the majority of our capital expenditures. The financing plan assumes $1.8 billion of tax credit transfers which improves our credit metrics, maintains a strong balance sheet and lowers the cost of renewable projects for our customers. Compared to our previous 5-year plan, transfer ability to reduce equity needs to $750 million, while we've increased CapEx by $3.5 billion. In addition, we anticipate that any incremental capital will be financed at roughly our current capital structure.  It is important to recognize that we've always maintained a conservative financing strategy, which reflects a strong balance sheet and credit metrics, a balanced financing plan and minimal levels of variable debt and longer maturities. This approach is critical in the current market of rising rates and will benefit our customers while maintaining our solid credit ratings and favorable access to the capital markets. Bob discussed IRA customer benefits, but I wanted to add a few more details. Tax credit transferability is projected to provide $1.8 billion of liquidity, which increases cash flow and reduces our equity needs. Our FFO to debt metrics improved by approximately 100 basis points during the forecast time period, even after adding $3. 5 billion of capital and reducing equity needs. The solar PTC and tax credit transferability improve the competitiveness of our renewable bids. We project the IRA will drive approximately $500 million of customer savings from our owned renewable projects over the next 5 years and nuclear PTCs could drive additional savings. We anticipate that pricing will decline on solar projects by 25% to 40% and wind projects by 50% to 60% later in this decade due to new and extended tax credits along with potential adders in the IRA. Finally, we don't anticipate any material impact from AMT as a result of makers' depreciation and existing tax credits on our balance sheet. Shifting to earnings. We've updated our 2022 guidance assumptions to reflect the latest information. We're also narrowing our 2022 earnings guidance range to $3.14 to $3.19 per share. We're also initiating our 2023 earnings guidance range of $3.30 to $3.40 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%. Key assumptions are detailed in our earnings release.  With that, I'll wrap it up with a quick summary. IRA was passed with significant benefits for our customers in the company. The Minnesota Commission approved our Sherco Solar project. We reached a constructive settlement in our Minnesota natural gas rate case. The Colorado Commission approved our natural gas rate case. We're narrowing our 2022 earnings guidance range. We announced our robust updated capital investment program that provides strong, transparent rate base growth and customer value. We initiated 2023 guidance consistent with our long-term earnings growth rate. And we remain confident we can continue to deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within the upper half of our 5% to 7% objective range as we lead the clean energy transition and keep those low for our customers.  This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions. Yes. Absolutely, Nick, and I'll handle that one. Yes. I mean when we look at the IRA, huge win for our customers and us. And really -- and when we think about our financing plan, it's around transferability. And there is an offset because a majority of those tax credits were on our balance sheet as a deferred tax asset, which would increase the cost of our renewable projects. So by being able to monetize them, we reduced that tax asset on our balance sheet, lower the overall LCOE for our wind projects and solar projects to our customers and improve our cash flow. So you do have lower rate base from that in a vacuum but it allows us to reduce our equity needs, increase CapEx and have basically a higher quality rate base as we think about it. Much of the steel in the ground and the tax assets on our balance sheet. Yes. Yes, I'll take that one. I think it absolutely does. And the way I think about it, it extends our PPA buyout opportunity for a long time, right? What we've been successful at, we bought out about $750 million of PPAs over the past number of years. And we were successful because we brought forward a win for our customers ,a win for us, right? We were able to buy out a PPA, put steel in the ground and save our customers' money. And we did that by buying out the PP and repowering it and qualifying for new set -- new strip of tax credits on the wind side.  So pre IRA, the buyout opportunities were stepping down as your tax credit stepped down. Now since we have a 10-year-plus runway of PTCs and also, we'll look at evaluating solar buyout opportunities, if you can repower on a solar PTC farm. So I think there's a much longer runway for buyout opportunities. And none of that is our capital forecast is in our 5-year plan as upside.  And I think that longer term, as you think about repowering, as you mentioned repowering is we put over 3,000 gigawatts or 3,000 megawatts of wind in service between '18 and '21. And we'll look at potentially repowering those in 2028, 2029, 2030 and save our customers' money, like we're doing with our 4 wind repowerings in Minnesota right now. So I think this really extends our opportunity on the PPA buyout and our own repowering opportunities. I think what we could potentially see in the Colorado, like we talked about potentially seeing bids in the RFP and the Minnesota RFP is focused on solar. The Colorado 1 will be an all-source RFP so we could potentially see something in that RFP that we'll launch later this year that Bob mentioned, will -- you'll get visibility in call it, mid to later next year, could be the first time. Because when we were middle of kind of the resource plan and RFP processes, we want to follow those and make sure we align with the other acquisitions. So that's probably the first time I'd look at it. Longer term, it's much more opportunistic, right? You got to find a developer that is willing to transact at a price that's beneficial for our customers. Jeremy, nice headline. Yes, I would just add a couple more to that. One is in our 5-year plan, we have nothing on hydrogen whether if there's an opportunity on the electric side or potential looking opportunities on the gas LDC side as we work through our clean heat plans. Then also storage. We're working on some interesting long-duration storage projects and also with the stand-alone ITC on store -- for our storage we're looking at opportunities there. So I think there's a good number of, call it, incremental opportunities that aren't captured in our plan as we think through the overall benefits of the IRA. Yes. On the first part, just to make sure you're talking about sales, right? Yes. Yes. So I think the way you framed it up, it's a little bit of both, right? It's a little post-COVID normalization. We expect to residential use for customer to come down kind of like we saw in Colorado this year where resi UPC has come down more towards pre-pandemic levels. And I think we expect to see that in other jurisdictions while we do see continued economic growth. So you could call it conservative. We are certainly conservative with our sales forecast this year going into the year, we thought we were going to be flat, and we've been up 2% and have seen strong economic activity.  On the O&M side, yes, I think as we went through this year, right, we're certainly subject to the inflationary pressures, and we have been flat since 2014 on O& M. So that was 8 years of being flat, and we had some inflationary pressures, had storms this year, increased investments in our customer platforms and also, we're running our coal plants much more given the change between gas prices and coal, so higher chemical costs, higher plant costs. So as we think about it next year, and we had a good year this year, if you look at kind of the change in the guidance from Q2 to Q3, we invested it this year, right, and when we have good time. So that's why we think about next year in maintaining flat almost a rebaselining into this year, doubling down our continuous improvement programs and setting ourselves up for next year. Yes. And I just think about longer term on the gas LDC side, like our net 0 plans for 2030 and 2050 and the LDC side are aligned with the climate science, they're aligned with the state goals, and we're looking forward to working through the clean heat plant in Colorado. Really, I think about resource planning on the gas side. And I think that will help us align with the commission and our stakeholders on how we achieve these carbon reduction targets on the LDC side because it is a critical asset for us and our customers really see demand and interest in it. Correct. Yes, absolutely. And it's a great question because the market for PTCs and transferability doesn't exist because it's being stood up, and it's effective 1 -- so any credit generated starting January 1, 2023, so starting next year is eligible to be transferred. And we were instrumental in the language that was included. We worked very closely on that. So we've been very focused on this because it's so important for our customers to driving down the overall cost for renewables and the LCOE of projects. And for us, we spent a lot of time -- we're not waiting for a market to get set up, right? Longer term, I think a liquid exchange ultimately gets set up but we don't expect that in 2023. We've been going out ourselves talking to local companies that have a significant cash tax appetite to look at bilateral transactions. And I think there's a really good local angle here where we can save our customers' money. We've had very good reception in the discussions we've had. And so we feel very confident in being able to execute on this transferability. But even just being conservative, we've only assumed we transfer half of those credits in 2023, just in conservative nature. And that -- so it takes a little bit of while less set up in our financing plan. But from all the discussions we've had over the past month, we feel very bullish about being able to do this in the interest there from the other corporates. Yes, you are. Yes. Yes. So I think, Ross, the way we think about it is really 5 to 7, we publicly target the upper half of that guidance range for EPS growth. And when we look at it, we feel very confident in delivering there. We've delivered in the upper half of our guidance for the past 12 years when you look at our annual earnings guidance and delivering on our guidance for 17 straight years. So we feel good about the plan we put in place. Yes, it's -- we have generally been known to put a conservative plan in place, and we have a lot of incremental upside. And I think you hit the nail on the head. If you look at 1 of our slides, we show where we think that incremental capital is going to be in the back half of the plan or the back 2 years of the plan. So I think that's the way to think about it as we kind of have that continued year-over-year strong rate base growth. And I'll just add, Bob, you talked on the LDC side. We can touch on the electric side, right, we're 85% roughly electric. And we've really set ourselves up well with our Steel for Fuel investments, right? We've always viewed those as being a hedge against rising gas commodity costs, and that's exactly what we see. Now we're going to provide our customers over $1 billion in fuel-related benefits or avoidance this year alone with our owned wind farms and we got those approved back when their gas is $2 to $3 -- in the $2 to $3 range. So think about how economic those wind investments are for our customers now.  So on the electric side, we feel good about where we are. And also on the electric side, we have the third lowest bills of any investor-owned utility in the country. So we're at a really good starting point too. And so obviously, what Bob said, we're very conscientious of customer bill impacts, and I spent a lot of time focusing on how we can mitigate and manage those for our customers. Steve, the way I think about it is a little bit of balance between FFO to debt and then the holding company debt to total debt. And that metric right now for Moody's has us at about a 25% threshold on that and certainly going to have a conversation about what that right threshold is. But -- great to see our FFO to debt with strong improvement of 100-plus basis points relative to pre IRA. So -- but we look at both of those in combination because it really is important to have -- maintain that strong credit quality, not only at the holding company, but also to work with our commissions ensure we have strong credit quality at all the operating companies too, because it really is in the best interest of the customer. It is consistent with the consolidated capital structure. Yes, I'll caveat that with all depending on the timing of that capital. if it's more backdated, you maybe have more flexibility. So that's just sitting here today, but it really depends on the timing and we really evaluate it once we get more visibility on magnitude and timing of that capital. Yes. We said the IRA was good for us and good for our customers. So we're glad to be able to speak about it in more depth on this earnings call. We only had about 12 hours last Q2 earnings call to talk about it in [digested tax], so happy to spend more time on it now. Absolutely. So Sherco -- I'll start with Sherco Solar. That includes from our initial -- very initial filing to the revised filing with higher capital costs to address the supply chain pressure. So that is -- includes all those pressures and then pre-IRA to post IRA. So that's that kind of actual capital costs, including pressures on the overall call it, panel pricing with everything -- The revised filing, so the revised filing, pre-IRA, post IRA. And then on the generics, assume capital cost is the same, assume today's capital cost or an inflated capital costs, right? So assume CapEx is the same. And a solar farm that would have qualified for a 10% ITC versus now you get a PTC for us, which is as a regulated utility, would choose the PTC. And then the range is based on NCFs if you qualify for any, call it, adders or bonuses, so just community energy. Right. When that assumes say, a 2027 wind farm that would have qualified for 0 tax cut to 0 PTCs versus now 100% PTCs at the escalated value as you assume over time. So that's really where our customers are going to see when we add those several thousand megawatts or 5-plus thousand megawatts in that back half of the decade. Yes. And Sophie, I'll just add to it. We're working through the development of it, it should be online probably later in 2023. And as we think we -- this is a really interesting aspect of potentially how we could use our nuclear plants and create pink hydrogen. We're working with a consortium in our states around the hydrogen hub announcement and applying for a DOE grant. And so this is part of a broader opportunity as we think we work with our states, both in Minnesota and the Upper Midwest and also in Colorado and the surrounding states on another hydrogen hub. And so this is 1 of the unique aspects of this, is high-temperature steam electrolysis. So we're taking waste steam off the nuclear plant to heat the water, which makes it 30% -- the electrolysis process 30% more efficient. Yes. Julien, let me hit on the first one. Yes, really two processes. One is the Minnesota RFP is already in flight. We launched it in -- later in Q3. And so that was a little bit of ahead of Colorado, so likely see a decision out of Minnesota in middle of '23 on the Minnesota, but that's a smaller RFP than Colorado. Colorado is the bigger RFP in terms of megawatts of renewables. And we'll look to launch that here later this year and then likely file the application with the Colorado Commission in, call it, mid to late Q3 is probably when you get some visibility into that and the decision, hopefully, by the end of next year on the Colorado Commission. So a little bit phased between Minnesota and Colorado.  On your question about the 50% assumption, we take a conservative assumption. And I think given the opportunity and the benefit that the IR has around the solar PTC and transferability, we expect to be extremely cost competitive and potentially have an opportunity to own more than 50%, and that's certainly our goal because we think it is long-term beneficial for our customers of ownership right? I mean the PPAs that were struck a few years ago aren't passing this benefit of transferability back to our customers as we are with our own wind farms. And we think about repowering our own wind farms longer term, it's more opportunity and benefit for our customers. So we think long-term ownership of these renewable assets is really good for our customers, and we're going to strive to tell as much as we possibly can. Yes. When you say repowerings, so I think about our own repowerings in the kind of the latter part of this decade, and that would not be in this RFP. That's a couple of years out type of opportunity to bring forth with our commissions in terms of we can do something that can save our customers' money. So I would say that's outside of the RFP process. Yes. Thank you all for participating in our earnings call this morning. We look forward to seeing everyone in a few weeks, and please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions."

Reporters can contact Media Relations with inquiries and individual investors and others can reach out to Investor Relations. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nPaul Johnson: Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2022 Second Quarter Earnings Call. Joining me today are Bob Frenzel, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer your questions if needed.  This morning, we will review our 2022 results, share recent business and regulatory developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder, some comments made during today's call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our SEC filings. Today, we will discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures. Information on the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release. With that, I'll turn it over to Bob.\nRobert Frenzel: Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everybody. It was certainly an interesting 11th hour twist in legislative news last evening, but we'll get to that in just a minute. Let's start with our financial results. We had another solid quarter, recording earnings of $0.60 per share in 2022 compared with $0.58 per share in '21. Our earnings are on track with expectations, and as a result, we are reaffirming our 2022 earnings guidance of $3.10 to $3.20 per share.  During the quarter, we made good progress on our clean energy plan, achieving constructive regulatory outcomes. In June, the Colorado Commission approved our resource plan settlement, which includes approximately 4,000 megawatts of utility scale renewable additions. The conversion of our Pawnee coal plant to natural gas by the end of 2025, and the early retirement of our Comanche 3 coal unit by the end of 2030, which will be the final coal plant retirement in Colorado.  We now have the approval of both our Minnesota and our Colorado resource plans, which together will add 10,000 megawatts of utility-scale renewables to our system and achieve an 85% carbon reduction by 2030. We anticipate issuing RFPs later this year, submitting our recommended portfolios by mid-2023 and receiving commission decisions in the second half of 2023.  We expect the recommended portfolio -- we expect the recommended portfolio of generation assets will include self-build, build-own transfers and power purchase agreements. Our plans are consistent with our steel for fuel strategy, which provides a valuable hedge for our customers against rising commodity prices. Our owned wind farms are projected to generate nearly $1 billion of fuel-related customer savings in 2022 alone and a total of $2.7 billion since 2017.  We're excited about our transmission expansion opportunity. MISO's long-term planning approach identified projects in Futures 1 with an estimated investment of $30 billion that will be awarded in 4 discrete tranches. Earlier this week, the MISO board approved tranche 1, which includes $10 billion in projects. Based on the most recent information from MISO, we anticipate a $1.2 billion investment opportunity for Xcel Energy within tranche 1.  Turning to electric vehicles. We're making progress on our goal to power 1.5 million EVs by 2030, supporting our states in achieving their electrification goals. We are excited to be the first U.S. energy company to introduce all electric bucket trucks to our fleet, and we expect to file comprehensive transportation plans in Minnesota and Wisconsin in early August. These state proposals include single and multifamily residential offerings, commercial customer programs as well as a school bus pilot.  In addition, we're looking to accelerate EV adoption through the development of high-speed public charging infrastructure, a partnering with our states and other organizations. The proposed programs will also foster customer affordability, providing significant fuel savings for EV drivers and helping to keep bills affordable for all customers through load growth and enabling more efficient utilization of distribution grid infrastructure.  The Minnesota, Wisconsin proposals reflect capital investment of approximately $325 million from 2024 to 2026, which does not include distribution investments needed to upgrade the grid. Xcel Energy's clean energy leadership, including our long-standing track record of carbon reduction is a direct result of the passion that our dedicated employees bring to serve our customers and our communities.  Earlier this month, we received another exemplary rating from the Institute of Nuclear Power Operators for our Prairie Islan Nuclear Power Plant. We've continued to improve performance and cost efficiencies, demonstrating sustainable excellence in operations. I want to congratulate and thank all of our nuclear employees, support teams, contractors and suppliers for their commitment and impact. Nuclear remains a very important source of reliable carbon-free energy. We're proud to be 1 of the top operators in the nation.  Yesterday, it was announced that Senator Schumer and Manson had reached agreement on the inflation Reduction Act of 2022. While we still need to analyze the details to understand all of the nuances of the act, it appears to include nearly all the broader clean energy tax credits, including new and extended tax credits for wind, solar, hydrogen storage and nuclear. While doesn't include direct pay for all taxpayers for all tax credits, it does include tax credit transferability as an option when direct pay is unavailable.  As we previously discussed, our capital investment plan is not dependent on changes in federal policy. However, the energy provisions included in the act would provide substantial customer benefits and help enable our clean energy transition while keeping our customer bills affordable. There's still a lot of twists and turns that can happen in Washington, but we're optimistic that the bill could become long.  This past quarter, we were honored to be among the first companies inducted into the Climate Leadership Hall of Fame, which recognizes different organizations across the country for exemplary leadership in response to climate change. We're also recognized with the Hubert H. Humphrey Public Leadership Award for our groundbreaking sustainability goals in Minnesota. And finally, we received the EEI National Key Accounts Award for outstanding customer engagement, which recognizes companies and their account executives for providing excellent support and offerings to corporate customers.  Our customers are at the heart of everything we do. And it's great to be recognized for our work and helping them achieve their goals. I want to thank these organizations for the recognition, along with our employees, partners and stakeholders who make it possible. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\nBrian Van Abel: Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. We had another solid quarter, recording earnings of $0.60 per share for the second quarter of 2022, compared with $0.58 per share in 2021. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter included the following: higher electric and natural gas margins increased earnings by $0.25 per share, primarily driven by rises and regulatory outcomes to recover our capital investments. In addition, a lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.06 per share. But keep in mind, production tax credits lowered the ETR. However, PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin and are largely earnings neutral.  Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation expense, which reduced earnings by $0.15 per share, reflecting our capital investment program and the recognition of previously deferred costs related to the Texas electric rate case, higher O&M expense, which decreased earnings by $0.02 per share, higher interest expense and other taxes, primarily property taxes decreased earnings by $0.08 per share. And other items combined to reduce earnings by $0.04 per share.  Turning to sales. Weather-adjusted electric sales increased by 3.1% for the first 6 months of 2022, largely due to higher C&I sales driven by strong economic activity in our service territories. In addition, our unemployment rate is 80 basis points below the national average. As a result, we have revised our assumption for 2022 sales growth to 2%.  O&M expenses increased $14 million for the second quarter, primarily driven by the recognition of previously deferred expenses related to the Texas electric rate case, additional investments in technology and customer programs and increased costs for storms and vegetation management. Like other businesses, we are facing inflationary pressures and now expect an annual O&M increase of approximately 2%.  In addition to the Colorado resource plan approval, we also made strong progress on a number of other regulatory proceedings. The Colorado Commission approved our uristorm settlement, including full recovery of all costs with the exception of an $8 million isone primarily related to conservation messaging. In Minnesota, an ALJ recommended full recovery of all euro-related fuel costs. We anticipate a commission decision later this summer.  In Texas, the commission approved our electric rate case settlement, which provides a rate increase of $89 million. Rates were effective back to March 2021, which is why you see some year-to-date true-ups in revenue and various expense lines of the income statement. The agreement also accelerates the depreciation life of the Tolk coal plant to 2034. We have a pending natural gas case in Colorado, seeking a rate increase of approximately $175 million over 3 years, based on an ROE of 10.25% and an equity ratio of 55.7%.  In June, intervener testimony was filed. The staff recommended an ROE of 9%, an equity ratio of 55% in a historic test year. While the UCA recommended a 9% ROE, an equity ratio of 51.5% in the historic test year. In July, we filed rebuttal testimony providing additional support for our file position. Hearings are scheduled for late August. We anticipate a commission decision later this year with final rates implemented in November of this year.  We recently filed our first electric rate case in South Dakota since 2014. We are seeking a $44 million revenue increase based on an ROE of 10.75% and equity ratio of 53% in the historic test year. We expect a decision in final rates implemented in the first quarter of 2023. We also have pending electric and natural gas rate cases in Minnesota. We are in the discovery phase and expect intervener testimony this fall, followed by commission decisions in 2023. Details on these cases and schedules are included in our earnings release.  Shifting to earnings. We've updated our 2022 guidance assumptions to reflect the latest information. Details are included in our earnings release. We are reaffirming our 2022 earnings guidance range of $3.10 to $3.20 per share, which is consistent with our long-term 5% to 7% EPS growth objective. With that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary.  The Colorado Commission approved our resource plan and Storm Urico recovery settlement. We received an ALJ recommendation in Minnesota for full recovery of fuel costs related to interest Storm Yuri. We will be filing our Midwest EV plan shortly. The Texas Commission approved our rate case settlement. We are reaffirming our 2022 earnings guidance, and we remain confident we can continue to deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within the upper half of our 5% to 7% objective range as we lead the clean energy transition and keep bills well for our customers. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. All right. And our first question will come from Nicholas Campanella with Credit Suisse.\nNicholas Campanella: So I guess just -- thanks for the upfront color on the inflation Reduction Act, helpful. Just if there is an alternative minimum tax, can you just remind us how your business is positioned there?\nBrian Van Abel: Hey, Nick. Good morning. This is Brian. Yes, it's a good question. So we think about that book AMT is -- we look at it in a couple of different ways. First is we have credits available where you can offset 75% of that book AMT impact. And then also when we look at the transferability that's included in the legislation, that ultimately, when we put those 2 together, that we see this as cash flow accretive for us. Now I'll caveat that. This came out yesterday and the 700 pages of legislative text. So we're still working through it. But that's our view on the book AMT.\nNicholas Campanella: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then I guess on sales, this is like the second time, I think, this year that your electric sales forecast for the near year has changed to the positive. So just maybe kind of talk about what type of trends you're seeing for this year, how that kind of compares to your long-term forecast? And are you kind of starting to see structurally higher demand going forward? And is that a long-term tailwind for you?\nBrian Van Abel: So that's a good question. And we've seen -- you're right, both in Q1 and Q2, we've increased our sales guidance for the year. And I would say there's probably some more opportunity there as we look into the balance of the year. Now certainly, the dependence on the macro impacts that could occur with what the Fed is doing, but we see strong C&I sales. And it's even better if you look at where Colorado is, the C&I sales in Colorado, that's -- this is an adjustment there when you normalize this large solar farm that we helped with a major customer behind the meter. C&I sales in Colorado are strong, too. So we're seeing that across our service territories with that C&I strength, good economic rebound.  We're seeing it on the residential side, we expected that, call it, reduction. And when we look at our budget, we're actually higher on residential than we expected. So structurally, I think we've seen a strong economy in the first half of the year and is certainly in the energy sector, in the manufacturing sector across the board. So as I think about longer term, obviously, you could have some potential headwinds if there's a recession or what happens and how big of an impact interest rates have. But I think we're bullish longer term when we start to think about the electrification opportunities, when we start to see EV penetration, when you start to see electrification of industrial processes. So I think there's a longer-term tailwind as I look at our service territories.  And just another example down in the Permian Basin. We've seen extremely strong growth. But longer term, we're talking to their customers about electrification. They have their own ESG goals and net zero goals in the Permian, and so we're in discussions of how you electrify pumps and rigs and compressors and ensuring that we have the capacity and the investments in our distribution and transmission system on there to serve them. So I think there are tailwinds longer term, and it's great to see the rebound that we have in the C&I sector.\nOperator: All right. And our next question will come from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.\nJeremy Tonet: Just want to dive into MISO a little bit here now that we have some more developments and touching on your $1.2 billion. Just wondering if you could characterize a bit more in terms of greenfield versus brownfield. And I guess this is just a preliminary estimate, but what's the scope, I guess, of what could possibly fall in incremental into this? Is this some competitive processes that still could make the way in? Just trying to feel our way through what this could mean.\nRobert Frenzel: Yes. Good morning. This is Bob. Look, first of all, let me just comment on transmission broadly. We feel very confident and excited about the transmission build-out opportunities we have. And as you think about where we've been this past quarter between the Colorado power pathway, the transmission needs from the Minnesota Resource Plan, and now the MISO MTEP tranche that's about $3.5 billion of large-scale transmission projects that we've identified and, in some cases, have approved.  So the class is important to us. It's certainly going to enable our ability to add to 10,000 megawatts of renewables that we need from the Minnesota and the Colorado resource plans, and to continue to execute on our 20%, 30%, 80% carbon reduction vision. Particularly with regard to the MISO MTEP process, I think we put our best estimate out in terms of the investment opportunity around $1.5 billion for about 6 different -- portions of 6 different projects. We've got ROFR legislation in Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota and feel pretty confident about what we've put forward in terms of the opportunity in MTEP.\nBrian Van Abel: And Jeremy, I'd just add to that, like Bob said, we feel good about our point estimate and the Wisconsin projects were deemed upgrades, so they're not expected to be competitively bid. So what you see as we put in our earnings presentation, are what we expect to be ours and owned, and that's our good estimate right now.\nPaul Johnson: And the estimate does not include any competitive bid. So if we choose to be competitively bid and we're successful, that would be incremental to the $1.2 billion.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. So this $1.2 billion replaces the 1 to 2 range, but there's still potentially competitive processes that could add to this is a fair way to think about it?\nPaul Johnson: Yes.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. And thanks for all the comments on the climate policy so far and noting that this is hot off the press. But just wondering if there's any particular items in there, if we peel back the onion more, what do you see as the largest potential impact and points of opportunity to your plan near and long term? I mean, could CCS be something that's thought about more now?\nRobert Frenzel: It's great question. Again, as Brian said, you kind of have to absorb about a page a minute since it came out last night to get through all the text. But we've been talking about a lot of these broad strokes since the third quarter call and EEI Financial Conference last fall. Some really interesting things in here is we've seen production increases in solar, the PTC for solar is really interesting relative to an ITC. You might see some regional differentiations on people using PTCs versus ITCs. I think the transferability piece is really interesting as we think about not just for our account, but for everybody who builds renewable assets and the friction costs that are embedded. We're financing some of those things, particularly with tax equity.  This could overall bring the cost of both owned and PPA assets down, again, real benefits for our customers as we continue to make this transition. Stand-alone storage credit is interesting. There's some really challenges with the pairing of solar and storage. We've made them work, but this makes stand-alone storage pretty interesting. And then Obviously, our North Dakota company is -- the governor there has put a very aggressive carbon neutral goal on the table and CCS is really important to North Dakota. So I think as we look across the country and across our portfolio, you're going to find bits and pieces of all of this to be interesting.  And notwithstanding all of that, there's great stuff around energy security, electric vehicles and resiliency all built into this that we really haven't even dug into. But I think it's a terrific piece of legislation for us as a company, and we're excited to dig in and hopefully see this pass the House and the Senate before the end of the fiscal year.\nBrian Van Abel: Yes. And I'll just add to that, Bob. I mean, as we're in the middle of developing our clean heat plans for our gas LDCs in Colorado and Minnesota and have a hydrogen PTC. So you couple that with a long-term PTC for wind or solar, it really gives -- should give green hydrogen a jump start. And so we're excited about that. And so I think there's a number of great things in this bill. And ultimately, we look at it, it's really in the looks and feel similar to what I talked about on Q3 of last year in terms of the impacts to us.  But ultimately, we look as cash flow accretive and slightly, there's some slight rate base reductions from we become more tax efficient, but slightly EPS beneficial. Now again, that's with a caveat, we're digging into it and make sure we understand everything, particularly around transferability but when we look at this whole package, as we talked about, our current plan is not built on this, right? Our current 5-year plan and long-term plan, our research plans were approved with current tax law. This just makes our plans even better for our customers. And that's the important point long run. Great for our customers as we make this clean energy transition even more affordable. So we're excited about this and optimistic that it gets passed.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's super helpful. If I could just circle back to MISO. Real quick, real quick last 1 here. Of the $10.3 billion of capital there, do you -- would you be willing to share any thoughts on how much of that you think could go through a competitive process?\nPaul Johnson: I think the estimates I've seen are about $1 billion.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. I'll leave it there.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning. Thanks for the time and the opportunity to connect here. Really appreciate it. So I'm going to keep going on this on the same front. Let's talk a little bit more on the legislative, how does your prior [indiscernible] debt improvement target under BBB with direct [indiscernible] compare to your first take of the provisions under the IRA factoring in the transferability elements, right? You specifically called that out a moment ago in your prepared remarks.\nBrian Van Abel: Hey Julien. Good morning. And like I said, it was -- and Bob said it is hot off the press and 700 pages of legislative text, so making sure we understand it in our nuances. So there's absolutely caveats as we think about it. But I think the best way to think about it, if you remember what we talked about in Q3 is maybe 75 to 100 basis points or higher improvement in FFO to that CFO to debt as we look at it, which gives us financing flexibility down the road potential capital headroom. But again, there's a lot to unpack around transferability and how that would ultimately work. But ultimately, our initial take is a little bit in line with what we talked about in Q3. So really good for us, but ultimately great for our customers as we think about how we can make this clean energy transition even more affordable for our customers.\nPaul Johnson: It also be noted that Brian didn't go to bed last night. So he's doing all the math on this. So take that with a grain of salt.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes, totally. In his delirium though, nonetheless, you're broadly affirming your expectation that the math is not too different from the -- what you described in the third quarter? Correct?\nPaul Johnson: With the caveat that we're still understanding. understanding.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Totally, completely. With that asteric, but also, what does that do for your equity needs, right? Let's just take that a step further if we can start to unpack that.\nBrian Van Abel: Look, so we talked about it gives us more flexibility. I think how we're going to unpack all this is we're rolling forward our capital plans and we'll release those in Q3 in our October earnings release. We'll know whether or not this passes by then. We should know a lot sooner whether this passes or not, and we can provide you a full update because that will include updated capital plans and how we're going to finance that so. But it certainly does give us more financing flexibility.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent. All right. And then a super quick last 1 here. I know on transmission, we talked a bit already. What about the ROFR challenges at FERC? Again, I know that's more recent here, but -- any thoughts perspective on the FERC angle here? Again, I guess this is states versus FERC and then also time frame?\nRobert Frenzel: Julien, it's Bob. I think these have been challenged in both state and federal court and the ROFRs have held up, and we expect them to.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs.\nInsoo Kim: My first one, just regarding the inflation impact in the O&M and the higher financing costs there. Like as we look I guess, beyond '22 into '23 and you just try to get ahead of it, what are some options you have that you could do now on any levers, I guess, to get ahead and position for '23?\nBrian Van Abel: Certainly, we're continually looking to offset inflationary pressures, and this is no different than any other year. But we've had O&M flat since 2014, and we're very proud of that because it has a direct impact on customer bills. Now like everyone else, we're feeling the inflationary pressures this year and adjusted our O&M up by 5% but as we go through the year and see how the year unfolds, you certainly take actions to see if you can set up next year in terms of how it's looking.  And we have a continuous improvement team that is regularly working with our business areas. We're investing in technology this year, what we have something called the digital operations factory that helps drive technology into the business areas to reduce O&M costs and make us more efficient. So that's just part of our DNA and part of our culture that we've stood up, and you can see in how we've managed on over the long term. So that's really our focus in terms of what we see now. We do expect some inflationary pressures to continue through the balance of the year, and that's a bit why we increased our guidance. But I think you should expect more of the same as, right? We're going to deliver for our customers. We're going to deliver operationally, and we'll deliver financially this year and in the future.\nInsoo Kim: Got it. My second one, and I think I know the answer to this one, but just given what could be on the table here on the legislative front for nuclear, does that change your thoughts on, I guess, over the next 5- to 10-year plan on building more, maybe it's a small module in nuclear or others?\nRobert Frenzel: Hey Insoo, it's Bob. Look, I think the legislation as it starts is really beneficial for the existing nuclear owners and in our case, the customers who would receive any benefits from production tax credits associated with the existing nuclear embedded within the new legislation. I think longer term, we've been pretty stalwart in saying that we, as a country, need to identify new clean energy resources that can be dispatchable and carbon-free to enable the transition to a carbon-light economy or a carbon-neutral economy.  And I think new nuclear has to play a role in that. I don't think it's a this decade role, certainly not for Xcel Energy but we are active at any eye. We are active in the development process. We've been working diligently with new scale as they've been trying to stand up there and get permission to build their first new nuclear reactor. So we're -- we watch very closely. We're engaged in the dialogue. I think it's next decade or beyond issue and opportunity for us as a company.\nInsoo Kim: Got it. That's what I expected.\nOperator: All right. Moving on, we'll take our next question from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Arcaro: I had a quick question on the color pathway and the potential upside opportunity there. Is that something that could crystallize basically after you get the RSPs done and you get a sense of where the projects are coming into place there that we get a sense of whether that could be added to the plan at some point in 2023?\nBrian Van Abel: Yes. David, yes, you're exactly right. Once we kind of see where these projects are located and call it the mix of projects, we'll be able to come out at the same time with what we expect to call the network upgrades voltage support that we need. And also the commission did conditionally approve that, call it, that lag that $250 million lag basically a radial and we fully expect projects to show up there, too. So we'll be able to give color both on the, call it, our renewable opportunity at that point in time, plus the incremental transmission investments we expect to make which will be probably -- if we play this out probably middle of next year once we see that final portfolio.\nDavid Arcaro: Yes. That makes sense. Okay. And on the Minnesota rate case, I was wondering, when does the window kind of open for a potential settlement? And any thoughts on prospects of settlement given the focus areas and what you've proposed here?\nRobert Frenzel: Yes. Thanks, David. It's Bob. Look, the cases are progressing through the regulatory process. I think when I look at the cases, they reflect a lot of the investment categories and alignment with our policy and stakeholders. So we don't expect any contentious issues there. Typically, we don't start talking settlement with counterparties until after their testimony has been received. So on the gas case that's expected at the end of August and in the electric case, that's early October. So probably more ripe for discussions in late Q3 or into Q4.\nDavid Arcaro: Okay. Great. Sounds good. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc.\nSophie Karp: If I may follow up on the MISO tranche 1, how much of the 1.2 is sort of low-hanging foot here where you have right of ways and basically shovel-ready, if you will? And then the same question for your competitive opportunities in that could potentially come behind it.\nRobert Frenzel: Yes. So look, I think we're in early innings in terms of the development of those lines. I think that some of them are concluded into existing substations, but most of the lines themselves are going to be greenfield and require local siting and permitting processes. I think that this is an area of strength and execution for the company as we do this. We did the CapEx 2020 plans up in the upper Midwest, we did the MVP plans. And so we've got a really strong team and a good partnership with the Grid North Partners Group that we think that from an execution perspective, this is something that's right in our wheelhouse.\nBrian Van Abel: And I'll just add, Sophie, is we'll go through the regulatory processes, certificate of need processes with our commissions. And so that will take 1 year, 1.5 years to get through those processes where we'll determine final work on final routing and permitting, everything.\nSophie Karp: Right, right. And so is that -- how much of that is already baked into your long-term capital plan, if anything, can you remind us?\nBrian Van Abel: So we had some -- a little bit in our 5-year plan. But when we look at it, right, these in service states are expected to be called by 2030. So we'll start -- you'll start to see as we roll forward our 5-year plan is that spend will kind of be baked in that new 5-year plan that we roll forward is how you'll see it in October. And we'll include it in our 10-year plan as we bring -- roll forward our 10-year plan to.\nPaul Johnson: We did have some of it captured in the second 5 years of our...\nSophie Karp: Another question I had is on the ROEs, right? So kind of in the 9s and low 9s across the board in your territories. Interest rates keep going up, ROEs are kind of sticky at this level. And I can appreciate the fact that they were sticking on the way down, too, right? But with the rates being higher and arguments being made that the structure would be higher in the next decade. Do you see this trend kind of reverse a little bit and maybe they are a picking up? Or is that pretty much not something that we should look forward to?\nBrian Van Abel: Sophie, that's a good question. I think the way we look at it, we kind of look at some recent data points, and there's a couple of data points in Minnesota. One was an ROE decision late last year for Otter Tail at 9.48%. And then there's a -- and we have a 906 Minnesota electric business right now. And then in the gas side, CenterPoint has a settlement pending in Minnesota with a 939 and Armin's gas, ROE is a 904. So no, I think as we see inflationary pressures, interest rates go up that they were sticky to go down, but I think we do have below the national average authorized ROEs across most of our jurisdictions, and we'd like to work to get those closer to the national average. We do think we are a very good operator. We are a policy aligned with our commissions, policy aligns with our states in terms of helping them achieve their decarbonization goals. And hopefully, it can be reflective in some of the outcomes we see in the future.\nOperator: And next, we'll take a question from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.\nPaul Patterson: So just -- I know like I can completely relate to the 700 pages late-night experience. But you mentioned how affordability could be potentially beneficial from the bill. Do you have any sense as to what the potential rate impact might be from the bill?\nBrian Van Abel: So this is a longer term when we look at it, and this is some of the analysis, we haven't done a very long-term model. We modeled it a while ago when we were looking at the earlier provisions. We saw about a 1% benefit to our customers over the long term on a CAGR basis as we thought about. Now there's a lot of caveats there in terms of what type of renewable deployment we have. But we are looking at inflationary right? Our target is long-term customer bill impacts at inflation, and this helped us drive below that.  So I think that's kind of the magnitude. Now certainly will depend on the nuclear PTC and some of the nuances in terms of hydrogen. But I think longer term, we see a significant benefit to that. And I would just add that we're really well positioned for this type of long-term credit extension because I don't believe there's an IOU that has a better combination of wind and solar in our backyard than we do. And so our commissions approved our plans without any extension of tax credits. Now to have this on top of it just puts us in a really good position to deliver on this community transition for our customers even more affordably.  And no, our view is long term customer bills matter. And for us to make this transition more affordably for our customers is great, and we look forward to working through with our commissions.\nRobert Frenzel: Yes, I'll just add on to what Brian said, and I agree with him completely. I think the opportunity here is really interesting because if we can make the energy transition more cost effective, that becomes an economic driver engine. Businesses are attracted to places that have clean energy and low-cost clean energy and reliable clean energy. When I think about a transition to clean fuels and green hydrogen with the production capability that we have and the wind and the solar resources we've got in and adjacent to our footprint should make the production of clean fuels more cost effective in the middle of the country, in the Midwest and in the Southwest than other parts.  And you've seen that as we've located wind and solar across the country, they've been concentrated in those areas. And we'd expect those continued economic development drivers to drive our business long term.\nBrian Van Abel: Yes. And then just to clarify, going to talk about 1%. That's on a CAGR basis. So as you accumulate that over time, it becomes very significant for our customers. So like I said, optimistic this gets passed, but our plans are not built on it. But if it does, we look forward to driving forward our plans even faster.\nPaul Patterson: Awesome. And then there was a local article about curtailments of wind production in Southern Minnesota. And I know you guys are pretty well positioned and what have you. But you guys are at a very large footprint, and you guys are very familiar with the situation around you. Do you see any -- well, are there any issues potentially that you're seeing? But also more significantly, perhaps, are there any situations that you're seeing with specific wind farms and curtailment occurring with other parties in your jurisdiction. I mean, the story sounds pretty significant in terms of how some counties were being impacted from a tax revenue perspective in the southern part of Minnesota. So I just was wondering if you had any insight on that?\nRobert Frenzel: Yes. Look, I think that we have seen curtailment in Southwestern Minnesota. It was a source of a significant amount of wind build-out over the last decade for us and for the region. And so 1 of the great things about the MTAP program is that it's identifying the need and locating transmission resources to move that 0 cost resource to the load. In the short term, it's led to curtailment and congestion. In the longer term, we think that frees up and is able to get to the load and deliver.  I don't think that it's concentrated in any 1 entity in terms of the owners of the farms, but I think it's out there. And as we think about the impact for our customers, some of that's just is driven by the desire and the need for clean energy curtailments built into a lot of our plans, and we recognize that sometimes that has implications for local communities on property taxes or wind production payments. But I think it's certainly manageable and something we're in conversations with our stakeholders as well.\nOperator: We have no additional questions. I'll turn the call back to CFO, Brian Van Abel for closing remarks.\nBrian Van Abel: Thank you all for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions.\nOperator: And this does conclude today's call. We thank you again for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Robert Frenzel",
            "content": "Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everybody. It was certainly an interesting 11th hour twist in legislative news last evening, but we'll get to that in just a minute. Let's start with our financial results. We had another solid quarter, recording earnings of $0.60 per share in 2022 compared with $0.58 per share in '21. Our earnings are on track with expectations, and as a result, we are reaffirming our 2022 earnings guidance of $3.10 to $3.20 per share.  During the quarter, we made good progress on our clean energy plan, achieving constructive regulatory outcomes. In June, the Colorado Commission approved our resource plan settlement, which includes approximately 4,000 megawatts of utility scale renewable additions. The conversion of our Pawnee coal plant to natural gas by the end of 2025, and the early retirement of our Comanche 3 coal unit by the end of 2030, which will be the final coal plant retirement in Colorado.  We now have the approval of both our Minnesota and our Colorado resource plans, which together will add 10,000 megawatts of utility-scale renewables to our system and achieve an 85% carbon reduction by 2030. We anticipate issuing RFPs later this year, submitting our recommended portfolios by mid-2023 and receiving commission decisions in the second half of 2023.  We expect the recommended portfolio -- we expect the recommended portfolio of generation assets will include self-build, build-own transfers and power purchase agreements. Our plans are consistent with our steel for fuel strategy, which provides a valuable hedge for our customers against rising commodity prices. Our owned wind farms are projected to generate nearly $1 billion of fuel-related customer savings in 2022 alone and a total of $2.7 billion since 2017.  We're excited about our transmission expansion opportunity. MISO's long-term planning approach identified projects in Futures 1 with an estimated investment of $30 billion that will be awarded in 4 discrete tranches. Earlier this week, the MISO board approved tranche 1, which includes $10 billion in projects. Based on the most recent information from MISO, we anticipate a $1.2 billion investment opportunity for Xcel Energy within tranche 1.  Turning to electric vehicles. We're making progress on our goal to power 1.5 million EVs by 2030, supporting our states in achieving their electrification goals. We are excited to be the first U.S. energy company to introduce all electric bucket trucks to our fleet, and we expect to file comprehensive transportation plans in Minnesota and Wisconsin in early August. These state proposals include single and multifamily residential offerings, commercial customer programs as well as a school bus pilot.  In addition, we're looking to accelerate EV adoption through the development of high-speed public charging infrastructure, a partnering with our states and other organizations. The proposed programs will also foster customer affordability, providing significant fuel savings for EV drivers and helping to keep bills affordable for all customers through load growth and enabling more efficient utilization of distribution grid infrastructure.  The Minnesota, Wisconsin proposals reflect capital investment of approximately $325 million from 2024 to 2026, which does not include distribution investments needed to upgrade the grid. Xcel Energy's clean energy leadership, including our long-standing track record of carbon reduction is a direct result of the passion that our dedicated employees bring to serve our customers and our communities.  Earlier this month, we received another exemplary rating from the Institute of Nuclear Power Operators for our Prairie Islan Nuclear Power Plant. We've continued to improve performance and cost efficiencies, demonstrating sustainable excellence in operations. I want to congratulate and thank all of our nuclear employees, support teams, contractors and suppliers for their commitment and impact. Nuclear remains a very important source of reliable carbon-free energy. We're proud to be 1 of the top operators in the nation.  Yesterday, it was announced that Senator Schumer and Manson had reached agreement on the inflation Reduction Act of 2022. While we still need to analyze the details to understand all of the nuances of the act, it appears to include nearly all the broader clean energy tax credits, including new and extended tax credits for wind, solar, hydrogen storage and nuclear. While doesn't include direct pay for all taxpayers for all tax credits, it does include tax credit transferability as an option when direct pay is unavailable.  As we previously discussed, our capital investment plan is not dependent on changes in federal policy. However, the energy provisions included in the act would provide substantial customer benefits and help enable our clean energy transition while keeping our customer bills affordable. There's still a lot of twists and turns that can happen in Washington, but we're optimistic that the bill could become long.  This past quarter, we were honored to be among the first companies inducted into the Climate Leadership Hall of Fame, which recognizes different organizations across the country for exemplary leadership in response to climate change. We're also recognized with the Hubert H. Humphrey Public Leadership Award for our groundbreaking sustainability goals in Minnesota. And finally, we received the EEI National Key Accounts Award for outstanding customer engagement, which recognizes companies and their account executives for providing excellent support and offerings to corporate customers.  Our customers are at the heart of everything we do. And it's great to be recognized for our work and helping them achieve their goals. I want to thank these organizations for the recognition, along with our employees, partners and stakeholders who make it possible. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian. Yes. Good morning. This is Bob. Look, first of all, let me just comment on transmission broadly. We feel very confident and excited about the transmission build-out opportunities we have. And as you think about where we've been this past quarter between the Colorado power pathway, the transmission needs from the Minnesota Resource Plan, and now the MISO MTEP tranche that's about $3.5 billion of large-scale transmission projects that we've identified and, in some cases, have approved.  So the class is important to us. It's certainly going to enable our ability to add to 10,000 megawatts of renewables that we need from the Minnesota and the Colorado resource plans, and to continue to execute on our 20%, 30%, 80% carbon reduction vision. Particularly with regard to the MISO MTEP process, I think we put our best estimate out in terms of the investment opportunity around $1.5 billion for about 6 different -- portions of 6 different projects. We've got ROFR legislation in Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota and feel pretty confident about what we've put forward in terms of the opportunity in MTEP. It's great question. Again, as Brian said, you kind of have to absorb about a page a minute since it came out last night to get through all the text. But we've been talking about a lot of these broad strokes since the third quarter call and EEI Financial Conference last fall. Some really interesting things in here is we've seen production increases in solar, the PTC for solar is really interesting relative to an ITC. You might see some regional differentiations on people using PTCs versus ITCs. I think the transferability piece is really interesting as we think about not just for our account, but for everybody who builds renewable assets and the friction costs that are embedded. We're financing some of those things, particularly with tax equity.  This could overall bring the cost of both owned and PPA assets down, again, real benefits for our customers as we continue to make this transition. Stand-alone storage credit is interesting. There's some really challenges with the pairing of solar and storage. We've made them work, but this makes stand-alone storage pretty interesting. And then Obviously, our North Dakota company is -- the governor there has put a very aggressive carbon neutral goal on the table and CCS is really important to North Dakota. So I think as we look across the country and across our portfolio, you're going to find bits and pieces of all of this to be interesting.  And notwithstanding all of that, there's great stuff around energy security, electric vehicles and resiliency all built into this that we really haven't even dug into. But I think it's a terrific piece of legislation for us as a company, and we're excited to dig in and hopefully see this pass the House and the Senate before the end of the fiscal year. Julien, it's Bob. I think these have been challenged in both state and federal court and the ROFRs have held up, and we expect them to. Hey Insoo, it's Bob. Look, I think the legislation as it starts is really beneficial for the existing nuclear owners and in our case, the customers who would receive any benefits from production tax credits associated with the existing nuclear embedded within the new legislation. I think longer term, we've been pretty stalwart in saying that we, as a country, need to identify new clean energy resources that can be dispatchable and carbon-free to enable the transition to a carbon-light economy or a carbon-neutral economy.  And I think new nuclear has to play a role in that. I don't think it's a this decade role, certainly not for Xcel Energy but we are active at any eye. We are active in the development process. We've been working diligently with new scale as they've been trying to stand up there and get permission to build their first new nuclear reactor. So we're -- we watch very closely. We're engaged in the dialogue. I think it's next decade or beyond issue and opportunity for us as a company. Yes. Thanks, David. It's Bob. Look, the cases are progressing through the regulatory process. I think when I look at the cases, they reflect a lot of the investment categories and alignment with our policy and stakeholders. So we don't expect any contentious issues there. Typically, we don't start talking settlement with counterparties until after their testimony has been received. So on the gas case that's expected at the end of August and in the electric case, that's early October. So probably more ripe for discussions in late Q3 or into Q4. Yes. So look, I think we're in early innings in terms of the development of those lines. I think that some of them are concluded into existing substations, but most of the lines themselves are going to be greenfield and require local siting and permitting processes. I think that this is an area of strength and execution for the company as we do this. We did the CapEx 2020 plans up in the upper Midwest, we did the MVP plans. And so we've got a really strong team and a good partnership with the Grid North Partners Group that we think that from an execution perspective, this is something that's right in our wheelhouse. Yes, I'll just add on to what Brian said, and I agree with him completely. I think the opportunity here is really interesting because if we can make the energy transition more cost effective, that becomes an economic driver engine. Businesses are attracted to places that have clean energy and low-cost clean energy and reliable clean energy. When I think about a transition to clean fuels and green hydrogen with the production capability that we have and the wind and the solar resources we've got in and adjacent to our footprint should make the production of clean fuels more cost effective in the middle of the country, in the Midwest and in the Southwest than other parts.  And you've seen that as we've located wind and solar across the country, they've been concentrated in those areas. And we'd expect those continued economic development drivers to drive our business long term. Yes. Look, I think that we have seen curtailment in Southwestern Minnesota. It was a source of a significant amount of wind build-out over the last decade for us and for the region. And so 1 of the great things about the MTAP program is that it's identifying the need and locating transmission resources to move that 0 cost resource to the load. In the short term, it's led to curtailment and congestion. In the longer term, we think that frees up and is able to get to the load and deliver.  I don't think that it's concentrated in any 1 entity in terms of the owners of the farms, but I think it's out there. And as we think about the impact for our customers, some of that's just is driven by the desire and the need for clean energy curtailments built into a lot of our plans, and we recognize that sometimes that has implications for local communities on property taxes or wind production payments. But I think it's certainly manageable and something we're in conversations with our stakeholders as well."

            "name": "Brian Van Abel",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. We had another solid quarter, recording earnings of $0.60 per share for the second quarter of 2022, compared with $0.58 per share in 2021. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter included the following: higher electric and natural gas margins increased earnings by $0.25 per share, primarily driven by rises and regulatory outcomes to recover our capital investments. In addition, a lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.06 per share. But keep in mind, production tax credits lowered the ETR. However, PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin and are largely earnings neutral.  Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation expense, which reduced earnings by $0.15 per share, reflecting our capital investment program and the recognition of previously deferred costs related to the Texas electric rate case, higher O&M expense, which decreased earnings by $0.02 per share, higher interest expense and other taxes, primarily property taxes decreased earnings by $0.08 per share. And other items combined to reduce earnings by $0.04 per share.  Turning to sales. Weather-adjusted electric sales increased by 3.1% for the first 6 months of 2022, largely due to higher C&I sales driven by strong economic activity in our service territories. In addition, our unemployment rate is 80 basis points below the national average. As a result, we have revised our assumption for 2022 sales growth to 2%.  O&M expenses increased $14 million for the second quarter, primarily driven by the recognition of previously deferred expenses related to the Texas electric rate case, additional investments in technology and customer programs and increased costs for storms and vegetation management. Like other businesses, we are facing inflationary pressures and now expect an annual O&M increase of approximately 2%.  In addition to the Colorado resource plan approval, we also made strong progress on a number of other regulatory proceedings. The Colorado Commission approved our uristorm settlement, including full recovery of all costs with the exception of an $8 million isone primarily related to conservation messaging. In Minnesota, an ALJ recommended full recovery of all euro-related fuel costs. We anticipate a commission decision later this summer.  In Texas, the commission approved our electric rate case settlement, which provides a rate increase of $89 million. Rates were effective back to March 2021, which is why you see some year-to-date true-ups in revenue and various expense lines of the income statement. The agreement also accelerates the depreciation life of the Tolk coal plant to 2034. We have a pending natural gas case in Colorado, seeking a rate increase of approximately $175 million over 3 years, based on an ROE of 10.25% and an equity ratio of 55.7%.  In June, intervener testimony was filed. The staff recommended an ROE of 9%, an equity ratio of 55% in a historic test year. While the UCA recommended a 9% ROE, an equity ratio of 51.5% in the historic test year. In July, we filed rebuttal testimony providing additional support for our file position. Hearings are scheduled for late August. We anticipate a commission decision later this year with final rates implemented in November of this year.  We recently filed our first electric rate case in South Dakota since 2014. We are seeking a $44 million revenue increase based on an ROE of 10.75% and equity ratio of 53% in the historic test year. We expect a decision in final rates implemented in the first quarter of 2023. We also have pending electric and natural gas rate cases in Minnesota. We are in the discovery phase and expect intervener testimony this fall, followed by commission decisions in 2023. Details on these cases and schedules are included in our earnings release.  Shifting to earnings. We've updated our 2022 guidance assumptions to reflect the latest information. Details are included in our earnings release. We are reaffirming our 2022 earnings guidance range of $3.10 to $3.20 per share, which is consistent with our long-term 5% to 7% EPS growth objective. With that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary.  The Colorado Commission approved our resource plan and Storm Urico recovery settlement. We received an ALJ recommendation in Minnesota for full recovery of fuel costs related to interest Storm Yuri. We will be filing our Midwest EV plan shortly. The Texas Commission approved our rate case settlement. We are reaffirming our 2022 earnings guidance, and we remain confident we can continue to deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within the upper half of our 5% to 7% objective range as we lead the clean energy transition and keep bills well for our customers. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions. Hey, Nick. Good morning. This is Brian. Yes, it's a good question. So we think about that book AMT is -- we look at it in a couple of different ways. First is we have credits available where you can offset 75% of that book AMT impact. And then also when we look at the transferability that's included in the legislation, that ultimately, when we put those 2 together, that we see this as cash flow accretive for us. Now I'll caveat that. This came out yesterday and the 700 pages of legislative text. So we're still working through it. But that's our view on the book AMT. So that's a good question. And we've seen -- you're right, both in Q1 and Q2, we've increased our sales guidance for the year. And I would say there's probably some more opportunity there as we look into the balance of the year. Now certainly, the dependence on the macro impacts that could occur with what the Fed is doing, but we see strong C&I sales. And it's even better if you look at where Colorado is, the C&I sales in Colorado, that's -- this is an adjustment there when you normalize this large solar farm that we helped with a major customer behind the meter. C&I sales in Colorado are strong, too. So we're seeing that across our service territories with that C&I strength, good economic rebound.  We're seeing it on the residential side, we expected that, call it, reduction. And when we look at our budget, we're actually higher on residential than we expected. So structurally, I think we've seen a strong economy in the first half of the year and is certainly in the energy sector, in the manufacturing sector across the board. So as I think about longer term, obviously, you could have some potential headwinds if there's a recession or what happens and how big of an impact interest rates have. But I think we're bullish longer term when we start to think about the electrification opportunities, when we start to see EV penetration, when you start to see electrification of industrial processes. So I think there's a longer-term tailwind as I look at our service territories.  And just another example down in the Permian Basin. We've seen extremely strong growth. But longer term, we're talking to their customers about electrification. They have their own ESG goals and net zero goals in the Permian, and so we're in discussions of how you electrify pumps and rigs and compressors and ensuring that we have the capacity and the investments in our distribution and transmission system on there to serve them. So I think there are tailwinds longer term, and it's great to see the rebound that we have in the C&I sector. And Jeremy, I'd just add to that, like Bob said, we feel good about our point estimate and the Wisconsin projects were deemed upgrades, so they're not expected to be competitively bid. So what you see as we put in our earnings presentation, are what we expect to be ours and owned, and that's our good estimate right now. Yes. And I'll just add to that, Bob. I mean, as we're in the middle of developing our clean heat plans for our gas LDCs in Colorado and Minnesota and have a hydrogen PTC. So you couple that with a long-term PTC for wind or solar, it really gives -- should give green hydrogen a jump start. And so we're excited about that. And so I think there's a number of great things in this bill. And ultimately, we look at it, it's really in the looks and feel similar to what I talked about on Q3 of last year in terms of the impacts to us.  But ultimately, we look as cash flow accretive and slightly, there's some slight rate base reductions from we become more tax efficient, but slightly EPS beneficial. Now again, that's with a caveat, we're digging into it and make sure we understand everything, particularly around transferability but when we look at this whole package, as we talked about, our current plan is not built on this, right? Our current 5-year plan and long-term plan, our research plans were approved with current tax law. This just makes our plans even better for our customers. And that's the important point long run. Great for our customers as we make this clean energy transition even more affordable. So we're excited about this and optimistic that it gets passed. Hey Julien. Good morning. And like I said, it was -- and Bob said it is hot off the press and 700 pages of legislative text, so making sure we understand it in our nuances. So there's absolutely caveats as we think about it. But I think the best way to think about it, if you remember what we talked about in Q3 is maybe 75 to 100 basis points or higher improvement in FFO to that CFO to debt as we look at it, which gives us financing flexibility down the road potential capital headroom. But again, there's a lot to unpack around transferability and how that would ultimately work. But ultimately, our initial take is a little bit in line with what we talked about in Q3. So really good for us, but ultimately great for our customers as we think about how we can make this clean energy transition even more affordable for our customers. Look, so we talked about it gives us more flexibility. I think how we're going to unpack all this is we're rolling forward our capital plans and we'll release those in Q3 in our October earnings release. We'll know whether or not this passes by then. We should know a lot sooner whether this passes or not, and we can provide you a full update because that will include updated capital plans and how we're going to finance that so. But it certainly does give us more financing flexibility. Certainly, we're continually looking to offset inflationary pressures, and this is no different than any other year. But we've had O&M flat since 2014, and we're very proud of that because it has a direct impact on customer bills. Now like everyone else, we're feeling the inflationary pressures this year and adjusted our O&M up by 5% but as we go through the year and see how the year unfolds, you certainly take actions to see if you can set up next year in terms of how it's looking.  And we have a continuous improvement team that is regularly working with our business areas. We're investing in technology this year, what we have something called the digital operations factory that helps drive technology into the business areas to reduce O&M costs and make us more efficient. So that's just part of our DNA and part of our culture that we've stood up, and you can see in how we've managed on over the long term. So that's really our focus in terms of what we see now. We do expect some inflationary pressures to continue through the balance of the year, and that's a bit why we increased our guidance. But I think you should expect more of the same as, right? We're going to deliver for our customers. We're going to deliver operationally, and we'll deliver financially this year and in the future. Yes. David, yes, you're exactly right. Once we kind of see where these projects are located and call it the mix of projects, we'll be able to come out at the same time with what we expect to call the network upgrades voltage support that we need. And also the commission did conditionally approve that, call it, that lag that $250 million lag basically a radial and we fully expect projects to show up there, too. So we'll be able to give color both on the, call it, our renewable opportunity at that point in time, plus the incremental transmission investments we expect to make which will be probably -- if we play this out probably middle of next year once we see that final portfolio. And I'll just add, Sophie, is we'll go through the regulatory processes, certificate of need processes with our commissions. And so that will take 1 year, 1.5 years to get through those processes where we'll determine final work on final routing and permitting, everything. So we had some -- a little bit in our 5-year plan. But when we look at it, right, these in service states are expected to be called by 2030. So we'll start -- you'll start to see as we roll forward our 5-year plan is that spend will kind of be baked in that new 5-year plan that we roll forward is how you'll see it in October. And we'll include it in our 10-year plan as we bring -- roll forward our 10-year plan to. Sophie, that's a good question. I think the way we look at it, we kind of look at some recent data points, and there's a couple of data points in Minnesota. One was an ROE decision late last year for Otter Tail at 9.48%. And then there's a -- and we have a 906 Minnesota electric business right now. And then in the gas side, CenterPoint has a settlement pending in Minnesota with a 939 and Armin's gas, ROE is a 904. So no, I think as we see inflationary pressures, interest rates go up that they were sticky to go down, but I think we do have below the national average authorized ROEs across most of our jurisdictions, and we'd like to work to get those closer to the national average. We do think we are a very good operator. We are a policy aligned with our commissions, policy aligns with our states in terms of helping them achieve their decarbonization goals. And hopefully, it can be reflective in some of the outcomes we see in the future. So this is a longer term when we look at it, and this is some of the analysis, we haven't done a very long-term model. We modeled it a while ago when we were looking at the earlier provisions. We saw about a 1% benefit to our customers over the long term on a CAGR basis as we thought about. Now there's a lot of caveats there in terms of what type of renewable deployment we have. But we are looking at inflationary right? Our target is long-term customer bill impacts at inflation, and this helped us drive below that.  So I think that's kind of the magnitude. Now certainly will depend on the nuclear PTC and some of the nuances in terms of hydrogen. But I think longer term, we see a significant benefit to that. And I would just add that we're really well positioned for this type of long-term credit extension because I don't believe there's an IOU that has a better combination of wind and solar in our backyard than we do. And so our commissions approved our plans without any extension of tax credits. Now to have this on top of it just puts us in a really good position to deliver on this community transition for our customers even more affordably.  And no, our view is long term customer bills matter. And for us to make this transition more affordably for our customers is great, and we look forward to working through with our commissions. Yes. And then just to clarify, going to talk about 1%. That's on a CAGR basis. So as you accumulate that over time, it becomes very significant for our customers. So like I said, optimistic this gets passed, but our plans are not built on it. But if it does, we look forward to driving forward our plans even faster. Thank you all for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Xcel Energy First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. Questions will only be taken from institutional investors. Reporters can contact Media Relations with inquiries, and individual investors and others can reach out to Investor Relations. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations.\nPaul Johnson: Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2022 First Quarter Earnings Call. Joining me today are Bob Frenzel, Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer your questions if needed. This morning, we'll review our 2022 results, share recent business and regulatory developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder some of the comments during today's call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our SEC filings. In addition today, we will discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures. Information on the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob.\nRobert Frenzel: Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everybody. At Xcel, we had another strong quarter, recording earnings of $0.70 per share for 2022 compared with $0.67 per share in 2021. And as a result, we're reaffirming our 2022 earnings guidance of $3.10 to $3.20 per share. During the quarter, we made strong progress on our clean energy plan, achieving significant and constructive regulatory outcomes. In February, the Minnesota Commission approved our resource plan, which achieved an 85% carbon reduction in a full coal exit by 2030. Other key components include an early retirement of the King coal plant in 2028 in the Sherco Unit 3 in 2030. 10 year extension of our Monticello nuclear facility, in the addition of approximately 6,000 megawatts of new wind and solar resources. The ownership of 2 new generation time lines associated with the retiring coal plants as well as the associated 2,600 megawatts of renewable resources on those lines. And finally, the commission recognized the need for approximately 800 megawatts of firm dispatchable resources, which will go through a separate certificate of need process. As you can tell that based on the latest MISO capacity auction results, it's critical that we add these firm dispatchable resources to ensure the reliability and affordability of the transition for our customers. Shifting to Colorado earlier this week, we reached a revised settlement on our electric resource plan. As a result, additional parties joined that settlement. The revised agreement further accelerates the retirement of our Comanche 3 coal unit to no later than January 1, 2031, which we believe addresses the concerns expressed by the commission during previous deliberations, settlement includes approximately 4,000 megawatts of renewable additions and the conversion of our Pawnee coal plant to natural gas no later than January 1, 2026. This resource plan is expected to reduce carbon by at least 85% by 2030. We believe the revised settlement will enable the commission to rule on the resource plan in June. Together, our Minnesota and Colorado Resource Plan will add nearly 10,000 megawatts of renewables to our system and achieve an 85% carbon reduction by 2030. This is consistent with our steel-for-fuel strategy which provides a significant hedge against rising commodity prices and is projected to generate over $1 billion of fuel-related customer savings in 2022 alone. In terms of next steps, we anticipate issuing RFPs in the second half of this year with insight into the preferred portfolio early next year and commission decisions in the first half of 2023. We expect the recommended portfolio of generation assets will include self-build, build-own transfers as well as some power purchase agreements. This time line represents a modest delay in our original plans, but provides additional time for more clarity given the solar supply chain considerations. Last quarter, the Colorado Commission approved our $1.7 billion Pathway transmission project to enable access to 5,500 megawatts of new renewables in some of the richest wind and solar resources in the region. The commission also conditionally approved the 90-mile May Valley to Longhorn line extension with an additional investment opportunity of approximately $250 million. These constructive regulatory outcomes reflect our alignment with our commissions on our clean energy transition, which is critical as we work to deliver reliable, affordable and sustainable energy to the states, the communities and the customers that we serve. We also remain excited about the transmission expansion opportunities in our Midwest region. MISO's Future 1 scenario, which reflects an estimated $30 billion of investment opportunities expected to be awarded in four discrete tranches. Tranche 1 includes roughly $10 billion of projects and MISO decision on that tranche is anticipated this July. Our preliminary estimates suggest a $1 billion to $2 billion investment opportunity for Xcel Energy within Tranche 1, and we expect to have more clarity this summer after MISO provides more detail on the recommended portfolio. Longer-term, we expect to be awarded approximately $5 billion to $6 billion in total Future 1 investments. And as we've previously discussed, our capital investment plan is not dependent on changes in federal policy. However, the energy provisions that were included in the Build Back Better legislation would provide substantial customer benefits and help enable our clean energy transition while keeping our customer bills affordable. While that legislation has stalled, there is ongoing discussion of a more modest version potentially moving forward this year. We would expect it to include new and extended tax credits for wind, solar, hydrogen, storage, nuclear and even transmission along with a direct pay option for those tax credits. We continue to work with our federal delegation as well as the EEI to advocate for these provisions, which we believe would benefit our customers and accelerate a clean energy transition nationally. Shifting to electric vehicles. We are executing well on our approved Colorado and New Mexico plans, and we recently received approval of our transportation plan in Minnesota, which outline future program focus areas and allows for implementation of new, fast chargers in our service territory in Minnesota. We're also supporting comprehensive transportation legislation in Minnesota that includes the potential for customer rebates similar to what we're implementing in Colorado. We're planning a more substantial update around these programs this summer to coincide with potential federal funding from the IIJA, and these are important steps in helping drive electric vehicle adoption as we support the goals of our states. Given strong alignment with our states on EV goals and our progress to date, we continue to anticipate significant long-term investment opportunities and load growth from electric vehicles. We've made significant progress this quarter, and I'm proud of the way our teams delivered those results. Our regulatory settlements and outcomes reflect our diligent efforts to listen, engage and collaborate with our many stakeholders, not just through regulatory processes, but also through our sustainability priorities and our core values. We have a history of strong storm restoration, and earlier this month had another opportunity to showcase our operational excellence when we experienced two feet of snow in North Dakota. Our teams were prepared and restore power to customers quickly despite battling frigid conditions. Our system resilience and storm preparatives are great examples of our continued discipline and proactive planning, strong execution and our employees' commitment to customer service. We strive to deliver our company values every day. And as a result, we were again named as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere. And the World's Most Admired Companies by Fortune. We're also recognized by Military Times and GI Jobs for our continued commitment to veteran hiring. And finally, I want to pause and remember that today, April 28 is Workers' Memorial Day, which for more than 50 years has been a day of remembrance for workers who've been injured or killed in the line of work. I want to acknowledge that all the women and men of Xcel Energy, our contractor partners and all utility workers across the country sacrifice to provide the critical energy needs of our customers and our communities. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\nBrian Van Abel: Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. We had another solid quarter, recording earnings of $0.70 per share for the first quarter of 2022 and compared with $0.67 per share in 2021. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter included the following: higher electric and natural gas margins increased earnings by $0.12 per share, primarily driven by riders and regulatory outcomes to recover our capital investments. In addition, a lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.05 per share. But keep in mind, production tax credits lowered the ETR. However, PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin and are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation expense, which reduced earnings by $0.06 per share, reflecting our capital investment program; higher O&M expense, which decreased earnings by $0.02 per share; higher interest expense and other taxes, primarily property taxes decreased earnings by $0.02 per share; and other items combined to reduce earnings by $0.04 per share. Turning to sales. Weather-adjusted electric sales increased by 3.9% for the first quarter of 2022, largely due to higher C&I sales driven by improved economic activity as COVID impacts lessen. Our unemployment rate is 60 basis points below the national average, and our economies are growing faster than the average of the country. As a result, we've increased our 2022 electric sales growth assumption of 1% to 2%. Our O&M expenses increased $18 million for the first quarter, primarily driven by higher insurance costs and additional investments in technology and our customer programs. We now project an annual O&M increase of approximately 1%. While Bob touched on the resource plan and transmission regulatory approvals this past quarter, we also made strong progress on various rate cases. In March, the Colorado Commission approved our electric rate case settlement, which will provide a net rate increase of $177 million based on an ROE of 9.3% and an equity ratio of 55.7%. New rates were effective in April. In February, New Mexico Commission approved our electric rate case settlement, which will provide a net rate increase of $62 million and includes an ROE of 9.35% and an equity ratio of 54.7% for determining the revenue requirements for our wind projects. Rates were effective at the end of February. Now every settlement is based on compromises, and we feel these are constructive outcomes for all parties. We also have pending rate cases in all the jurisdictions. In Texas, we have a Blackbox settlement in our electric rate case, which provides a rate increase of approximately $89 million. The agreement also accelerates the depreciation life of the Tolk coal plant to 2034. The commission decision is anticipated later this year. We also have pending electric and natural gas rate cases in Minnesota and are early in the process. We're in the discovery phase and expecting intervenor testimony this fall, followed by commission decisions in 2023. In addition, we'll look for opportunities to resettlements on both these cases after intervenor testimony has been filed. Earlier this year, we filed a natural gas case in Colorado, the request is driven by significant capital investment to support continued customer growth, safety, reliability and resiliency. We anticipate a commission decision later this year and final rates to be implemented in November 2022. Details on these cases and schedules are included in our earnings release. Shifting to earnings. We've updated our 2022 guidance assumptions to reflect our latest information. Details are included in our earnings release. Please note, our depreciation expense assumption has increased to reflect regulatory recovery in Colorado and New Mexico. In addition, the decreasing capital riders in the lower ETR reflect an IRS increase in the value of the PTC. These assumption changes are largely earnings neutral. Finally, the combination of increased sales growth, favorable weather and lower O&M costs are expected to mitigate the headwind associated with replacement power costs related to Comanche 3 and increased interest expense due to rising rates. As a result, we are reaffirming our 2022 earnings guidance range of $3.10 to $3.20 per share, which is consistent with our long-term 5% to 7% EPS growth objective. With that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. The Minnesota Commission approved our research plan. The Colorado Commission approved our electric rate case settlement and Pathway transmission project. We reached a revised settlement on the Colorado Resource Plan, which has the support of additional parties and accelerated retirement of Comanche 3 to no later than January 1, 2031. We are reaffirming our 2022 earnings guidance. And we remain confident, we can continue to deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within the upper half of our 5% to 7% objective range as we lead the clean energy transition and keep bills low for our customers. This concludes our prepared remarks. And operator, we will now take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We will now take our first question from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.\nRobert Frenzel: Hey, Jeremy. How are you? Busy day for you.\nJeremy Tonet: That's right. Thanks. I just want to start off on the solar supply chain. You noted in the release some timing changes there. And just wondering if you could speak to your conversations with developers in the supply chain. And any thoughts you could share or any consensus or hearing out there with regards to resolution of the DOC's anti-circumvention investigation? Or just any thoughts on that topic in general at this point?\nBrian Van Abel: Hey, Jeremy, good morning. We are certainly seeing the disruptions and given you saw the impacts in our earnings release and all the impacts it's had on the panel supply. No, we're in regular contact with developers, whether it's on BOT projects or PPAs that are going to work. So even as we think about we're going into potential RFPs in Minnesota and Colorado later this year. Yes, I don't think there's necessarily a consensus. I think there's a good argument for it, not to be affirmed in terms of a tariff, but we'll wait and see where the Department of Commerce rules on it. Certainly, right, it'll be the preliminary finding at the end of August will be the first real data point and then we'll see how things go from there. For us, I think we're in a good spot. Solar CapEx is less than 3% of our overall five year CapEx plan. And we have flexibility to delay our projects, the Sherco Solar Project in the Western Mustang. So we really just pushed them later into our five year plan. I just want to note that we are very committed to those projects, both the Sherco Solar and Western Mustang. Well, Sherco Solar is going to be the largest solar farm in Minnesota. We're pretty excited about it. We can reuse a coal transmission interconnection. It reinvest tax base into that community and also able to create good local paying union construction jobs. So we are very committed to that and look forward to working with our intervenors and our stakeholders and the commission as we bring forward a new plan on that. But really, we just asked for some time, as you said, to work through kind of what the real supply chain impacts are here. I think broader -- or on a broader note, I think this really points to the importance of getting a domestic clean energy supply chain. And hopefully, with this event and some of the other global events that are happening as we can get some legislation passed in Washington, as Bob noted, there's a lot of incentives for clean energy manufacturing, and we're very supportive of that and then also very supportive on the tax credit side for production of wind, solar, hydrogen. I think that will be absolutely great for our customers long-term. So we certainly weighing in where we can on this issue.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful there. And then maybe just pivoting towards Colorado in the IRP revised settlement filed in April. With the implications for the 2031 Comanche Unit 3 retirement there, just wondering how you think about, I guess, potential generation replacement options going forward at this point? Or just any other details on that you could provide?\nRobert Frenzel: Yes. Jeremy, it's Bob. We said that we've got about 4,000 megawatts of new renewables as part of this resource plan. As it pertains specifically to Comanche 3 replacement, we're going to need a separate regulatory proceeding to address the capacity replacement and the energy replacement of that unit, and we expect that to be maybe two to three years from now.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. And then maybe just a quick last one on MISO, the $1 billion to $2 billion of CapEx for Tranche 1 that you identified today. Just wondering how that, I guess, squares versus your expectations? Have they been kind of changing over time based on what you're seeing unfolding here? And just any other thoughts, I guess, for two and three sizing up what those investment opportunities might look like for Xcel?\nRobert Frenzel: Yes. Look, we see great opportunity and great need for transmission expansion in the upper Midwest and is one of the largest transmission owners in the country. Our expectations for Future 1 and Tranche 1 really haven't changed. That's still a bit of our same range one to two in Tranche 1, and five to six over Future 1. And then if you think about longer-term in the country nationally, when you look at MISO's Future 3, that looks a little bit more like what would match something that has the decarbonization plans of the United States embedded into it. So we see great opportunity here. Only thing that's changed in our view was a little bit of a delay in the timing of the MISO publishing the results and then getting Board approval for the plans. But our investment opportunity looks very similar.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it, that is all very helpful. I will leave it there. Thanks.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Good morning, team. Thanks for the time.\nRobert Frenzel: Hey, good morning, Julien.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: So perhaps just the nuance here on Comanche 3, just if you can speak to it, just the extent to which the plant is out in kind of near-term purchase power impact. I imagine that that's fairly transparent. I just want to check in on that. And then also, related on C3, just any efforts to improve the reliability of the unit through the 2031 time frame?\nRobert Frenzel: Sure. Happy to chat about it. Look, Unit 3 went down in January. In our fourth quarter call, we indicated that it was likely going to be a two months repair. After inspection and discovery, it looks more like a four month repair and our cost looks more like $25 million as opposed to the $9 million or $10 million we talked about in the first quarter. I feel comfortable with that in that the collector rings on the generator, which is what we needed to repair, were sourced, have been procured and have been delivered to the United States, and we're starting reassembly as early as this week. So our June time frame, I feel pretty comfortable about. We did have higher purchase power costs to replace that unit, and that's reflective of the $25 million estimate that we put out there. And look, longer term, the reliability of that unit, I think early in its life, it had some asset challenges, and they're largely behind us. And I think we've spent a lot of time on operational excellence at -- in our generation fleet broadly and in Colorado, in particular. And I think we should have sustained reliability in that unit for the balance of the decade.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent. And then just if I can pivot here in terms of the buy-ins as you previously talked about, obviously, some of your peers have as well. I mean, how is that going, the process negotiations been, wind cost increases, is that an issue here for the relative economics? Or is pressure on that vertical, keeping the economics close to intact here, just to kind of revisit the wind subject, especially in light of everything.\nBrian Van Abel: Julien, just to clarify, when you say buy-ins, you mean PPA buyout opportunities.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Absolutely. Sorry. Indeed.\nBrian Van Abel: Yes, different nomenclature of different companies. The way we've talked about it recently, like we still see a good opportunity. But I think for us, the next opportunity comes through the RFPs that we're issuing after we resolve the -- Minnesota resolved the ERP, and we're waiting on the Colorado commission to approve our revised ERP settlement. So I think that's the process for us in the near-term in terms of seeing some potential PPA buyout opportunities as it will get bid into an RFP and we have a nice process set up so we don't have to work outside of that. I think -- so as I think about it longer term with where gas prices are today and call the upward step change in long-term gas forecast as I think it provides us more opportunity on wind. Even if you see higher capital cost for wind pushed up by inflation or on the solar side, right? That comparison against gas being kind of the marginal fuel, the offset fuel is -- will make the renewable strategy and buyout opportunities more valuable for our customers and we have to demonstrate customer benefit. And then the other data point to watch and we've spoken about it before is an extension of the long-term extension of PTCs just provides a longer run rate for us to look at buying something else, repowering them because we've been very successful at our recent buyouts that have been buyout and repower. So that's a little bit of commentary before. But I think when you think about inflationary costs on renewables relative to how we look at it for customer benefit and what the fuels you offset is I think they'll still hunt.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. Certainly, I'm just curious on the timing. It sounds like that's not necessarily as relatively pressing as something to the RFPs. That's what you've...\nBrian Van Abel: Yes. No, I think it's more about the commission when there's a process upcoming like an RFP. The commission -- it makes sense for us to follow that RFP and have that process already laid out versus doing a separate one-off regulatory approval.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it, okay. Excellent. I will leave at there. Thank you guys.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Durgesh Chopra from Evercore. Please go ahead.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey, good morning team. Thank you for taking my questions. Brian, just one quick one for me. The -- looking at the 2020 earnings guidance reaffirmation and changes, the depreciation expense increase, that is the -- is that -- I know it says regulatory recovery here. Is that a depreciation expense change that to whatever studies that you were able to get? Or what does that actually represent?\nBrian Van Abel: It's really the implementation of new rates with the rate cases in Colorado and New Mexico. And so that will be offset by the revenue with it. So it's really earnings neutral and just the implementation of new rates. That comes out of the rate case.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. Is that cash flow accretive? Are you -- I mean, is it higher rates? Or I'm just -- are these new...\nBrian Van Abel: Yes.\nDurgesh Chopra: Okay. So this would be cash flow positive modestly, I guess?\nBrian Van Abel: Yes.\nDurgesh Chopra: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Travis Miller from Morningstar. Please go ahead.\nTravis Miller: Good morning. Thank you.\nBrian Van Abel: Hey, Travis.\nTravis Miller: There's been a lot of talk obviously about solar and supply chain. I'm wondering you touched on this a little bit, but I wanted some more comments on, could you see a shift toward wins in the near term, especially the RFPs, would you anticipate maybe seeing a little solar pullback, at least again, in the near term, a little more wins? And are there supply chain issues that might prevent that on the wind side?\nBrian Van Abel: Travis, it's a good question. One of the reasons why, at least in Minnesota, we've slowed down the RFP is to see if we can get some visibility into the preliminary finding for the tariff investigation. And so I think that will help. But these are longer term. We're looking to source renewable projects, '25 and beyond. So I think it's a fair question, and you certainly could see some shift from solar to wind maybe in the near term. But ultimately, the way we look at it long term, we are adding a lot. We do need a lot of solar and wind, we need that resource diversity from wind and solar. And so it's not just purely a cost perspective. It's what is called the capacity accreditation for solar. So there's a little bit more nuance going into it, even if you do see some changes in overall capital costs.\nRobert Frenzel: Yes. So Travis, this is Bob. Just to add on to what Brian said. When you think about our renewable mix right now, we're about 11 gigs of wind and two gigs of solar, if you count community and rooftop in that number. As we look forward, the 10,000 megawatts that we're likely to add over the next decade is probably 60-40 wind solar, but that's for us, and it's indicative of our needs and where we -- what our starting point is. You asked a good question about nationally, could you see a shift towards wind in lieu of solar. I think it's going to be company dependent, but you do raise a nice thoughtful point around the wind supply chain looks a little bit more certain right now than the solar supply chain. But again, we expect the DOC outcome sometime in August, and we're hopeful to not have a significant tariff there for the benefit of our customers. And in the meantime, just the fact that we've got still working hard on federal legislation for tax credits recognizing that with inflationary pressures on both, all these will be mitigants for clean energy transition across the country.\nTravis Miller: Great. I appreciate all that detail. And then just one other quick thing. When might we see some of these transmission projects and proposals start flowing through your CapEx plan? Just a year away, two years away, are you months away?\nBrian Van Abel: So Travis, we expect approval in, call it, the summer time frame, MISO July time frame. And then certainly, we would need to go through a certificate of need process with our commissions. But right now, we don't have any of that MISO capital that in, call it, Tranche 1 in our five year plan. So could you start to see it in the '25-'26 time frame? Certainly, potentially. And we'll give you more visibility into that as we get some ourselves with the approval of MISO and then we start the regulatory proceedings at the state level.\nTravis Miller: Okay, great. Thanks.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Nicholas Campanella from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nNicholas Campanella: Hey everyone. Thanks for squeezing me in here and taking my questions.\nBrian Van Abel: It is pleasure, Nick.\nNicholas Campanella: Yes, thank you. I heard your prepared remarks on just the MISO capacity print. Can you just kind of update us on how Xcel is exposed to these higher capacity prices on the supply side here? Just kind of saw some of your MISO peers put out some releases on some seemingly high bill impacts. And I know it's very specific to how your own vertically integrated portfolio is positioned. So just how should we kind of think about the impact of supply costs for Xcel customers?\nBrian Van Abel: Yes, Nick, good question. That's -- clearly, it's hit some headlines here in April as a result of that planning auction. And I would say it was unexpected by parties, right? You had the capacity payment last year, right, was $5 per megawatt per day, and it hit the cost of new entry here. And ultimately, MISO was short when you look at the numbers. I think it really highlights the importance of dispatchable generation in making this transition reliably and methodically. And I think you saw that in our commission decision with our resource plan, is they saw the need for us to add dispatchable generation as we shut down our coal units. And so -- but for us, in this auction specifically, we're long. And so it's a benefit to us. And ultimately, it will be a benefit to our customers. And the way we look at it is it will flow through in our Minnesota rate case and help us mitigate our electric rate case and hopefully facilitate a settlement. So overall, it's -- we're in a good position with the capacity auction. And it's important and just a credit to how we think about this transition and ensure that we have the capacity to serve our customers.\nNicholas Campanella: That's real helpful. And then just one cleanup question on the MISO transmission CapEx upside. Is it still for any kind of capital upside that's not in the plan today, should we still be thinking 50% equity funding there?\nBrian Van Abel: Yes. That's fair. I mean it was the one caveat that we've spoken about before is, no, we get federal legislation pass that does help us from a financing perspective, improves our credit metrics. So -- but if we don't get that, then that's a good way to think about how we finance incremental capital.\nNicholas Campanella: Thank you. See in New York in a little bit. Have a good one.\nBrian Van Abel: Absolutely, looking forward to it.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Ryan Levine from Citi. Please go ahead.\nRyan Levine: Good morning. If the Colorado Resource Plan fell away from solar, how could this impact incremental CapEx connected to the Colorado Pathway, that there is some language in your presentation, I was hoping to clarify.\nBrian Van Abel: So Ryan, I think you're talking about the potential incremental capital that we need for the Colorado Power Pathway that we have -- we have call it upside, but we haven't identified yet around voltage support system stability.\nRyan Levine: Correct.\nBrian Van Abel: I think it really depends. It's a tough one to answer because it depends on exactly where these projects are or end up being located. And so I think it's a little bit too early to say if we shift some more to wind than solar because it is so location dependent, asset-dependent and how we think about it. So we certainly -- a broader point is we absolutely believe we need that capital, and it's just more of where it's going to be located. We've talked about it, a lot of it's -- I think of the 345 that we're building is a freeway and these are the on-ramps and off-ramps, and so we'll need it. But it's a fair question. We just don't -- there needs to be a little bit more visibility into what the actual portfolio could look like and a marginal shift between wind and solar probably doesn't change that number much.\nPaul Johnson: And to be clear, Ryan, we've not made any change in our view of solar versus wind. It's really going to come through the RFP process, which will determine how many megawatts of solar, how many megawatts of wind are ultimately chosen.\nRyan Levine: Okay, and then one just broader question given some of the moving time lines with given supply chain challenges and some of the solar policies from the government. How broadly are you feeling about reliability within your service territory and needs for incremental capacity to help serve your customers?\nRobert Frenzel: It's a great question. I appreciate it, Ryan. This is Bob. If you saw on both of our resource plans, we have continuing need for firm dispatchable resources. In the upper Midwest, we got a separate certificate process to build back firm capacity in the upper Midwest, similarly in the Colorado resource plan proposal. So we recognize the need for reliability. Now you'll see that we moved in the upper Midwest, for example, from a combined cycle to combustion turbines. We do think that with the geographic advantage in the place that we sit in the country, we do have high capacity factors for wind and coincident on peak solar. So we do think that the assets that need to come back are largely combustion turbines. We're prepared and have offered in all of our jurisdictions to be able to co-fire those with green hydrogen when and if that becomes available. And so we're looking at the very low capacity factors, but a real need for system reliability. As I think about CTs broadly, it's a bit of an insurance policy. We need them for the very rare times when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow and the batteries aren't available, but it's a great insurance policy to have.\nBrian Van Abel: And Ryan, just to add on to that, I absolutely agree with what Bob said in terms of longer term. In the short term, certainly, we expected some solar plus storage projects come online in Colorado, and we're negotiating with the developers there about the impacts we're seeing. So we'll evaluate alternative opportunities to ensure we have reliability in the system.\nRyan Levine: Appreciate the color. Thank you.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from David Peters from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nDavid Peters: Hey, good morning everyone. Just maybe curious to maybe get an update on some of the regulatory items in Minnesota near term. I think you have the Uri gas recovery case where an ALJ report is due soon. I know initially, you were pretty far off with some of the intervenor positions, but wasn't sure if conversations have developed since then to where you can maybe resolve that? And then just related, any commentary on the rate case, if any, I know it's early there.\nBrian Van Abel: Yes, Dave. And on Uri we are awaiting that ALJ decision, we should get it at the end of May about the 25th. And we're still fairly far apart with the office of Attorney General and Department of Commerce. I mean, if you read our testimony and our comments, we strongly disagree with their assertions. And we believe we acted prudently in accordingly to the commission approved hedging procedures, really for the best interest of our customers. So we'll await that ALJ recommendation. And then once you get the ALJ recommendation, it should likely be in August with the commission decision on that. On the rate cases, it is -- it's still early in the proceeding. There's a couple of other rate cases in front of us that they call it or have been serially working through. So we haven't a lot of discovery yet in the electric or gas case. So not a whole lot to update you on. But certainly, as we get through the year, like I said, we talked about, so the MISO capacity auction being helped mitigating the impacts we've seen really good sales growth in Minnesota and our economy is strong here in Minnesota. So it's a good thing to see that, hopefully, as we get later in the year and can start to talk about settlement opportunities with intervenors and we can reach a pretty constructive outcome for all of our parties.\nDavid Peters: Great, thank you.\nOperator: I would now like to turn the call back to Brian Van Abel, CFO, for any additional or closing remarks.\nBrian Van Abel: Thank you all for participating in earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions.\nOperator: Thank you. That will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, ladies and gentlemen. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Robert Frenzel",
            "content": "Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everybody. At Xcel, we had another strong quarter, recording earnings of $0.70 per share for 2022 compared with $0.67 per share in 2021. And as a result, we're reaffirming our 2022 earnings guidance of $3.10 to $3.20 per share. During the quarter, we made strong progress on our clean energy plan, achieving significant and constructive regulatory outcomes. In February, the Minnesota Commission approved our resource plan, which achieved an 85% carbon reduction in a full coal exit by 2030. Other key components include an early retirement of the King coal plant in 2028 in the Sherco Unit 3 in 2030. 10 year extension of our Monticello nuclear facility, in the addition of approximately 6,000 megawatts of new wind and solar resources. The ownership of 2 new generation time lines associated with the retiring coal plants as well as the associated 2,600 megawatts of renewable resources on those lines. And finally, the commission recognized the need for approximately 800 megawatts of firm dispatchable resources, which will go through a separate certificate of need process. As you can tell that based on the latest MISO capacity auction results, it's critical that we add these firm dispatchable resources to ensure the reliability and affordability of the transition for our customers. Shifting to Colorado earlier this week, we reached a revised settlement on our electric resource plan. As a result, additional parties joined that settlement. The revised agreement further accelerates the retirement of our Comanche 3 coal unit to no later than January 1, 2031, which we believe addresses the concerns expressed by the commission during previous deliberations, settlement includes approximately 4,000 megawatts of renewable additions and the conversion of our Pawnee coal plant to natural gas no later than January 1, 2026. This resource plan is expected to reduce carbon by at least 85% by 2030. We believe the revised settlement will enable the commission to rule on the resource plan in June. Together, our Minnesota and Colorado Resource Plan will add nearly 10,000 megawatts of renewables to our system and achieve an 85% carbon reduction by 2030. This is consistent with our steel-for-fuel strategy which provides a significant hedge against rising commodity prices and is projected to generate over $1 billion of fuel-related customer savings in 2022 alone. In terms of next steps, we anticipate issuing RFPs in the second half of this year with insight into the preferred portfolio early next year and commission decisions in the first half of 2023. We expect the recommended portfolio of generation assets will include self-build, build-own transfers as well as some power purchase agreements. This time line represents a modest delay in our original plans, but provides additional time for more clarity given the solar supply chain considerations. Last quarter, the Colorado Commission approved our $1.7 billion Pathway transmission project to enable access to 5,500 megawatts of new renewables in some of the richest wind and solar resources in the region. The commission also conditionally approved the 90-mile May Valley to Longhorn line extension with an additional investment opportunity of approximately $250 million. These constructive regulatory outcomes reflect our alignment with our commissions on our clean energy transition, which is critical as we work to deliver reliable, affordable and sustainable energy to the states, the communities and the customers that we serve. We also remain excited about the transmission expansion opportunities in our Midwest region. MISO's Future 1 scenario, which reflects an estimated $30 billion of investment opportunities expected to be awarded in four discrete tranches. Tranche 1 includes roughly $10 billion of projects and MISO decision on that tranche is anticipated this July. Our preliminary estimates suggest a $1 billion to $2 billion investment opportunity for Xcel Energy within Tranche 1, and we expect to have more clarity this summer after MISO provides more detail on the recommended portfolio. Longer-term, we expect to be awarded approximately $5 billion to $6 billion in total Future 1 investments. And as we've previously discussed, our capital investment plan is not dependent on changes in federal policy. However, the energy provisions that were included in the Build Back Better legislation would provide substantial customer benefits and help enable our clean energy transition while keeping our customer bills affordable. While that legislation has stalled, there is ongoing discussion of a more modest version potentially moving forward this year. We would expect it to include new and extended tax credits for wind, solar, hydrogen, storage, nuclear and even transmission along with a direct pay option for those tax credits. We continue to work with our federal delegation as well as the EEI to advocate for these provisions, which we believe would benefit our customers and accelerate a clean energy transition nationally. Shifting to electric vehicles. We are executing well on our approved Colorado and New Mexico plans, and we recently received approval of our transportation plan in Minnesota, which outline future program focus areas and allows for implementation of new, fast chargers in our service territory in Minnesota. We're also supporting comprehensive transportation legislation in Minnesota that includes the potential for customer rebates similar to what we're implementing in Colorado. We're planning a more substantial update around these programs this summer to coincide with potential federal funding from the IIJA, and these are important steps in helping drive electric vehicle adoption as we support the goals of our states. Given strong alignment with our states on EV goals and our progress to date, we continue to anticipate significant long-term investment opportunities and load growth from electric vehicles. We've made significant progress this quarter, and I'm proud of the way our teams delivered those results. Our regulatory settlements and outcomes reflect our diligent efforts to listen, engage and collaborate with our many stakeholders, not just through regulatory processes, but also through our sustainability priorities and our core values. We have a history of strong storm restoration, and earlier this month had another opportunity to showcase our operational excellence when we experienced two feet of snow in North Dakota. Our teams were prepared and restore power to customers quickly despite battling frigid conditions. Our system resilience and storm preparatives are great examples of our continued discipline and proactive planning, strong execution and our employees' commitment to customer service. We strive to deliver our company values every day. And as a result, we were again named as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere. And the World's Most Admired Companies by Fortune. We're also recognized by Military Times and GI Jobs for our continued commitment to veteran hiring. And finally, I want to pause and remember that today, April 28 is Workers' Memorial Day, which for more than 50 years has been a day of remembrance for workers who've been injured or killed in the line of work. I want to acknowledge that all the women and men of Xcel Energy, our contractor partners and all utility workers across the country sacrifice to provide the critical energy needs of our customers and our communities. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian. Hey, Jeremy. How are you? Busy day for you. Yes. Jeremy, it's Bob. We said that we've got about 4,000 megawatts of new renewables as part of this resource plan. As it pertains specifically to Comanche 3 replacement, we're going to need a separate regulatory proceeding to address the capacity replacement and the energy replacement of that unit, and we expect that to be maybe two to three years from now. Yes. Look, we see great opportunity and great need for transmission expansion in the upper Midwest and is one of the largest transmission owners in the country. Our expectations for Future 1 and Tranche 1 really haven't changed. That's still a bit of our same range one to two in Tranche 1, and five to six over Future 1. And then if you think about longer-term in the country nationally, when you look at MISO's Future 3, that looks a little bit more like what would match something that has the decarbonization plans of the United States embedded into it. So we see great opportunity here. Only thing that's changed in our view was a little bit of a delay in the timing of the MISO publishing the results and then getting Board approval for the plans. But our investment opportunity looks very similar. Hey, good morning, Julien. Sure. Happy to chat about it. Look, Unit 3 went down in January. In our fourth quarter call, we indicated that it was likely going to be a two months repair. After inspection and discovery, it looks more like a four month repair and our cost looks more like $25 million as opposed to the $9 million or $10 million we talked about in the first quarter. I feel comfortable with that in that the collector rings on the generator, which is what we needed to repair, were sourced, have been procured and have been delivered to the United States, and we're starting reassembly as early as this week. So our June time frame, I feel pretty comfortable about. We did have higher purchase power costs to replace that unit, and that's reflective of the $25 million estimate that we put out there. And look, longer term, the reliability of that unit, I think early in its life, it had some asset challenges, and they're largely behind us. And I think we've spent a lot of time on operational excellence at -- in our generation fleet broadly and in Colorado, in particular. And I think we should have sustained reliability in that unit for the balance of the decade. Yes. So Travis, this is Bob. Just to add on to what Brian said. When you think about our renewable mix right now, we're about 11 gigs of wind and two gigs of solar, if you count community and rooftop in that number. As we look forward, the 10,000 megawatts that we're likely to add over the next decade is probably 60-40 wind solar, but that's for us, and it's indicative of our needs and where we -- what our starting point is. You asked a good question about nationally, could you see a shift towards wind in lieu of solar. I think it's going to be company dependent, but you do raise a nice thoughtful point around the wind supply chain looks a little bit more certain right now than the solar supply chain. But again, we expect the DOC outcome sometime in August, and we're hopeful to not have a significant tariff there for the benefit of our customers. And in the meantime, just the fact that we've got still working hard on federal legislation for tax credits recognizing that with inflationary pressures on both, all these will be mitigants for clean energy transition across the country. It's a great question. I appreciate it, Ryan. This is Bob. If you saw on both of our resource plans, we have continuing need for firm dispatchable resources. In the upper Midwest, we got a separate certificate process to build back firm capacity in the upper Midwest, similarly in the Colorado resource plan proposal. So we recognize the need for reliability. Now you'll see that we moved in the upper Midwest, for example, from a combined cycle to combustion turbines. We do think that with the geographic advantage in the place that we sit in the country, we do have high capacity factors for wind and coincident on peak solar. So we do think that the assets that need to come back are largely combustion turbines. We're prepared and have offered in all of our jurisdictions to be able to co-fire those with green hydrogen when and if that becomes available. And so we're looking at the very low capacity factors, but a real need for system reliability. As I think about CTs broadly, it's a bit of an insurance policy. We need them for the very rare times when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow and the batteries aren't available, but it's a great insurance policy to have."

            "name": "Brian Van Abel",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. We had another solid quarter, recording earnings of $0.70 per share for the first quarter of 2022 and compared with $0.67 per share in 2021. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter included the following: higher electric and natural gas margins increased earnings by $0.12 per share, primarily driven by riders and regulatory outcomes to recover our capital investments. In addition, a lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.05 per share. But keep in mind, production tax credits lowered the ETR. However, PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin and are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation expense, which reduced earnings by $0.06 per share, reflecting our capital investment program; higher O&M expense, which decreased earnings by $0.02 per share; higher interest expense and other taxes, primarily property taxes decreased earnings by $0.02 per share; and other items combined to reduce earnings by $0.04 per share. Turning to sales. Weather-adjusted electric sales increased by 3.9% for the first quarter of 2022, largely due to higher C&I sales driven by improved economic activity as COVID impacts lessen. Our unemployment rate is 60 basis points below the national average, and our economies are growing faster than the average of the country. As a result, we've increased our 2022 electric sales growth assumption of 1% to 2%. Our O&M expenses increased $18 million for the first quarter, primarily driven by higher insurance costs and additional investments in technology and our customer programs. We now project an annual O&M increase of approximately 1%. While Bob touched on the resource plan and transmission regulatory approvals this past quarter, we also made strong progress on various rate cases. In March, the Colorado Commission approved our electric rate case settlement, which will provide a net rate increase of $177 million based on an ROE of 9.3% and an equity ratio of 55.7%. New rates were effective in April. In February, New Mexico Commission approved our electric rate case settlement, which will provide a net rate increase of $62 million and includes an ROE of 9.35% and an equity ratio of 54.7% for determining the revenue requirements for our wind projects. Rates were effective at the end of February. Now every settlement is based on compromises, and we feel these are constructive outcomes for all parties. We also have pending rate cases in all the jurisdictions. In Texas, we have a Blackbox settlement in our electric rate case, which provides a rate increase of approximately $89 million. The agreement also accelerates the depreciation life of the Tolk coal plant to 2034. The commission decision is anticipated later this year. We also have pending electric and natural gas rate cases in Minnesota and are early in the process. We're in the discovery phase and expecting intervenor testimony this fall, followed by commission decisions in 2023. In addition, we'll look for opportunities to resettlements on both these cases after intervenor testimony has been filed. Earlier this year, we filed a natural gas case in Colorado, the request is driven by significant capital investment to support continued customer growth, safety, reliability and resiliency. We anticipate a commission decision later this year and final rates to be implemented in November 2022. Details on these cases and schedules are included in our earnings release. Shifting to earnings. We've updated our 2022 guidance assumptions to reflect our latest information. Details are included in our earnings release. Please note, our depreciation expense assumption has increased to reflect regulatory recovery in Colorado and New Mexico. In addition, the decreasing capital riders in the lower ETR reflect an IRS increase in the value of the PTC. These assumption changes are largely earnings neutral. Finally, the combination of increased sales growth, favorable weather and lower O&M costs are expected to mitigate the headwind associated with replacement power costs related to Comanche 3 and increased interest expense due to rising rates. As a result, we are reaffirming our 2022 earnings guidance range of $3.10 to $3.20 per share, which is consistent with our long-term 5% to 7% EPS growth objective. With that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. The Minnesota Commission approved our research plan. The Colorado Commission approved our electric rate case settlement and Pathway transmission project. We reached a revised settlement on the Colorado Resource Plan, which has the support of additional parties and accelerated retirement of Comanche 3 to no later than January 1, 2031. We are reaffirming our 2022 earnings guidance. And we remain confident, we can continue to deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within the upper half of our 5% to 7% objective range as we lead the clean energy transition and keep bills low for our customers. This concludes our prepared remarks. And operator, we will now take questions. Hey, Jeremy, good morning. We are certainly seeing the disruptions and given you saw the impacts in our earnings release and all the impacts it's had on the panel supply. No, we're in regular contact with developers, whether it's on BOT projects or PPAs that are going to work. So even as we think about we're going into potential RFPs in Minnesota and Colorado later this year. Yes, I don't think there's necessarily a consensus. I think there's a good argument for it, not to be affirmed in terms of a tariff, but we'll wait and see where the Department of Commerce rules on it. Certainly, right, it'll be the preliminary finding at the end of August will be the first real data point and then we'll see how things go from there. For us, I think we're in a good spot. Solar CapEx is less than 3% of our overall five year CapEx plan. And we have flexibility to delay our projects, the Sherco Solar Project in the Western Mustang. So we really just pushed them later into our five year plan. I just want to note that we are very committed to those projects, both the Sherco Solar and Western Mustang. Well, Sherco Solar is going to be the largest solar farm in Minnesota. We're pretty excited about it. We can reuse a coal transmission interconnection. It reinvest tax base into that community and also able to create good local paying union construction jobs. So we are very committed to that and look forward to working with our intervenors and our stakeholders and the commission as we bring forward a new plan on that. But really, we just asked for some time, as you said, to work through kind of what the real supply chain impacts are here. I think broader -- or on a broader note, I think this really points to the importance of getting a domestic clean energy supply chain. And hopefully, with this event and some of the other global events that are happening as we can get some legislation passed in Washington, as Bob noted, there's a lot of incentives for clean energy manufacturing, and we're very supportive of that and then also very supportive on the tax credit side for production of wind, solar, hydrogen. I think that will be absolutely great for our customers long-term. So we certainly weighing in where we can on this issue. Julien, just to clarify, when you say buy-ins, you mean PPA buyout opportunities. Yes, different nomenclature of different companies. The way we've talked about it recently, like we still see a good opportunity. But I think for us, the next opportunity comes through the RFPs that we're issuing after we resolve the -- Minnesota resolved the ERP, and we're waiting on the Colorado commission to approve our revised ERP settlement. So I think that's the process for us in the near-term in terms of seeing some potential PPA buyout opportunities as it will get bid into an RFP and we have a nice process set up so we don't have to work outside of that. I think -- so as I think about it longer term with where gas prices are today and call the upward step change in long-term gas forecast as I think it provides us more opportunity on wind. Even if you see higher capital cost for wind pushed up by inflation or on the solar side, right? That comparison against gas being kind of the marginal fuel, the offset fuel is -- will make the renewable strategy and buyout opportunities more valuable for our customers and we have to demonstrate customer benefit. And then the other data point to watch and we've spoken about it before is an extension of the long-term extension of PTCs just provides a longer run rate for us to look at buying something else, repowering them because we've been very successful at our recent buyouts that have been buyout and repower. So that's a little bit of commentary before. But I think when you think about inflationary costs on renewables relative to how we look at it for customer benefit and what the fuels you offset is I think they'll still hunt. Yes. No, I think it's more about the commission when there's a process upcoming like an RFP. The commission -- it makes sense for us to follow that RFP and have that process already laid out versus doing a separate one-off regulatory approval. It's really the implementation of new rates with the rate cases in Colorado and New Mexico. And so that will be offset by the revenue with it. So it's really earnings neutral and just the implementation of new rates. That comes out of the rate case. Yes. Yes. Hey, Travis. Travis, it's a good question. One of the reasons why, at least in Minnesota, we've slowed down the RFP is to see if we can get some visibility into the preliminary finding for the tariff investigation. And so I think that will help. But these are longer term. We're looking to source renewable projects, '25 and beyond. So I think it's a fair question, and you certainly could see some shift from solar to wind maybe in the near term. But ultimately, the way we look at it long term, we are adding a lot. We do need a lot of solar and wind, we need that resource diversity from wind and solar. And so it's not just purely a cost perspective. It's what is called the capacity accreditation for solar. So there's a little bit more nuance going into it, even if you do see some changes in overall capital costs. So Travis, we expect approval in, call it, the summer time frame, MISO July time frame. And then certainly, we would need to go through a certificate of need process with our commissions. But right now, we don't have any of that MISO capital that in, call it, Tranche 1 in our five year plan. So could you start to see it in the '25-'26 time frame? Certainly, potentially. And we'll give you more visibility into that as we get some ourselves with the approval of MISO and then we start the regulatory proceedings at the state level. It is pleasure, Nick. Yes, Nick, good question. That's -- clearly, it's hit some headlines here in April as a result of that planning auction. And I would say it was unexpected by parties, right? You had the capacity payment last year, right, was $5 per megawatt per day, and it hit the cost of new entry here. And ultimately, MISO was short when you look at the numbers. I think it really highlights the importance of dispatchable generation in making this transition reliably and methodically. And I think you saw that in our commission decision with our resource plan, is they saw the need for us to add dispatchable generation as we shut down our coal units. And so -- but for us, in this auction specifically, we're long. And so it's a benefit to us. And ultimately, it will be a benefit to our customers. And the way we look at it is it will flow through in our Minnesota rate case and help us mitigate our electric rate case and hopefully facilitate a settlement. So overall, it's -- we're in a good position with the capacity auction. And it's important and just a credit to how we think about this transition and ensure that we have the capacity to serve our customers. Yes. That's fair. I mean it was the one caveat that we've spoken about before is, no, we get federal legislation pass that does help us from a financing perspective, improves our credit metrics. So -- but if we don't get that, then that's a good way to think about how we finance incremental capital. Absolutely, looking forward to it. So Ryan, I think you're talking about the potential incremental capital that we need for the Colorado Power Pathway that we have -- we have call it upside, but we haven't identified yet around voltage support system stability. I think it really depends. It's a tough one to answer because it depends on exactly where these projects are or end up being located. And so I think it's a little bit too early to say if we shift some more to wind than solar because it is so location dependent, asset-dependent and how we think about it. So we certainly -- a broader point is we absolutely believe we need that capital, and it's just more of where it's going to be located. We've talked about it, a lot of it's -- I think of the 345 that we're building is a freeway and these are the on-ramps and off-ramps, and so we'll need it. But it's a fair question. We just don't -- there needs to be a little bit more visibility into what the actual portfolio could look like and a marginal shift between wind and solar probably doesn't change that number much. And Ryan, just to add on to that, I absolutely agree with what Bob said in terms of longer term. In the short term, certainly, we expected some solar plus storage projects come online in Colorado, and we're negotiating with the developers there about the impacts we're seeing. So we'll evaluate alternative opportunities to ensure we have reliability in the system. Yes, Dave. And on Uri we are awaiting that ALJ decision, we should get it at the end of May about the 25th. And we're still fairly far apart with the office of Attorney General and Department of Commerce. I mean, if you read our testimony and our comments, we strongly disagree with their assertions. And we believe we acted prudently in accordingly to the commission approved hedging procedures, really for the best interest of our customers. So we'll await that ALJ recommendation. And then once you get the ALJ recommendation, it should likely be in August with the commission decision on that. On the rate cases, it is -- it's still early in the proceeding. There's a couple of other rate cases in front of us that they call it or have been serially working through. So we haven't a lot of discovery yet in the electric or gas case. So not a whole lot to update you on. But certainly, as we get through the year, like I said, we talked about, so the MISO capacity auction being helped mitigating the impacts we've seen really good sales growth in Minnesota and our economy is strong here in Minnesota. So it's a good thing to see that, hopefully, as we get later in the year and can start to talk about settlement opportunities with intervenors and we can reach a pretty constructive outcome for all of our parties. Thank you all for participating in earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions."

Please note, this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions].  Questions will only be taken from institutional investors. Reporters can contact Media Relations with inquiries, and individual investors and others can reach out to Investor Relations. \n I'll now turn the call over to Paul Johnson, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nPaul Johnson: Good morning, welcome to Xcel Energy's 2023 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. Joining me today are Bob Frenzel, Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer your questions if needed.\n This morning, we will review our '23 results and highlights, share recent business and regulatory updates and provide updates on our long-term growth plans.\n Slides accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder, some of the comments during today's call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ both anticipated are described in our earnings release and our SEC filings.\n Today, we'll discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures. Information on the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release.\n In the fourth quarter, Xcel implemented several workforce actions to streamline the organization, ensure resources are aligned with business and customer needs to ensure our long-term success.\n Xcel initiated a voluntary retirement program under which 400 non-bargaining employees retired. In addition, we eliminated 159 bargaining positions. As a result, we recorded a workforce reduction expense of $72 million or $0.09 per share in the fourth quarter of '23.\n Also in '23, we recorded a charge of $35 million or $0.05 per share related to a legal dispute between CORE and Xcel Energy regarding prior year operations at the Comanche 3 coal plant. Given the nonrecurring nature of these items, both have been excluded from ongoing earnings. As a result, our GAAP earnings were $3.21 per share, while ongoing earnings which exclude these nonrecurring charges were $3.35 per share.\n All further discussions in this earnings call will focus on ongoing earnings. For more information on this, please see the disclosures in our earnings release. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob. \nRobert Frenzel: Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everybody. We had another successful year at Xcel Energy continuing to provide our customers with safe, clean, reliable and affordable energy while delivering an operational and financial performance.\n In 2023, we executed on the largest capital program in Xcel Energy history, investing approximately $6 billion to improve resiliency and enabling clean energy for our customers while delivering economic growth and vitality for our communities. \n Our investments in operations enabled ongoing earnings of $3.35 per share, representing the 19th consecutive year of meeting or exceeding our earnings guidance. Meeting our financial commitments is critical to maintaining a competitive cost of capital, which benefits our customers as we access the capital markets to fund our operations. \n In December, we received approval for our ground breaking clean energy portfolio with over 5,800 megawatts of new generation resources. This $4.8 billion of new generation investment, which when coupled with the necessary transmission represents almost an $8 billion worth of commitments in Colorado to deliver a cleaner energy economy.\n I'm proud of how our teams partnered with so many stakeholders to deliver on these achievements. And as I look back on the year, we accomplished so many other great outcomes. While the final values aren't in yet, our SAIDI scores improved and we believe we'll be in the top quartile of U.S. utilities for delivering reliable electricity to our customers. Across our wind fleet, we continue to deliver strong net capacity performance and exceeded our corporate availability target for the third consecutive year.\n We navigated a very busy regulatory calendar resolving multiple rate cases and reached a pending settlement in our Texas electric rate case. We filed our Clean Heat Plan in Colorado and our natural gas innovation plan in Minnesota, providing a framework in both of those states to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions for our natural gas customers.\n We've approved transportation electrification programs in New Mexico and in Wisconsin, along with updated transportation plans pending commission approval in both Minnesota and Colorado.\n We were partners in over $1.5 billion of awards by the Department of Energy to support the Heartland Hydrogen Hub, wildfire and extreme weather resiliency, Form Energy long-duration energy storage pilots, and additional transmission as part of the MISO SPPC's projects. These grants will lower the cost of these clean energy and resiliency projects for our customers.\n In 2023, we signed agreements for data centers with Meta in Minnesota and QTS in Colorado. Data center and AI-driven demand continued to be a low driver on our system with several gigawatts in the pipeline across our footprint. In Minnesota, we received approvals for an additional 250 megawatts of solar in our 10-megawatt 100-hour Form Energy battery pilot both at our retiring Sherco coal facility.\n We have active RFPs for over 2,000 megawatts of renewable resources across our operating companies, which we expect resolution on later this year. \n We also filed resource plans in our SPS company, which could add an additional 5,000 to 10,000 megawatts to our system by 2030. In December, we retired Unit 2 at our Sherco coal facility while continuing the trend of no personnel layoffs at our retiring coal facilities over the past 15 years. We reduced carbon emissions for the electric utility by 53% as compared to a 2005 baseline, on track with our goals for 2030 and 2050.\n All the while, our customer bills remain amongst the lowest in the country. Over the past 5 years, the average Xcel Energy residential, electric and natural gas bills are 28% and 14% below the national average, respectively. And over the last 10 years, we kept our annual residential electric and natural gas bill increases to 1.8% and 1.1%, respectively, well below the rate of inflation.\n We're actively involved in our communities as our employees, contractors and retirees provided more than $11 million and volunteered over 40,000 hours to support charitable organizations across our footprint. We initiated 18 economic development projects for our communities, which are projected to create more than $2.4 billion in capital investments and 1,400 jobs.\n For the seventh consecutive year, we received the top score from Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Corporate Equality Index, the nation's foremost benchmarking survey in measuring corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ+ workplace equality.\n And finally, we received several other recognitions, including being named a top military employer by multiple organizations and one of the World's Most Admired Companies by Fortune Magazine.\n We're proud of these achievements, which reflect operational excellence and strong policy alignment, allowing Xcel Energy to provide a valuable product with significant benefits to our customers, our communities, our employees and our shareholders.\n With that, I'll turn it over to Brian. \nBrian Van Abel: Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. For the full year 2023, we had ongoing earnings of $3.35 per share compared to $3.17 per share in 2022. The most significant earnings drivers for the year include the following: higher electric and natural gas margins increased earnings by $0.10 per share. This reflects $0.10 of unfavorable weather as compared to last year.\n Lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.06 per share which reflects the impact of cost containment actions. Lower conservation and DSM expense increased earnings by $0.06 per share, which is largely offset in lower margins.\n Higher other income increased earnings by $0.05 per share, primarily due to rabbi trust performance, which is largely offset in O&M expenses.\n Lower other taxes, primarily property taxes, increased earnings by $0.04 per share. And in addition, other items combined to increase earnings by $0.06 per share. Offsetting these positive drivers, higher interest charges, which decreased earnings by $0.14 per share driven by rising interest rates and increased debt levels to fund capital investment; and higher depreciation and amortization expense, which decreased earnings by $0.05 per share, reflecting our capital investment program.\n Turning to sales. Full year weather adjusted electric sales increased by 1%, consistent with our guidance assumptions. For 2024, we expect electric sales to increase by 2% to 3%. Shifting to expenses. O&M expenses decreased $47 million or approximately 2% for the year. This is consistent with our annual guidance and reflects management action to offset inflation and other challenges we faced during the year.\n During the fourth quarter, we also made constructive progress on several rate case proceedings. In December, we filed a settlement in our Texas Electric Rate Case, which reflects a rate increase of $65 million; an acceleration of the Tolk depreciation life to 2028; and the ROE of 9.55% and equity ratio of 54.5% for AFUDC purposes. The commission decision is anticipated in the first quarter of 2024.\n In November, Wisconsin Commission approved an electric rate increase of $1 million and a natural gas increase of $5 million based on an ROE of 9.8% and an equity ratio of 52.5%. The decision reflects adjustments for our residential affordability program, updated fuel and purchase power costs and other items, which are earnings neutral. Rates were effective January 2024.\n In November, we filed a Minnesota Natural Gas Rate Case requesting a $59 million rate increase based on an ROE of 10.2%, an equity ratio of 52.5% in a forward test year. In December, the commission approved our request for interim rates of $51 million, subject to refund starting this January. Final decision is expected later this year.\n As far as future filings, we plan to file a Colorado Natural Gas Case in the next week or so. In addition, we also anticipate filing a revised Wildfire Mitigation Plan in Colorado in the first half of 2024.\n Updating our progress on production tax credit transferability. We executed multiple contracts in 2023 totaling $400 million. We anticipate executing $500 million of PPC sales in 2024. Transferability reduces near-term funding needs, and most importantly, lowers the cost of our renewable energy projects for our customers.\n Moving to our capital forecast. We've updated our 5-year capital plan for the decision in the Colorado Resource Plan, which now reflects an investment of $39 billion. This base capital plan supports investment in renewable generation, transmission to deliver the clean energy and customer-facing investments for a reliable and resilient advanced grid. The baseline results in an annual rate base growth of approximately 9%. Not included in our base plan is approximately $5 billion for renewables and firm capacity associated with RFPs at NSP and SPS and future filings in Colorado.\n We've updated our base financing plan, which reflects the incremental debt and equity financing needs for these investments. Please note that the guidance assumptions in our earnings release have also been updated to reflect changes to the capital forecast for this year. As a reminder, we anticipate any incremental capital investment to be funded by approximately 40% equity.\n It is important to recognize that we've always maintained a balanced financing strategy which includes a mix of debt and equity to fund accretive growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet and credit metrics. Maintaining solid credit metrics and favorable access to capital markets are critical to fund our clean energy transition, maintain a competitive cost of capital and keep customer bills low, especially in a higher interest rate environment.\n Finally, we remain committed to our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%, which we believe is conservative. We now expect to deliver earnings at or above the top end of the range in 2025 -- starting in 2025.\n In addition, we will rebase future annual guidance of actual results. As a result of the significant capital investment opportunities and equity funding needs, we now expect to grow the dividend at the low end of our current 5% to 7% dividend growth range with a target payout ratio of 50% to 60%. This will reduce our equity financing needs over time, lower financing risk and give us even more dry powder and financial flexibility in the future.\n Now I'll conclude with a brief update on the Marshall Wildfire Litigation. The statute of limitations ended in December, and as expected, we saw a significant increase in the number of claims. As of now, we are aware of 298 lawsuits with approximately 4,000 claims. In early February, there will be a hearing at which time a schedule may be determined. We believe the trial will likely begin in 2025.\n With that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. We're executing on an ambitious investment plan for our customers to deliver clean, reliable energy that investment enabled Xcel Energy to deliver 2023 ongoing earnings within our guidance range for the 19th year in a row. For the 20th consecutive year, we increased our dividend to investors. \n We resolved multiple rate cases and filed foundational plans for our natural gas utility to reach its net zero goals. We retired our Sherco Unit 2 coal plant early and reduced carbon emissions by 53% from 2005 levels. We received approval for our groundbreaking portfolio of clean energy resources in Colorado. We updated our base 5-year capital plan to $39 billion, which reflects 9% rate base growth. We have additional capital backlog in all of our jurisdictions.\n We have a strong line of sight to achieving -- to achieve earnings at or above the top end of our 5% to 7% long-term EPS growth rate. And finally, our electric and natural gas customers have some of the lowest bills in the country, while continuing the safe and reliable service they expect from Xcel Energy. \n This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions. \nOperator: Our first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. \nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Congratulations on a variety of different metrics here. But you guys had already been tracking above the midpoint of your 5% to 7% and given the -- the rate base going up say, 1.5% even with kind of incremental dilution, how do you think about that adding up, right? I mean I'm going to put it back to you a little bit, like how do you think about doing the math there, if you will? And just setting expectations. Obviously, every year might be slightly different here. \nRobert Frenzel: I like the phrase doing the math. I think I might have heard that before. Look, we're really excited about our investment profile over the next 5 years, across our 8 states, multiple asset categories, clean generation, transmission, advanced grid, electric vehicles, everything in support of our customers. Obviously, the EPS growth rate follows the rate base growth with some amount of dilution for financing costs at the parent level. The new updated capital plan is accretive. We expect during this 5-year period to be at or above the top end of our 5% to 7% range. But we think 5% to 7% is still a good long-term growth rate for the company, and that's our guidance right now. \nBrian Van Abel: Yes. And Julien, I'd just add that we do expect -- that's a conservative growth rate. And as I noted in my remarks, going forward, we will rebase off of actual earnings. So important things to note in our script. And overall, as Bob said, we're really excited about it. We're excited about our opportunities and our steel for fuel and the clean energy transition. And I think we're one of the fastest transitioning utilities in the country. And our electric bills are 28% below the national average. So I think we're in a great place for our investors and our customers. \nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes. I appreciate being able to rebase of the actuals. That's certainly a sign of strength, as you say.\n Now maybe just to come back to the timing of equity here. How do you think about that vis-a-vis the updated plan and updated needs? And perhaps just to clarify this, just for the time being, at least this year, no change in that 5% to 7% at least for the current plan here? \nBrian Van Abel: Yes. Julien, yes, no change and our guidance assumptions for this year is still $3.50 to $3.60. Now there is an increase in CapEx if you look kind of plan over plan this year. But that was really back-end loaded as we work through some of the regulatory approval processes. From an equity perspective, look, we have -- we've said we've been -- we've talked about doing at least $500 million annually through our ATM and expect that ratable over the 5 years. And then we do have some drip. The amount above the $1.5 billion above that, we'll be opportunistic, and we'll look at it. But I think it kind of follows with how our incremental CapEx follows. \nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent. And then on Minnesota commissioner you've experienced, what's your relationship and maybe a little bit of a brief comment here on where we stand in Minnesota, if you will. \nRobert Frenzel: Yes. No, we've got a long-standing relationship. The new commissioner comes out of the department, and we've been working with him very proactively over years. So we expect a continued strong relationship with the Minnesota Commission. \nOperator: Our next question is from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. \nRichard Sunderland: It's actually Rich Sunderland on for Jeremy. Can you hear me? \nBrian Van Abel: Yes, we can. \nRichard Sunderland: Great. Just picking at the last point on equity. I appreciate opportunistic in terms of timing. Can you speak a little bit more in terms of format of how you might address that I guess, the gap from the ATM to the total needs. Anything on the table at this point or any guardrails to that? \nBrian Van Abel: No, the way we'll -- a pretty plain vanilla way we finance our company. So kind of the base case to be is a block issue. And something you can obviously look at doing a forwards or something. We look at mandatory converts, but our base case is just doing blocks above the level that we feel comfortable with on the ATM. \nRichard Sunderland: Understood. Very helpful. And then looking at a high level in terms of the O&M outlook and then parsing that relative to the workforce reduction announcements. Could you speak a little bit more to the savings there over the near to medium term? How that factors into your overall O&M trajectory and how you're thinking about that O&M outlook, I guess, over the long term as well relative to the work you've accomplished over the past few years. \nBrian Van Abel: Yes. Let me hit the workforce reduction question first, and I'll transition to the longer-term O&M outlook for us.\n I think from a workforce reduction perspective, us like everyone else faced some significant cost challenges and pressures over the past few years. And so we -- as Paul said, we undertook that to streamline the organization and ensure some of our resources are aligned where our customer needs are and our growth opportunities. \n So as Paul said, approximately 400 employees are through that voluntary retirement program and another 150 positions were eliminated so that we look forward that generates approximately 2% O&M savings on a run rate basis.\n But we will look to reinvest some of that, as I said, into the growth areas of the company as we look to support our customer needs. But overall, sets us up into '24 that is included and incorporated into our 2024 guidance. As I think about 2024, our guidances were up 1% to 2% relative to '23, but it's really flat to '22 when you look what happened in 2023. \n Now longer term, you asked about kind of what our longer-term expectations are, we've been managing our O&M with a laser focus on operational efficiency. I think if you look at our IR deck from Q4, we're 1 of 3 utilities that have O&M flat or down since 2015 on the electric operations side. So something we're really proud of.\n And while we look longer term, we have some tailwinds of coal plant shutdowns. We expect we'll be shutting down a coal plant roughly a coal unit roughly a year. We spend a lot of time on technology in looking at how we can leverage technology in our operations in the corporate areas. And then I think most importantly, we haven't talked about this that much as we launched something that we call One Xcel Energy Way which is our continuous improvement engine. We deployed it last year, so we're in the year 2 of it. Really focused on the lean principles and being a transformation engine that is looking at waste reduction and waste elimination. And so that's something we're putting a lot of effort and focus on it and that team reports directly to me, so I'm very involved in it.\n So we think longer term, our goal is to absorb inflation, absorb the, call it, areas we need to invest in from a growth perspective and maintain O&M roughly flat and ensure that we can keep our customer bills low for the long term. So we're pretty excited about it. Obviously, it's not easy but something we spend a lot of time on. So I appreciate the question. \nOperator: Our next question is from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. \nDurgesh Chopra: Bob, congrats, a solid quarter here to you as well Brian and the rest of the team. Just I thought the dividend growth trajectory change was interesting. You're now saying low end of the 5% to 7% because you have high growth rate. Maybe just talk through your thinking there. You were kind of growing faster, so that gives you more flexibility on the financing side. Just a little bit more color there would be helpful. \nBrian Van Abel: Yes. Absolutely. So as we look at it, given our significant growth in our base plan, we just added $5 billion of capital to it and that -- the fact that we're guiding to the top end or above our conservative 5% to 7% EPS growth, we thought it was prudent and the right decision to lower our dividend growth, still within our dividend growth guidance of 5% to 7%.\n But as we think over the long term that helped us reduce the equity we needed for this $5 billion of capital. But even longer term, when you look at the compounding impact of a lower dividend with significantly high capital needs it feels like a prudent decision, gives us longer-term financial flexibility and dry powder and reduces financing risks over the long term.\n So we feel really good about it. We feel really good that we have a very good total shareholder return proposition for investors, and we'll continue -- we expect to deliver here [indiscernible] \nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. And Brian, just as you -- there's obviously a ton of CapEx opportunity, you outlined $5 billion additional CapEx. Do you expect -- is that 5% the floor? Or could you -- could the dividend growth be further lowered in case you have -- you're adding more capital to the plan? \nBrian Van Abel: Durgesh, I think we'll assess it every time if we have a significant chunk of capital, update our plans as we do regularly, we obviously evaluate all parts of our total shareholder return. \nDurgesh Chopra: That's fair. Okay. And then just one last one for me is just thank you for the color on Marshall Fire, the additional complaints and other things. Maybe just what are the key steps for us to watch there? And when could we expect updates? \nRobert Frenzel: It's Bob. Thanks for the support as always. With the fire, I think the next sort of milestone I'd say is we have a sort of a trial planning period of meeting first week of February. Given the change in cases and plaintiffs that schedule got moved back a little bit to give new claimants more time. We'll get a better trial calendar.\n As Brian said, we expect a trial some time in '25. Look, we -- after that, we go into discovery, there's not much to do past that. So we'll update everybody when we know more, but there's not much to say other than the facts remain the same on the case and roll the calendar probably to early next month. \nOperator: Our next question is from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. \nSteven Fleishman: Yes. So I just wanted to clarify, all your growth rate commentary is that based on the base plan? The updated base plan? \nBrian Van Abel: Yes, Steve, the updated $39 billion plan. Yes. \nSteven Fleishman: Okay. And on the -- could you just talk to the PIMs in Colorado and just how you're feeling about being able to manage any -- I guess it could be good or bad, but just any risk exposure from that? \nBrian Van Abel: Yes. Certainly, Steve, and for the folks that haven't been close to that proceeding. We really have 2 PIMs, which the commission asked to propose a couple of PIMs. So we have a cost to construct and think of that just as a capital, what's our budget for the project has been. And we've operated under those types of things for a long time, whether in Minnesota, Texas, New Mexico, we've had those in Colorado. So we propose a PIM. The commission modified it a little bit, so it's a plus or minus 5% deadband and then customers sharing -- savings and sharing was a penalty or incentive above the 5%.\n Overall, we're comfortable with managing within that PIM. We feel like we put forward good budgets for our projects and knew going in that we would be held to what we proposed given that was a competitive process.\n So we feel comfortable about that. On the operational PIM, again, it's -- the commission modified it slightly but generally adopted what we proposed. That's an overall -- think of it as LCOE PIM on a 3-year rolling average with a plus or minus 5% deadband. And the first 5% to 10% above, it's 80% of the costs or savings you have for customers, the company bears 20%. So if you look at it, we view that's very manageable and appreciative that the commission adopted the PIMs that we -- our structure that PIMs are put forward. \n So we look forward to working through the CPCNs with commission and then we have the Just Transition plan coming up, which is additional opportunities as we think about transitioning our generation fleet in Colorado. \nSteven Fleishman: Okay. Great. And then lastly, just some Washington question. The, I guess, time line, if any, on the nuclear PTC. Your thoughts on the proposed hydrogen rules and what that means for your project. And if you want to take up any thoughts on election risk to IRA. \nRobert Frenzel: Steve, it's Bob. The last one seems like a lot of fun to talk about, but I'll probably pass on that fastball. On Washington, in particular, the hydrogen production tax credit, we were very active, we've been very stalwart in our position that we believe that clean fuels and clean molecules are going to be needed as part of a broader, cleaner energy economy. We felt that hydrogen was probably the most attractive molecule that we could produce in a clean and green way. \n We are really proud to be considered for a Hydrogen Hub and in our Upper Midwest proposal, The Heartland Hub. But I got to tell you, the 45V tax credit draft guidance out of the treasury was disappointing. It doesn't feel as if we're trying to support a hydrogen economy in the United States. It's going to make it more expensive for our customers, harder to develop an electrolyzer industry on an industrial basis in the country and will slow or stall clean fuel deployment in the United States. We expect to make comments within the comment period. We expect EEI to make comments. We expect other customers to make comments. So I think the treasury is going to have a lot to balance here, strict additionality and hourly matching if it's going to make it more challenging to produce hydrogen at a cost-competitive basis with other fuels. So that's kind of where we are on hydrogen. And I think you asked about nuclear, our math -- go ahead, Brian. \nBrian Van Abel: Yes, I can just chime in on nuclear. So we expect guidance here in Q2 is our current thinking. Obviously, the guidance we're looking for is how do you calculate the gross receipts, meaning how do you calculate the value. We've got advocated for the use of LMPs, obviously, given that we're in an RTO. \n Certainly, if you look at our earnings guidance, we have not incorporated that into our ETR. But when we look at kind of the forward curve, we would expect north of $100 million benefit for our customers. So something that we're -- that we provided our comments and hopeful that treasury comes out and favor us because it's a great benefit for our customers. \n So looking for that Q2. Just a follow-up on Bob's comments on hydrogen. I mean disappointing, the analysis I've seen is green hydrogen now structurally more expensive than blue hydrogen for the next decade and significantly more expensive than gray hydrogen. And so it will depress the development of the green hydrogen market. And so hopeful to get some changes to the final rules. \nOperator: Our next question is from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. \nAnthony Crowdell: Just hopefully 2 quick ones if I could follow up on Steve and Julien's math class question. When you think of the 5% to 7%, you're at or above the high end, and that's all in the base capital. What would cause you to get to 6% growth? \nBrian Van Abel: Well, I mean, at or above the high end implies that we're above 6% growth right now. But I take it your question, what would cause us to go to 6% to 8%, if I can interpret it. Like we evaluate it we feel 5% to 7% is the right long-term growth rate. It's conservative and rebasing off of actuals and signaling that we're going to be at the top end or above is the right place to be long term. \nAnthony Crowdell: Great. And then I think you mentioned you're filing a Colorado Wildfire mitigation plan later this year, I believe. Just could you give us a look into that? I mean, is that also a potential for additional capital -- CapEx and then -- or any changes in operation you're thinking once you make that filing? \nRobert Frenzel: Yes. Anthony, it's Bob. Good to hear you this morning, and thanks for the questions. We're operating under an existing wildfire mitigation program in Colorado right now. And I'd say that, that plan includes asset hardening and replacement. It's got pilots for various technology solutions and risk modeling embedded within that. \n I think the updated plan that we're anticipating for Colorado would be a continuation of a lot of those existing programs and maybe moving from more pilot to more scale -- or scale deployment of everything from coatings on poles to covered conductor analysis and deployment to enhanced recloser settings and recloser installations across the business, potential for incremental undergrounding in various areas and probably some operational opportunities around enhanced power line settings and PSPs mechanisms. \n Still working on finals. So I don't think it's going to be a material driver in terms of our capital deployment, but I do think it will be an enhancement to our risk reduction in our Colorado company. \nAnthony Crowdell: And Bob, just lastly, do you -- does that plan have to get approved or just accepted, just a procedure that goes on in Colorado on a wildfire mitigation plan? \nRobert Frenzel: Yes. It goes through a regular way of proceeding with intervenor testimony and our testimony [indiscernible] approval by the PUC. \nOperator: Our next question is from Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. \nCarly Davenport: Just two quick ones for me on some of the resource plan opportunities that you've highlighted. So first, on Colorado, obviously, strong results on that plan in 2023. How should we think about just the next milestones to watch in Colorado, whether that's around the CPCN process for the transmission or the Just Transition filing? \n And then just second on SPS. We saw the load growth come in close to 5% overall in '23. So just in that context, can you talk a little bit about the SPS opportunity around the future RFP there to sort of accommodate that level of potential growth going forward? \nBrian Van Abel: Yes, absolutely, Carly. Related to Colorado, we'll begin -- so the marker will begin to file CPCNs for all of our projects in transmission starting in likely late February. And then you'll just see them kind of filter in probably over Q2. And then those will be regular way CPCNs, I think probably 8- to 9-month type approval processes on each of those filings. So those are the next markers at least on the projects coming out of the Colorado Resource Plan that was just approved.\n And then we're working on filing our Just Transition Plan in June and that was originally focused on the replacement of the Comanche 3 assets with a little bit of the commission approving No Regrets Portfolio in this December. I think there's opportunity to bring the incremental resources. We do think we need additional resources that we propose and even the commission acknowledges that there may be an opportunity or they believe that we may need those resources.\n So that will be all part of the Just Transition Plan filing. And again that follows a typical Colorado time line in terms of 9 months or so to work through that proceeding. So it would - pushes that into 2025. But overall, excited those are kind of looking at '28 to [ '29 ], '30 type clean generation opportunities and how do we transition our fleet in Colorado as it will be completely out of coal by the end of 2030 in Colorado.\n On SPS, really great low growth opportunities in SPS. And you noted our sales growth there in 2023, we expect to continue to see significant sales growth in that region. I think that is really the driver of our SPS resource plan. We provided a range from 5,000 megawatts up to 10,000 megawatts. That 10,000 megawatts is really working with our large customers on their electrification forecast. So I think it's a significant opportunity. We do not have that anywhere in our capital plans. So we will make -- we will work through that filing and the New Mexico Commission will -- they don't officially approve it, but they accept the resource plan, and then we'll look to launch the RFP in the summer time.\n And then we'll get our results later in 2024 and likely start working on selection early in 2025. So pretty excited about that plan, excited about supporting the benefits of electrification down in SPS and making sure that we can serve our customers.\n So overall, like I said, really great steel for fuel low growth -- steel for fuel opportunities in serving the low growth in our territories. \nRobert Frenzel: Carly, it's Bob. I just add on to what Brian said is probably remiss if we didn't comment on the Minnesota and the Wisconsin RFPs that are in the SPS RP that's in flight right now, which represents 2,000 megawatts of new clean energy in the Upper Midwest and in the Southwest. We expect resolution of those, as I said in my prepared remarks, this year, and they're included in our incremental capital opportunities in our investor deck. \nBrian Van Abel: And just one more thing to add. We'll be filing a resource plan in Minnesota on February 1, which is a continuation of the transition of our generation fleet as we shut down our coal plants in Minnesota by 2030. And pretty excited about just all the opportunities across our service territories. \nOperator: Our next question is from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. \nSophie Karp: So I noticed that you showed the Colorado, I guess, earned ROE like sub 8%, if I'm reading this correctly. Just given how much capital you're going to be investing in the state, do you see a path to improve that? And what is that? \nBrian Van Abel: Yes. Sophie, thanks for the question. Certainly, in Colorado, we've had a pretty significant gap between our authorized versus earned ROE. As we think of all the capital that we're deploying on the clean energy transition that will flow through timely recovery from a rider perspective. Also all the transmission that we need to invest to be able to deliver that clean energy to our customers will flow through the TCA. So the incremental capital should get more timely recovery. I mean it's important as we think about longer term to ensure that we have a financially healthy utility because it allows us to have a competitive cost of capital, which in the long term is that -- most beneficial to our customers as it delivers the lowest cost of customers -- lowest cost to our customers. \n So something that we're certainly aware of and working on, our stakeholders and policymakers around ensuring that we are aligned with the clean energy policy in Colorado and how we can ensure that we keep that alignment and improve it over time. \nSophie Karp: So the problem, so to speak there was just a timing lag with capital, which you expect to improve with more contemporaneous mechanisms. Am I getting this right? \nBrian Van Abel: Yes. And as we mentioned, yes, it is the regulatory lag, the capital lag. We had a historic test year in Colorado gas. And as we mentioned in my opening remarks, we'll be filing a Colorado Natural Gas Case here in the next week or so. And so we'll be working through that. \nSophie Karp: Okay. All right. And my other question was your volume growth overall for the company was something like 1% or above in '23 and you're basing your guidance on 2% to 3% growth in '24. So I'm wondering where do you expect to see this acceleration and what's the underlying assumption there? \nBrian Van Abel: So as we think about it, yes, our guidance here is 2% to 3% in 2024. The biggest driver continues to be in SPS and the electrification and growth we're hearing from our customers, obviously, we work very closely with our large industrial customers down there, so I have a good sense of what their low growth forecasts are in 2024 and even beyond. We're starting to see some large C&I growth in Colorado with the data center coming online and a couple of other large customers coming online. So really driven by C&I load growth in 2024. We do continue to have customer -- residential customer growth of roughly 1%, so that contribute some. But overall, it's driven by our C&I growth, particularly in SPS. \nOperator: Our next question is from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. \nDavid Arcaro: I had a quick question just on tax credit transfers. Let's see -- are you changing kind of the anticipated level over the course of the plan given the increased CapEx here? And did that contribute? I saw that the cash flow from ops increased versus the prior slide deck. I'm wondering if that was part of it. \nBrian Van Abel: David, so we incorporate the transferability into the cash from operations. But for us, transferability isn't really cash flow driver when we look plan over plans. We've incorporated all the transfer tax credits in the previous plan, the transfer tax credits in this new plan.\n Certainly, cash flow from ops increased by about $1.5 billion when you look at it from the $34 billion to $39 billion plan. Really, the projects -- there's a net income that drives our book depreciation and some deferred taxes, it's a combination of all 3. Some of these projects do go in service in the middle and so they are good cash flowing assets as we think about it. And so that's why you see that there. \n From a transferability perspective, now we do include that now in our 5-year forecast. I think prior, I talked about -- we were somewhere around $2.5 billion of transferability. Now we're approaching about $3 billion of transfer tax credits over the 5 years,. Roughly $500 million this year, growing to about $700 million at the end of the 5-year forecast. So we see the demand and have -- actually have much more demand than our supply. \nOperator: Our next question is from Travis Miller with Morningstar. \nTravis Miller: I'm disappointed, we don't get to hear your election thoughts. But aside from that, wonder if you could talk a little bit more after you've added this capital and the impact that's going to have, obviously, on financing needs and the impact on the dividend growth, how do you go into these next set of RFPs and any kind of other capital investment opportunities. Does that change your thinking in terms of pursuing some of those projects? \nRobert Frenzel: Tavis, it's Bob. Thanks for the question. We really want to own and operate the infrastructure that serves our customers. I think this is a core skill set of the company. We think we're competitive. We think we can do a price competitively for our customers. I think we've proven that over the last 5 or 6 years and delivering value to our customers from our clean energy investments. I think -- it wasn't in our original pro forma estimates, but I think our total over the last 5 years is close to $5 billion worth of tax credits and avoided fuel costs from installing wind into our system for the benefit of our customers, which was never included in our forecast when we put those wind farms in.\n So there's real customer benefit for us owning and passing that stuff through to our customers. As we look to the future, obviously, we want to own and operate the infrastructure. It's important in the regulatory mechanisms, as you said, making sure that we get timely recovery of the new investment assets, is really important for us as we think about installing new generation into our areas.\n But I think our position would be that we continue to want to own and operate generation assets, recognizing that there are going to be likely competitive processes, and we have to prove value to our customers and we've been good at that. And I think our plan would be to continue to target ownership of some amounts of those generation assets. \nBrian Van Abel: Yes. And Travis just to add that -- Bob's absolutely right, we have to demonstrate that we're competitive with our commissions and we have been, and we expect to continue to be so going forward. And so we can continue to deliver low-cost electricity to our customers.\n But I think just from a purely financial standpoint, we've been very open about -- we will fund accretive capital growth, and we'll fund that with a balanced mix of equity and debt and cash flow from operations. So overall, we're very comfortable with it and I think we're in a great to be both to deliver for our customers and our shareholders for the longer term. \nTravis Miller: Okay. Great. That makes sense. And then one other different subject. Assuming you get the Tolk accelerated depreciation approval in Texas, are there any remaining steps, either regulatory, other procedural steps necessary to hit that 2030 goal of closing your entire coal fleet? \nBrian Van Abel: No. No. That was the last one outstanding. So we're pretty excited about it assuming we get PUCT approval of the settlement. That's the last one. \nTravis Miller: Okay. No transmission operator agreement necessary and anything like that? \nBrian Van Abel: No. \nOperator: Our next question is from [ Ryan Breno ] with Citi. \nUnknown Analyst: A couple of quick questions. In terms of the Marshall fire, I appreciate the clarifications and updates. Is there any opportunity for settlement there outside of the formal court process? \nBrian Van Abel: Ryan, look, it's still very early in the process. But as we've said from the beginning, we strongly disagree with the conclusion of the sheriff's report, and we intend to viciously defend ourselves sitting here today. \nUnknown Analyst: Okay. And given the balance sheet, operator challenges and needs to raise capital over the coming years. Are there any M&A opportunities in terms of asset sales that you'd contemplate to derisk your funding plans? \nBrian Van Abel: Yes. First, I guess I'd disagree with the balance sheet challenges. I think we have one of the stronger balance sheets in the industry. So I don't necessarily agree with that characterization. But now from an M&A standpoint, now we're comfortable with where we sit in the assets we own. Obviously, we're aware of everything that is going on in the industry. \nOperator: Our next question is from Paul Fremont with Ladenburg. \nPaul Fremont: Just a quick question on the Marshall fire. Is there any update on the dollar amount of the claims at this point? \nRobert Frenzel: Paul, it's Bob. Thanks for the question. No, no update. I mean the insurance commissioner said that the property damage was in excess of $2 billion. But as far as the total amount of suits, they haven't claimed any liability in the suits or from the plaintiffs. \nOperator: Our last question is from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. \nPaul Patterson: Just one of my questions have been asked. But on the -- to follow up on Steve Fleishman's question on the PIMs. It seemed like meeting the order and stuff that there was a greater -- that they basically anticipated looking at additional PIMs and sort of we're intrigued with sort of PBR in general. And I was wondering just sort of how you -- I know it's early to say, and it depends obviously what the PIMs are. But given that they seem to be sort of more performance-based PBR directionally driven. How you think you're positioned to deal with that?\n And do you see perhaps not only sticks but also carats, is there a potential, perhaps, that you could do well under PBR, if you follow me? \nRobert Frenzel: Paul, you were breaking up a little bit, but let me see if I understand the question. Given the recent PIMs in Colorado, how do you feel broadly about performance-based ratemaking and things like that.\n Look, I think that it's natural. And as Brian indicated earlier, that we've had capital cost caps on various projects broadly throughout the portfolio. I think the setup PIMs that we worked through with interveners and stakeholders and the commission as part of the CEP in Colorado, I think the process was productive. We have an opportunity to propose. I think they appreciated our proposal. I don't think it's a material move in a certain direction. I think it's probably appropriate and on a project basis probably less so for an entity-wide basis. So I don't see a lot -- I don't read a lot into where we've been with Colorado or with other jurisdictions in terms of incentive mechanisms around capital deployment. \nBrian Van Abel: Yes, Paul, in the written orders, certainly there's a discussion. We'll work with the staff as we work on the Just Transition plan in terms of looking at well-designed PIMs. And there's also a PIM around potential kind of the emissions achievement. So we look forward to working with staff on that as we move through time. \nOperator: Thank you very much. I'd like to hand it back over to CFO, Brian Van Abel for any closing remarks. \nBrian Van Abel: Well, thank you all for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions. Have a great day. \nOperator: Thank you very much. That concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Robert Frenzel",
            "content": "Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everybody. We had another successful year at Xcel Energy continuing to provide our customers with safe, clean, reliable and affordable energy while delivering an operational and financial performance.\n In 2023, we executed on the largest capital program in Xcel Energy history, investing approximately $6 billion to improve resiliency and enabling clean energy for our customers while delivering economic growth and vitality for our communities. \n Our investments in operations enabled ongoing earnings of $3.35 per share, representing the 19th consecutive year of meeting or exceeding our earnings guidance. Meeting our financial commitments is critical to maintaining a competitive cost of capital, which benefits our customers as we access the capital markets to fund our operations. \n In December, we received approval for our ground breaking clean energy portfolio with over 5,800 megawatts of new generation resources. This $4.8 billion of new generation investment, which when coupled with the necessary transmission represents almost an $8 billion worth of commitments in Colorado to deliver a cleaner energy economy.\n I'm proud of how our teams partnered with so many stakeholders to deliver on these achievements. And as I look back on the year, we accomplished so many other great outcomes. While the final values aren't in yet, our SAIDI scores improved and we believe we'll be in the top quartile of U.S. utilities for delivering reliable electricity to our customers. Across our wind fleet, we continue to deliver strong net capacity performance and exceeded our corporate availability target for the third consecutive year.\n We navigated a very busy regulatory calendar resolving multiple rate cases and reached a pending settlement in our Texas electric rate case. We filed our Clean Heat Plan in Colorado and our natural gas innovation plan in Minnesota, providing a framework in both of those states to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions for our natural gas customers.\n We've approved transportation electrification programs in New Mexico and in Wisconsin, along with updated transportation plans pending commission approval in both Minnesota and Colorado.\n We were partners in over $1.5 billion of awards by the Department of Energy to support the Heartland Hydrogen Hub, wildfire and extreme weather resiliency, Form Energy long-duration energy storage pilots, and additional transmission as part of the MISO SPPC's projects. These grants will lower the cost of these clean energy and resiliency projects for our customers.\n In 2023, we signed agreements for data centers with Meta in Minnesota and QTS in Colorado. Data center and AI-driven demand continued to be a low driver on our system with several gigawatts in the pipeline across our footprint. In Minnesota, we received approvals for an additional 250 megawatts of solar in our 10-megawatt 100-hour Form Energy battery pilot both at our retiring Sherco coal facility.\n We have active RFPs for over 2,000 megawatts of renewable resources across our operating companies, which we expect resolution on later this year. \n We also filed resource plans in our SPS company, which could add an additional 5,000 to 10,000 megawatts to our system by 2030. In December, we retired Unit 2 at our Sherco coal facility while continuing the trend of no personnel layoffs at our retiring coal facilities over the past 15 years. We reduced carbon emissions for the electric utility by 53% as compared to a 2005 baseline, on track with our goals for 2030 and 2050.\n All the while, our customer bills remain amongst the lowest in the country. Over the past 5 years, the average Xcel Energy residential, electric and natural gas bills are 28% and 14% below the national average, respectively. And over the last 10 years, we kept our annual residential electric and natural gas bill increases to 1.8% and 1.1%, respectively, well below the rate of inflation.\n We're actively involved in our communities as our employees, contractors and retirees provided more than $11 million and volunteered over 40,000 hours to support charitable organizations across our footprint. We initiated 18 economic development projects for our communities, which are projected to create more than $2.4 billion in capital investments and 1,400 jobs.\n For the seventh consecutive year, we received the top score from Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Corporate Equality Index, the nation's foremost benchmarking survey in measuring corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ+ workplace equality.\n And finally, we received several other recognitions, including being named a top military employer by multiple organizations and one of the World's Most Admired Companies by Fortune Magazine.\n We're proud of these achievements, which reflect operational excellence and strong policy alignment, allowing Xcel Energy to provide a valuable product with significant benefits to our customers, our communities, our employees and our shareholders.\n With that, I'll turn it over to Brian. I like the phrase doing the math. I think I might have heard that before. Look, we're really excited about our investment profile over the next 5 years, across our 8 states, multiple asset categories, clean generation, transmission, advanced grid, electric vehicles, everything in support of our customers. Obviously, the EPS growth rate follows the rate base growth with some amount of dilution for financing costs at the parent level. The new updated capital plan is accretive. We expect during this 5-year period to be at or above the top end of our 5% to 7% range. But we think 5% to 7% is still a good long-term growth rate for the company, and that's our guidance right now. Yes. No, we've got a long-standing relationship. The new commissioner comes out of the department, and we've been working with him very proactively over years. So we expect a continued strong relationship with the Minnesota Commission. It's Bob. Thanks for the support as always. With the fire, I think the next sort of milestone I'd say is we have a sort of a trial planning period of meeting first week of February. Given the change in cases and plaintiffs that schedule got moved back a little bit to give new claimants more time. We'll get a better trial calendar.\n As Brian said, we expect a trial some time in '25. Look, we -- after that, we go into discovery, there's not much to do past that. So we'll update everybody when we know more, but there's not much to say other than the facts remain the same on the case and roll the calendar probably to early next month. Steve, it's Bob. The last one seems like a lot of fun to talk about, but I'll probably pass on that fastball. On Washington, in particular, the hydrogen production tax credit, we were very active, we've been very stalwart in our position that we believe that clean fuels and clean molecules are going to be needed as part of a broader, cleaner energy economy. We felt that hydrogen was probably the most attractive molecule that we could produce in a clean and green way. \n We are really proud to be considered for a Hydrogen Hub and in our Upper Midwest proposal, The Heartland Hub. But I got to tell you, the 45V tax credit draft guidance out of the treasury was disappointing. It doesn't feel as if we're trying to support a hydrogen economy in the United States. It's going to make it more expensive for our customers, harder to develop an electrolyzer industry on an industrial basis in the country and will slow or stall clean fuel deployment in the United States. We expect to make comments within the comment period. We expect EEI to make comments. We expect other customers to make comments. So I think the treasury is going to have a lot to balance here, strict additionality and hourly matching if it's going to make it more challenging to produce hydrogen at a cost-competitive basis with other fuels. So that's kind of where we are on hydrogen. And I think you asked about nuclear, our math -- go ahead, Brian. Yes. Anthony, it's Bob. Good to hear you this morning, and thanks for the questions. We're operating under an existing wildfire mitigation program in Colorado right now. And I'd say that, that plan includes asset hardening and replacement. It's got pilots for various technology solutions and risk modeling embedded within that. \n I think the updated plan that we're anticipating for Colorado would be a continuation of a lot of those existing programs and maybe moving from more pilot to more scale -- or scale deployment of everything from coatings on poles to covered conductor analysis and deployment to enhanced recloser settings and recloser installations across the business, potential for incremental undergrounding in various areas and probably some operational opportunities around enhanced power line settings and PSPs mechanisms. \n Still working on finals. So I don't think it's going to be a material driver in terms of our capital deployment, but I do think it will be an enhancement to our risk reduction in our Colorado company. Yes. It goes through a regular way of proceeding with intervenor testimony and our testimony [indiscernible] approval by the PUC. Carly, it's Bob. I just add on to what Brian said is probably remiss if we didn't comment on the Minnesota and the Wisconsin RFPs that are in the SPS RP that's in flight right now, which represents 2,000 megawatts of new clean energy in the Upper Midwest and in the Southwest. We expect resolution of those, as I said in my prepared remarks, this year, and they're included in our incremental capital opportunities in our investor deck. Tavis, it's Bob. Thanks for the question. We really want to own and operate the infrastructure that serves our customers. I think this is a core skill set of the company. We think we're competitive. We think we can do a price competitively for our customers. I think we've proven that over the last 5 or 6 years and delivering value to our customers from our clean energy investments. I think -- it wasn't in our original pro forma estimates, but I think our total over the last 5 years is close to $5 billion worth of tax credits and avoided fuel costs from installing wind into our system for the benefit of our customers, which was never included in our forecast when we put those wind farms in.\n So there's real customer benefit for us owning and passing that stuff through to our customers. As we look to the future, obviously, we want to own and operate the infrastructure. It's important in the regulatory mechanisms, as you said, making sure that we get timely recovery of the new investment assets, is really important for us as we think about installing new generation into our areas.\n But I think our position would be that we continue to want to own and operate generation assets, recognizing that there are going to be likely competitive processes, and we have to prove value to our customers and we've been good at that. And I think our plan would be to continue to target ownership of some amounts of those generation assets. Paul, it's Bob. Thanks for the question. No, no update. I mean the insurance commissioner said that the property damage was in excess of $2 billion. But as far as the total amount of suits, they haven't claimed any liability in the suits or from the plaintiffs. Paul, you were breaking up a little bit, but let me see if I understand the question. Given the recent PIMs in Colorado, how do you feel broadly about performance-based ratemaking and things like that.\n Look, I think that it's natural. And as Brian indicated earlier, that we've had capital cost caps on various projects broadly throughout the portfolio. I think the setup PIMs that we worked through with interveners and stakeholders and the commission as part of the CEP in Colorado, I think the process was productive. We have an opportunity to propose. I think they appreciated our proposal. I don't think it's a material move in a certain direction. I think it's probably appropriate and on a project basis probably less so for an entity-wide basis. So I don't see a lot -- I don't read a lot into where we've been with Colorado or with other jurisdictions in terms of incentive mechanisms around capital deployment."

            "name": "Brian Van Abel",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. For the full year 2023, we had ongoing earnings of $3.35 per share compared to $3.17 per share in 2022. The most significant earnings drivers for the year include the following: higher electric and natural gas margins increased earnings by $0.10 per share. This reflects $0.10 of unfavorable weather as compared to last year.\n Lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.06 per share which reflects the impact of cost containment actions. Lower conservation and DSM expense increased earnings by $0.06 per share, which is largely offset in lower margins.\n Higher other income increased earnings by $0.05 per share, primarily due to rabbi trust performance, which is largely offset in O&M expenses.\n Lower other taxes, primarily property taxes, increased earnings by $0.04 per share. And in addition, other items combined to increase earnings by $0.06 per share. Offsetting these positive drivers, higher interest charges, which decreased earnings by $0.14 per share driven by rising interest rates and increased debt levels to fund capital investment; and higher depreciation and amortization expense, which decreased earnings by $0.05 per share, reflecting our capital investment program.\n Turning to sales. Full year weather adjusted electric sales increased by 1%, consistent with our guidance assumptions. For 2024, we expect electric sales to increase by 2% to 3%. Shifting to expenses. O&M expenses decreased $47 million or approximately 2% for the year. This is consistent with our annual guidance and reflects management action to offset inflation and other challenges we faced during the year.\n During the fourth quarter, we also made constructive progress on several rate case proceedings. In December, we filed a settlement in our Texas Electric Rate Case, which reflects a rate increase of $65 million; an acceleration of the Tolk depreciation life to 2028; and the ROE of 9.55% and equity ratio of 54.5% for AFUDC purposes. The commission decision is anticipated in the first quarter of 2024.\n In November, Wisconsin Commission approved an electric rate increase of $1 million and a natural gas increase of $5 million based on an ROE of 9.8% and an equity ratio of 52.5%. The decision reflects adjustments for our residential affordability program, updated fuel and purchase power costs and other items, which are earnings neutral. Rates were effective January 2024.\n In November, we filed a Minnesota Natural Gas Rate Case requesting a $59 million rate increase based on an ROE of 10.2%, an equity ratio of 52.5% in a forward test year. In December, the commission approved our request for interim rates of $51 million, subject to refund starting this January. Final decision is expected later this year.\n As far as future filings, we plan to file a Colorado Natural Gas Case in the next week or so. In addition, we also anticipate filing a revised Wildfire Mitigation Plan in Colorado in the first half of 2024.\n Updating our progress on production tax credit transferability. We executed multiple contracts in 2023 totaling $400 million. We anticipate executing $500 million of PPC sales in 2024. Transferability reduces near-term funding needs, and most importantly, lowers the cost of our renewable energy projects for our customers.\n Moving to our capital forecast. We've updated our 5-year capital plan for the decision in the Colorado Resource Plan, which now reflects an investment of $39 billion. This base capital plan supports investment in renewable generation, transmission to deliver the clean energy and customer-facing investments for a reliable and resilient advanced grid. The baseline results in an annual rate base growth of approximately 9%. Not included in our base plan is approximately $5 billion for renewables and firm capacity associated with RFPs at NSP and SPS and future filings in Colorado.\n We've updated our base financing plan, which reflects the incremental debt and equity financing needs for these investments. Please note that the guidance assumptions in our earnings release have also been updated to reflect changes to the capital forecast for this year. As a reminder, we anticipate any incremental capital investment to be funded by approximately 40% equity.\n It is important to recognize that we've always maintained a balanced financing strategy which includes a mix of debt and equity to fund accretive growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet and credit metrics. Maintaining solid credit metrics and favorable access to capital markets are critical to fund our clean energy transition, maintain a competitive cost of capital and keep customer bills low, especially in a higher interest rate environment.\n Finally, we remain committed to our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%, which we believe is conservative. We now expect to deliver earnings at or above the top end of the range in 2025 -- starting in 2025.\n In addition, we will rebase future annual guidance of actual results. As a result of the significant capital investment opportunities and equity funding needs, we now expect to grow the dividend at the low end of our current 5% to 7% dividend growth range with a target payout ratio of 50% to 60%. This will reduce our equity financing needs over time, lower financing risk and give us even more dry powder and financial flexibility in the future.\n Now I'll conclude with a brief update on the Marshall Wildfire Litigation. The statute of limitations ended in December, and as expected, we saw a significant increase in the number of claims. As of now, we are aware of 298 lawsuits with approximately 4,000 claims. In early February, there will be a hearing at which time a schedule may be determined. We believe the trial will likely begin in 2025.\n With that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. We're executing on an ambitious investment plan for our customers to deliver clean, reliable energy that investment enabled Xcel Energy to deliver 2023 ongoing earnings within our guidance range for the 19th year in a row. For the 20th consecutive year, we increased our dividend to investors. \n We resolved multiple rate cases and filed foundational plans for our natural gas utility to reach its net zero goals. We retired our Sherco Unit 2 coal plant early and reduced carbon emissions by 53% from 2005 levels. We received approval for our groundbreaking portfolio of clean energy resources in Colorado. We updated our base 5-year capital plan to $39 billion, which reflects 9% rate base growth. We have additional capital backlog in all of our jurisdictions.\n We have a strong line of sight to achieving -- to achieve earnings at or above the top end of our 5% to 7% long-term EPS growth rate. And finally, our electric and natural gas customers have some of the lowest bills in the country, while continuing the safe and reliable service they expect from Xcel Energy. \n This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions. Yes. And Julien, I'd just add that we do expect -- that's a conservative growth rate. And as I noted in my remarks, going forward, we will rebase off of actual earnings. So important things to note in our script. And overall, as Bob said, we're really excited about it. We're excited about our opportunities and our steel for fuel and the clean energy transition. And I think we're one of the fastest transitioning utilities in the country. And our electric bills are 28% below the national average. So I think we're in a great place for our investors and our customers. Yes. Julien, yes, no change and our guidance assumptions for this year is still $3.50 to $3.60. Now there is an increase in CapEx if you look kind of plan over plan this year. But that was really back-end loaded as we work through some of the regulatory approval processes. From an equity perspective, look, we have -- we've said we've been -- we've talked about doing at least $500 million annually through our ATM and expect that ratable over the 5 years. And then we do have some drip. The amount above the $1.5 billion above that, we'll be opportunistic, and we'll look at it. But I think it kind of follows with how our incremental CapEx follows. Yes, we can. No, the way we'll -- a pretty plain vanilla way we finance our company. So kind of the base case to be is a block issue. And something you can obviously look at doing a forwards or something. We look at mandatory converts, but our base case is just doing blocks above the level that we feel comfortable with on the ATM. Yes. Let me hit the workforce reduction question first, and I'll transition to the longer-term O&M outlook for us.\n I think from a workforce reduction perspective, us like everyone else faced some significant cost challenges and pressures over the past few years. And so we -- as Paul said, we undertook that to streamline the organization and ensure some of our resources are aligned where our customer needs are and our growth opportunities. \n So as Paul said, approximately 400 employees are through that voluntary retirement program and another 150 positions were eliminated so that we look forward that generates approximately 2% O&M savings on a run rate basis.\n But we will look to reinvest some of that, as I said, into the growth areas of the company as we look to support our customer needs. But overall, sets us up into '24 that is included and incorporated into our 2024 guidance. As I think about 2024, our guidances were up 1% to 2% relative to '23, but it's really flat to '22 when you look what happened in 2023. \n Now longer term, you asked about kind of what our longer-term expectations are, we've been managing our O&M with a laser focus on operational efficiency. I think if you look at our IR deck from Q4, we're 1 of 3 utilities that have O&M flat or down since 2015 on the electric operations side. So something we're really proud of.\n And while we look longer term, we have some tailwinds of coal plant shutdowns. We expect we'll be shutting down a coal plant roughly a coal unit roughly a year. We spend a lot of time on technology in looking at how we can leverage technology in our operations in the corporate areas. And then I think most importantly, we haven't talked about this that much as we launched something that we call One Xcel Energy Way which is our continuous improvement engine. We deployed it last year, so we're in the year 2 of it. Really focused on the lean principles and being a transformation engine that is looking at waste reduction and waste elimination. And so that's something we're putting a lot of effort and focus on it and that team reports directly to me, so I'm very involved in it.\n So we think longer term, our goal is to absorb inflation, absorb the, call it, areas we need to invest in from a growth perspective and maintain O&M roughly flat and ensure that we can keep our customer bills low for the long term. So we're pretty excited about it. Obviously, it's not easy but something we spend a lot of time on. So I appreciate the question. Yes. Absolutely. So as we look at it, given our significant growth in our base plan, we just added $5 billion of capital to it and that -- the fact that we're guiding to the top end or above our conservative 5% to 7% EPS growth, we thought it was prudent and the right decision to lower our dividend growth, still within our dividend growth guidance of 5% to 7%.\n But as we think over the long term that helped us reduce the equity we needed for this $5 billion of capital. But even longer term, when you look at the compounding impact of a lower dividend with significantly high capital needs it feels like a prudent decision, gives us longer-term financial flexibility and dry powder and reduces financing risks over the long term.\n So we feel really good about it. We feel really good that we have a very good total shareholder return proposition for investors, and we'll continue -- we expect to deliver here [indiscernible] Durgesh, I think we'll assess it every time if we have a significant chunk of capital, update our plans as we do regularly, we obviously evaluate all parts of our total shareholder return. Yes, Steve, the updated $39 billion plan. Yes. Yes. Certainly, Steve, and for the folks that haven't been close to that proceeding. We really have 2 PIMs, which the commission asked to propose a couple of PIMs. So we have a cost to construct and think of that just as a capital, what's our budget for the project has been. And we've operated under those types of things for a long time, whether in Minnesota, Texas, New Mexico, we've had those in Colorado. So we propose a PIM. The commission modified it a little bit, so it's a plus or minus 5% deadband and then customers sharing -- savings and sharing was a penalty or incentive above the 5%.\n Overall, we're comfortable with managing within that PIM. We feel like we put forward good budgets for our projects and knew going in that we would be held to what we proposed given that was a competitive process.\n So we feel comfortable about that. On the operational PIM, again, it's -- the commission modified it slightly but generally adopted what we proposed. That's an overall -- think of it as LCOE PIM on a 3-year rolling average with a plus or minus 5% deadband. And the first 5% to 10% above, it's 80% of the costs or savings you have for customers, the company bears 20%. So if you look at it, we view that's very manageable and appreciative that the commission adopted the PIMs that we -- our structure that PIMs are put forward. \n So we look forward to working through the CPCNs with commission and then we have the Just Transition plan coming up, which is additional opportunities as we think about transitioning our generation fleet in Colorado. Yes, I can just chime in on nuclear. So we expect guidance here in Q2 is our current thinking. Obviously, the guidance we're looking for is how do you calculate the gross receipts, meaning how do you calculate the value. We've got advocated for the use of LMPs, obviously, given that we're in an RTO. \n Certainly, if you look at our earnings guidance, we have not incorporated that into our ETR. But when we look at kind of the forward curve, we would expect north of $100 million benefit for our customers. So something that we're -- that we provided our comments and hopeful that treasury comes out and favor us because it's a great benefit for our customers. \n So looking for that Q2. Just a follow-up on Bob's comments on hydrogen. I mean disappointing, the analysis I've seen is green hydrogen now structurally more expensive than blue hydrogen for the next decade and significantly more expensive than gray hydrogen. And so it will depress the development of the green hydrogen market. And so hopeful to get some changes to the final rules. Well, I mean, at or above the high end implies that we're above 6% growth right now. But I take it your question, what would cause us to go to 6% to 8%, if I can interpret it. Like we evaluate it we feel 5% to 7% is the right long-term growth rate. It's conservative and rebasing off of actuals and signaling that we're going to be at the top end or above is the right place to be long term. Yes, absolutely, Carly. Related to Colorado, we'll begin -- so the marker will begin to file CPCNs for all of our projects in transmission starting in likely late February. And then you'll just see them kind of filter in probably over Q2. And then those will be regular way CPCNs, I think probably 8- to 9-month type approval processes on each of those filings. So those are the next markers at least on the projects coming out of the Colorado Resource Plan that was just approved.\n And then we're working on filing our Just Transition Plan in June and that was originally focused on the replacement of the Comanche 3 assets with a little bit of the commission approving No Regrets Portfolio in this December. I think there's opportunity to bring the incremental resources. We do think we need additional resources that we propose and even the commission acknowledges that there may be an opportunity or they believe that we may need those resources.\n So that will be all part of the Just Transition Plan filing. And again that follows a typical Colorado time line in terms of 9 months or so to work through that proceeding. So it would - pushes that into 2025. But overall, excited those are kind of looking at '28 to [ '29 ], '30 type clean generation opportunities and how do we transition our fleet in Colorado as it will be completely out of coal by the end of 2030 in Colorado.\n On SPS, really great low growth opportunities in SPS. And you noted our sales growth there in 2023, we expect to continue to see significant sales growth in that region. I think that is really the driver of our SPS resource plan. We provided a range from 5,000 megawatts up to 10,000 megawatts. That 10,000 megawatts is really working with our large customers on their electrification forecast. So I think it's a significant opportunity. We do not have that anywhere in our capital plans. So we will make -- we will work through that filing and the New Mexico Commission will -- they don't officially approve it, but they accept the resource plan, and then we'll look to launch the RFP in the summer time.\n And then we'll get our results later in 2024 and likely start working on selection early in 2025. So pretty excited about that plan, excited about supporting the benefits of electrification down in SPS and making sure that we can serve our customers.\n So overall, like I said, really great steel for fuel low growth -- steel for fuel opportunities in serving the low growth in our territories. And just one more thing to add. We'll be filing a resource plan in Minnesota on February 1, which is a continuation of the transition of our generation fleet as we shut down our coal plants in Minnesota by 2030. And pretty excited about just all the opportunities across our service territories. Yes. Sophie, thanks for the question. Certainly, in Colorado, we've had a pretty significant gap between our authorized versus earned ROE. As we think of all the capital that we're deploying on the clean energy transition that will flow through timely recovery from a rider perspective. Also all the transmission that we need to invest to be able to deliver that clean energy to our customers will flow through the TCA. So the incremental capital should get more timely recovery. I mean it's important as we think about longer term to ensure that we have a financially healthy utility because it allows us to have a competitive cost of capital, which in the long term is that -- most beneficial to our customers as it delivers the lowest cost of customers -- lowest cost to our customers. \n So something that we're certainly aware of and working on, our stakeholders and policymakers around ensuring that we are aligned with the clean energy policy in Colorado and how we can ensure that we keep that alignment and improve it over time. Yes. And as we mentioned, yes, it is the regulatory lag, the capital lag. We had a historic test year in Colorado gas. And as we mentioned in my opening remarks, we'll be filing a Colorado Natural Gas Case here in the next week or so. And so we'll be working through that. So as we think about it, yes, our guidance here is 2% to 3% in 2024. The biggest driver continues to be in SPS and the electrification and growth we're hearing from our customers, obviously, we work very closely with our large industrial customers down there, so I have a good sense of what their low growth forecasts are in 2024 and even beyond. We're starting to see some large C&I growth in Colorado with the data center coming online and a couple of other large customers coming online. So really driven by C&I load growth in 2024. We do continue to have customer -- residential customer growth of roughly 1%, so that contribute some. But overall, it's driven by our C&I growth, particularly in SPS. David, so we incorporate the transferability into the cash from operations. But for us, transferability isn't really cash flow driver when we look plan over plans. We've incorporated all the transfer tax credits in the previous plan, the transfer tax credits in this new plan.\n Certainly, cash flow from ops increased by about $1.5 billion when you look at it from the $34 billion to $39 billion plan. Really, the projects -- there's a net income that drives our book depreciation and some deferred taxes, it's a combination of all 3. Some of these projects do go in service in the middle and so they are good cash flowing assets as we think about it. And so that's why you see that there. \n From a transferability perspective, now we do include that now in our 5-year forecast. I think prior, I talked about -- we were somewhere around $2.5 billion of transferability. Now we're approaching about $3 billion of transfer tax credits over the 5 years,. Roughly $500 million this year, growing to about $700 million at the end of the 5-year forecast. So we see the demand and have -- actually have much more demand than our supply. Yes. And Travis just to add that -- Bob's absolutely right, we have to demonstrate that we're competitive with our commissions and we have been, and we expect to continue to be so going forward. And so we can continue to deliver low-cost electricity to our customers.\n But I think just from a purely financial standpoint, we've been very open about -- we will fund accretive capital growth, and we'll fund that with a balanced mix of equity and debt and cash flow from operations. So overall, we're very comfortable with it and I think we're in a great to be both to deliver for our customers and our shareholders for the longer term. No. No. That was the last one outstanding. So we're pretty excited about it assuming we get PUCT approval of the settlement. That's the last one. No. Ryan, look, it's still very early in the process. But as we've said from the beginning, we strongly disagree with the conclusion of the sheriff's report, and we intend to viciously defend ourselves sitting here today. Yes. First, I guess I'd disagree with the balance sheet challenges. I think we have one of the stronger balance sheets in the industry. So I don't necessarily agree with that characterization. But now from an M&A standpoint, now we're comfortable with where we sit in the assets we own. Obviously, we're aware of everything that is going on in the industry. Yes, Paul, in the written orders, certainly there's a discussion. We'll work with the staff as we work on the Just Transition plan in terms of looking at well-designed PIMs. And there's also a PIM around potential kind of the emissions achievement. So we look forward to working with staff on that as we move through time. Well, thank you all for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions. Have a great day."

Joining me today are Bob Frenzel, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer questions if needed. This morning, we will review our third quarter results and highlights, share recent business and regulatory developments, update our capital and financing plans and provide 2024 guidance. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. \n As a reminder, some of the comments during today's call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our SEC filings. Today, we'll discuss certain measures that are non-GAAP measures. Information on comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release. \n Early this week, a jury in Denver District Court found Xcel Energy liable and its dispute with core cooperative regarding prior year's lost power damages at our Comanche power plant. We intend to appeal the decision. For the third quarter of 2023, we recorded GAAP earnings of $1.19 per share, which includes a onetime nonrecurring tax charge of $34 million related to the ongoing legal dispute. \n As a result, we have taken a nonrecurring charge of $0.05 per share, which we don't consider part of ongoing earnings. All for the discussion in our earnings call will focus on ongoing earnings. For more information on this matter, please see the disclosure in our earnings release.\n I'll now turn the call over to Bob. \nRobert Frenzel: Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everybody. Let's start with the quarter. We had solid results recording ongoing earnings of $1.23 per share for 2023 compared to $1.18 per share in 2022. As a result, we're narrowing our '23 ongoing earnings guidance to $3.32 to $3.37 per share. We're also initiating 2024 ongoing earnings guidance of $3.50 to $3.60 per share, which is consistent with our 5% to 7% long-term EPS growth rate. \n Consistent with past practices, we've reviewed our customer and operational needs and have updated our infrastructure plan for 2024 to 2028. This revised forecast reflects $34 billion of needed capital investment, an increase of $4.5 billion from our previous plan. \n This base infrastructure investment plan includes substantial resiliency investments in both transmission and distribution including additional upgrades required to support the Colorado Energy Plan. However, it does not include clean energy generation investments that could result from the resource plans in Colorado, Texas, New Mexico, or in the Upper Midwest. If approved by our commissions, these cost-effective clean energy generation investments could result in an additional capital need totaling $10 billion from 2024 to 2028 and dramatically reduced carbon emissions in various states. \n Xcel Energy's resource plans also demonstrate the benefits of the Inflation Reduction Act, our state's geographic advantages that enable high-capacity renewable generation and our operational expertise and commercial acumen can bring to our customers. In September, we filed our recommended plan in Colorado. This plan seeks to double the amount of renewable energy in the state, making it the largest clean energy transition ever in Colorado history and demonstrates our strong element with the state's environmental goals. \n Our proposal contemplates the shutdown or conversion of our remaining coal units replaces them with approximately 6,500 megawatts of renewable energy and battery storage and 600 megawatts of dispatchable gas resources to ensure system reliability in times of low wind or solar conditions. These amounts include 4,800 megawatts as proposed to be owned and operated by Xcel Energy for the benefit of our customers. Including the approximately $3 billion in required transmission investments to ensure deliverability and reliability, this Colorado energy plan represents nearly an $11 billion total investment by Xcel Energy. \n In addition, this portfolio also includes $10 billion in IRA savings to customers. It creates local jobs, promote economic development and provides over $2 billion in tax benefits to local communities in the coming decades. At the same time, it will reduce carbon emissions by over 80% from 2005 levels in Colorado while having expected annual rate impact of only 2.3%. This competitive portfolio provides our Colorado customers an industry-leading opportunity for a cleaner economy at a fraction of the cost most other states would incur. \n Moving to Minnesota. In September, the commission approved 350 megawatts of new renewable generation, including an additional 250 megawatts at our Sherco facility. This brings the total amount of company-built solar at Sherco to over 700 MW making it one of the largest solar facilities in the country. In October, we also issued an RFP seeking 1,200 megawatts of wind that will utilize our transmission interconnect at our retiring Sherco coal facility and we'll be issuing additional RFPs to fulfill the remainder of the approved Upper Midwest Resource Plan in 2024. \n Finally, in October, we filed a resource plan in New Mexico. Based on our filing, SPS could require additional 5,000 to 10,000 megawatts of new generation by the end of the decade to accommodate increasing demand, plant retirements, and ensure resiliency and reliability of the grid. We've already proposed 418 megawatts of company-owned solar and battery projects that are pending commission approval. We anticipate filing another RFP in 2024 and for the additional generation resources. \n Shifting to our clean energy innovation projects. The Department of Energy recently announced nearly $1.5 billion in awards to support multiple Xcel Energy affiliated projects. Starting with the Heartland Hydrogen Hub, this estimated $5 billion initiative, which includes multiple projects from Xcel Energy and others received an award of up to $925 million by the DOE. This game-changing funding will serve as a catalyst for clean hydrogen ecosystem in the Upper Midwest and the foundation of our clean fuels efforts at Xcel Energy. \n Fortunately, the Western Interstate Hydrogen Hub in Colorado, New Mexico, Wyoming and Utah were not successful in this round of DOE funding. And that said, we remain committed to working with policymakers and federal offices with the hopes that our projects can progress to advance our shared clean energy goals. \n The DOE also awarded Xcel Energy up to $70 million to support two 10-megawatt 100-hour battery pilots with Form Energy. Combined with the grants from Breakthrough Energy's Catalyst Fund, we secured up to $90 million to support these long-duration energy storage pilots, a critical asset class to ensure cost-effective, reliability in a high renewable grid. \n With respect to DOE grid resilience and innovation partnerships program, Xcel Energy was selected as part of 2 different awards. First, the DOE we awarded Xcel Energy a $100 million to support projects to mitigate the threat of wildfires and ensure resiliency of the grid through extreme weather. Projects include vegetation management, selective undergrounding, advanced infrastructure technologies, drones, and several additional resiliency projects. Xcel Energy was also partied to grid's $464 million grant to expand transmission as part of the MISO and SPP program to fund high-voltage transmission to improve interregional transfer capability, reliability, and resolve grid constraints. \n We're appreciative of the DOE support as well as many of our partners in these projects, including our state and regional transmission organizations. Funding support helps us accelerate critical carbon-free technologies, enhance safety and resiliency while keeping costs low for customers. \n Turning to our natural gas utility. In August, we filed our Clean Heat program in Colorado. This first-of-a-kind plan provides a framework, reduce greenhouse gas emissions consistent with state goals in our net zero emissions target. The Plant fast track solutions such as electrification, demand side management, clean fuels and certified natural gas. The proposed Clean Heat Plus portfolio reduces greenhouse and gas emissions by 28% by 2030, ensures customer reliability and choice while optimizing customer bill impact. We plan to file a natural gas innovation plan, a corresponding framework for our Minnesota gas utility in the fourth quarter. \n In September, Meta announced construction of a $700 million data center in Minnesota, which eventually could be one of the largest customers in the state. We continue to evaluate a number of additional data center and commercial opportunities that will further support growth and economic development in our committees. \n Finally, there are not many new material developments with the Marshall Wildfire litigation. We currently have 14 complaints with 675 plaintiffs which have been consolidated into a single case. For the past four years, Xcel Energy has been operating under a commission-approved wildfire mitigation program in Colorado. We intend to file an updated wildfire mitigation plan next year which will include a wide range of options for stakeholder consideration, including the technologies, undergrounding additional vegetation management, composite poles, selective use of covered conductor and preventative power system shutoffs.\n Let me wrap-up with just a few summary comments before I turn it over to Brian. As we look forward across the next five years and beyond, we see a future that is bright for our communities, our customers and our investors. Xcel Energy is committed to providing a clean energy economy in our regions and it will require meaningful investment to accomplish.\n For our customers, we have the potential to deploy 15,000 to 20,000 megawatts of new clean generation on our systems by 2030, dramatically lowering our emissions profile, affordably powering our customers' homes and businesses, while ensuring 99.99% reliability that they come to expect from Xcel Energy. And through leveraging the benefits of the IRA and the IIJA, we are able to accelerate deployment of renewable resources in pairing them with affordable energy storage assets and other firm dispatchable clean fuel resources to provide reliability. \n We continue to invest in and innovate our transmission and distribution systems to ensure reliability and resilience and provide for regional and interregional deliverability. We're laying the framework to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions on our natural gas system. All the while our residential customer electric and natural gas builds are amongst the lowest in the country, 28% and 14% below the national average. And given that the regions where we serve customers are the most resource rich in wind and solar, we believe that we can lead this clean energy transition for our customers more cost-effectively than almost any other company. \n With that, I'll turn it over to Brian. \nBrian Van Abel: Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. We had ongoing earnings of $1.23 per share for the third quarter of 2023, compared to $1.18 per share in 2022. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter included the following: Lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.03 share which reflects the impact of cost containment actions, lower effective tax rate and conservation and demand side management expenses, which increased earnings $0.03 per share. Note that these items are apparently offset in lower margins are earnings neutral. In addition, other items combined to increase earnings by $0.04 per share. \n Offsetting these positive drivers, higher interest charges, which decreased earnings by $0.03 per share, driven by rising interest rates and increased debt levels to fund capital investment and higher depreciation and amortization expense, which decreased earnings by $0.02 per share, reflecting our capital investment program. \n Turning to sales. Year-to-date weather-adjusted electric sales increased by 1.1%, largely driven by strong C&I sales. As a result, we now expect annual electric sales growth of 1% to 2% in 2023. \n Shifting to expenses. O&M decreased $25 million for the third quarter, reflecting management actions to lower costs. We now expect our annual O&M expenses to decline by 1% to 2%. \n During the third quarter, we also made progress in several regulatory proceedings and we are getting close to wrapping up a busy regulatory year. 2024 will be much lighter from a rate case perspective. In our Colorado electric rate case, the commission approved our settlement that reflects a $95 million rate increase based on an ROE of 9.3% and an equity ratio of 55.7%. Rates were effective in September. \n In October, the New Mexico Commission approved our electric rate case settlement. That reflects a rate increase of $33 million, based on an ROE of 9.5%, an equity ratio of 54.7%, a forward test year an acceleration of total depreciation to 2028. Rates were effective in October. \n In our pending Texas electric rate case, we reached a settlement in principle on revenue requirements. We're hopeful the parties will reach agreement on class cost allocation and rate design so that we can file the settlement this year. We expect a decision in the implementation rates in the first quarter of 2024. And as a reminder, we have a relate back date to July 13. \n In New Wisconsin, we continue to work through the regulatory process for our electric and natural gas rate cases and expect the commission decision by year-end. \n With regards to future rate cases, we plan to file a natural gas rate case for Minnesota in the order and the potential Colorado natural gas rate case in the first quarter of next year. \n Updating our progress on production tax credit transferability, we recently executed 2 contracts totaling $250 million. We anticipate further PTC sales in the fourth quarter, consistent with our plan totaling $300 million to $400 million for the year. Transferability lowers the cost of our renewable energy projects for our customers and reduces near-term funding needs. \n Moving to our updated capital forecast. We've issued a robust $34 billion 5-year base capital plan with annual rate base growth of 7.6%. The base plan reflects commission approved renewable projects, including over 700 megawatts of new solar at Sherco. The base plan also reflects significant rate and resiliency investments, including our Colorado Power Pathway, transition to support our Colorado preferred plan, MISO transformer investments, as well as other system investments to maintain asset health and reliability. \n In addition, we have additional capital investment opportunities for our renewables and firm capacity associated with the Colorado preferred plan, 418 megawatts of proposed self-built solar and Solar SPS and further RFPs in NSP and SPS. We'll update our base capital plan after our various commissions complete their review and finalize their decisions regarding our proposals. \n These opportunities, if approved, could translate to $10 billion of additional investment through 2028, resulting in annual rate base growth of 10.7%. \n We've updated our base financing plan, which reflects $15 billion of debt and $2.5 billion of equity. We anticipate that any incremental capital investment would be funded by approximately 40% equity and 60% debt. It is important to recognize that we've always maintained a balanced financing strategy which includes a mix of debt and equity to fund accretive growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet and credit metrics. Maintaining solid credit ratings and  favorable access to capital markets are critical to fund our clean energy transition, deliver strong shareholder returns and keep customer bills low, especially with rising interest rates. \n Shifting to our earnings. We've updated our 2023 guidance assumptions to reflect the latest information. We're also narrowing our 2023 ongoing earnings guide range to $3.32 to $3.37 per share. We have a long history of delivering on our financial objectives and expect to continue that trend in 2023. As a result, we anticipate strong earnings in the fourth quarter that will result in achieving our earnings guidance. Key drivers include incremental revenue from the Colorado and New Mexico electric rate cases, deferral of certain O&M depreciation and interest expenses as part of the Texas electric rate case, strong O&M cost management, and better-than-expected sales growth. \n Finally, we are initiating our 2024 ongoing earnings guidance range of $3.50 to $3.60 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%. Key assumptions are detailed in our earnings release. \n With that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. We continue to execute on our clean energy plans, leveraging the benefits of the IRA to reduce cost for our customers. We proposed a game-changing preferred plan in Colorado, which results in one of the most aggressive renewable bill loads in the country. We secured DOE grants for our Heartland hydrogen hub, wildfire mitigation plants, four-man injury pilots, and transmission expansion, which will accelerate breakthrough technology and reduce risk at a lower cost for our customers. We resolved rate cases in Colorado and New Mexico, while reaching a settlement in principle in Texas. \n We're nearing our 2023 ongoing earnings guidance and continue to expect to deliver within our guidance range as we have for the past 18 years. We announced a robust, updated capital investment program and initiated 2024 guidance that provides strong, transparent rate base growth and customer value. And finally, we remain confident we continue to deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within the upper half of our 5% to 7% objective range as we lead the clean energy transition and continue to keep bills low for our customers. \n This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. \nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Nicely done. Got to say, what a set of updates quarter-over-quarter here. So maybe just to pick things up here real quickly, on the credit side, I mean, I appreciate the commentary about 60-40. Can you comment a little bit about the latest monetization policies for the credit rating agencies and thoughts about monetizing in terms of flowing tax credits through FFO? To what extent does that change or impact your financing plan at all? Just to come back to that a bit. \nBrian Van Abel: Yes. So we met with the credit rating agencies in September. And as we are sitting right now, we've included tax credit transferability in our financing plan, and we expect that they will include it in the way they look at our credit metrics. And for us, we use the income tax election method, so it will flow through our cash from operations in our financial statements. So all of that is included in our baseline as we think about it. \nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. And then separately, just as you think about the upside plan here, I mean, just incredible numbers here. I mean, and I know there's a lot of fixation here in Colorado. Can you walk through a little bit of just the timing here in some of the other jurisdictions in terms of coming to fruition, especially through 2020, it's practically around the corner. Do you want to talk a little bit about the specific timelines to getting some of that full 10 reflected in the plan here just as it goes to aligning against the full update with 4Q or beyond? \nRobert Frenzel: Yeah. Hey, Julien, it's Bob. We're really excited about the Colorado Energy Plan. It's great to see it sort of nearing conclusion and approval milestones. We've been working on this for two years. We've actually been working with the counterparties on the bids for over six months. I recognize that it might be quick timing for the external world, but we've been working with these people for a while and we're really excited about what we've done here. We've been working with stakeholders very collaboratively and the PUC over the past two years to bring this plan to life for our Colorado customers. Obviously a great wrinkle, right in the middle of it with the IRA, right? And so we've basically been able to double the renewable portfolio, have the fossil portfolio, increase our storage component dramatically.\n So we think the plan meets the policy guidelines. The process from here is relatively quick in the grand scheme of things. So we received the independent engineer's report that validated our proposal last week \u2013-- actually Monday of this week I think. We get comments \u2013-- external comments to early November. We applied to those comments late November and then we turn it over to the commission for deliberations. We think that happens in December and early next year and probably early Q1 of next year we'd expect a decision from the commission. So pretty quick given the long time frame of the process in total. \nBrian Van Abel: And Julien, a couple of the other pieces in that steel for Fuel 2.0 plan is the SPS Solar plus Storage, we should get the decision in Q2 of next year. And then we just launched in a sort of 1200 megawatt wind RFP. Bids are due in December, should get a short list in Q2 of next year on that.\n And then not in any in our steel for Fuel 2.0, but really looking forward to working with our stakeholders in SPS. Bob mentioned this in his opening remarks of our New Mexico resource plan. We'll launch an RFP in mid next year and that's 5,000 to 10,000 megawatts of potential generation resources and should get a project selection in call it early to mid-2025 for that. So nowhere in the $10 billion is a great opportunity as we look forward to transitioning to SPS's generation outage. \nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes. It's incredible, again, update. With that, though, and then given the timing early 1Q for at least a good chunk of that. I mean, 4Q could we see an update to your earnings CAGR outlook and/or any other related metrics as you get that clarity affirmed here, at least on the preponderance of it? \nBrian Van Abel: Yes, Julien, I mean, certainly we'll wait until we get through the commission approvals. But if that timing aligns, then yes, it would be fair to think through that. \nOperator: We'll now move to Nicholas Campanella coming from Barclays. \nNicholas Campanella: So a couple for me. I guess on Colorado, as you kind of layer in that to the next financing plan, and obviously, you had the 40% rule. Is equity continuing to be programmatic across the 5 years? Or does that drive more -- a larger need in the near years of the plan? \nBrian Van Abel: The way we look at it, the base capital plan pretty programmatic as we think about it, most likely in ATM with the base capital plan. When you look at the -- not just in Colorado, but the $10 billion of the Steel for Fuel 2.0 opportunities, this is really kind of the '25, '26, '27 time frame or the heavy spend. So I would look at it as that's in the time frame that would align with the spend for that incremental and additional opportunities. \nNicholas Campanella: Got it. And then one more on the Colorado plan. I just -- I know the commission is exploring some type of risk-sharing mechanism for the renewable assets. But can you just help us understand if that type of proposal is something that would tweak the plan in any way? Is it something that you're working with the commission actively on? And how could that kind of transpire through the remaining course of the year here? \nRobert Frenzel: Yes. Consistent with past practice, Nick, we would expect some forms of customer protection, capital costs or energy cost providers. We've submitted some proposals to the commission that they -- so they are purview. It will go along with their overall decision. And on the portfolio side, of course, there's always a chance to look at it, but we've looked at this sideways, back ways, front ways. I think we've put together a great plan that complements the geographic diversity in the state where the wind and solar physically come into the grid to provide high resilience and reliability from the renewable resources. And so always a chance to move it around a little bit, but we'll think the substantial changes coming from the plan. \nNicholas Campanella: And if I could just squeeze one more in. You talked about the data centers in your prepared remarks, your weather-normalized load for '24 is 2% to 3%, and that's higher than last year by 100 basis points. So just -- what are you seeing that's changing the demand profile? How are you thinking about the longer-term forecast and whether that's pressure higher in your 5% to 7%? \nBrian Van Abel: Thanks, Nick. I'll take that one. The way I think about it is -- yes. So we're starting to see a number of things in our long-term sales forecast. We updated our sales forecast for 2024, 2% to 3%. But we think over the 5 years at that 2% to 3% CAGR to hold, if not, call it conservative, given what we're seeing on the potential load from data centers. Data centers represent less than 1% of our sales right now. We see some potential where that could grow to 5% over this next 5 years. \n As I think about just next year, significant electrification happening in the oil and gas region in the Permian Basin, the Delaware Basin. We're working very closely with our large customers down there around -- it's not just -- it's not really about even more drilling. It's electrification of their pumps compressors as they hit their net zero goals in the Permian Basin and achieve the goals that the state of New Mexico has for them. \n And then also, we're starting to see an uptick in residential demand. We're starting to see penetration from the EV perspective. So overall, really great trends as we look out -- not only next year but longer term with kind of electrification and data center potential. \nRobert Frenzel: Nick, just to add on to that, this is Bob. When I think about some of the comments I made in the opening remarks, about the ability to deliver clean energy more cost effectively in our regions of the country than other parts. I think over the long term, that should absolutely accrue to our state's benefits in terms of economic development. Energy and energy-intensive resources are going to come back in onshore in the United States. We should be a very attractive destination for them as we can deliver renewable energy and clean energy much more cost effectively. We serve customers where the wind blows and the sun shines and that translates to high capacity factors and lower energy cost to our customers, which should lead to long-term economic development in our states. \nOperator: We'll now move to Durgesh Chopra coming from Evercore ISI. \nDurgesh Chopra: You guys have been sort of the leader in transferability. I mean you were kind of one of the first ones to introduce the concept and start working on it. It seems like you're making great strides here. The target for the year, if I recall this, if I have this correctly, it was increased from $200 million to $300 million to $400 million. I just wanted to see if I'm thinking about that correctly. And then what does that do to the prior point had $1.8 billion in total amount raised from transferability? What does that number look like in the current plan? \nBrian Van Abel: Yes. So you're actually thinking about it correctly. When we went into this year before the market has even fully set up, we're a little bit conservative in saying around $200 million. We've already executed 2 contracts for $250 million and working on another. So we feel very good about our $300 million to $400 million in total for the balance of the year. \n And when we think about our baseline, we've layered in the Sherco solar projects now that they've been approved. So we have a little bit over 5 -- think about it about $500 million run rate annual transfer of PTC credits. So it's about a total of $2.7 billion over our 5-year forecast from '24 to '28. \nDurgesh Chopra: That's really helpful. And then maybe just -- I didn't see this in your prepared remarks on slide deck and maybe I missed it, but just any update on the gas price risk management plan that you have to file in Colorado? I believe that's due next month. \nBrian Van Abel: Yes. So we'll file it by November 1, absolutely right. So due next week, working with the stakeholders are working on the plan, and we've seen compounded in a couple of different veins. One is this idea of the smoothing mechanism where we can reduce volatility by using our balance sheet. And so if commodity prices spike to a certain level, we would take that on our balance sheet and spread over 1, 2, 3, 4 years and get a carrying cost on it or really reduce that volatility that our customers experienced last year. So that's important because we need to maintain a good balance sheet, strong product quality to be able to use our balance sheet to help our customers out. \n The second part is really focused on what are the proposals we can make to reduce volatility and that's whether there's additional physical storage, potential for fixed physical contracts or additional financial hedging. So you see all out of par proposal here coming up next week and look forward to working with the commission and the stakeholders and helping reduce the volatility for our customers in Colorado. \nRobert Frenzel: Durgesh just to add on to that, one of the best things we've done for our customers is our renewables portfolio. We have lowered our reliability on fossil fuels dramatically over the past five years and the customers have accrued over $4 billion of fuel savings and tax benefits from that since 2017.\n So as we continue to look forward obviously the Colorado Energy Plan our Upper Midwest Energy plans certainly derisk our customers from a commodity volatility on the electric side. And as we lean into clean fuels, you start to see that on the gas LDC side as well. \nBrian Van Abel: And just to clarify, we meant that we've reduced our reliance on fossil fuels, not the reliability of our fossil fuels. \nOperator: We'll now move to Carly Davenport of Goldman Sachs. \nCarly Davenport: Maybe just a quick follow-up on your comments just then on tax credit transferability, the color that you've done already kind of $250 million of contracts. Can you just talk a bit about kind of how the market's been evolving relative to your initial expectations and how you kind of think about the competitiveness of that space? \nBrian Van Abel: Carly, thanks for the question. So it's evolved pretty close to how we expected it to this year, bilateral transactions in kind of the pricing we anticipated. There has been significant amount of demand. The demand is much, much greater than our supply of PTCs. Now we're still waiting for a little -- for the treasury staying up their portal and additional administrative requirements. So we feel comfortable executing contracts. \n I think also what we found and this is the strength of us, as we are a major player in this market. We have a great tax department. And with our balance sheet strength and our credit quality, we have no issue with identifying these credits, which makes it really easy to do business with us.\n And as a certain evolve, we're getting in the longer-term discussions is not just a 2023 or 2024 transaction, but hey, let's look at longer-term multiple years signing up a single counterparty. So we're very pleased with how it's developed, and the amount of interest from their counterparties there. And for us it's great. We have almost 20 Fortune 500 companies in our backyard in Minneapolis in Minnesota. So, it is great to have those relationships at the C-suite level to drive some of these. \nCarly Davenport: Got it. That's super helpful. And then maybe to follow up just on the Hydrogen Hub process now that that's been awarded, I guess, how should we be thinking about timeline there? And is there any dependence on that investment cadence going forward on kind of how the tax credit structure looks for hydrogen once we get that from the treasury? \nRobert Frenzel: Sure. So Carly, it's Bob. We're really excited about our clean fuels program, but it is fairly long dated. We are at a place where we are invited to negotiate with the DOE on this upper Midwest Hydrogen Heartland hub. Negotiations, final engineering, those processes are going to take probably 2 years. I wouldn't say we'd start capital deployment until probably the end of our 5-year plan and runs through the end of the decade. I would think that parts of the hub could be activated by 2029 -- 2028, 2029. So it's long-dated investment cycle. \n It's a $5 billion project. About half of that was attributable to projects that we proposed. So about $2 billion of company capital paired with $0.5 billion of federal money, is sort of how I think about it. None of that is in our financial plan, and that's about the timeline it's going to go on. So we'll still work on -- that does not include any investments also that we would look at some of the projects in Colorado were really attractive as part of our hub application there. We still want to work with the federal offices and our state partners, to see if we can advance some of those projects as well. Again, none of that's in our base case or in our Steel for Fuel portfolio. \nBrian Van Abel: And Carly, the second part of your question, you asked about kind of the guidance around. Obviously, we're still waiting for the guidance from Treasury unless we provided our comments, industry's driver comments. One of the things important to us is on the nuclear qualifying for hydrogen PTC. So hopeful that we get guidance here, rumor sometime in November, but it could push a little bit. \nOperator: We'll now move to Jeremy Tonet coming from JPMorgan. \nJeremy Tonet: Clearly, an incredible update in Colorado here and just wanted to dive in a little bit more, if I could. Just given the rate base growth as you outlined there, and how should we think about, I guess, the EPS growth relative to the rate base growth, given the higher interest rate environment here, thinking about potentially greater than 10% rate base growth, do you see the gap kind of widening at that point? Or how should we think about that at a high level? \nBrian Van Abel: Jeremy, good question. Obviously, we are in a higher interest rate environment, higher financing market and also have some issue equity -- equity to fund accretive growth which we're very comfortable with. It's important to maintain a strong balance sheet. And we've been very consistent about how we'll fund incremental growth. So, as you go through you do see a little bit of a divergence from rate base growth and EPS growth, but certainly, not hard to do the math, and I'm sure all of you have done that math already. \nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Yes. No, good math to do there. So that makes sense. And just wanted to kind of come in on the O&M side for the guidance there. And I think it's been kind of flat to down, if I recall correctly, but targeting a little bit of an uplift in '24 here. I'm just wondering, if you could provide a bit more color on the increase here and how this O&M, I guess, impacts how '24 guidance could fall out, particularly given Minnesota being a bit lighter than expected? \nBrian Van Abel: Yeah. We take everything that happened in this year from a regulatory perspective rate case perspective taking into account as we give 2024 guidance. When we think about O&M, we're down for this year our guidance for this year is down 1% to 2%. So as we think about next year up 1% to 2% we did some management actions in this year. And so really when I put the 2 years together it's about essentially maintaining flat O&M. It's a big focus from a long-term perspective is investing in technology to improve processes and take cost out of the business. \n We have innovation and transformation arm focused on eliminating waste and improving processes. We call it One Xcel Energy Way that we've deployed at the start of this year. And also as you go longer term we start to see tailwinds from coal plant shutdowns as we start to shut down a unit of the year almost. So next year is just a little bit of a balance in this year and next year but over flat is how I'd look at it overall. \nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That makes sense. On the other side of the coin, as it relates to the sales outlook, you talked about the data center opportunity in supporting the 2% to 3% growth. Is that kind of like the right base to think about beyond '24? Do you anticipate some further acceleration over the 5-year plan? Just trying to calvary, if like the environment is just different now given some of the tailwinds as you talked about. And clearly, as well, oil and gas, a Delaware Basin really click on all cylinders here, a lot of activity that we see on the pipeline side. So just, I guess, curious for those drivers and how that could carry out over time. \nBrian Van Abel: Yes. And I think really next year, as you mentioned, in the Permian Basin, significant growth down in SPS as we're supporting electrification and working closely with our large customers there. \n From a data center perspective and thinking about the longer-term growth, I do think right now our 5-year sales growth is -- we're projecting 2% to 3% over the 5 years. So kind of think about 2024, and that will continue over the next 5 years. And I think there's even opportunity beyond that as you start to look at what generative AI means from a load perspective and a data center perspective. \n So pretty excited. We think about -- obviously, there's investment opportunity when we think about loan growth, helping us keeping customer bills low and affordable and that's really important as we look to invest significantly into our system. \nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful. Real quick last one, if I could, just kind of rounding things out here. Any updates on the ongoing Marshall wildfire litigation? Any update on whether total liabilities we go to reach the 560 insurance coverage? Or any color you could provide there. \nRobert Frenzel: Yeah. Hey, it's Bob. I don't think we've seen a lot of material updates in Marshall, I think in our disclosures in our Q and in our earnings release are up-to-date. We've seen 675 plaintiffs. To put it in perspective we think there are about 1,100 structures that had some amount of physical damage and estimated by the by the state of Colorado at about $2 billion worth of damage. None of that's changed or been updated. The cases into 14 complaints and has been consolidated into a single case right now.\n The statute of limitation ends at the end of the year. So we think it will be pretty quiet until then maybe a couple of other plaintiffs trickle in through the process and then we'd expect to get a litigation calendar sometime in early next year. \nOperator: We'll now move to Anthony Crowdell of Mizuho. \nAnthony Crowdell: Just hopefully, easy one, everything has been answered. Great news on Colorado, but just following up on Jeremy's question. You talked about, I think, the company is going to file a wildfire mitigation plan, I believe, in 2024 in Colorado. Is there a potential for even additional CapEx associated with wildfire mitigation like magnitude, is that similar to what we've seen in the Steel for Fuel 2.0? \nRobert Frenzel: Anthony, Look, we've been operating under WMP in Colorado for the past 4 years. I think that plan was around $400 million in total. We are looking at more capital investments as we roll forward. I think a lot of that's going to be built into the base plan already. I don't think it has anything of the magnitude of Steel for Fuel 2.0. Obviously, the big needle in there would be if we did something very dramatic on undergrounding. I don't see a proposal that will move the needle necessarily in capital expenditures going forward, but something worth looking at. \nOperator: We'll now move to David Arcaro calling from Morgan Stanley. \nDavid Arcaro: I was wondering, it's clearly a step change in the renewables aspirations and opportunity for Colorado. Could this also apply to Minnesota in terms of potentially seeing an acceleration and a step change in renewables there as you fully realize the benefits of IRA going forward? \nRobert Frenzel: Maybe -- David, it's Bob. Thanks for the question. When I think about my prepared remarks, I made the comment around 15,000 to 20,000 gigawatts of -- 15,000 megawatts of generation by the end of the decade. If you think 7 of that's in Colorado, then the balance, 8 to 13 is a combination of SPS and NSP. There's very little in our capital plan, our Steel for Fuel plan that's included for those 2 regions in our capital plan or in our Steel for Fuel 2.0 that Brian laid out. \n So we have real generation upside investment opportunities. They're a little longer dated. So I think '28 to '30 maybe outside of the plan period. Some might creep into this 5 years, but I think it's really more backdated. \n But that's a substantial amount of generation in each of those two -- to those jurisdictions. We did go through a resource plan in Minnesota, the 1,200 megawatts that we referenced in terms of RP for next year as part of that program. But there's probably 4,000 to 5,000 megawatts of that is in the Upper Midwest, largely approved as part of our last resource plan that we need to go execute upon. \nBrian Van Abel: Yes. And we have -- as we mentioned we have the 1,200 megawatts of wind RFP in flight. We actually have Wisconsin RFP, solar RFP in flight that we're working on. we think we'll file another resource plan, but also significant opportunities in Minnesota longer date is around our wind repowerings.\n And the assets that we put in service in the 2018 to 2021 timeframe, we're requiring a couple of older ones that we brought forward to the commission and it's a great way to increase output and save our customers' money. And so we'll look at those as we get closer to the time period as another opportunity in terms of being able to buy savings for our customers and invest in steel in the ground. \nDavid Arcaro: Got it. That all makes sense. That's helpful to frame it up. And I was curious what's the latest that you're seeing in Renewables economics in terms of LCOE? In your service territories there's been market concerns about rising PPA prices inflationary pressures in the renewable supply chain. But just curious what your experience has been in terms of latest data points how attractive have renewables projects looked? \nRobert Frenzel: Yes, David, look, so the great benefit of the last couple of years is obviously the Inflation Reduction Act. We've definitively seen higher capital costs in wind and in solar, the IRA and the tax benefits of 100% PTCs have been able to offset that, at least in our jurisdictions on an LCOE business. So probably I'll give you some data points. I'd say we've seen probably 30 -- from our last approved wind project, which would have been our Dakota Ridge project, we built that for around 1,200, 1,250 kW, we've probably seen capital cost increases on wind or 30% to 40% on top of that. \n But the IRA has offset all of the capital cost improvements as well as NCS improvements as well as NCS improvements from better technology and the bigger turbines. Those 2 combinations have put our LCOEs on those projects in line with what we put wind into service for in 2018 and 2019. So we're really favorable participants. Our customers are great beneficiaries of the Inflation Reduction Act keep the levelized cost of energy very, very affordable for our customers. \n And when I think about -- I made the comment earlier around sort of economic development opportunities. We're putting wind in -- let's say we're putting wind in around $20, $22 a megawatt-hour. You compare that to offshore wind on the East Coast at north of $100 and we think over time lower cost energy will accrue an economic benefits to our regions of the country. \nOperator: We'll now move to Travis Miller of Morningstar. \nTravis Miller: Just a couple of quick follow-ups to some of the earlier questions in your comments. That 1% to 2% moving the sales number to 2% to 3%, what's the approximate earnings impact there incremental, all else equal? \nBrian Van Abel: Just easiest rule of thumb is I'll call it a 1% change in sales, there's about a $25 million change in the revenue from our sales. So, that's a good rule of thumb for you, Travis. \nTravis Miller: Okay. After-tax, that's earnings, right? \nBrian Van Abel: No. That was revenue -- sorry, that's revenue. And that takes into account our true-up in decoupling mechanisms. \nTravis Miller: Okay. So, pre-tax. Okay. Got it. And then on the Heartland and some of the other projects you've mentioned in terms of new technology other hydrogen projects, is your thought for us is to put that through some of those things through the regulatory traditional regulatory process? Or do you foresee potentially coming up with another financing structure another corporate structure, is something that would house some of those projects that are say unusual in a positive way obviously? \nRobert Frenzel: Hey Travis, it's Bob. Good morning. Our proposed plan would certainly put the assets into regulatory rate base here in the Upper Midwest. If you think about our proposals at the DOE, we've got green hydrogen off of wind and solar. We've got pink hydrogen off of nuclear plants and the end users are going to help partners create green fertilizers, green ammonia to green urea to fertilizer, as well as some amount of blending into our gas plants and into our LDCs with some of the output. So the expectation is they would go through a regular state process around that capital investment and those ultimate uses for the fuel. \nTravis Miller: Okay. Perfect. And then real quick, Minnesota, any update on the timing of your appeal process? \nRobert Frenzel: Yes, so sorry, thanks. We went through a reconsideration process in mid-September. I think our appeal plan would be early November. \nTravis Miller: Okay. And then about how long does that take -- would you think? \nBrian Van Abel: Sometime into next year. \nOperator: We'll now go to Ross Fowler calling from UBS. \nRoss Fowler: So Brian maybe one for you, since you guys are sort of on the leading edge of lets transferability and feel free to take us offline, if we can't do it in seven minutes. But I'm just thinking through like how do you think about the accounting? Do you record the nonmonetary assets at fair value and then book a sort of gain and loss against that when you get to cash? Or there's no FASB guideline here right if I've got it right. So how are you walking through the accounting of these source ones that you're doing? And can we get clarification from FASB or the IRS at some point about how the accounting should work? \nBrian Van Abel: Certainly, we work closely with our audit firm on this and the audit firm is working with the -- the Big Four are working together. The way we look at -- it's an income tax model election for us. And so what that means is we're going to run it through the gains and losses through income tax expense on the income statement. And so any discounts on the sales will run through that and then from a regulatory approval of regulatory mechanisms for that discount whether we'll be able to have deferral treatment of the discount with our regulatory approval. So really because this is a benefit of our customers to be able to have that regulatory deferral mechanism is helpful. And then it will run through our cash from operations. So I think income tax expense line item and then cash from operations. \nOperator: We'll now take questions from Paul Patterson calling from Glenrock Associates. \nPaul Patterson: So all my questions have been answered, except for -- and congratulations. But just on Comanche. I saw that -- can you hear me? The Comanche litigation, just was wondering with the jury [ award ] and everything, where we stand with that? Is that pretty much over? And just if you could elaborate a little bit more on that. \nBrian Van Abel: Yes. I mean it's -- we will appeal. We feel that we have a strong legal challenge against -- there's 2 items and the award is related to lost power. I mean the majority upon no liability in all the other allegations, including no word for diminution of plant value. So as Paul mentioned in the opening comments, we view it as a onetime charge, and we have a strong legal basis for challenging that $26 million of award. \nPaul Patterson: Okay. So that was what -- that charge -- that jury award was what was reflected in the third quarter results. Is that right? \nRobert Frenzel: That's correct. \nOperator: We'll now go to Ryan Levine calling from Citi. \nRyan Levine: What's your current thought on PPAs buy-ins in light of some of the tax tenability dynamics and some of the developments that you're having? \nBrian Van Abel: Ryan, it's something we have nothing in our capital plans for PPA buy-ins or PPA buyouts as we think about it. It's something that can come through the RFP processes. As we think about it, and we work closely with our developers to see if there's an opportunity. \n The way I think about the opportunities may come in, if you can buy out a wind farm and repower it, that's where we've been successful with our PPA buyouts. But we think it has an incremental very opportunistic -- call it opportunistic, hard-to-predict opportunities, and that's why we don't put anything in our capital plans. But we do work closely with our developers to see if there's opportunities from time to time. \nRyan Levine: Okay. And then regarding the -- looks like $100 million DOE grant or wildfire mitigation, that's been rewarded more recently. As you go into a lot of wildfire mitigation plan and look at more spending, is there opportunities to receive digital brands? Are you pursuing any capital to automate your plan? \nRobert Frenzel: Ryan, it's Bob. I don't know if there's more dollars in the DOE bucket in the grid resiliency program. Obviously, we're going to take these dollars and continue to do additional work. Those were discrete projects that were approved with the DOE and are earmarked across our various states. Some of which is for wildfire. Some of it is in technology development. So we're excited about partnering with the DOE. It's about 60-40 split in terms of their funding versus our capital, and our piece is embedded within our forecast. So it's not going to be a big upside in terms of capital investment opportunities. \n But as we look to the long term, on wildfire mitigation plan. We're going to work with all of our stakeholders in our various states. But the wildfire mitigation plan in Colorado should get filed late this year or early next and look to be very proactive in how we handle system hardening, new technology to bring to bear to minimize the risk of ignition for our customers in the state, obviously, protecting their assets and their help is our priority. \nBrian Van Abel: Yes. And I was in just taking a step back. We're proud of the 4 grants that we've received really focusing on how can we help lower the cost of our customers, others for new technology around and specifically on the  form long-duration battery. And not only do we get $70 million in deal refunding for that, but we also got $20 million from Breakthrough Energy Ventures. So $90 million for those 2 pilots. So really a great story and looking forward to working with our commissions on all the DOE funding that we've received so far. And certainly, we'll look for other opportunities out there. \nOperator: As we have no further audio questions. I turn it for closing remarks. I turn the call back over to CFO, Brian Van Abel. \nBrian Van Abel: Thank you all for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions. \nOperator: Thank you so much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. We wish you a very good day, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Robert Frenzel",
            "content": "Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everybody. Let's start with the quarter. We had solid results recording ongoing earnings of $1.23 per share for 2023 compared to $1.18 per share in 2022. As a result, we're narrowing our '23 ongoing earnings guidance to $3.32 to $3.37 per share. We're also initiating 2024 ongoing earnings guidance of $3.50 to $3.60 per share, which is consistent with our 5% to 7% long-term EPS growth rate. \n Consistent with past practices, we've reviewed our customer and operational needs and have updated our infrastructure plan for 2024 to 2028. This revised forecast reflects $34 billion of needed capital investment, an increase of $4.5 billion from our previous plan. \n This base infrastructure investment plan includes substantial resiliency investments in both transmission and distribution including additional upgrades required to support the Colorado Energy Plan. However, it does not include clean energy generation investments that could result from the resource plans in Colorado, Texas, New Mexico, or in the Upper Midwest. If approved by our commissions, these cost-effective clean energy generation investments could result in an additional capital need totaling $10 billion from 2024 to 2028 and dramatically reduced carbon emissions in various states. \n Xcel Energy's resource plans also demonstrate the benefits of the Inflation Reduction Act, our state's geographic advantages that enable high-capacity renewable generation and our operational expertise and commercial acumen can bring to our customers. In September, we filed our recommended plan in Colorado. This plan seeks to double the amount of renewable energy in the state, making it the largest clean energy transition ever in Colorado history and demonstrates our strong element with the state's environmental goals. \n Our proposal contemplates the shutdown or conversion of our remaining coal units replaces them with approximately 6,500 megawatts of renewable energy and battery storage and 600 megawatts of dispatchable gas resources to ensure system reliability in times of low wind or solar conditions. These amounts include 4,800 megawatts as proposed to be owned and operated by Xcel Energy for the benefit of our customers. Including the approximately $3 billion in required transmission investments to ensure deliverability and reliability, this Colorado energy plan represents nearly an $11 billion total investment by Xcel Energy. \n In addition, this portfolio also includes $10 billion in IRA savings to customers. It creates local jobs, promote economic development and provides over $2 billion in tax benefits to local communities in the coming decades. At the same time, it will reduce carbon emissions by over 80% from 2005 levels in Colorado while having expected annual rate impact of only 2.3%. This competitive portfolio provides our Colorado customers an industry-leading opportunity for a cleaner economy at a fraction of the cost most other states would incur. \n Moving to Minnesota. In September, the commission approved 350 megawatts of new renewable generation, including an additional 250 megawatts at our Sherco facility. This brings the total amount of company-built solar at Sherco to over 700 MW making it one of the largest solar facilities in the country. In October, we also issued an RFP seeking 1,200 megawatts of wind that will utilize our transmission interconnect at our retiring Sherco coal facility and we'll be issuing additional RFPs to fulfill the remainder of the approved Upper Midwest Resource Plan in 2024. \n Finally, in October, we filed a resource plan in New Mexico. Based on our filing, SPS could require additional 5,000 to 10,000 megawatts of new generation by the end of the decade to accommodate increasing demand, plant retirements, and ensure resiliency and reliability of the grid. We've already proposed 418 megawatts of company-owned solar and battery projects that are pending commission approval. We anticipate filing another RFP in 2024 and for the additional generation resources. \n Shifting to our clean energy innovation projects. The Department of Energy recently announced nearly $1.5 billion in awards to support multiple Xcel Energy affiliated projects. Starting with the Heartland Hydrogen Hub, this estimated $5 billion initiative, which includes multiple projects from Xcel Energy and others received an award of up to $925 million by the DOE. This game-changing funding will serve as a catalyst for clean hydrogen ecosystem in the Upper Midwest and the foundation of our clean fuels efforts at Xcel Energy. \n Fortunately, the Western Interstate Hydrogen Hub in Colorado, New Mexico, Wyoming and Utah were not successful in this round of DOE funding. And that said, we remain committed to working with policymakers and federal offices with the hopes that our projects can progress to advance our shared clean energy goals. \n The DOE also awarded Xcel Energy up to $70 million to support two 10-megawatt 100-hour battery pilots with Form Energy. Combined with the grants from Breakthrough Energy's Catalyst Fund, we secured up to $90 million to support these long-duration energy storage pilots, a critical asset class to ensure cost-effective, reliability in a high renewable grid. \n With respect to DOE grid resilience and innovation partnerships program, Xcel Energy was selected as part of 2 different awards. First, the DOE we awarded Xcel Energy a $100 million to support projects to mitigate the threat of wildfires and ensure resiliency of the grid through extreme weather. Projects include vegetation management, selective undergrounding, advanced infrastructure technologies, drones, and several additional resiliency projects. Xcel Energy was also partied to grid's $464 million grant to expand transmission as part of the MISO and SPP program to fund high-voltage transmission to improve interregional transfer capability, reliability, and resolve grid constraints. \n We're appreciative of the DOE support as well as many of our partners in these projects, including our state and regional transmission organizations. Funding support helps us accelerate critical carbon-free technologies, enhance safety and resiliency while keeping costs low for customers. \n Turning to our natural gas utility. In August, we filed our Clean Heat program in Colorado. This first-of-a-kind plan provides a framework, reduce greenhouse gas emissions consistent with state goals in our net zero emissions target. The Plant fast track solutions such as electrification, demand side management, clean fuels and certified natural gas. The proposed Clean Heat Plus portfolio reduces greenhouse and gas emissions by 28% by 2030, ensures customer reliability and choice while optimizing customer bill impact. We plan to file a natural gas innovation plan, a corresponding framework for our Minnesota gas utility in the fourth quarter. \n In September, Meta announced construction of a $700 million data center in Minnesota, which eventually could be one of the largest customers in the state. We continue to evaluate a number of additional data center and commercial opportunities that will further support growth and economic development in our committees. \n Finally, there are not many new material developments with the Marshall Wildfire litigation. We currently have 14 complaints with 675 plaintiffs which have been consolidated into a single case. For the past four years, Xcel Energy has been operating under a commission-approved wildfire mitigation program in Colorado. We intend to file an updated wildfire mitigation plan next year which will include a wide range of options for stakeholder consideration, including the technologies, undergrounding additional vegetation management, composite poles, selective use of covered conductor and preventative power system shutoffs.\n Let me wrap-up with just a few summary comments before I turn it over to Brian. As we look forward across the next five years and beyond, we see a future that is bright for our communities, our customers and our investors. Xcel Energy is committed to providing a clean energy economy in our regions and it will require meaningful investment to accomplish.\n For our customers, we have the potential to deploy 15,000 to 20,000 megawatts of new clean generation on our systems by 2030, dramatically lowering our emissions profile, affordably powering our customers' homes and businesses, while ensuring 99.99% reliability that they come to expect from Xcel Energy. And through leveraging the benefits of the IRA and the IIJA, we are able to accelerate deployment of renewable resources in pairing them with affordable energy storage assets and other firm dispatchable clean fuel resources to provide reliability. \n We continue to invest in and innovate our transmission and distribution systems to ensure reliability and resilience and provide for regional and interregional deliverability. We're laying the framework to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions on our natural gas system. All the while our residential customer electric and natural gas builds are amongst the lowest in the country, 28% and 14% below the national average. And given that the regions where we serve customers are the most resource rich in wind and solar, we believe that we can lead this clean energy transition for our customers more cost-effectively than almost any other company. \n With that, I'll turn it over to Brian. Yeah. Hey, Julien, it's Bob. We're really excited about the Colorado Energy Plan. It's great to see it sort of nearing conclusion and approval milestones. We've been working on this for two years. We've actually been working with the counterparties on the bids for over six months. I recognize that it might be quick timing for the external world, but we've been working with these people for a while and we're really excited about what we've done here. We've been working with stakeholders very collaboratively and the PUC over the past two years to bring this plan to life for our Colorado customers. Obviously a great wrinkle, right in the middle of it with the IRA, right? And so we've basically been able to double the renewable portfolio, have the fossil portfolio, increase our storage component dramatically.\n So we think the plan meets the policy guidelines. The process from here is relatively quick in the grand scheme of things. So we received the independent engineer's report that validated our proposal last week \u2013-- actually Monday of this week I think. We get comments \u2013-- external comments to early November. We applied to those comments late November and then we turn it over to the commission for deliberations. We think that happens in December and early next year and probably early Q1 of next year we'd expect a decision from the commission. So pretty quick given the long time frame of the process in total. Yes. Consistent with past practice, Nick, we would expect some forms of customer protection, capital costs or energy cost providers. We've submitted some proposals to the commission that they -- so they are purview. It will go along with their overall decision. And on the portfolio side, of course, there's always a chance to look at it, but we've looked at this sideways, back ways, front ways. I think we've put together a great plan that complements the geographic diversity in the state where the wind and solar physically come into the grid to provide high resilience and reliability from the renewable resources. And so always a chance to move it around a little bit, but we'll think the substantial changes coming from the plan. Nick, just to add on to that, this is Bob. When I think about some of the comments I made in the opening remarks, about the ability to deliver clean energy more cost effectively in our regions of the country than other parts. I think over the long term, that should absolutely accrue to our state's benefits in terms of economic development. Energy and energy-intensive resources are going to come back in onshore in the United States. We should be a very attractive destination for them as we can deliver renewable energy and clean energy much more cost effectively. We serve customers where the wind blows and the sun shines and that translates to high capacity factors and lower energy cost to our customers, which should lead to long-term economic development in our states. Durgesh just to add on to that, one of the best things we've done for our customers is our renewables portfolio. We have lowered our reliability on fossil fuels dramatically over the past five years and the customers have accrued over $4 billion of fuel savings and tax benefits from that since 2017.\n So as we continue to look forward obviously the Colorado Energy Plan our Upper Midwest Energy plans certainly derisk our customers from a commodity volatility on the electric side. And as we lean into clean fuels, you start to see that on the gas LDC side as well. Sure. So Carly, it's Bob. We're really excited about our clean fuels program, but it is fairly long dated. We are at a place where we are invited to negotiate with the DOE on this upper Midwest Hydrogen Heartland hub. Negotiations, final engineering, those processes are going to take probably 2 years. I wouldn't say we'd start capital deployment until probably the end of our 5-year plan and runs through the end of the decade. I would think that parts of the hub could be activated by 2029 -- 2028, 2029. So it's long-dated investment cycle. \n It's a $5 billion project. About half of that was attributable to projects that we proposed. So about $2 billion of company capital paired with $0.5 billion of federal money, is sort of how I think about it. None of that is in our financial plan, and that's about the timeline it's going to go on. So we'll still work on -- that does not include any investments also that we would look at some of the projects in Colorado were really attractive as part of our hub application there. We still want to work with the federal offices and our state partners, to see if we can advance some of those projects as well. Again, none of that's in our base case or in our Steel for Fuel portfolio. Yeah. Hey, it's Bob. I don't think we've seen a lot of material updates in Marshall, I think in our disclosures in our Q and in our earnings release are up-to-date. We've seen 675 plaintiffs. To put it in perspective we think there are about 1,100 structures that had some amount of physical damage and estimated by the by the state of Colorado at about $2 billion worth of damage. None of that's changed or been updated. The cases into 14 complaints and has been consolidated into a single case right now.\n The statute of limitation ends at the end of the year. So we think it will be pretty quiet until then maybe a couple of other plaintiffs trickle in through the process and then we'd expect to get a litigation calendar sometime in early next year. Anthony, Look, we've been operating under WMP in Colorado for the past 4 years. I think that plan was around $400 million in total. We are looking at more capital investments as we roll forward. I think a lot of that's going to be built into the base plan already. I don't think it has anything of the magnitude of Steel for Fuel 2.0. Obviously, the big needle in there would be if we did something very dramatic on undergrounding. I don't see a proposal that will move the needle necessarily in capital expenditures going forward, but something worth looking at. Maybe -- David, it's Bob. Thanks for the question. When I think about my prepared remarks, I made the comment around 15,000 to 20,000 gigawatts of -- 15,000 megawatts of generation by the end of the decade. If you think 7 of that's in Colorado, then the balance, 8 to 13 is a combination of SPS and NSP. There's very little in our capital plan, our Steel for Fuel plan that's included for those 2 regions in our capital plan or in our Steel for Fuel 2.0 that Brian laid out. \n So we have real generation upside investment opportunities. They're a little longer dated. So I think '28 to '30 maybe outside of the plan period. Some might creep into this 5 years, but I think it's really more backdated. \n But that's a substantial amount of generation in each of those two -- to those jurisdictions. We did go through a resource plan in Minnesota, the 1,200 megawatts that we referenced in terms of RP for next year as part of that program. But there's probably 4,000 to 5,000 megawatts of that is in the Upper Midwest, largely approved as part of our last resource plan that we need to go execute upon. Yes, David, look, so the great benefit of the last couple of years is obviously the Inflation Reduction Act. We've definitively seen higher capital costs in wind and in solar, the IRA and the tax benefits of 100% PTCs have been able to offset that, at least in our jurisdictions on an LCOE business. So probably I'll give you some data points. I'd say we've seen probably 30 -- from our last approved wind project, which would have been our Dakota Ridge project, we built that for around 1,200, 1,250 kW, we've probably seen capital cost increases on wind or 30% to 40% on top of that. \n But the IRA has offset all of the capital cost improvements as well as NCS improvements as well as NCS improvements from better technology and the bigger turbines. Those 2 combinations have put our LCOEs on those projects in line with what we put wind into service for in 2018 and 2019. So we're really favorable participants. Our customers are great beneficiaries of the Inflation Reduction Act keep the levelized cost of energy very, very affordable for our customers. \n And when I think about -- I made the comment earlier around sort of economic development opportunities. We're putting wind in -- let's say we're putting wind in around $20, $22 a megawatt-hour. You compare that to offshore wind on the East Coast at north of $100 and we think over time lower cost energy will accrue an economic benefits to our regions of the country. Hey Travis, it's Bob. Good morning. Our proposed plan would certainly put the assets into regulatory rate base here in the Upper Midwest. If you think about our proposals at the DOE, we've got green hydrogen off of wind and solar. We've got pink hydrogen off of nuclear plants and the end users are going to help partners create green fertilizers, green ammonia to green urea to fertilizer, as well as some amount of blending into our gas plants and into our LDCs with some of the output. So the expectation is they would go through a regular state process around that capital investment and those ultimate uses for the fuel. Yes, so sorry, thanks. We went through a reconsideration process in mid-September. I think our appeal plan would be early November. That's correct. Ryan, it's Bob. I don't know if there's more dollars in the DOE bucket in the grid resiliency program. Obviously, we're going to take these dollars and continue to do additional work. Those were discrete projects that were approved with the DOE and are earmarked across our various states. Some of which is for wildfire. Some of it is in technology development. So we're excited about partnering with the DOE. It's about 60-40 split in terms of their funding versus our capital, and our piece is embedded within our forecast. So it's not going to be a big upside in terms of capital investment opportunities. \n But as we look to the long term, on wildfire mitigation plan. We're going to work with all of our stakeholders in our various states. But the wildfire mitigation plan in Colorado should get filed late this year or early next and look to be very proactive in how we handle system hardening, new technology to bring to bear to minimize the risk of ignition for our customers in the state, obviously, protecting their assets and their help is our priority."

            "name": "Brian Van Abel",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. We had ongoing earnings of $1.23 per share for the third quarter of 2023, compared to $1.18 per share in 2022. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter included the following: Lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.03 share which reflects the impact of cost containment actions, lower effective tax rate and conservation and demand side management expenses, which increased earnings $0.03 per share. Note that these items are apparently offset in lower margins are earnings neutral. In addition, other items combined to increase earnings by $0.04 per share. \n Offsetting these positive drivers, higher interest charges, which decreased earnings by $0.03 per share, driven by rising interest rates and increased debt levels to fund capital investment and higher depreciation and amortization expense, which decreased earnings by $0.02 per share, reflecting our capital investment program. \n Turning to sales. Year-to-date weather-adjusted electric sales increased by 1.1%, largely driven by strong C&I sales. As a result, we now expect annual electric sales growth of 1% to 2% in 2023. \n Shifting to expenses. O&M decreased $25 million for the third quarter, reflecting management actions to lower costs. We now expect our annual O&M expenses to decline by 1% to 2%. \n During the third quarter, we also made progress in several regulatory proceedings and we are getting close to wrapping up a busy regulatory year. 2024 will be much lighter from a rate case perspective. In our Colorado electric rate case, the commission approved our settlement that reflects a $95 million rate increase based on an ROE of 9.3% and an equity ratio of 55.7%. Rates were effective in September. \n In October, the New Mexico Commission approved our electric rate case settlement. That reflects a rate increase of $33 million, based on an ROE of 9.5%, an equity ratio of 54.7%, a forward test year an acceleration of total depreciation to 2028. Rates were effective in October. \n In our pending Texas electric rate case, we reached a settlement in principle on revenue requirements. We're hopeful the parties will reach agreement on class cost allocation and rate design so that we can file the settlement this year. We expect a decision in the implementation rates in the first quarter of 2024. And as a reminder, we have a relate back date to July 13. \n In New Wisconsin, we continue to work through the regulatory process for our electric and natural gas rate cases and expect the commission decision by year-end. \n With regards to future rate cases, we plan to file a natural gas rate case for Minnesota in the order and the potential Colorado natural gas rate case in the first quarter of next year. \n Updating our progress on production tax credit transferability, we recently executed 2 contracts totaling $250 million. We anticipate further PTC sales in the fourth quarter, consistent with our plan totaling $300 million to $400 million for the year. Transferability lowers the cost of our renewable energy projects for our customers and reduces near-term funding needs. \n Moving to our updated capital forecast. We've issued a robust $34 billion 5-year base capital plan with annual rate base growth of 7.6%. The base plan reflects commission approved renewable projects, including over 700 megawatts of new solar at Sherco. The base plan also reflects significant rate and resiliency investments, including our Colorado Power Pathway, transition to support our Colorado preferred plan, MISO transformer investments, as well as other system investments to maintain asset health and reliability. \n In addition, we have additional capital investment opportunities for our renewables and firm capacity associated with the Colorado preferred plan, 418 megawatts of proposed self-built solar and Solar SPS and further RFPs in NSP and SPS. We'll update our base capital plan after our various commissions complete their review and finalize their decisions regarding our proposals. \n These opportunities, if approved, could translate to $10 billion of additional investment through 2028, resulting in annual rate base growth of 10.7%. \n We've updated our base financing plan, which reflects $15 billion of debt and $2.5 billion of equity. We anticipate that any incremental capital investment would be funded by approximately 40% equity and 60% debt. It is important to recognize that we've always maintained a balanced financing strategy which includes a mix of debt and equity to fund accretive growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet and credit metrics. Maintaining solid credit ratings and  favorable access to capital markets are critical to fund our clean energy transition, deliver strong shareholder returns and keep customer bills low, especially with rising interest rates. \n Shifting to our earnings. We've updated our 2023 guidance assumptions to reflect the latest information. We're also narrowing our 2023 ongoing earnings guide range to $3.32 to $3.37 per share. We have a long history of delivering on our financial objectives and expect to continue that trend in 2023. As a result, we anticipate strong earnings in the fourth quarter that will result in achieving our earnings guidance. Key drivers include incremental revenue from the Colorado and New Mexico electric rate cases, deferral of certain O&M depreciation and interest expenses as part of the Texas electric rate case, strong O&M cost management, and better-than-expected sales growth. \n Finally, we are initiating our 2024 ongoing earnings guidance range of $3.50 to $3.60 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%. Key assumptions are detailed in our earnings release. \n With that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. We continue to execute on our clean energy plans, leveraging the benefits of the IRA to reduce cost for our customers. We proposed a game-changing preferred plan in Colorado, which results in one of the most aggressive renewable bill loads in the country. We secured DOE grants for our Heartland hydrogen hub, wildfire mitigation plants, four-man injury pilots, and transmission expansion, which will accelerate breakthrough technology and reduce risk at a lower cost for our customers. We resolved rate cases in Colorado and New Mexico, while reaching a settlement in principle in Texas. \n We're nearing our 2023 ongoing earnings guidance and continue to expect to deliver within our guidance range as we have for the past 18 years. We announced a robust, updated capital investment program and initiated 2024 guidance that provides strong, transparent rate base growth and customer value. And finally, we remain confident we continue to deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within the upper half of our 5% to 7% objective range as we lead the clean energy transition and continue to keep bills low for our customers. \n This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions. Yes. So we met with the credit rating agencies in September. And as we are sitting right now, we've included tax credit transferability in our financing plan, and we expect that they will include it in the way they look at our credit metrics. And for us, we use the income tax election method, so it will flow through our cash from operations in our financial statements. So all of that is included in our baseline as we think about it. And Julien, a couple of the other pieces in that steel for Fuel 2.0 plan is the SPS Solar plus Storage, we should get the decision in Q2 of next year. And then we just launched in a sort of 1200 megawatt wind RFP. Bids are due in December, should get a short list in Q2 of next year on that.\n And then not in any in our steel for Fuel 2.0, but really looking forward to working with our stakeholders in SPS. Bob mentioned this in his opening remarks of our New Mexico resource plan. We'll launch an RFP in mid next year and that's 5,000 to 10,000 megawatts of potential generation resources and should get a project selection in call it early to mid-2025 for that. So nowhere in the $10 billion is a great opportunity as we look forward to transitioning to SPS's generation outage. Yes, Julien, I mean, certainly we'll wait until we get through the commission approvals. But if that timing aligns, then yes, it would be fair to think through that. The way we look at it, the base capital plan pretty programmatic as we think about it, most likely in ATM with the base capital plan. When you look at the -- not just in Colorado, but the $10 billion of the Steel for Fuel 2.0 opportunities, this is really kind of the '25, '26, '27 time frame or the heavy spend. So I would look at it as that's in the time frame that would align with the spend for that incremental and additional opportunities. Thanks, Nick. I'll take that one. The way I think about it is -- yes. So we're starting to see a number of things in our long-term sales forecast. We updated our sales forecast for 2024, 2% to 3%. But we think over the 5 years at that 2% to 3% CAGR to hold, if not, call it conservative, given what we're seeing on the potential load from data centers. Data centers represent less than 1% of our sales right now. We see some potential where that could grow to 5% over this next 5 years. \n As I think about just next year, significant electrification happening in the oil and gas region in the Permian Basin, the Delaware Basin. We're working very closely with our large customers down there around -- it's not just -- it's not really about even more drilling. It's electrification of their pumps compressors as they hit their net zero goals in the Permian Basin and achieve the goals that the state of New Mexico has for them. \n And then also, we're starting to see an uptick in residential demand. We're starting to see penetration from the EV perspective. So overall, really great trends as we look out -- not only next year but longer term with kind of electrification and data center potential. Yes. So you're actually thinking about it correctly. When we went into this year before the market has even fully set up, we're a little bit conservative in saying around $200 million. We've already executed 2 contracts for $250 million and working on another. So we feel very good about our $300 million to $400 million in total for the balance of the year. \n And when we think about our baseline, we've layered in the Sherco solar projects now that they've been approved. So we have a little bit over 5 -- think about it about $500 million run rate annual transfer of PTC credits. So it's about a total of $2.7 billion over our 5-year forecast from '24 to '28. Yes. So we'll file it by November 1, absolutely right. So due next week, working with the stakeholders are working on the plan, and we've seen compounded in a couple of different veins. One is this idea of the smoothing mechanism where we can reduce volatility by using our balance sheet. And so if commodity prices spike to a certain level, we would take that on our balance sheet and spread over 1, 2, 3, 4 years and get a carrying cost on it or really reduce that volatility that our customers experienced last year. So that's important because we need to maintain a good balance sheet, strong product quality to be able to use our balance sheet to help our customers out. \n The second part is really focused on what are the proposals we can make to reduce volatility and that's whether there's additional physical storage, potential for fixed physical contracts or additional financial hedging. So you see all out of par proposal here coming up next week and look forward to working with the commission and the stakeholders and helping reduce the volatility for our customers in Colorado. And just to clarify, we meant that we've reduced our reliance on fossil fuels, not the reliability of our fossil fuels. Carly, thanks for the question. So it's evolved pretty close to how we expected it to this year, bilateral transactions in kind of the pricing we anticipated. There has been significant amount of demand. The demand is much, much greater than our supply of PTCs. Now we're still waiting for a little -- for the treasury staying up their portal and additional administrative requirements. So we feel comfortable executing contracts. \n I think also what we found and this is the strength of us, as we are a major player in this market. We have a great tax department. And with our balance sheet strength and our credit quality, we have no issue with identifying these credits, which makes it really easy to do business with us.\n And as a certain evolve, we're getting in the longer-term discussions is not just a 2023 or 2024 transaction, but hey, let's look at longer-term multiple years signing up a single counterparty. So we're very pleased with how it's developed, and the amount of interest from their counterparties there. And for us it's great. We have almost 20 Fortune 500 companies in our backyard in Minneapolis in Minnesota. So, it is great to have those relationships at the C-suite level to drive some of these. And Carly, the second part of your question, you asked about kind of the guidance around. Obviously, we're still waiting for the guidance from Treasury unless we provided our comments, industry's driver comments. One of the things important to us is on the nuclear qualifying for hydrogen PTC. So hopeful that we get guidance here, rumor sometime in November, but it could push a little bit. Jeremy, good question. Obviously, we are in a higher interest rate environment, higher financing market and also have some issue equity -- equity to fund accretive growth which we're very comfortable with. It's important to maintain a strong balance sheet. And we've been very consistent about how we'll fund incremental growth. So, as you go through you do see a little bit of a divergence from rate base growth and EPS growth, but certainly, not hard to do the math, and I'm sure all of you have done that math already. Yeah. We take everything that happened in this year from a regulatory perspective rate case perspective taking into account as we give 2024 guidance. When we think about O&M, we're down for this year our guidance for this year is down 1% to 2%. So as we think about next year up 1% to 2% we did some management actions in this year. And so really when I put the 2 years together it's about essentially maintaining flat O&M. It's a big focus from a long-term perspective is investing in technology to improve processes and take cost out of the business. \n We have innovation and transformation arm focused on eliminating waste and improving processes. We call it One Xcel Energy Way that we've deployed at the start of this year. And also as you go longer term we start to see tailwinds from coal plant shutdowns as we start to shut down a unit of the year almost. So next year is just a little bit of a balance in this year and next year but over flat is how I'd look at it overall. Yes. And I think really next year, as you mentioned, in the Permian Basin, significant growth down in SPS as we're supporting electrification and working closely with our large customers there. \n From a data center perspective and thinking about the longer-term growth, I do think right now our 5-year sales growth is -- we're projecting 2% to 3% over the 5 years. So kind of think about 2024, and that will continue over the next 5 years. And I think there's even opportunity beyond that as you start to look at what generative AI means from a load perspective and a data center perspective. \n So pretty excited. We think about -- obviously, there's investment opportunity when we think about loan growth, helping us keeping customer bills low and affordable and that's really important as we look to invest significantly into our system. Yes. And we have -- as we mentioned we have the 1,200 megawatts of wind RFP in flight. We actually have Wisconsin RFP, solar RFP in flight that we're working on. we think we'll file another resource plan, but also significant opportunities in Minnesota longer date is around our wind repowerings.\n And the assets that we put in service in the 2018 to 2021 timeframe, we're requiring a couple of older ones that we brought forward to the commission and it's a great way to increase output and save our customers' money. And so we'll look at those as we get closer to the time period as another opportunity in terms of being able to buy savings for our customers and invest in steel in the ground. Just easiest rule of thumb is I'll call it a 1% change in sales, there's about a $25 million change in the revenue from our sales. So, that's a good rule of thumb for you, Travis. No. That was revenue -- sorry, that's revenue. And that takes into account our true-up in decoupling mechanisms. Sometime into next year. Certainly, we work closely with our audit firm on this and the audit firm is working with the -- the Big Four are working together. The way we look at -- it's an income tax model election for us. And so what that means is we're going to run it through the gains and losses through income tax expense on the income statement. And so any discounts on the sales will run through that and then from a regulatory approval of regulatory mechanisms for that discount whether we'll be able to have deferral treatment of the discount with our regulatory approval. So really because this is a benefit of our customers to be able to have that regulatory deferral mechanism is helpful. And then it will run through our cash from operations. So I think income tax expense line item and then cash from operations. Yes. I mean it's -- we will appeal. We feel that we have a strong legal challenge against -- there's 2 items and the award is related to lost power. I mean the majority upon no liability in all the other allegations, including no word for diminution of plant value. So as Paul mentioned in the opening comments, we view it as a onetime charge, and we have a strong legal basis for challenging that $26 million of award. Ryan, it's something we have nothing in our capital plans for PPA buy-ins or PPA buyouts as we think about it. It's something that can come through the RFP processes. As we think about it, and we work closely with our developers to see if there's an opportunity. \n The way I think about the opportunities may come in, if you can buy out a wind farm and repower it, that's where we've been successful with our PPA buyouts. But we think it has an incremental very opportunistic -- call it opportunistic, hard-to-predict opportunities, and that's why we don't put anything in our capital plans. But we do work closely with our developers to see if there's opportunities from time to time. Yes. And I was in just taking a step back. We're proud of the 4 grants that we've received really focusing on how can we help lower the cost of our customers, others for new technology around and specifically on the  form long-duration battery. And not only do we get $70 million in deal refunding for that, but we also got $20 million from Breakthrough Energy Ventures. So $90 million for those 2 pilots. So really a great story and looking forward to working with our commissions on all the DOE funding that we've received so far. And certainly, we'll look for other opportunities out there. Thank you all for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions."

        "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to Xcel Energy's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Melissa, and I will be your coordinator for today's event. Please note, this conference is being recorded and for the duration of the call, your lines will be listen-only. [Operator Instructions]. Questions will only be taken from institutional investors, reporters can contact Media Relations with inquiries and individual investors and others can reach out to Investor Relations. I will now hand you over to your host, Paul Johnson, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations to begin today's conference. Thank you.\nPaul Johnson: Good morning, and welcome Xcel Energy's 2023 Second Quarter Earnings Call. Joining me today are Bob Frenzel, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer your questions if needed. This morning, we will review our 2023 second quarter results and highlights and share recent business developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder, some of the comments during today's call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our SEC filings. Today, we will discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures. Information on the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release. And with that, I'll turn it over to Bob Frenzel.\nRobert Frenzel: Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everybody. Let's start with our results. We faced some headwinds from weather and other items in the second quarter, recording earnings of $0.52 per share for the second quarter of 2023 as compared to $0.60 per share in 2022. We've got tangible plans in place for the second half of the year to overcome the inflationary pressures as well as the impact of the lower-than-expected ROE in the Minnesota electric rate case and allow us to deliver on our 2023 guidance. But our strategic priorities are unchanged. Leading the clean energy transition, enhancing our customers' experience and keeping our customers' bills low. And we've delivered on this strategic vision across our eight states for the past decade. We invest in clean energy resources that provide both financial cost savings to our customers while transitioning to a lower carbon economy. We invest in network infrastructure to foster economic development for new businesses to provide top quartile reliability and to provide resiliency in the face of more volatile and unpredictable weather. We're also building infrastructure to accelerate clean transportation for all of our customers and exploring innovative technologies like batteries and clean fuels to enable the policy objectives and the customer desires for a lower carbon economy, and we focused on continuous improvement to operate efficiently with a lower expense burden to our customers. And as a result, we've been able to keep our operating expenses nearly flat for over the past -- for over a decade. Our customers benefit from these actions, including significant carbon reductions and residential bills that are 20% below the national average. As you can see, we have a long history of delivering on our commitments to all of our stakeholders and are confident in our ability to meet our earnings guidance again in 2023. This quarter, we made progress on our clean energy transition plans with a growing portfolio of both company-owned resources and power purchase agreements. In our NSP solicitation, we recommended an incremental 250 megawatts of self-build solar generation in a 100-megawatt power purchase agreement. This brings our total company-owned solar projects at Sherco to over 700 megawatts which will utilize the transmission rights for the first of the three retiring coal units there. In the SPS RFP, we recommended a portfolio of 418 megawatts and self-build solar projects and a 230-megawatt power purchase agreement. We're also proposing a battery storage project to one of the new self-build solar facilities. In addition, later in the quarter, we expect to file our recommended Colorado portfolio for nearly 4,000 megawatts of potential resources. And based on our interim analysis, the outcomes should be very beneficial to our customers. Across our eight-state footprint, we enjoy a geographic advantage for wind and solar resources, which enables higher capacity factors. And as a result, Xcel Energy can deliver new renewables at low and competitive prices due to a combination of high capacity factors, IRA tax benefits and the ability to reuse transmission from retiring plants, all of which provides significant benefits to our customers. enables a faster transition to a clean energy economy. Each of these RFPs would represent incremental opportunities as compared to our base capital forecast. We anticipate commission decisions on these proceedings in the second half of 2023 for Minnesota and Colorado, and in the first half of 2024 for SPS. In May, Breakthrough Energy Ventures announced a $20 million grant to support our two 10-megawatt pilot projects for Form Energy's 100-hour battery technology. In July, the Minnesota Commission unanimously approved the Form Energy pilot to be installed at our Sherco site alongside our new solar projects. We plan on filing for our second Form Energy pilot later in the quarter and are evaluating sites that could be supportive of this exciting new clean energy technology. We're also working with the Department of Energy and additional funding opportunities to further reduce the cost of these projects for our customers. In May, we filed our second transportation electrification plan in Colorado, the proposed plan, which covers the 2024 to 2026 period includes expanded solutions and rebates to support new public charging stations and charging at homes, businesses, multifamily buildings and community locations. It also proposes programs supporting electric school buses, innovation and income qualified customers. Our focus is to bring clean transportation to all customers and communities and to expeditiously assist in the build-out of quarter charging to reduce range anxiety of EZ purchasers. Next month, we plan to file our Clean Heat plant in Colorado and will follow with our natural gas innovation plan for Minnesota during the fourth quarter. These plans will be similar to our electric resource plans and provide a framework for our natural gas system to achieve our carbon reduction goals while meeting the reliability and affordability needs of our customers. Taken as a whole, these innovative projects and partnerships in electricity and clean transportation and home heating are essential for Xcel Energy to meet our sustainability goals and to continue to deliver our customers the safe, clean, reliable and affordable energy that they expect now and long into the future. In June, the Boulder County Sheriff office announced the findings of its investigation into the cause of the Marshall Fire in December of 2021. Our thoughts continue to be with the families and the communities impacted by this devastating fire, including our own employees whose homes and families were directly affected. The report states that the first Marshall Fire started as a result of an ignition on a property affiliated with an entity called the Twelve Tribes and that this ignition had nothing to do with Xcel Energy's power lines. The Sheriff's report also discusses a second ignition that started more than an hour after the first fire at a different location, which the report estimates is approximately 80 to 110 feet away from our power lines. Sheriff's report says that the most probable cause of the second ignition was PSCo's power lines, and we strongly disagree with that conclusion. Because of the pending litigation has been filed, we're not in a position to discuss the Marshall fire in more detail at this time, but we will vigorously defend ourselves and look forward to presenting our position in court. Importantly, additional information about the lawsuits and some of the relevant legal standards is included in our earnings release and our 10-Q filing, and I would direct you there. Finally, we recently released our comprehensive sustainability report. The report focuses on four core ESG pillars: Reach Net Zero responsibly; strengthen our communities; operate with integrity and to value people. It details our progress in achieving our industry-leading ESG goals as well as our priorities moving forward. Some of the key highlights include Xcel Energy has reduced our carbon emissions by 53% since 2005. And more than half of the electricity we provide to our customers comes from carbon-free resources as compared to 41% nationwide. We outperformed the industry reliability standard restoring power to 94% of customers within 24 hours during major storm events. In this past year, in addition to contributing over $10 million to local organizations through the Xcel Energy Foundation, our employees contributed $3 million and volunteered over 74,000 hours for nonprofit and community improvement projects. We're proud of our track record. It's keeping with our corporate strategy, and it's based on our values of connected, committed, trustworthy and safe. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\nBrian Van Abel: Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. We had earnings of $0.52 per share for the second quarter of 2023 compared to $0.60 per share in 2022. Please note that the line-by-line income statement comparisons are more complicated this quarter as a result of true-ups for the Minnesota rate case this year and the Texas rate case last year. Most significant earnings drivers for the quarter included the following: Lower depreciation and amortization expense increased earnings by $0.10 per share, largely due to the reversal of deferrals in the Texas rate case last year and the extension of depreciation lives from the Minnesota rate case. These decreases are partially offset by our capital investment program. Lower taxes other than income taxes increased earnings by $0.06 per share, reflecting property tax deferrals in Minnesota and Colorado. In addition, other items combined to increase earnings by $0.04 per share. Offsetting these positive drivers, lower electric revenues less fuel decreased earnings by $0.23 per share, reflecting unfavorable weather, the impact of the Minnesota rate case and recognition of revenue from the Texas rate case last year. Higher O&M expense decreased earnings by $0.02 per share and higher interest expense decreased earnings by $0.03 per share. Turning to sales. Year-to-date weather-adjusted electric sales increased by 0.6%. We continue to expect annual electric sales growth of approximately 1% in 2023, which is driven by growth in C&I sales, partially offset by projected declines in residential sales. Now shifting to the expenses. O&M expenses increased $14 million for the second quarter. This increase was primarily due to the timing of generation outages, higher bad debt expense, insurance costs and inflation, partially offset by the recognition of previously deferred costs from the Texas electric rate case in 2022. Given these drivers as well as the Minnesota rate case decision, we are taking actions to mitigate O&M, which will include evaluating discretionary programs, staffing levels, consulting, employee expenses, variable compensation and other management actions. As a result, we now expect O&M expenses to decline 3% for the year. During the second quarter, we also made progress on several regulatory proceedings. Starting with our completed proceedings. In June, Minnesota Commission approved a three-year electric rate increase of $311 million based on an ROE of 9.25%, an equity ratio of 52.5% in a forward test year. We plan to file for reconsideration of the decision as we felt the ROE was not consistent with the ALJ recommendation or recent commission decisions in other Minnesota proceedings. In our South Dakota electric rate case, the commission approved a settlement for approximately $14 million revenue increase. In our pending Colorado Electric rate case, we reached a partial settlement that reflects a $95 million rate increase based on an ROE of 9.3%, an equity ratio of 55.7%, and a 2022 historic test year. Remaining items for litigation are the structure of the TCA rider and treatment of depreciation. We expect the commission decision later this summer with rates going into effect in September. In our New Mexico electric rate case, we reached a contested settlement that reflects a rate increase of $33 million based on an ROE of 9.5%, equity ratio of 54.7% in the forecast test year. We expect the decision and implementation of final rates by October. Both the Colorado and New Mexico settlements reflect significant negotiation and compromise by Xcel Energy and a wide range of interveners with varied interests. The parties believe that the settlements resulted in a just and reasonable outcome for our customers. As a result, we are hopeful our commissions will approve the settlements without modifications. We also have pending rate cases in Wisconsin and Texas which are early in the process. Intervener testimony is expected in the Texas case in August, with a decision in the first quarter of next year, while in Wisconsin we expect intervener testimony in the Fall and a commission decision by year-end. Turning to the Inflation Reduction Act. As most of you are aware, the U.S. Treasury recently provided guidance on tax credit transferability, which was consistent with our expectations. We have considerable demand and anticipate monetizing excess tax credits later in the year. Finally, we are reaffirming our 2023 earnings guidance range of $3.30 to $3.40 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%. We've updated our key assumptions to reflect the latest information, which are detailed in our earnings release. Please note that the guidance assumption changes regarding capital riders, depreciation, property taxes and ETR primarily reflect regulatory decisions or changes to assumed PTC levels and are largely earnings neutral. However, the lower O&M and a portion of the interest expense assumptions will generally impact earnings. With that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. We continue to expect to deliver 2023 earnings within our guidance range as we have for the past 18 years, managing through regulatory outcomes, changing economic environments, and periodic headwinds. We're delivering on our capital plan and executing on opportunities including clean generation, transmission and distribution to support reliability, resiliency, and broader economic growth. And we remain confident we can continue to deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within the upper half of our 5% to 7% objective range as we support our communities and states in the clean energy transition. This concludes our prepared remarks further. Operator, we will now take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.\nRobert Frenzel: Hey, good morning, Jeremy. How are you?\nJeremy Tonet: Good, good. Thanks for having me. Just wanted to touch base with a bit on the targeted O&M reductions as you called out there for these efficiencies in 2023. I was wondering if you could peel back the onion a little bit more to see how much of this is one-time in nature versus carry forward into future years? Just any thoughts there would be helpful.\nBrian Van Abel: Sure. Hey, good morning, Jeremy and thanks for the question. So I think I'll hit on it a couple of different ways. Talk about kind of the near-term actions and we think about it. How do we hit our year-end O&M guidance? One is we look at second half of last year we had elevated O&M, if you look at versus the first half of last year, and particularly in Q4 as there was some one-time items in Q4 relative to having a good year, investing in the system. And then there are some impacts this year where we've had some timing of generation outages earlier in this year. And we also expect bad debt expense to decline. We saw some higher bad debt expense levels given the commodity price impacts earlier in this year. So as I think about that, bad debt expense level should be more sustainable. You have some timing and generation outages, but then we're also looking at a number of what I call it near-term and long-term opportunities. Near-term is what you'd call more one-time discretionary items around program spend, consulting, third-party contracts and variable compensation levers, more traditional management initiatives. But I think we're spending a lot of time on longer-term initiatives around our Innovation and Transformation team. We've invested heavily in driving what we call waste elimination and process improvements across our orgs. And then we're also investing heavily in technology. You heard me, I've talked about before something we call the Digital Operations Factory, which is focused on using AI in our operations. We started that in nuclear with our Corrective Action program. Now we're rolling that out to distribution and gas in our field operations and that's using traditional AI. We're also looking at now use cases for Gen AI. So as we look at it, our goal is to hit 3% down for the year. Longer term, our goal is to kind of keep O&M flat. And as Bob said, we've done that for nearly a decade and so we have some work to do to get there a balance of a year, but then think longer term O&M flat as we go forward.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very comprehensive, very helpful there. And so that kind of touches on, I guess, the next question I had is just with regards to, will the Minnesota order, if and it caused you revisit any embedded assumptions over the remainder of your five year plan at this point, and has these kind of O&M items, as you called out, adjusted for that?\nBrian Van Abel: No, I don't think it does. I think about our long-term assumptions and our long-term 5% to 10% earnings growth rate. We continue to expected to leverage on upper half of that long-term guidance.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. And then just at a higher level, if I could, given the growth of wildfire risk, has your mitigation strategy, I guess, evolved over time or do you have any other thoughts on that side?\nRobert Frenzel: Hey, Jeremy, it's Bob. I appreciate the question. As you know, we've been operating under -- in Colorado under a Wildfire Mitigation Plan that was instituted probably more than three years ago. And that plan is due to be refreshed in Colorado at the end of this year. And we expect to propose continuation of existing programs and new programs in Colorado that understand the volatility of weather in the west and the footprint of the Colorado company in particular. So we're still working through that. Nothing specific right now, but certainly looking at everything that we can in terms of the risk and the opportunities to strengthen our own system and make sure that we protect our communities and our customers.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Just one last one, if I could, post what we've seen in Minnesota here so far. Does your view of the relative attractiveness of Minnesota versus Xcel's wider footprint change in anyway.\nRobert Frenzel: Look I think, as I said in my opening remarks, we feel like we've run a really good utility in Minnesota and across our eight states, focusing on our customers and our communities and helping our states achieve their policy objectives around clean energy and clean transportation. And the outcome, I'll say, was disappointing for two reasons. Paul and Brian mentioned one, which was -- it was inconsistent with previous decisions in Minnesota that have been 94 to 965. But equally important, probably didn't recognize what I think Xcel Energy is a national leading utility in advancing a lot of these initiatives. Making sure we do it reliably and affordably and sustainably. We'll continue to review our investment opportunities and our programs in the state, but I think generally really confident that this is our headquarters state. We want to work proactively with the Governor and the legislature and the PUC to advance these initiatives.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful. I'll leave it there. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra of Evercore. Please go ahead.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey, good morning, team. Sorry, I was on mute.\nBrian Van Abel: Hey, Durgesh.\nRobert Frenzel: Three years later, we're still getting caught by the mute button.\nDurgesh Chopra: Okay, can you hear me now? I'm sorry.\nBrian Van Abel: Yes, great.\nDurgesh Chopra: Okay, perfect. Sorry about that, guys. Brian, I heard you mention the Minnesota rate case item. Just appeal or rehearing. Could you just give us a little bit more color there as to what the next steps are timeline?\nBrian Van Abel: Yes, the reconsideration, its -- we need to file for reconsideration 20 days after the written order, so that's coming up. And so certainly we will file for reconsideration right around ROE, around the decision on the prepaid pension asset and some other expense levels. And we're hopeful the Minnesota Commission will take that up and look at hard at our reconsideration filing, and they have 60 days once -- they have 60 days to decide. So that's the process.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. Okay, so that should be coming out shortly, and then 60 days after is a decision whether they take it up or not. That's just the Minnesota Commission?\nBrian Van Abel: Yes.\nDurgesh Chopra: Okay. Thank you. And then know you mentioned the transferability guidance was in line with your expectations. There's been a lot of discussion within the industry, investors and credit agencies on the implications to CFO -- I know you're very knowledgeable on this topic in general. So just get your thoughts there, how you're seeing this play out and implications for your credit metrics?\nBrian Van Abel: Yes, so I mean, we've spent a lot of -- I would call it an industry collaboration on how we work this through our financials. And so not only worked with a lot of our peer utilities who've also worked with the big four accounting firms. And so every renews going to be in accordance with GAAP, it's going to -- we'll take the income tax approach. It's going to flow through our income tax expense line. That will also flow through cash from operations. And so I think it's pretty straightforward. And I know there's been a lot of discussion whether it will show up in the FFO to debt metrics. So I feel pretty good about it because it absolutely will reflect economics of our underlying financials. And it is -- for us, right, it will be a reoccurring cash flow benefit as we look to monetize these tax credits. So I feel pretty good about how it will be reflected across the rating agencies and we've spent time with each of those talking them through that. And like I said, also worked closely with the big 4 accounting firms and generally approach the whole industry will take.\nDurgesh Chopra: That's very helpful. Thanks. And then maybe just to the extent you're willing to comment on this, just a little bit more pointed question on 2023 guidance. Obviously, you mentioned the history of meeting and exceeding expectations. Just with the unfavorable weather and the regulatory decision, where are you tracking and with your sort of cost efforts in place, what are you targeting? Or where are you tracking within that guidance range?\nBrian Van Abel: Yes. So sitting here today, six months of the year, right, we're tracking to midpoint of the guidance. And I'll give you a little bit more color, right? I think about it in kind of three buckets. First is execution of our -- on our O&M plans, which I talked about earlier. Second is we build additional rate case revenue that will come in the door in the second half of the year, particularly with the Colorado rate case in flight, the New Mexico rate case in flight and then there's still continued to benefit from Wisconsin last year. And then we do have expected continued sales growth in our service territories. And so those are really the three buckets that I think about it in targeting midpoint of guidance. And obviously, as we normally do in Q3, we will look at where we are in Q3, investing to tighten guidance.\nDurgesh Chopra: Very clear. Thanks so much, Brian. Appreciate the time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin- Smith of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning team. Thank you so much for the time and appreciate it. I wanted to focus on the wildfire dynamics. Obviously, a lot of sensation on this, perhaps principally coming from out of state as well. Can you elaborate a little bit? I know in the prepared remarks, you said you referred us to the 10-Q immediately here, but can you elaborate at least on your insurance levels today, your insurance programs across the states as well as how do you frame the risk here from the lawsuits that have been filed? I imagine that some of the commentary you alluded to in the Q here, but can you help frame up your understanding as well as maybe some of the differences critically from some of the out-of-state considerations that are drawn with new scrutiny?\nRobert Frenzel: Yes, hey Julien, it's Bob, and thanks for the question. And here's what I can say about Marshall right now. The Boulder County share report concluded that the Marshall Fire first ignited on the property of the Twelve Tribes and that this ignition was unrelated to our equipment. With respect to the cause of a second ignition which began an hour after the first, we strongly disagree with the conclusion of the Sheriff's report, and we will vigorously defend ourselves in court. The Sheriff's report concluded that there were no design or installation or maintenance defects or deficiencies in public services, electrical circuit in the area of the second ignition. And so regarding the litigation, there's a hearing in September where we expect to learn more about the procedural next steps, additional information on the lawsuit and the legal standards are included in our disclosures in our earnings release and in our 10-Q. Given the lawsuits, I don't think we're going to comment any further beyond those particular disclosures. I'll let Brian comment on insurance coverage, but other than that, I think we're going to stick to our disclosure statements.\nBrian Van Abel: Yes. And Julien, the insurance coverage is included in our disclosure is approximately $500 million.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. All right. Understood. And then any further commentary about the differences in context across different states, especially whether it pertains to legal recovery constructs and/or jury constructs?\nRobert Frenzel: Yes, it's all included in disclosures an entire page of disclosures in the earnings release in the Q.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: All right. Fair enough. We will leave it there. Thank you guys very much. Appreciate it.\nRobert Frenzel: Thanks, Julien.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Anthony Crowdell of Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Crowdell: Hey, good morning, Bob. Good morning, Brian. And good morning, Paul. Sorry, I didn't want to leave you out. Just hopefully two quick questions, one on Julien -- following up on Julien with the Marshall fire. Is there a timing when that resolves itself? Or you just have to let it play to the courts and you can't give any real feel of when that proceeding will wrap up and that overhang lifted?\nRobert Frenzel: As I mentioned, look, we have a September hearing where we're going to learn a lot more about the procedural schedule, and we'll know more of that.\nPaul Johnson: Yes. And Anthony, we really can't go beyond what we've already said in the disclosure. So we have to limit the questions on that.\nAnthony Crowdell: Okay. Great. And then on Slide 11, the pending settlement in Colorado. Just -- you talked about, I think an alternative rate increase $47 million, but that's dependent upon, I guess some coal plant deferrals. I'm just curious if you could talk about how the commission will they hopefully, when they approve the settlement, is that when they will address how they handle the coal plant deferrals? Or does that get rolled into a separate proceeding?\nRobert Frenzel: No. Anthony, that will all be decided within the rate case decision that the commission will make here in Q3. So they deliver -- they had hearings on it in July, and so it's all part of the record. So it's kind of either the $95 million one or the alternative if you defer some additional depreciation is $47 million. And that $48 million difference is just the deferral of depreciation. So all will be decided.\nBrian Van Abel: So it would be earnings neutral, but it would have a cash flow impact, obviously.\nAnthony Crowdell: Great, thanks. I'm good from here. Thanks again for taking the questions.\nBrian Van Abel: Yes, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sophie Karp of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nSophie Karp: Hi, good morning. And thanks for taking my questions. A lot of my questions have been answered, but maybe I can just ask a couple of questions here. So on volumes, I'm just curious if you could discuss a little bit what drive the volume variability here like aside from weather -- it seems like C&I volumes were equally or closed equally weak as well as residential. So what are some puts and takes that drive it, I guess, year-over-year?\nBrian Van Abel: Sophie, yes, if I think about sales and really looking at the weather normalized sales, we continue to see really strong growth on the C&I side out of SPS and in Q2 on a weather normalized basis. We had strength in Minnesota and Wisconsin to Colorado on a year-to-date basis on C&I. There is a large manufacturing facility was down for the first quarter in the first quarter of this year in Colorado. So that had some weakness on the residential side, the residential while we're down close to 1% for the year. It's tracking in line with our forecast or expectations for the year, right? We continue to see good customer growth, but we do see continued use for customer declines as our -- we have really strong energy efficiency and DSM program. So I think overall, it is tracking both on the C&I side and on the resi side, is tracking to expectations for kind of through the first six months and for the balance of the year with our guidance on sales.\nSophie Karp: All right. And maybe I can just ask the bigger picture question here. I know you've been looking at potentially involvement in operating into 1 of your territories? Just kind of curious how you're still thinking about that and if it's been a new progress to report.\nRobert Frenzel: It's Bob. We look, we -- as a company, we certainly have a view on nuclear, both current and future. Key priority for us is preserving the existing nuclear fleet and making sure that -- there's a potential for a nuclear future for the country. We have been working with a company called NuScale on their technology. It's an SMR technology mostly helping them through the nuclear regulatory process and making sure that their applications meet the NRC guidelines and hoping to get that, that technology can get through the regulatory process. We don't have plans as a company to own or operate a SMR at this point. We really are just taking our nuclear expertise and helping with the nuclear future for that company with -- so we don't have any specific plans to announce on SMRs in specifics.\nSophie Karp: Okay, thank you. That's all from me.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Carly Davenport of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nCarly Davenport: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.\nRobert Frenzel: Hi, Carly. Welcome aboard.\nCarly Davenport: Thank you, appreciate that. Bob, you've been vocal about sort of an all of the above approach kind of on the energy transition from a technology perspective. And you talked a little bit about the grant to support the Form Energy pilot. Could you just talk a little bit about kind of how that pilot is evolving and other opportunities that might exist in that space for itself, if you think about long duration storage?\nRobert Frenzel: Yes, happy to. Look, as we think about it as a company, first utility to announce 100% carbon free. Given our geographic position, our ability to transition with wind and solar cost effectively for our customers through the end of this decade allowed us to make an interim target of an 80% carbon reduction, we feel very confident in that. But we've always been focused on we need new technology, new research, development and deployment of new technologies to achieve our 100% goal in the nation's clean energy goal One of the big pieces of that is obviously energy storage. We have a lot of lithium ion for our batteries around the country, and we have some on our own systems. The long-duration energy storage is a critical part of the energy future. And so the Form Energy battery is a 100-megawatt hour battery. So instead of 4 hours, it's 4 days. And that's a nice asset class as we think about periods when the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine. And we've seen evidence of that as recently as early June of this year. In the Southwest, where we had very limited wind production. We've seen it in polar vortexes, where in Winter Storm Uri, where we had no wind production for almost a 3-day period. So this idea of a long-duration battery is really interesting. What's exciting about Form, in particular, it's a pretty old technology really. This was found by the Department of Energy almost 60 years ago. But it's becoming commercializable by a new company, Form Energy and they're a breakthrough energy VC-funded company, an Energy Impact Partners-funded company. And the technology is pretty interesting. I want to call it simple because that would minimize the impact and the efforts of the development team and the founders of that company but it's basically resting and de rusting iron. And the great part about that is iron is readily available. It's domestically available, not subject to counter parties and regimes in the world where we have challenges. And so when I think about new technologies, sometimes it's not the best that wins, it's the one that's most commercializable and the 1 that can deploy the fastest. And I was really proud to be in West Virginia last month and breaking ground with the Form Energy team with Secretary Grand Home and Sender Mansion. We're building an 800-megawatt capable factory in West Virginia as we speak, with low guarantees and grants from the government. So this is a technology that's going to come to fruition. It's a technology that's going to be scalable. We're really pleased to be their first partner in sales of that, but it's a pilot. It's 10 megawatts and we're going to put it on a 9,000 megawatt system. So we have a great opportunity to build it with them and invest alongside and then the breakthrough energy grants and the potential DOE grants buy down that cost and buy down that risk for the company. So very exciting technology, really excited about the future, what this can mean.\nPaul Johnson: And Carly, I would just add, we have another pilot in Colorado [indiscernible], which is a liquid metal technology that we'll have online in 2024. That's a to duration, so kind of call it mid duration. So we're spending a lot of time on this new technology. And I think also longer term, if we kind of broaden the definition of energy storage, green hydrogen is a form of energy storage as we think about longer term, be able to store and then burn it through some of our firm to stash all units longer term. So we're pretty excited about a lot of you call it new technologies and glad really happy to see how excited our Minnesota commission is on form energy with the unanimous approval of that project.\nCarly Davenport: Awesome. I appreciate those perspectives. And then the follow-up just around earnings guidance, and obviously, you're reiterating the guidance for 2020. I just wanted to check in on temperature on the 5% to 7% long-term guidance. As you kind of think about the incremental spending opportunities from a CapEx perspective along with some of the regulatory outcomes that you've seen kind of how are you thinking about that long-term range?\nBrian Van Abel: Yes, Carly, good question. And we fully expect to continue delivering in the upper half of our 5% to 7% long-term guidance. So that's unchanged. I think you mentioned the incremental opportunities that we have. And I think in Bob's comments, he mentioned the Sherco Solar free Farm, the SPS, the 418 megawatts of solar farms that are going to provide significant customer benefits in SPS. We filed that CCN yesterday. So those 2 together are north of $1 billion of clean energy investments that will benefit our customers that are outside of our current capital plan. And I think longer term, right, we'll file here in Q3 or preferred plan or with the Colorado Commission around our RFP going into that, those decided pre IRA with the commission ruled on that resource spend before we could layer on the significant benefits significant customer benefits of the IRA. So when we look at how the costs are coming in relative to what was approved, we believe we will go bigger and faster and above what the initial 4,000 megawatts of renewables in stored showed. So we're excited to work with our Colorado Commission on that, look for that filing in Q3 and hopefully give a decision then even more longer term in the next 18 to 24 months, we'll be filing more RFPs in Minnesota, Colorado and SPS for further significant additions of clean energy assets as we march towards a 0 by 2030 goal. So I'm pretty excited about it, pretty excited about long-term opportunities, and we do feel good about delivering in the upper half of our long-term guidance range.\nCarly Davenport: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nSteven Fleishman: Yes, hi. Good morning. Good to have all of you. On the phone including Paul. Just first, one Marshall fire question. Is there a deadline when any claims need to be filed by?\nRobert Frenzel: Yes. Steve, it's Bob. My understanding is that claims are a 2-year deadline. So that would say the end of this year is when claims need to be filed.\nSteven Fleishman: Okay. Second question, a different topic on the Colorado settlement. Is there -- I know I think you mentioned Q3 for the final order. Is there a specific date for that approval?\nPaul Johnson: There's not a date, Steve, but we expect that the commissioner rule probably in the middle of August, whole deliberations in the middle of August.\nSteven Fleishman: Okay. And then lastly, just I know you all have been pretty focused on a number of IRA provisions, including the hydrogen one. And I'm just kind of curious latest thoughts on the ability to look at hydrogen production green hydrogen, all those kind of pillars of the green hydrogen, when do you think you'll get -- we'll get that out and whether nuclear might be included in that or this additionality going to be a problem for that?\nRobert Frenzel: Yes, Steve, it's Bob. Thanks for the question. We've been very active in clean fuels in general and hydrogen in particular. Look, philosophically, we believe that we're going to undergo a large period of electrification over the next 10 or 20 years as a country and as a company, but that there are parts of the economy that are going to be difficult or expensive or even in some cases, impossible to electrify. And therefore, we feel like we need a clean molecule to help in those areas. And today, that's natural gas. But tomorrow, most promising molecule that we see is a green hydrogen molecule. And this looks like it's an opportunity for the company. It's another version of fuel for fuel at some level. set of government supportive of it. The states are supportive of it. And we've got two hydrogen hub applications. One in the Rocky Mountain region with MOUs from four states two of which we serve Colorado and New Mexico as well as Utah and Wyoming. And then here in the upper Midwest, five-state MOU, again, two of which three of it that we serve, Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota and Montana. And we're in front of the DOE, those have progressed through the process, and we expect to know by the end of the year, whether we're going to get duly loan -- grants for hydrogen. And I think you're aware of some of the challenges around what qualifies for a tax credit in hydrogen land. And I think there's sort of three areas of sort of debate. And what we're trying to do is balance cost to the customer and a need to accelerate OEMs to build and take us down the technology curve of electrolyzers and balance of plant. And I think about those as location generation matching and then additionality. So with respect to location, we've been -- in all three of those on one end, we think we need flexibility in all three of those categories. On the location, we've been supporting as a company, a balancing area type location, but certainly not national, which causes real market distortions and challenges with generation nationally. Similarly on matching, I think that the pure level would say we need hourly matching, but we probably need some transition period to get to that strict hourly matching. And so we've been supportive of some period of time where maybe by the end of the decade or late this decade, we've got hourly matching, but we'll go to annually matching for some period of time. And then with additionality, again, very supportive of the additionality as a concept but areas of flexibility there. One, we would really support nuclear in regards to additionality, and we have supported pretty vocally that as well as any sort of otherwise back down energy we would support that as additionality if it came back into the grid. And so very active -- we're very active at EEI, we're very active. And I think those are generally in line with principles that both of those organizations are supporting.\nPaul Johnson: Steve, you asked about timing. The statutory deadline in August 22. And they haven't missed a statutory deadline yet, but what we're hearing is that there's still a lot of uncertainty around the position of it outlined given some of the polarizing viewpoints. So it certainly could slip into September or October.\nSteven Fleishman: Okay, that is a lot of good information. Thank you. Appreciate it.\nPaul Johnson: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Levine of Citi. Please go ahead.\nRyan Levine: Hi, everybody. In terms of the $500 million insurance, what was the cost of that insurance and when was it occurred? And then I guess, going forward, are you seeing changes in pricing for wildfire-related insurance? And what's your strategy on a go-forward basis related to insurance?\nBrian Van Abel: We haven't disclosed the cost, Ryan, and every year we renew our insurance program, and we continue to look at that. Insurance program is for everything is based on market experience for the insurance companies. And as you can imagine, it gets more challenged all the time, that's not just related to wildfire, but that's what all we have to say about insurance.\nRyan Levine: Have you already procured it in '23 for the next year? Or is that an upcoming event for the back half of the year?\nBrian Van Abel: We're still in the process.\nRyan Levine: Okay. And I guess one last question on that. I mean, so the $500 million, any associated costs with procuring it. Is that passed on to ratepayers? Or is that embedded in your O&M cost outlook?\nBrian Van Abel: It's recovered through rate cases, yes and it's included in O&M.\nRyan Levine: It's included in...\nBrian Van Abel: It's included in O&M expense.\nRyan Levine: Okay, appreciate the color. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. As we have no further questions in the queue, I will turn the call back over to CFO, Brian Van Abel for closing remarks.\nBrian Van Abel: Thank you all for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up. Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Robert Frenzel",
            "content": "Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everybody. Let's start with our results. We faced some headwinds from weather and other items in the second quarter, recording earnings of $0.52 per share for the second quarter of 2023 as compared to $0.60 per share in 2022. We've got tangible plans in place for the second half of the year to overcome the inflationary pressures as well as the impact of the lower-than-expected ROE in the Minnesota electric rate case and allow us to deliver on our 2023 guidance. But our strategic priorities are unchanged. Leading the clean energy transition, enhancing our customers' experience and keeping our customers' bills low. And we've delivered on this strategic vision across our eight states for the past decade. We invest in clean energy resources that provide both financial cost savings to our customers while transitioning to a lower carbon economy. We invest in network infrastructure to foster economic development for new businesses to provide top quartile reliability and to provide resiliency in the face of more volatile and unpredictable weather. We're also building infrastructure to accelerate clean transportation for all of our customers and exploring innovative technologies like batteries and clean fuels to enable the policy objectives and the customer desires for a lower carbon economy, and we focused on continuous improvement to operate efficiently with a lower expense burden to our customers. And as a result, we've been able to keep our operating expenses nearly flat for over the past -- for over a decade. Our customers benefit from these actions, including significant carbon reductions and residential bills that are 20% below the national average. As you can see, we have a long history of delivering on our commitments to all of our stakeholders and are confident in our ability to meet our earnings guidance again in 2023. This quarter, we made progress on our clean energy transition plans with a growing portfolio of both company-owned resources and power purchase agreements. In our NSP solicitation, we recommended an incremental 250 megawatts of self-build solar generation in a 100-megawatt power purchase agreement. This brings our total company-owned solar projects at Sherco to over 700 megawatts which will utilize the transmission rights for the first of the three retiring coal units there. In the SPS RFP, we recommended a portfolio of 418 megawatts and self-build solar projects and a 230-megawatt power purchase agreement. We're also proposing a battery storage project to one of the new self-build solar facilities. In addition, later in the quarter, we expect to file our recommended Colorado portfolio for nearly 4,000 megawatts of potential resources. And based on our interim analysis, the outcomes should be very beneficial to our customers. Across our eight-state footprint, we enjoy a geographic advantage for wind and solar resources, which enables higher capacity factors. And as a result, Xcel Energy can deliver new renewables at low and competitive prices due to a combination of high capacity factors, IRA tax benefits and the ability to reuse transmission from retiring plants, all of which provides significant benefits to our customers. enables a faster transition to a clean energy economy. Each of these RFPs would represent incremental opportunities as compared to our base capital forecast. We anticipate commission decisions on these proceedings in the second half of 2023 for Minnesota and Colorado, and in the first half of 2024 for SPS. In May, Breakthrough Energy Ventures announced a $20 million grant to support our two 10-megawatt pilot projects for Form Energy's 100-hour battery technology. In July, the Minnesota Commission unanimously approved the Form Energy pilot to be installed at our Sherco site alongside our new solar projects. We plan on filing for our second Form Energy pilot later in the quarter and are evaluating sites that could be supportive of this exciting new clean energy technology. We're also working with the Department of Energy and additional funding opportunities to further reduce the cost of these projects for our customers. In May, we filed our second transportation electrification plan in Colorado, the proposed plan, which covers the 2024 to 2026 period includes expanded solutions and rebates to support new public charging stations and charging at homes, businesses, multifamily buildings and community locations. It also proposes programs supporting electric school buses, innovation and income qualified customers. Our focus is to bring clean transportation to all customers and communities and to expeditiously assist in the build-out of quarter charging to reduce range anxiety of EZ purchasers. Next month, we plan to file our Clean Heat plant in Colorado and will follow with our natural gas innovation plan for Minnesota during the fourth quarter. These plans will be similar to our electric resource plans and provide a framework for our natural gas system to achieve our carbon reduction goals while meeting the reliability and affordability needs of our customers. Taken as a whole, these innovative projects and partnerships in electricity and clean transportation and home heating are essential for Xcel Energy to meet our sustainability goals and to continue to deliver our customers the safe, clean, reliable and affordable energy that they expect now and long into the future. In June, the Boulder County Sheriff office announced the findings of its investigation into the cause of the Marshall Fire in December of 2021. Our thoughts continue to be with the families and the communities impacted by this devastating fire, including our own employees whose homes and families were directly affected. The report states that the first Marshall Fire started as a result of an ignition on a property affiliated with an entity called the Twelve Tribes and that this ignition had nothing to do with Xcel Energy's power lines. The Sheriff's report also discusses a second ignition that started more than an hour after the first fire at a different location, which the report estimates is approximately 80 to 110 feet away from our power lines. Sheriff's report says that the most probable cause of the second ignition was PSCo's power lines, and we strongly disagree with that conclusion. Because of the pending litigation has been filed, we're not in a position to discuss the Marshall fire in more detail at this time, but we will vigorously defend ourselves and look forward to presenting our position in court. Importantly, additional information about the lawsuits and some of the relevant legal standards is included in our earnings release and our 10-Q filing, and I would direct you there. Finally, we recently released our comprehensive sustainability report. The report focuses on four core ESG pillars: Reach Net Zero responsibly; strengthen our communities; operate with integrity and to value people. It details our progress in achieving our industry-leading ESG goals as well as our priorities moving forward. Some of the key highlights include Xcel Energy has reduced our carbon emissions by 53% since 2005. And more than half of the electricity we provide to our customers comes from carbon-free resources as compared to 41% nationwide. We outperformed the industry reliability standard restoring power to 94% of customers within 24 hours during major storm events. In this past year, in addition to contributing over $10 million to local organizations through the Xcel Energy Foundation, our employees contributed $3 million and volunteered over 74,000 hours for nonprofit and community improvement projects. We're proud of our track record. It's keeping with our corporate strategy, and it's based on our values of connected, committed, trustworthy and safe. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian. Hey, good morning, Jeremy. How are you? Hey, Jeremy, it's Bob. I appreciate the question. As you know, we've been operating under -- in Colorado under a Wildfire Mitigation Plan that was instituted probably more than three years ago. And that plan is due to be refreshed in Colorado at the end of this year. And we expect to propose continuation of existing programs and new programs in Colorado that understand the volatility of weather in the west and the footprint of the Colorado company in particular. So we're still working through that. Nothing specific right now, but certainly looking at everything that we can in terms of the risk and the opportunities to strengthen our own system and make sure that we protect our communities and our customers. Look I think, as I said in my opening remarks, we feel like we've run a really good utility in Minnesota and across our eight states, focusing on our customers and our communities and helping our states achieve their policy objectives around clean energy and clean transportation. And the outcome, I'll say, was disappointing for two reasons. Paul and Brian mentioned one, which was -- it was inconsistent with previous decisions in Minnesota that have been 94 to 965. But equally important, probably didn't recognize what I think Xcel Energy is a national leading utility in advancing a lot of these initiatives. Making sure we do it reliably and affordably and sustainably. We'll continue to review our investment opportunities and our programs in the state, but I think generally really confident that this is our headquarters state. We want to work proactively with the Governor and the legislature and the PUC to advance these initiatives. Three years later, we're still getting caught by the mute button. Yes, hey Julien, it's Bob, and thanks for the question. And here's what I can say about Marshall right now. The Boulder County share report concluded that the Marshall Fire first ignited on the property of the Twelve Tribes and that this ignition was unrelated to our equipment. With respect to the cause of a second ignition which began an hour after the first, we strongly disagree with the conclusion of the Sheriff's report, and we will vigorously defend ourselves in court. The Sheriff's report concluded that there were no design or installation or maintenance defects or deficiencies in public services, electrical circuit in the area of the second ignition. And so regarding the litigation, there's a hearing in September where we expect to learn more about the procedural next steps, additional information on the lawsuit and the legal standards are included in our disclosures in our earnings release and in our 10-Q. Given the lawsuits, I don't think we're going to comment any further beyond those particular disclosures. I'll let Brian comment on insurance coverage, but other than that, I think we're going to stick to our disclosure statements. Yes, it's all included in disclosures an entire page of disclosures in the earnings release in the Q. Thanks, Julien. As I mentioned, look, we have a September hearing where we're going to learn a lot more about the procedural schedule, and we'll know more of that. No. Anthony, that will all be decided within the rate case decision that the commission will make here in Q3. So they deliver -- they had hearings on it in July, and so it's all part of the record. So it's kind of either the $95 million one or the alternative if you defer some additional depreciation is $47 million. And that $48 million difference is just the deferral of depreciation. So all will be decided. It's Bob. We look, we -- as a company, we certainly have a view on nuclear, both current and future. Key priority for us is preserving the existing nuclear fleet and making sure that -- there's a potential for a nuclear future for the country. We have been working with a company called NuScale on their technology. It's an SMR technology mostly helping them through the nuclear regulatory process and making sure that their applications meet the NRC guidelines and hoping to get that, that technology can get through the regulatory process. We don't have plans as a company to own or operate a SMR at this point. We really are just taking our nuclear expertise and helping with the nuclear future for that company with -- so we don't have any specific plans to announce on SMRs in specifics. Hi, Carly. Welcome aboard. Yes, happy to. Look, as we think about it as a company, first utility to announce 100% carbon free. Given our geographic position, our ability to transition with wind and solar cost effectively for our customers through the end of this decade allowed us to make an interim target of an 80% carbon reduction, we feel very confident in that. But we've always been focused on we need new technology, new research, development and deployment of new technologies to achieve our 100% goal in the nation's clean energy goal One of the big pieces of that is obviously energy storage. We have a lot of lithium ion for our batteries around the country, and we have some on our own systems. The long-duration energy storage is a critical part of the energy future. And so the Form Energy battery is a 100-megawatt hour battery. So instead of 4 hours, it's 4 days. And that's a nice asset class as we think about periods when the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine. And we've seen evidence of that as recently as early June of this year. In the Southwest, where we had very limited wind production. We've seen it in polar vortexes, where in Winter Storm Uri, where we had no wind production for almost a 3-day period. So this idea of a long-duration battery is really interesting. What's exciting about Form, in particular, it's a pretty old technology really. This was found by the Department of Energy almost 60 years ago. But it's becoming commercializable by a new company, Form Energy and they're a breakthrough energy VC-funded company, an Energy Impact Partners-funded company. And the technology is pretty interesting. I want to call it simple because that would minimize the impact and the efforts of the development team and the founders of that company but it's basically resting and de rusting iron. And the great part about that is iron is readily available. It's domestically available, not subject to counter parties and regimes in the world where we have challenges. And so when I think about new technologies, sometimes it's not the best that wins, it's the one that's most commercializable and the 1 that can deploy the fastest. And I was really proud to be in West Virginia last month and breaking ground with the Form Energy team with Secretary Grand Home and Sender Mansion. We're building an 800-megawatt capable factory in West Virginia as we speak, with low guarantees and grants from the government. So this is a technology that's going to come to fruition. It's a technology that's going to be scalable. We're really pleased to be their first partner in sales of that, but it's a pilot. It's 10 megawatts and we're going to put it on a 9,000 megawatt system. So we have a great opportunity to build it with them and invest alongside and then the breakthrough energy grants and the potential DOE grants buy down that cost and buy down that risk for the company. So very exciting technology, really excited about the future, what this can mean. Yes. Steve, it's Bob. My understanding is that claims are a 2-year deadline. So that would say the end of this year is when claims need to be filed. Yes, Steve, it's Bob. Thanks for the question. We've been very active in clean fuels in general and hydrogen in particular. Look, philosophically, we believe that we're going to undergo a large period of electrification over the next 10 or 20 years as a country and as a company, but that there are parts of the economy that are going to be difficult or expensive or even in some cases, impossible to electrify. And therefore, we feel like we need a clean molecule to help in those areas. And today, that's natural gas. But tomorrow, most promising molecule that we see is a green hydrogen molecule. And this looks like it's an opportunity for the company. It's another version of fuel for fuel at some level. set of government supportive of it. The states are supportive of it. And we've got two hydrogen hub applications. One in the Rocky Mountain region with MOUs from four states two of which we serve Colorado and New Mexico as well as Utah and Wyoming. And then here in the upper Midwest, five-state MOU, again, two of which three of it that we serve, Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota and Montana. And we're in front of the DOE, those have progressed through the process, and we expect to know by the end of the year, whether we're going to get duly loan -- grants for hydrogen. And I think you're aware of some of the challenges around what qualifies for a tax credit in hydrogen land. And I think there's sort of three areas of sort of debate. And what we're trying to do is balance cost to the customer and a need to accelerate OEMs to build and take us down the technology curve of electrolyzers and balance of plant. And I think about those as location generation matching and then additionality. So with respect to location, we've been -- in all three of those on one end, we think we need flexibility in all three of those categories. On the location, we've been supporting as a company, a balancing area type location, but certainly not national, which causes real market distortions and challenges with generation nationally. Similarly on matching, I think that the pure level would say we need hourly matching, but we probably need some transition period to get to that strict hourly matching. And so we've been supportive of some period of time where maybe by the end of the decade or late this decade, we've got hourly matching, but we'll go to annually matching for some period of time. And then with additionality, again, very supportive of the additionality as a concept but areas of flexibility there. One, we would really support nuclear in regards to additionality, and we have supported pretty vocally that as well as any sort of otherwise back down energy we would support that as additionality if it came back into the grid. And so very active -- we're very active at EEI, we're very active. And I think those are generally in line with principles that both of those organizations are supporting."

            "name": "Brian Van Abel",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. We had earnings of $0.52 per share for the second quarter of 2023 compared to $0.60 per share in 2022. Please note that the line-by-line income statement comparisons are more complicated this quarter as a result of true-ups for the Minnesota rate case this year and the Texas rate case last year. Most significant earnings drivers for the quarter included the following: Lower depreciation and amortization expense increased earnings by $0.10 per share, largely due to the reversal of deferrals in the Texas rate case last year and the extension of depreciation lives from the Minnesota rate case. These decreases are partially offset by our capital investment program. Lower taxes other than income taxes increased earnings by $0.06 per share, reflecting property tax deferrals in Minnesota and Colorado. In addition, other items combined to increase earnings by $0.04 per share. Offsetting these positive drivers, lower electric revenues less fuel decreased earnings by $0.23 per share, reflecting unfavorable weather, the impact of the Minnesota rate case and recognition of revenue from the Texas rate case last year. Higher O&M expense decreased earnings by $0.02 per share and higher interest expense decreased earnings by $0.03 per share. Turning to sales. Year-to-date weather-adjusted electric sales increased by 0.6%. We continue to expect annual electric sales growth of approximately 1% in 2023, which is driven by growth in C&I sales, partially offset by projected declines in residential sales. Now shifting to the expenses. O&M expenses increased $14 million for the second quarter. This increase was primarily due to the timing of generation outages, higher bad debt expense, insurance costs and inflation, partially offset by the recognition of previously deferred costs from the Texas electric rate case in 2022. Given these drivers as well as the Minnesota rate case decision, we are taking actions to mitigate O&M, which will include evaluating discretionary programs, staffing levels, consulting, employee expenses, variable compensation and other management actions. As a result, we now expect O&M expenses to decline 3% for the year. During the second quarter, we also made progress on several regulatory proceedings. Starting with our completed proceedings. In June, Minnesota Commission approved a three-year electric rate increase of $311 million based on an ROE of 9.25%, an equity ratio of 52.5% in a forward test year. We plan to file for reconsideration of the decision as we felt the ROE was not consistent with the ALJ recommendation or recent commission decisions in other Minnesota proceedings. In our South Dakota electric rate case, the commission approved a settlement for approximately $14 million revenue increase. In our pending Colorado Electric rate case, we reached a partial settlement that reflects a $95 million rate increase based on an ROE of 9.3%, an equity ratio of 55.7%, and a 2022 historic test year. Remaining items for litigation are the structure of the TCA rider and treatment of depreciation. We expect the commission decision later this summer with rates going into effect in September. In our New Mexico electric rate case, we reached a contested settlement that reflects a rate increase of $33 million based on an ROE of 9.5%, equity ratio of 54.7% in the forecast test year. We expect the decision and implementation of final rates by October. Both the Colorado and New Mexico settlements reflect significant negotiation and compromise by Xcel Energy and a wide range of interveners with varied interests. The parties believe that the settlements resulted in a just and reasonable outcome for our customers. As a result, we are hopeful our commissions will approve the settlements without modifications. We also have pending rate cases in Wisconsin and Texas which are early in the process. Intervener testimony is expected in the Texas case in August, with a decision in the first quarter of next year, while in Wisconsin we expect intervener testimony in the Fall and a commission decision by year-end. Turning to the Inflation Reduction Act. As most of you are aware, the U.S. Treasury recently provided guidance on tax credit transferability, which was consistent with our expectations. We have considerable demand and anticipate monetizing excess tax credits later in the year. Finally, we are reaffirming our 2023 earnings guidance range of $3.30 to $3.40 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%. We've updated our key assumptions to reflect the latest information, which are detailed in our earnings release. Please note that the guidance assumption changes regarding capital riders, depreciation, property taxes and ETR primarily reflect regulatory decisions or changes to assumed PTC levels and are largely earnings neutral. However, the lower O&M and a portion of the interest expense assumptions will generally impact earnings. With that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. We continue to expect to deliver 2023 earnings within our guidance range as we have for the past 18 years, managing through regulatory outcomes, changing economic environments, and periodic headwinds. We're delivering on our capital plan and executing on opportunities including clean generation, transmission and distribution to support reliability, resiliency, and broader economic growth. And we remain confident we can continue to deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within the upper half of our 5% to 7% objective range as we support our communities and states in the clean energy transition. This concludes our prepared remarks further. Operator, we will now take questions. Sure. Hey, good morning, Jeremy and thanks for the question. So I think I'll hit on it a couple of different ways. Talk about kind of the near-term actions and we think about it. How do we hit our year-end O&M guidance? One is we look at second half of last year we had elevated O&M, if you look at versus the first half of last year, and particularly in Q4 as there was some one-time items in Q4 relative to having a good year, investing in the system. And then there are some impacts this year where we've had some timing of generation outages earlier in this year. And we also expect bad debt expense to decline. We saw some higher bad debt expense levels given the commodity price impacts earlier in this year. So as I think about that, bad debt expense level should be more sustainable. You have some timing and generation outages, but then we're also looking at a number of what I call it near-term and long-term opportunities. Near-term is what you'd call more one-time discretionary items around program spend, consulting, third-party contracts and variable compensation levers, more traditional management initiatives. But I think we're spending a lot of time on longer-term initiatives around our Innovation and Transformation team. We've invested heavily in driving what we call waste elimination and process improvements across our orgs. And then we're also investing heavily in technology. You heard me, I've talked about before something we call the Digital Operations Factory, which is focused on using AI in our operations. We started that in nuclear with our Corrective Action program. Now we're rolling that out to distribution and gas in our field operations and that's using traditional AI. We're also looking at now use cases for Gen AI. So as we look at it, our goal is to hit 3% down for the year. Longer term, our goal is to kind of keep O&M flat. And as Bob said, we've done that for nearly a decade and so we have some work to do to get there a balance of a year, but then think longer term O&M flat as we go forward. No, I don't think it does. I think about our long-term assumptions and our long-term 5% to 10% earnings growth rate. We continue to expected to leverage on upper half of that long-term guidance. Hey, Durgesh. Yes, great. Yes, the reconsideration, its -- we need to file for reconsideration 20 days after the written order, so that's coming up. And so certainly we will file for reconsideration right around ROE, around the decision on the prepaid pension asset and some other expense levels. And we're hopeful the Minnesota Commission will take that up and look at hard at our reconsideration filing, and they have 60 days once -- they have 60 days to decide. So that's the process. Yes. Yes, so I mean, we've spent a lot of -- I would call it an industry collaboration on how we work this through our financials. And so not only worked with a lot of our peer utilities who've also worked with the big four accounting firms. And so every renews going to be in accordance with GAAP, it's going to -- we'll take the income tax approach. It's going to flow through our income tax expense line. That will also flow through cash from operations. And so I think it's pretty straightforward. And I know there's been a lot of discussion whether it will show up in the FFO to debt metrics. So I feel pretty good about it because it absolutely will reflect economics of our underlying financials. And it is -- for us, right, it will be a reoccurring cash flow benefit as we look to monetize these tax credits. So I feel pretty good about how it will be reflected across the rating agencies and we've spent time with each of those talking them through that. And like I said, also worked closely with the big 4 accounting firms and generally approach the whole industry will take. Yes. So sitting here today, six months of the year, right, we're tracking to midpoint of the guidance. And I'll give you a little bit more color, right? I think about it in kind of three buckets. First is execution of our -- on our O&M plans, which I talked about earlier. Second is we build additional rate case revenue that will come in the door in the second half of the year, particularly with the Colorado rate case in flight, the New Mexico rate case in flight and then there's still continued to benefit from Wisconsin last year. And then we do have expected continued sales growth in our service territories. And so those are really the three buckets that I think about it in targeting midpoint of guidance. And obviously, as we normally do in Q3, we will look at where we are in Q3, investing to tighten guidance. Yes. And Julien, the insurance coverage is included in our disclosure is approximately $500 million. So it would be earnings neutral, but it would have a cash flow impact, obviously. Yes, thank you. Sophie, yes, if I think about sales and really looking at the weather normalized sales, we continue to see really strong growth on the C&I side out of SPS and in Q2 on a weather normalized basis. We had strength in Minnesota and Wisconsin to Colorado on a year-to-date basis on C&I. There is a large manufacturing facility was down for the first quarter in the first quarter of this year in Colorado. So that had some weakness on the residential side, the residential while we're down close to 1% for the year. It's tracking in line with our forecast or expectations for the year, right? We continue to see good customer growth, but we do see continued use for customer declines as our -- we have really strong energy efficiency and DSM program. So I think overall, it is tracking both on the C&I side and on the resi side, is tracking to expectations for kind of through the first six months and for the balance of the year with our guidance on sales. Yes, Carly, good question. And we fully expect to continue delivering in the upper half of our 5% to 7% long-term guidance. So that's unchanged. I think you mentioned the incremental opportunities that we have. And I think in Bob's comments, he mentioned the Sherco Solar free Farm, the SPS, the 418 megawatts of solar farms that are going to provide significant customer benefits in SPS. We filed that CCN yesterday. So those 2 together are north of $1 billion of clean energy investments that will benefit our customers that are outside of our current capital plan. And I think longer term, right, we'll file here in Q3 or preferred plan or with the Colorado Commission around our RFP going into that, those decided pre IRA with the commission ruled on that resource spend before we could layer on the significant benefits significant customer benefits of the IRA. So when we look at how the costs are coming in relative to what was approved, we believe we will go bigger and faster and above what the initial 4,000 megawatts of renewables in stored showed. So we're excited to work with our Colorado Commission on that, look for that filing in Q3 and hopefully give a decision then even more longer term in the next 18 to 24 months, we'll be filing more RFPs in Minnesota, Colorado and SPS for further significant additions of clean energy assets as we march towards a 0 by 2030 goal. So I'm pretty excited about it, pretty excited about long-term opportunities, and we do feel good about delivering in the upper half of our long-term guidance range. We haven't disclosed the cost, Ryan, and every year we renew our insurance program, and we continue to look at that. Insurance program is for everything is based on market experience for the insurance companies. And as you can imagine, it gets more challenged all the time, that's not just related to wildfire, but that's what all we have to say about insurance. We're still in the process. It's recovered through rate cases, yes and it's included in O&M. It's included in O&M expense. Thank you all for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up. Thank you."

Please note, this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I'll now hand it over to Mr. Paul Johnson, Vice President, Treasurer, and Investor Relations, to begin this conference. Please go ahead, sir.\nPaul Johnson : Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2023 First Quarter Earnings Call. Joining me today are Bob Frenzel, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer your questions if needed. This morning, we will review our '23 first quarter results and highlights and share recent business developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder, some of the comments made during today's call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our SEC filings. Today, we will discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures. Information on the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release. With that, I'll turn it over to Bob.\nBob Frenzel: Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with our first quarter results. We had another solid financial quarter, recording earnings of $0.76 per share for 2023 compared to $0.70 per share in 2022. The increase in earnings largely reflects new revenue to recover our investments in clean energy and grid systems for the benefit of our customers. Our business plan is on track for the year, and as a result, we are reaffirming our 2023 earnings guidance of $3.30 to $3.40 per share. This quarter, we continue to make progress on our industry-leading clean energy transition plans. We've received and reviewed a significant number of proposals in our pending solicitations for nearly 6,000 megawatts of new electric generation across multiple jurisdictions. We anticipate commission decisions on these various proceedings in the second half of '23 and remain confident in our ability to deliver a beneficial mix of both company-owned and third-party resources across those plans. We also continue to pursue the benefits and opportunities provided by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act to accelerate the clean energy transition. We recently submitted multiple projects to the Department of Energy for funding consideration, including the multiparty Heartland and Western Interstate Hydrogen Hub and grid resilience investments in Colorado. In addition, we recently applied for DOE and venture capital grants for our long-duration energy storage proposals in Colorado and Minnesota and believe we are well-positioned to receive some or all of our requests. Our country and our company need new technologies, like long-duration storage, like hydrogen and clean fuels to commercialize in order to realize a clean energy future. And at Xcel Energy, we are actively working to do our part for the regions and the customers that we serve. And while the promise of a clean energy future is bright, we are keenly aware of the financial challenges that some of our customers experienced this winter with a significant rise in gas prices that we saw in 2022, driven by macroeconomic and geopolitical issues. Xcel Energy is proud of our long track record of keeping customer bills amongst the lowest in the country and to transition to a cleaner energy future with bill increases below the rate of inflation. We believe that affordability, reliability and sustainability can be realized concurrently through thoughtful energy policy and excellent operations. We've taken a number of steps in recent years that have saved customers' money and reduced exposure to commodity volatility. In our electric business, Xcel Energy's nearly 4,500 megawatts of owned wind farms continue to be a leader in capacity factor performance and generated $1.1 billion of fuel-related customer benefits in 2022 and more than $3 billion since 2017. Future investments in renewable generation and clean fuels will continue to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and add further benefits to our customers. Since 2014, we've kept our operating and maintenance expenses nearly flat and well below inflation through our continuous improvement programs, which is a benefit that accrues to our customers' bills. Our numerous energy efficiency and demand management programs have saved enough energy to avoid building approximately 25 average-sized power plants. And in 2022, we disbursed a record $216 million in state and federal payment assistance funds to customers across our states, and we expect to exceed that record in 2023. Also, in partnership with Colorado Staff, Colorado Energy Office, Energy Outreach Colorado and the Utility Consumer Advocate, we proposed to the commission to increase funding to support income-qualified customers burdened by high energy costs. We expect to provide those increased benefits to our customers throughout 2023 and beyond. And with recent declines in natural gas prices, we proactively lowered our gas recovery mechanism in Colorado 4x, reducing customers' gas costs by 58%. Our customers in our other states are seeing comparable benefits. In Colorado, we've been working with stakeholders on proposed legislation regarding customer affordability, rate stability and the regulatory process. And finally, in addition to our energy efficiency programs, we are relooking at potential long-term solutions to reduce price volatility that could include physical and financial hedging, additional natural gas storage, long-term natural gas supply contracts, multiyear rate plans, natural gas cost deferrals, energy decoupling and the use of renewable energy to generate clean fuels for blending in the natural gas LDC. We are confident that if implemented, these actions can help reduce natural gas volatility in the future for our customers. As I wrap up, I'm pleased to share some of the company's recent recognition. For the tenth year in a row, we've been honored as one of the world's most admired companies by Fortune Magazine. We ranked first in social responsibility and quality of management, placing second overall amongst the most admired electric and gas companies in the country. In addition, for the fourth year in a row, Xcel Energy has been named one of the world's most ethical companies by Ethisphere, a global leader in defining and advancing the standards of ethical business practices. None of this will be possible without the commitment of our employees, contractors and our partners. And while we're proud of our track record and our accolades, we will never rest on our mission to provide our customers with safe, clean, reliable energy services at a competitive price. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\nBrian Van Abel : Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. We had another solid quarter, reporting earnings of $0.76 per share for the first quarter of 2023 compared with $0.70 per share in 2022. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter included the following: higher electric and natural gas revenues increased earnings by $0.24 per share, reflecting new revenue to recover investments in our electric and natural gas systems and clean energy infrastructure. A lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.02 per share. But keep in mind, production tax credits lowered the ETR. However, PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin and are largely earnings-neutral. In addition, other items combined to increase earnings by $0.01 per share. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation expense, which reduced earnings by $0.08 per share, reflecting our capital investment program, higher O&M expense, which decreased earnings by $0.06 per share and higher interest expense and other taxes which decreased earnings by $0.07 per share. Turning to sales. Weather-adjusted electric sales increased by 0.6% for the first 3 months of 2023. We continue to expect annual electric sales growth of approximately 1% in 2023, driven by C&I sales, while we expect residential sales to be down slightly for the year. O&M expenses increased $48 million for the first quarter. The increase was primarily due to timing differences associated with regulatory recovery mechanisms, generation outages and emergent work, inflationary pressures and investments in electric vehicle programs and other customer products. We continue to expect O&M to decrease approximately 2% in 2023 compared with last year. We've also made progress on a number of regulatory proceedings. The commission recently approved our settlement in the Minnesota natural gas rate case, which reflects a rate increase of $21 million, an ROE of 9.57%, an equity ratio of 52.5% in the decoupling mechanism and property tax tracker. In the Minnesota electric case, we received a constructive ALJ recommendation including a 9.87% ROE and a 52.5% equity ratio. We anticipate a commission decision in June and final rates implemented in the fall. During the quarter, we filed a Texas electric rate case seeking a rate increase of $158 million based on an ROE of 10.65%, an equity ratio of 54.6% in the historic test year in the early retirement of the Tolk coal plant. We anticipate a commission decision and implementation of final rates in the first quarter of 2024. Our electric rate case in Colorado is early in the process. Intervenor recommendations are due in May, and we'll see if there's a potential to reach a settlement with parties. A commission decision and implementation of final rates are expected in the fall. In our New Mexico electric rate case, intervenors filed an initial testimony. The staff recommended a forward test year with a rate increase of $37 million based on an ROE of 9.35% and an equity ratio of 54.7%. Other intervenors recommended equity ratios in the range of 45% to 54.7% and ROEs between 8.7% to 9.6%. We anticipate a decision later in the year. Finally, later this month, we'll file a rate case in Wisconsin, seeking an electric rate increase of approximately $40 million and a natural gas rate increase of approximately $9 million based on a 10.25% ROE, a 52.5% equity ratio and a 2024 future test year. We expect the commission to decide on the case before year-end with new rates in effect in January. Details on these cases are included in our earnings release. We are reaffirming our 2023 earnings guidance range of $3.30 to $3.40 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%. We've updated our key assumptions to reflect the latest information, which are detailed in our earnings release. With that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. Our customers continue to have some of the lowest bills in the country, we remain committed to keeping long-term bill growth below the rate of inflation while leading the clean energy transition and reducing customer exposure to volatility in fossil fuel prices. We continue to achieve constructive regulatory outcomes across our operating companies with progress across multiple rate cases. We have received a significant number of generation bids in response to our RFPs with additional RFPs forthcoming. We are reaffirming our 2023 earnings guidance, and we remain confident, we continue to deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within the upper half of our 5% to 7% objective range as we lead the clean energy transition. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Today's first question is coming from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Thank you, guys, for the time. Appreciate it. Look, I wanted to talk about the proposed legislation and just efforts in Colorado to address the affordability, obviously, a lot of different comments out there. Can you set a little bit of your thoughts out there as to what the key tools and mechanisms and avenues that exist out there? And then ultimately, how to address some of the recovery issues and some of the perception issues?\nBob Frenzel : Yes. Julien, good to hear your voice on a Thursday morning. So we've been -- I appreciate your question. Look, as I think about legislation in Colorado that got introduced last week, pretty late in the session. We've been very keenly aware, as I said in my prepared remarks around the impacts to our customers from the volatility in natural gas prices that occurred largely last year and the declines that we've seen this year. And we've taken a lot of steps, both on the communications side and on the price mitigation side to assist there and obviously more to do. The legislation itself as proposed, was introduced in the Senate. And with the idea that we look at both price and price volatility that we saw over the past year, really with the benefit of our customers in mind, requires the company in the PUC. And again, this is still in -- it was approved by the Senate, I believe, yesterday, and it's going to go to the house maybe today or tomorrow. But requires a company in the PUC to look at all the mechanisms that can be helpful for our customers on price and price volatility. As I think about it, I think it provides tools on both the front end and the back end of the gas procurement cycle. So think on the front end, hedging and hedging tools, thinking -- rethinking about long-term storage, physical and financial hedging and things like that on the front end of the cycle. The legislation also takes a look at the back end of the cycle in the event that there are price volatility that exceeds a forecast, then we look at mechanisms for deferrals so that it may not be felt immediately in the pocket books of our customers. And I think those mechanisms much to be determined in the regulatory process, but the legislation contemplates those mechanisms being very beneficial to mitigate the volatility that we saw over the past year. I think the third piece of the legislation looks at something we've been already working with -- proactively with the commission on, which is incentive mechanism that provides an incentive to the company to meet or beat gas price forecast and manage the volatility for our customers. Again, lots of details that have to get worked through the regulatory process. But on balance, the intention is to really protect customers from the volatility we saw over the last year with regulatory mechanisms.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: I hear you on that front. And then ultimately, as you think about this, mean just on the electric business, I mean, does this change anything in terms of procurement? Obviously, that could feed into some of those conversations. And then related on the gas side, any initial thoughts as to what this could mean from a financial perspective, maybe too early.\nBob Frenzel : Yes. Look, I think on the gas procurement side, it applied to procurement for both the electric and the gas business. More broadly speaking, it also looks at -- it asked us to do a cost causation study around gas LDC customers and how we make future long-term investments into the gas system allows for some distributed energy resources and the ability to add those to our systems maybe in a more expeditious manner. So there's some factors like that in the electric and gas, probably a little too early to say what the long-term implications on our capital forecasting are in the state, but I don't think it will be necessarily material in totality.\nBrian Van Abel: Yes. And Julien, I would just add, we\u2019re scheduled to file a clean heat plant in Colorado in August, which is really \u2013 I equate that to call it a resource planning process on the electric side. So really working through with our commission and our stakeholders is how do we do decarbonize the LDC. We have legislation with targets in 2030 and then a net zero target longer term. So we\u2019re looking forward to working with all our stakeholders about how we decarbonize our LDC, and I think that\u2019s a real opportunity as we put plans in place for a longer term.\nOperator: Our next question will be coming from Durgesh Chopra calling from Evercore ISI.\nDurgesh Chopra: Team, thanks for the update. I just wanted to -- I was going to ask you a question on Colorado, which you just answered. But just maybe can we get an update on the tax credits transferability? You have, what, $1.8 billion in the plan that is going to come from the tax credit transferability through 2027. Maybe just update us on your efforts there? And then can you remind us, I think you've disclosed this in the past, what are you assuming in terms of funds from that activity this year?\nBrian Van Abel: Durgesh, thanks for the question. Something we're very focused on, not only transferability guidance, but guidance for the other aspects of the IRA. But specific to transferability on the guidance, we expect guidance to be issued in Q2 for transferability. And for us, we're looking for a fairly straightforward guidance, right? We would call it clean, no pun intended, a clean seller of these tax credits here from wind farms that have already been in service. And so we're looking for documentation and the certification requirements, in terms of sale, registration requirements, so pretty basic stuff. So that's really what we're looking for out of the guidance from the IRS. The other aspect is we've talked to about 20 counterparties already, and there is a significant amount of interest in the purchases of our tax credits, not only this year but for a longer term. So we're pretty confident in terms of our ability to execute on this at a good price for our customers. And so I think about this, we get guidance in Q2, I would expect us to start executing in Q3. And this year, we took a pretty conservative approach. We really expected to sell about $200 million of tax credits in our financing plan. That's about of half of what we could sell this year. So -- and then we'd assume we sell the remainder of it in the year after. But that's kind of our view on transferability and I think is a great mechanism as we think about the longer-term cost of renewable projects and how we can be the most tax efficient with those tax credits.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. And then just -- how will you announce like as you sell these tax credits, is that just going to be in your back half of the year earnings calls? Or are there going to be depending on how sizable these are other sort of 8-K type announcements any...\nBrian Van Abel: No, I think we just included in our quarterly earnings calls. Obviously, there may be \u2013 depending on the counterparty, they may want to make some announcement about it if they\u2019re thinking about \u2013 how they\u2019re thinking about they\u2019re supporting the clean energy transition by other counterparties may not want to. So \u2013 but the expectation would be in our quarterly earnings calls.\nOperator: We'll now take questions from David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Arcaro: I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on what you're seeing in the RFPs that you've got outstanding right now, how Xcel is competing. And if you're seeing cost increase or decrease just in terms of inflationary pressures or if some of these project proposals are coming in at more attractive prices?\nBrian Van Abel: David, thanks for the question. So still working through the RFP processes, and I can comment on Colorado because we made a what we call a 30-day filing in Colorado that talked about the median prices that we've seen, incredible amount of interest in the projects and in the bid process. On the wind side, the median price was about $22 from an LCOE perspective. And if you think about that, that's -- if we didn't have IRA and we didn't have any tax credits that would probably be closer to $50. So a really great opportunity from a customer savings perspective with the IRA in what we're seeing. Now that's slightly above the RFP that we did 5 years ago, as you can see some inflationary pressures on CapEx. On the solar side, the median price is about $33. Now I'm giving you a median price. We have not disclosed the project portfolio that will happen in August when we make our filing and with our recommended portfolio to the commission. But overall, you think our project portfolio will come in well below those median prices that we've stated. So overall, I think we set ourselves up well with the number of bids we put in from a self-build perspective. We've been at the scheme for a long time from the wind side. And now we've proven with [Circle] solar and the price point we've delivered Circle solar that we can be very competitive. So I think, overall, we're excited about getting these RFPs. I talked about Colorado because that's the one that we've at least shared some information. Minnesota expect a filing from us here in May on the Minnesota RFP. And then on the SPS, RFP, expect a filing in Q3. So we'll give everyone kind of full transparency and visibility into the opportunities later in this year. But I would say, overall, we're pretty excited and excited to execute on some of these wind and solar and storage projects for the benefit of our customers.\nDavid Arcaro: Okay. Got it. Great. And then could you also give any more color just related to the water leak at the Monticello plant? What was the cost of the repair? Curious if you see any broader or more significant issues that popped up just in inspecting it. And then what's the status of the plant now and when it would be coming back online?\nBob Frenzel: David, it\u2019s Bob. Thanks for the question. As we think about the water leak at Monticello, the repair costs were not significant. We \u2013 as we said in our releases, we have contained the leak, repaired the pipe are in the process of removing the water from the aquifer below the plant. There was no risk to people or planet in the process. We\u2019re about halfway \u2013 close to halfway through that water removal, expect to finish it probably end of this year, early next. So not a material increase in the cost side. It\u2019s really about pumping water out of the plants. The plants planned to shut down for refueling. We do refueling at Monticello every 2 years. And I expect they probably have 2 more weeks before they finish loading fuel and restarting the plant, but it is ready to go.\nOperator: We'll now take questions from Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan.\nJeremy Tonet: Just want to pivot to Minnesota a little bit, if I could. And I didn't know if you could share any other thoughts with regards to remaining priorities out of Minnesota electric ALJ recommendation there. Are there any particular points to address in the final stages of this rate case from your perspective?\nBob Frenzel : Sure. No, look, I appreciate the question. The process really continues. Since we last got together, we filed our -- the ALJ filed their recommendations at the end of March. We certainly didn't get all that we asked for in the ALJ filing, but as litigation goes, that's not atypical for the process. We'll file some exceptions and some things that the ALJ recommended we take up in a future proceeding or have the commission take up, I wouldn't say it's terribly material on the exception side. We haven't had a general rate case since 2016, prosecuted in the state on the electric side. And so we think that the recommendation from the ALJ was pretty thoughtful for all sides of the argument. And expect the commission to look at the ALJ's recommendation as well as some of the mitigation mechanisms that we put in place as a company to mitigate the impact to customers for having been out for a long time. We shall take it up in probably early June, and we expect the decision by the end of the second quarter.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. And then just kind of pivoting towards MISO. Just as far as tranche 2 is concerned, what are you hearing there? Are there any updated thoughts from your side, what kind of -- what are current timing expectations for initial thoughts on CapEx potential there?\nBrian Van Abel: Yes. Thanks for the question, Jeremy. I think we're thinking about it right now. And obviously, this is a little bit of a moving target with MISO, but we're thinking an announcement in the first part of next year. But like I said, that has the potential to shift as we've seen. And we're expecting kind of the next tranche or tranche 2 to be as big at lease as tranche 4, potentially bigger. And as we think about it, we'd expect a similar share as we received in tranche 1. So that's where our thoughts are today. But obviously, working with MISO and the stakeholders as we move through the process.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful. Last one for me. Just didn't know if you might be able to elaborate a little bit more on the hydrogen hub now that the applications are in, just any incremental thoughts you could share with us would be great.\nBob Frenzel: It's Bob. Thanks for the question. We -- look, I think as we think about the future and the future of hydrogen, I think the country really needs as we think about decarbonization across the economy, why we need a clean molecule for some of those harder to decarbonize sectors and hydrogen appears to be the most versatile of the clean energy molecules that we've been looking at. Certainly, the Department of Energy supports that through the hydrogen hub programs and in the IIJA. So we're excited about the application process. We expect decisions by end of year, where then we would go into future proposals around the proceedings. So we have two, one in the Rocky Mountain region, one in the upper Midwest region, both are consortiums with our multiple states and both involve the goal of creating what I think about as an ecosystem of both producers and users of a clean molecule like hydrogen and whether that can then be converted into fertilizer for ag, process heat -- burning for process heat and from our perspective, blending into the distribution system and co-firing in our existing natural gas plants. So we're excited around the versatility that the molecule provides. We appreciate what Congress and DOE are doing, and we look forward to progressing our applications at the DOE this year.\nBrian Van Abel: Yes. And I\u2019ll just add a little bit of more color on the process. I think overall, there is about 80 concept papers that were submitted, and DOE encouraged 33 concept papers and all 3 of ours were encouraged. Ultimately, as Bob said, we\u2019ve moved forward with 2 because 2 were in the Rocky Mountain region. But we feel good about our, call it, multi-application hydrogen hubs and multistate hubs. So looking forward to seeing this process play out and as Bob said, awards at the end of the year, and then it\u2019s a stage process going forward after that.\nOperator: We'll now take question from Sophie Karp calling from KeyBanc.\nSophie Karp: Just a quick follow-up on the RFP process. Could you remind us if you're also bidding into those? And what do you expect your win rates to be, if any?\nBrian Van Abel: Sophie. Yes, thanks for the follow-up question. We do -- so the way we see this playing out is we have absolutely submitted our own self-bid -- self-build projects in all 3 of the RFPs, Minnesota, Colorado and SPS. And those range from solar to wind and storage and combinations of each of those and depends on the RFP. Minnesota was only a solar RFP. But we've spent probably the last 18 to 24 months, working on our self-build projects. As we know, we have a massive renewable build-out over the next decade in our territories. So -- not only do we see potentially our own self-build projects being selected, we have a good partnership with Vestas in the Colorado with their Colorado facility. And so we have some geographical advantages with having wind turbine -- wind blades being manufactured there, and we have a lot of opportunities around. We're using the interconnection of our retiring coal plants. So we feel really good. Now, publicly, we talk about targeting 50% ownership. Obviously, we think we'll be very cost competitive and would love to demonstrate to our commissions that we could do more than 50% ownership because we think we have really good projects that will show a lot of benefit to our customers. And I think this is just -- as I think about this, let me give you a little view of longer-term. I really think this is a start of steel for fuel 2.0 as we think about it. And I don't think there are many utilities can do this clean energy transition at the price point that we can because of the solar and wind resources in our backyard. And we think that's a true competitive advantage over the longer term as being able to deliver 80% to 85% clean energy in 2030 at or below inflation. So we're excited to continue to work on these RFPs. And following these RFPs, we'll do multiple more RFPs in our jurisdictions. So I'm looking forward to giving you and everyone on this call and our stakeholders further updates as we work through the process.\nSophie Karp: Perfect. And then as a follow-up, maybe on the O&M. I see that the O&M has been a drag about like $0.06 maybe in the first quarter. Just wondering if that was impacted maybe by Monticello outage and repairs to a larger degree? And how do you see the shape of the O&M through the rest of the year?\nBrian Van Abel: Yes. Thanks for the question. No, Monticello -- Monticello maybe a couple of million dollars from a repair cost perspective. So pretty immaterial relative to the quarter. As we think about it, last year, if you look at our pattern of O&M last year, it was significantly higher in the latter part of the year. Part of that is due to some regulatory deferrals that were in place of Q1 last year than unwound as we got rates in Texas. And then we also had good weather last year, so we invested in our system later in the year. So as we think about it, we're still good with our year-end guidance, and we'll continue to work on that. Now that being said, we are facing inflationary pressures and it's something that we're very focused on internally is keeping those O&M expenses down as I think is important from a customer build perspective long term. But overall, we feel good with where we are and expect to deliver on our year-end numbers as we've done for 18 years.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to [Mr. Greg Orell] of UBS.\nUnidentified Analyst: Just a clarification around the transferability. Is it sort of the legal basis that you're looking for? Getting the clarification enables you to move forward. Or is there something that you're looking for in terms of the content?\nBrian Van Abel: Not at all in terms of the content. I would call it we're looking for more administrative guidance. Now there may be other parties that are involved in tax equity partnerships or ITC, but we're looking at transferring PTCs, as I said, we're very clean from a transferability perspective. So it's more like okay, what are the registration requirements and then just our counterparties want to see the guidance too, so they know what they need to do. So nothing of our concern beyond just getting those administrative requirements out and that's why we're waiting, and we'll be ready to pull the trigger when we give that guidance.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Ryan Levine calling from Citigroup.\nRyan Levine: On New Mexico, can you give some color as to what you're seeing in that regulatory process and compared to how the processes were with the prior commission? And is there any potential for settlement or change to the Q4 guidance, given the ramp-up of the new commission staff?\nBrian Van Abel : Ryan, thanks for the question. As we think about it in New Mexico, a wide range of intervenor testimony. I think some of that from large industrials is call it par for the course. Look at the staff testimony, we think it's a good starting point, the staff testimony. I think one of the key aspects is we filed the forward test year. And I think there's support from a forward test year construct perspective, which is different from historical standards. So absolutely, just got the testimony in last Friday, have digested it, and then we'll see if there is an opportunity to work with the parties and reach a balanced and constructive outcome from a settlement perspective. If you look at the schedule we have -- hearings are June 20. And so that would be kind of from now until June 20, and it's actually a stipulation period in their native, in terms of looking at settlement opportunities. But we've been -- we've reached a settlement in our last couple of rate cases in New Mexico and certainly look forward to working with the parties on it to get a balanced outcome for our customers. The second part of your question was around guidance. This goes into effect late in the year, so relatively small impact on 2023 guidance.\nRyan Levine: Okay. But is the fourth quarter '23 decision, do you think that there's any risk to that timeline, from a regulatory timeline...\nBrian Van Abel: No. From a timeline perspective, no, I do not. In terms of it getting pushed out.\nUnidentified Company Representative: I mean, Ryan, the schedule has already moved out a month. So we think it's fine the way it is.\nRyan Levine: Okay. And then on New Mexico, what are you seeing for weather-normalized load for that region?\nBrian Van Abel: So I think overall, in SPS, if you looked at our sales is very strong sales on \u2013 particularly on the C&I side, right? We had 7% plus C&I sales quarter \u2013 year-over-year for the quarter. Resi sales were up about 3%. Now that was higher than expectations on the residential side. Commercial side was pretty much in line with what we expected. So really strong growth, and more of that growth is weighted towards New Mexico than Texas with what we\u2019re seeing in the oil patch region in the Delaware Basin. Now rigs are up about 10% year-over-year from the rig count in the 2 counties we serve, Eddy and Lee. And then we\u2019re also seeing a lot of electrification requests as the large oil and gas customers have their own carbon reduction targets hitting and they\u2019re obviously working with the state of New Mexico is how they can improve their overall carbon footprint. So really good growth there, and we\u2019re doing everything we can and working with our customers to make sure that we can support them with the distribution and transmission investments that we need to make.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Mr. Paul Patterson calling from Glenrock Associates.\nPaul Patterson: Can you hear me?\nBob Frenzel: Yes, Paul.\nPaul Patterson: So just back to the Colorado bill, I apologize if I wasn't -- if I just didn't get this but are you guys -- I mean the bill is moving pretty quickly. Are you guys -- I mean, with the amendments that were done on Tuesday, are you guys okay with it at this point? Or do you look for additional changes in it? I apologize if you guys actually addressed this earlier.\nBob Frenzel : Paul, it's Bob. I didn't comment earlier but no new concerns there. We -- the bill as it passed the Senate and the amendments that were provided make the bill workable, I think, from our perspective. We continue to watch it as it moves through the house process. But as it stands right now, I think it's something that we can work with. We think if there still leaves a lot at the commission for decision-making, and we would very much work with the CPUC and the staff to implement some of that legislation through the regulatory process.\nPaul Patterson: Okay. Great. And then given some of your management experience in California, and their sort of more novel idea of the commission -- the company's proposal to bill -- at least a part of the bill associated with income. I'm just wondering if that's something that you guys have thought about in any of your jurisdictions. But particularly Colorado given the experience in California. And just if you have sort of any feedback or any thoughts you might have about that.\nBob Frenzel: Yes. Thanks, Paul. I think you\u2019re talking about stratification of residential customers from an income perspective. I think at this point, what we do in that regard is we direct a lot of assistance through regulatory state and federal agency programs to mitigate the income-qualified customers. And that process, I think, has worked pretty well. I don\u2019t see us proposing any changes to customer stratification at this point.\nOperator: As we have no further questions, at this time, I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Brian Van Abel for any additional closing remarks. Thank you.\nBrian Van Abel: Thanks, everyone, for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions.\nOperator: Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's conference. Thanks for your attendance. You may now disconnect. Have a good day. Goodbye.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bob Frenzel",
            "content": "Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with our first quarter results. We had another solid financial quarter, recording earnings of $0.76 per share for 2023 compared to $0.70 per share in 2022. The increase in earnings largely reflects new revenue to recover our investments in clean energy and grid systems for the benefit of our customers. Our business plan is on track for the year, and as a result, we are reaffirming our 2023 earnings guidance of $3.30 to $3.40 per share. This quarter, we continue to make progress on our industry-leading clean energy transition plans. We've received and reviewed a significant number of proposals in our pending solicitations for nearly 6,000 megawatts of new electric generation across multiple jurisdictions. We anticipate commission decisions on these various proceedings in the second half of '23 and remain confident in our ability to deliver a beneficial mix of both company-owned and third-party resources across those plans. We also continue to pursue the benefits and opportunities provided by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act to accelerate the clean energy transition. We recently submitted multiple projects to the Department of Energy for funding consideration, including the multiparty Heartland and Western Interstate Hydrogen Hub and grid resilience investments in Colorado. In addition, we recently applied for DOE and venture capital grants for our long-duration energy storage proposals in Colorado and Minnesota and believe we are well-positioned to receive some or all of our requests. Our country and our company need new technologies, like long-duration storage, like hydrogen and clean fuels to commercialize in order to realize a clean energy future. And at Xcel Energy, we are actively working to do our part for the regions and the customers that we serve. And while the promise of a clean energy future is bright, we are keenly aware of the financial challenges that some of our customers experienced this winter with a significant rise in gas prices that we saw in 2022, driven by macroeconomic and geopolitical issues. Xcel Energy is proud of our long track record of keeping customer bills amongst the lowest in the country and to transition to a cleaner energy future with bill increases below the rate of inflation. We believe that affordability, reliability and sustainability can be realized concurrently through thoughtful energy policy and excellent operations. We've taken a number of steps in recent years that have saved customers' money and reduced exposure to commodity volatility. In our electric business, Xcel Energy's nearly 4,500 megawatts of owned wind farms continue to be a leader in capacity factor performance and generated $1.1 billion of fuel-related customer benefits in 2022 and more than $3 billion since 2017. Future investments in renewable generation and clean fuels will continue to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and add further benefits to our customers. Since 2014, we've kept our operating and maintenance expenses nearly flat and well below inflation through our continuous improvement programs, which is a benefit that accrues to our customers' bills. Our numerous energy efficiency and demand management programs have saved enough energy to avoid building approximately 25 average-sized power plants. And in 2022, we disbursed a record $216 million in state and federal payment assistance funds to customers across our states, and we expect to exceed that record in 2023. Also, in partnership with Colorado Staff, Colorado Energy Office, Energy Outreach Colorado and the Utility Consumer Advocate, we proposed to the commission to increase funding to support income-qualified customers burdened by high energy costs. We expect to provide those increased benefits to our customers throughout 2023 and beyond. And with recent declines in natural gas prices, we proactively lowered our gas recovery mechanism in Colorado 4x, reducing customers' gas costs by 58%. Our customers in our other states are seeing comparable benefits. In Colorado, we've been working with stakeholders on proposed legislation regarding customer affordability, rate stability and the regulatory process. And finally, in addition to our energy efficiency programs, we are relooking at potential long-term solutions to reduce price volatility that could include physical and financial hedging, additional natural gas storage, long-term natural gas supply contracts, multiyear rate plans, natural gas cost deferrals, energy decoupling and the use of renewable energy to generate clean fuels for blending in the natural gas LDC. We are confident that if implemented, these actions can help reduce natural gas volatility in the future for our customers. As I wrap up, I'm pleased to share some of the company's recent recognition. For the tenth year in a row, we've been honored as one of the world's most admired companies by Fortune Magazine. We ranked first in social responsibility and quality of management, placing second overall amongst the most admired electric and gas companies in the country. In addition, for the fourth year in a row, Xcel Energy has been named one of the world's most ethical companies by Ethisphere, a global leader in defining and advancing the standards of ethical business practices. None of this will be possible without the commitment of our employees, contractors and our partners. And while we're proud of our track record and our accolades, we will never rest on our mission to provide our customers with safe, clean, reliable energy services at a competitive price. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian. Yes. Julien, good to hear your voice on a Thursday morning. So we've been -- I appreciate your question. Look, as I think about legislation in Colorado that got introduced last week, pretty late in the session. We've been very keenly aware, as I said in my prepared remarks around the impacts to our customers from the volatility in natural gas prices that occurred largely last year and the declines that we've seen this year. And we've taken a lot of steps, both on the communications side and on the price mitigation side to assist there and obviously more to do. The legislation itself as proposed, was introduced in the Senate. And with the idea that we look at both price and price volatility that we saw over the past year, really with the benefit of our customers in mind, requires the company in the PUC. And again, this is still in -- it was approved by the Senate, I believe, yesterday, and it's going to go to the house maybe today or tomorrow. But requires a company in the PUC to look at all the mechanisms that can be helpful for our customers on price and price volatility. As I think about it, I think it provides tools on both the front end and the back end of the gas procurement cycle. So think on the front end, hedging and hedging tools, thinking -- rethinking about long-term storage, physical and financial hedging and things like that on the front end of the cycle. The legislation also takes a look at the back end of the cycle in the event that there are price volatility that exceeds a forecast, then we look at mechanisms for deferrals so that it may not be felt immediately in the pocket books of our customers. And I think those mechanisms much to be determined in the regulatory process, but the legislation contemplates those mechanisms being very beneficial to mitigate the volatility that we saw over the past year. I think the third piece of the legislation looks at something we've been already working with -- proactively with the commission on, which is incentive mechanism that provides an incentive to the company to meet or beat gas price forecast and manage the volatility for our customers. Again, lots of details that have to get worked through the regulatory process. But on balance, the intention is to really protect customers from the volatility we saw over the last year with regulatory mechanisms. Yes. Look, I think on the gas procurement side, it applied to procurement for both the electric and the gas business. More broadly speaking, it also looks at -- it asked us to do a cost causation study around gas LDC customers and how we make future long-term investments into the gas system allows for some distributed energy resources and the ability to add those to our systems maybe in a more expeditious manner. So there's some factors like that in the electric and gas, probably a little too early to say what the long-term implications on our capital forecasting are in the state, but I don't think it will be necessarily material in totality. David, it's Bob. Thanks for the question. As we think about the water leak at Monticello, the repair costs were not significant. We \u2013 as we said in our releases, we have contained the leak, repaired the pipe are in the process of removing the water from the aquifer below the plant. There was no risk to people or planet in the process. We're about halfway \u2013 close to halfway through that water removal, expect to finish it probably end of this year, early next. So not a material increase in the cost side. It's really about pumping water out of the plants. The plants planned to shut down for refueling. We do refueling at Monticello every 2 years. And I expect they probably have 2 more weeks before they finish loading fuel and restarting the plant, but it is ready to go. Sure. No, look, I appreciate the question. The process really continues. Since we last got together, we filed our -- the ALJ filed their recommendations at the end of March. We certainly didn't get all that we asked for in the ALJ filing, but as litigation goes, that's not atypical for the process. We'll file some exceptions and some things that the ALJ recommended we take up in a future proceeding or have the commission take up, I wouldn't say it's terribly material on the exception side. We haven't had a general rate case since 2016, prosecuted in the state on the electric side. And so we think that the recommendation from the ALJ was pretty thoughtful for all sides of the argument. And expect the commission to look at the ALJ's recommendation as well as some of the mitigation mechanisms that we put in place as a company to mitigate the impact to customers for having been out for a long time. We shall take it up in probably early June, and we expect the decision by the end of the second quarter. It's Bob. Thanks for the question. We -- look, I think as we think about the future and the future of hydrogen, I think the country really needs as we think about decarbonization across the economy, why we need a clean molecule for some of those harder to decarbonize sectors and hydrogen appears to be the most versatile of the clean energy molecules that we've been looking at. Certainly, the Department of Energy supports that through the hydrogen hub programs and in the IIJA. So we're excited about the application process. We expect decisions by end of year, where then we would go into future proposals around the proceedings. So we have two, one in the Rocky Mountain region, one in the upper Midwest region, both are consortiums with our multiple states and both involve the goal of creating what I think about as an ecosystem of both producers and users of a clean molecule like hydrogen and whether that can then be converted into fertilizer for ag, process heat -- burning for process heat and from our perspective, blending into the distribution system and co-firing in our existing natural gas plants. So we're excited around the versatility that the molecule provides. We appreciate what Congress and DOE are doing, and we look forward to progressing our applications at the DOE this year. Yes, Paul. Paul, it's Bob. I didn't comment earlier but no new concerns there. We -- the bill as it passed the Senate and the amendments that were provided make the bill workable, I think, from our perspective. We continue to watch it as it moves through the house process. But as it stands right now, I think it's something that we can work with. We think if there still leaves a lot at the commission for decision-making, and we would very much work with the CPUC and the staff to implement some of that legislation through the regulatory process. Yes. Thanks, Paul. I think you're talking about stratification of residential customers from an income perspective. I think at this point, what we do in that regard is we direct a lot of assistance through regulatory state and federal agency programs to mitigate the income-qualified customers. And that process, I think, has worked pretty well. I don't see us proposing any changes to customer stratification at this point."

            "name": "Brian Van Abel",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. We had another solid quarter, reporting earnings of $0.76 per share for the first quarter of 2023 compared with $0.70 per share in 2022. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter included the following: higher electric and natural gas revenues increased earnings by $0.24 per share, reflecting new revenue to recover investments in our electric and natural gas systems and clean energy infrastructure. A lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.02 per share. But keep in mind, production tax credits lowered the ETR. However, PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin and are largely earnings-neutral. In addition, other items combined to increase earnings by $0.01 per share. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation expense, which reduced earnings by $0.08 per share, reflecting our capital investment program, higher O&M expense, which decreased earnings by $0.06 per share and higher interest expense and other taxes which decreased earnings by $0.07 per share. Turning to sales. Weather-adjusted electric sales increased by 0.6% for the first 3 months of 2023. We continue to expect annual electric sales growth of approximately 1% in 2023, driven by C&I sales, while we expect residential sales to be down slightly for the year. O&M expenses increased $48 million for the first quarter. The increase was primarily due to timing differences associated with regulatory recovery mechanisms, generation outages and emergent work, inflationary pressures and investments in electric vehicle programs and other customer products. We continue to expect O&M to decrease approximately 2% in 2023 compared with last year. We've also made progress on a number of regulatory proceedings. The commission recently approved our settlement in the Minnesota natural gas rate case, which reflects a rate increase of $21 million, an ROE of 9.57%, an equity ratio of 52.5% in the decoupling mechanism and property tax tracker. In the Minnesota electric case, we received a constructive ALJ recommendation including a 9.87% ROE and a 52.5% equity ratio. We anticipate a commission decision in June and final rates implemented in the fall. During the quarter, we filed a Texas electric rate case seeking a rate increase of $158 million based on an ROE of 10.65%, an equity ratio of 54.6% in the historic test year in the early retirement of the Tolk coal plant. We anticipate a commission decision and implementation of final rates in the first quarter of 2024. Our electric rate case in Colorado is early in the process. Intervenor recommendations are due in May, and we'll see if there's a potential to reach a settlement with parties. A commission decision and implementation of final rates are expected in the fall. In our New Mexico electric rate case, intervenors filed an initial testimony. The staff recommended a forward test year with a rate increase of $37 million based on an ROE of 9.35% and an equity ratio of 54.7%. Other intervenors recommended equity ratios in the range of 45% to 54.7% and ROEs between 8.7% to 9.6%. We anticipate a decision later in the year. Finally, later this month, we'll file a rate case in Wisconsin, seeking an electric rate increase of approximately $40 million and a natural gas rate increase of approximately $9 million based on a 10.25% ROE, a 52.5% equity ratio and a 2024 future test year. We expect the commission to decide on the case before year-end with new rates in effect in January. Details on these cases are included in our earnings release. We are reaffirming our 2023 earnings guidance range of $3.30 to $3.40 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%. We've updated our key assumptions to reflect the latest information, which are detailed in our earnings release. With that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. Our customers continue to have some of the lowest bills in the country, we remain committed to keeping long-term bill growth below the rate of inflation while leading the clean energy transition and reducing customer exposure to volatility in fossil fuel prices. We continue to achieve constructive regulatory outcomes across our operating companies with progress across multiple rate cases. We have received a significant number of generation bids in response to our RFPs with additional RFPs forthcoming. We are reaffirming our 2023 earnings guidance, and we remain confident, we continue to deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within the upper half of our 5% to 7% objective range as we lead the clean energy transition. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions. Yes. And Julien, I would just add, we're scheduled to file a clean heat plant in Colorado in August, which is really \u2013 I equate that to call it a resource planning process on the electric side. So really working through with our commission and our stakeholders is how do we do decarbonize the LDC. We have legislation with targets in 2030 and then a net zero target longer term. So we're looking forward to working with all our stakeholders about how we decarbonize our LDC, and I think that's a real opportunity as we put plans in place for a longer term. Durgesh, thanks for the question. Something we're very focused on, not only transferability guidance, but guidance for the other aspects of the IRA. But specific to transferability on the guidance, we expect guidance to be issued in Q2 for transferability. And for us, we're looking for a fairly straightforward guidance, right? We would call it clean, no pun intended, a clean seller of these tax credits here from wind farms that have already been in service. And so we're looking for documentation and the certification requirements, in terms of sale, registration requirements, so pretty basic stuff. So that's really what we're looking for out of the guidance from the IRS. The other aspect is we've talked to about 20 counterparties already, and there is a significant amount of interest in the purchases of our tax credits, not only this year but for a longer term. So we're pretty confident in terms of our ability to execute on this at a good price for our customers. And so I think about this, we get guidance in Q2, I would expect us to start executing in Q3. And this year, we took a pretty conservative approach. We really expected to sell about $200 million of tax credits in our financing plan. That's about of half of what we could sell this year. So -- and then we'd assume we sell the remainder of it in the year after. But that's kind of our view on transferability and I think is a great mechanism as we think about the longer-term cost of renewable projects and how we can be the most tax efficient with those tax credits. No, I think we just included in our quarterly earnings calls. Obviously, there may be \u2013 depending on the counterparty, they may want to make some announcement about it if they're thinking about \u2013 how they're thinking about they're supporting the clean energy transition by other counterparties may not want to. So \u2013 but the expectation would be in our quarterly earnings calls. David, thanks for the question. So still working through the RFP processes, and I can comment on Colorado because we made a what we call a 30-day filing in Colorado that talked about the median prices that we've seen, incredible amount of interest in the projects and in the bid process. On the wind side, the median price was about $22 from an LCOE perspective. And if you think about that, that's -- if we didn't have IRA and we didn't have any tax credits that would probably be closer to $50. So a really great opportunity from a customer savings perspective with the IRA in what we're seeing. Now that's slightly above the RFP that we did 5 years ago, as you can see some inflationary pressures on CapEx. On the solar side, the median price is about $33. Now I'm giving you a median price. We have not disclosed the project portfolio that will happen in August when we make our filing and with our recommended portfolio to the commission. But overall, you think our project portfolio will come in well below those median prices that we've stated. So overall, I think we set ourselves up well with the number of bids we put in from a self-build perspective. We've been at the scheme for a long time from the wind side. And now we've proven with [Circle] solar and the price point we've delivered Circle solar that we can be very competitive. So I think, overall, we're excited about getting these RFPs. I talked about Colorado because that's the one that we've at least shared some information. Minnesota expect a filing from us here in May on the Minnesota RFP. And then on the SPS, RFP, expect a filing in Q3. So we'll give everyone kind of full transparency and visibility into the opportunities later in this year. But I would say, overall, we're pretty excited and excited to execute on some of these wind and solar and storage projects for the benefit of our customers. Yes. Thanks for the question, Jeremy. I think we're thinking about it right now. And obviously, this is a little bit of a moving target with MISO, but we're thinking an announcement in the first part of next year. But like I said, that has the potential to shift as we've seen. And we're expecting kind of the next tranche or tranche 2 to be as big at lease as tranche 4, potentially bigger. And as we think about it, we'd expect a similar share as we received in tranche 1. So that's where our thoughts are today. But obviously, working with MISO and the stakeholders as we move through the process. Yes. And I'll just add a little bit of more color on the process. I think overall, there is about 80 concept papers that were submitted, and DOE encouraged 33 concept papers and all 3 of ours were encouraged. Ultimately, as Bob said, we've moved forward with 2 because 2 were in the Rocky Mountain region. But we feel good about our, call it, multi-application hydrogen hubs and multistate hubs. So looking forward to seeing this process play out and as Bob said, awards at the end of the year, and then it's a stage process going forward after that. Sophie. Yes, thanks for the follow-up question. We do -- so the way we see this playing out is we have absolutely submitted our own self-bid -- self-build projects in all 3 of the RFPs, Minnesota, Colorado and SPS. And those range from solar to wind and storage and combinations of each of those and depends on the RFP. Minnesota was only a solar RFP. But we've spent probably the last 18 to 24 months, working on our self-build projects. As we know, we have a massive renewable build-out over the next decade in our territories. So -- not only do we see potentially our own self-build projects being selected, we have a good partnership with Vestas in the Colorado with their Colorado facility. And so we have some geographical advantages with having wind turbine -- wind blades being manufactured there, and we have a lot of opportunities around. We're using the interconnection of our retiring coal plants. So we feel really good. Now, publicly, we talk about targeting 50% ownership. Obviously, we think we'll be very cost competitive and would love to demonstrate to our commissions that we could do more than 50% ownership because we think we have really good projects that will show a lot of benefit to our customers. And I think this is just -- as I think about this, let me give you a little view of longer-term. I really think this is a start of steel for fuel 2.0 as we think about it. And I don't think there are many utilities can do this clean energy transition at the price point that we can because of the solar and wind resources in our backyard. And we think that's a true competitive advantage over the longer term as being able to deliver 80% to 85% clean energy in 2030 at or below inflation. So we're excited to continue to work on these RFPs. And following these RFPs, we'll do multiple more RFPs in our jurisdictions. So I'm looking forward to giving you and everyone on this call and our stakeholders further updates as we work through the process. Yes. Thanks for the question. No, Monticello -- Monticello maybe a couple of million dollars from a repair cost perspective. So pretty immaterial relative to the quarter. As we think about it, last year, if you look at our pattern of O&M last year, it was significantly higher in the latter part of the year. Part of that is due to some regulatory deferrals that were in place of Q1 last year than unwound as we got rates in Texas. And then we also had good weather last year, so we invested in our system later in the year. So as we think about it, we're still good with our year-end guidance, and we'll continue to work on that. Now that being said, we are facing inflationary pressures and it's something that we're very focused on internally is keeping those O&M expenses down as I think is important from a customer build perspective long term. But overall, we feel good with where we are and expect to deliver on our year-end numbers as we've done for 18 years. Not at all in terms of the content. I would call it we're looking for more administrative guidance. Now there may be other parties that are involved in tax equity partnerships or ITC, but we're looking at transferring PTCs, as I said, we're very clean from a transferability perspective. So it's more like okay, what are the registration requirements and then just our counterparties want to see the guidance too, so they know what they need to do. So nothing of our concern beyond just getting those administrative requirements out and that's why we're waiting, and we'll be ready to pull the trigger when we give that guidance. Ryan, thanks for the question. As we think about it in New Mexico, a wide range of intervenor testimony. I think some of that from large industrials is call it par for the course. Look at the staff testimony, we think it's a good starting point, the staff testimony. I think one of the key aspects is we filed the forward test year. And I think there's support from a forward test year construct perspective, which is different from historical standards. So absolutely, just got the testimony in last Friday, have digested it, and then we'll see if there is an opportunity to work with the parties and reach a balanced and constructive outcome from a settlement perspective. If you look at the schedule we have -- hearings are June 20. And so that would be kind of from now until June 20, and it's actually a stipulation period in their native, in terms of looking at settlement opportunities. But we've been -- we've reached a settlement in our last couple of rate cases in New Mexico and certainly look forward to working with the parties on it to get a balanced outcome for our customers. The second part of your question was around guidance. This goes into effect late in the year, so relatively small impact on 2023 guidance. No. From a timeline perspective, no, I do not. In terms of it getting pushed out. So I think overall, in SPS, if you looked at our sales is very strong sales on \u2013 particularly on the C&I side, right? We had 7% plus C&I sales quarter \u2013 year-over-year for the quarter. Resi sales were up about 3%. Now that was higher than expectations on the residential side. Commercial side was pretty much in line with what we expected. So really strong growth, and more of that growth is weighted towards New Mexico than Texas with what we're seeing in the oil patch region in the Delaware Basin. Now rigs are up about 10% year-over-year from the rig count in the 2 counties we serve, Eddy and Lee. And then we're also seeing a lot of electrification requests as the large oil and gas customers have their own carbon reduction targets hitting and they're obviously working with the state of New Mexico is how they can improve their overall carbon footprint. So really good growth there, and we're doing everything we can and working with our customers to make sure that we can support them with the distribution and transmission investments that we need to make. Thanks, everyone, for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions."

Please note this conference is being recorded and for the duration of the call your lines will be on listen-only. However, you will have the opportunity to ask questions at the end of the presentation. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the call over to Paul Johnson, Vice President, Treasury and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nPaul Johnson: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2024 third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Bob Frenzel, President, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer; Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer questions if needed. This morning, we will review our third quarter results and highlights, share recent business and regulatory updates, update our capital and financing plans and provide 2025 guidance. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder, some of the comments during today's call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings releases and SEC filings. Today, we will discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures. Information on comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release. In the third quarter of 2024 Minnesota Commission disallowed $46 million of replacement power costs associated with the extended outage at our Sherco plant in 2011. As a result, we recorded a charge of $35 million, or $0.04, in the third quarter, which was in addition to an $11 million, or $0.02 charge, that was accrued in the second quarter of 2024 related to that matter. Given the nonrecurring nature of these items, both charges have been excluded from third quarter and year-to-date earnings. As a result, our GAAP earnings for the third quarter of 2024 were $1.21 per share, while our ongoing earnings, which exclude this charge, were $1.25 per share. All for the discussion in our earnings call today will focus on ongoing earnings. For more information on this, please see the disclosure in our earnings release. I'll now turn the call over to Bob.\nBob Frenzel: Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we delivered another quarter of solid operational and financial progress. We continue to deploy capital for the benefit of our customers and communities and we enable a future power by cleaner fuels and a more resilient and intelligent grid. We partner with stakeholders to encourage economic development, and we provide products and services capable of meeting our customers' most important needs. In the most recent quarter, we invested $2 billion in resilient and reliable energy infrastructure. We delivered ongoing earnings of $1.25 per share for our owners. We provided industry-leading storm response and strong customer reliability despite challenging conditions, and we accelerated our wildfire risk reduction measures to enable safer and more resilient communities. Xcel Energy's commitment to our communities and investors is anchored by our core investment thesis as a clean energy leader. For more than two decades, we've provided \u2013 we've been a leading provider of wind energy and with our filed resource plans we expect to stay in that position. We've delivered on our earnings guidance for 19 straight years, one of the best records in the industry and looking to make it 20 this year. We have a long-term and transparent growth plan, making investments in clean generation, new and enhanced energy grids and economic development programs to support our community's vitality. We've deepened our commitment to serve and support customer needs efficiently. For example, since 2020, our continuous improvement programs have saved almost $0.5 billion in O&M expense while improving operating outcomes and reducing risk. In addition, we've kept our O&M costs significantly below the rate of inflation over the last 10 years. And our Steel for Fuel strategy has delivered more than $4 billion in customer fuel-related savings since 2017. And finally, this discipline, alongside support of state and federal policies enable us to reduce emissions and keep residential electric and natural gas bills 28% and 14% below the industry average and growth well under the rate of inflation. We're $0.16 ahead of 2023 year-to-date earnings, and as a result, we are reaffirming our 2024 guidance of $3.50 to $3.60 per share, and we are initiating our 2025 earnings guidance range of $3.75 to $3.85 per share. And today, we're introducing our updated 5-year $45 billion capital investment plan, which centers on four key areas. Clean Energy, which continues investment in generation that provides customers with a secure and clean energy future while helping our states and our customers meet their ambitious policy goals. Customer electrification, which helps customers electrify their transportation needs, transitioning homes and businesses away from fossil fuel heating and converting fossil fuel loads to clean electric power loads. New load growth, which expands our electric system to support customers surging demand and requirements over the next decade and beyond and safety and reliability, which modernizes and hardens our system to ensure continued safe operations and address increasing risks from severe weather. There's a lot of focus across our industry and country regarding data centers. Xcel Energy has nearly 9,000 megawatts of opportunities in our customer pipeline before 2030. The scale of this pipeline gives us the ability to thoughtfully negotiate agreements that deliver the energy and capacity needed to important new customers in the region while protecting Xcel Energy and its customers and ensuring lasting relationships with our data center customers, ensures that new data center load that's brought onto our system benefits all customers. It drives load growth to our increasingly decarbonized energy system, generates economic growth in vitality in our communities and delivers on the national imperative to support a domestic data center industry. As a result of these guiding principles, we anticipate we will secure contracts with about 25% of this pipeline in the five-year forecast period. We also expect these opportunities to continue to grow and the need extends well past the next decade. We previously signed data center agreements with Meta and QTS and completed land sales with entities, including Microsoft to support new facilities. In October, a new data center customer completed a land acquisition in our service territory, and we're in the final stages of signing service contracts with that party. Turning to the supply side of the equation, we continued progress during the quarter on our clean energy transition through multiple resource planning and RFP processes. We reached a settlement in our Upper Midwest resource plan. And as part of that settlement, 720 megawatts of company-owned natural gas CTs and battery investments were selected. In addition, the agreement reflects the need for an incremental 4,200 megawatts of wind, solar and storage a portion of which is included in existing RFP solicitations. The settlement is pending a decision by the Minnesota Commission, which is expected in the first quarter of 2025. In October, we made a new energy resource filing in Colorado called the Just Transition solicitation. Our projections indicate the need for up to 14,000 megawatts of new generation to meet the phase out of our coal plants to accommodate increasing demand from data centers and to achieve state and customer emissions goals. We anticipate a decision on that filing in fall of 2025 with RFPs to be issued in early 2026. And we're working on our solicitation and SPS which could ultimately yield more than 5,000 megawatts of renewable and firm dispatchable generation. These are due in January of next year, and we expect commission approvals in 2026. Protecting our customers from the threats of extreme weather also remains a top priority. In August, severe thunderstorms brought heavy rain, hail and winds of over 60 miles an hour to customers in Minnesota and Wisconsin. Xcel Energy employees and contractors safely and promptly restored power to over 250,000 customers who lost service during those storms. We're thankful for the dedication of our employees and contractors that ensure that our communities continue to have safe and reliable service that they expect from Xcel Energy. In addition, we'd like to thank our crews who've worked tirelessly to provide mutual aid assistance to other utilities to support recovery and restoration efforts from the devastating hurricanes Helene and Milton. And regarding wildfire risk reduction, we continue to make progress on our accelerated wildfire mitigation efforts as well as our Colorado wildfire mitigation plan filing. In the fourth quarter, we anticipate filing our Texas resiliency plan, which will include wildfire mitigation in the Southwest. Finally, turning to a tradition that I'm very proud, during the third quarter, nearly 2,200 volunteers from Xcel Energy in our communities took action to support nonprofit organizations during our 14th annual day of service. Volunteers dedicated almost 8,000 hours to support 125 projects for nonprofits across our eight states. We're grateful to the thousands of volunteers and nonprofits that come together year-after-year to put good energy into action that fuels growth influences change and lifts up our neighbors. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\nBrian Van Abel: Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Starting with our financial results, Xcel Energy had ongoing earnings of $1.25 per share for the third quarter of 2024 compared to ongoing earnings of $1.23 per share in 2023. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter included the following: outcomes from rate cases and nonfuel riders increased earnings by $0.25 per share and higher AFUDC increased earnings by $0.04 per share. Offsetting these positive drivers were higher O&M expenses decreased earnings by $0.09 per share. Higher depreciation and amortization decreased earnings by $0.08 per share, reflecting our capital investment programs. Higher interest charges decreased earnings by $0.08 per share, driven by rising interest rates and increased debt levels to fund capital investments and other items increased earnings by $0.02 per share. Turning to sales, year-to-date weather and leap year adjusted electric sales increased 0.2%. However, third quarter weather adjusted sales increased 1.3%, based on our forecast, we are reaffirming our full year guidance of a 1% increase in weather-adjusted electric sales. Our new five-year plan includes 5% per year electric sales growth, of which approximately 50% is from data centers with other growth coming from the oil and gas industry and EVs. Our sales forecast only assumes contracted or high-probability data centers. We also large data center \u2013 we also expect that large data center low growth will continue beyond our five-year plan, and there is upside to what we have included. Year-to-date, O&M increased $58 million, primarily driven by increased generation maintenance, damage prevention, wildfire mitigation and storm expenses. In addition, we are facing increased costs from our recent excess liability insurance renewal. As such, we are revising our full year O&M forecast to 3% to 4% increase relative to 2023. During the quarter, we also made progress in several rate cases. Earlier this month, the Colorado Commission completed deliberations on our natural gas rate case, which reflects an estimated rate increase of approximately $130 million which includes $15 million of incremental depreciation that was not included in our original request. The decision was based on a historic test year with an average rate base and a weighted average cost of capital of 7%, reflecting an ROE range of 9.2% to 9.5% and an equity ratio of 52% to 55%. Rates will go into effect in November. In early November, we plan to file a Minnesota Electric Rate Case, seeking a rate increase of $490 million over two years based on an ROE of 10.3% and a 52.5% equity ratio. We\u2019re also requesting interim rates of $224 million to go in effect in January of 2025. The final decision is expected in 2026. We continue to make progress in the Smokehouse Creek wildfire claims process. We\u2019ve settled 86 of the 179 submitted claims, which we view as a positive and constructive outcome, 23 lawsuits have also been filed. In addition, there is no change to our estimated accrued liability of $215 million. As a reminder, we have approximately $500 million of excess liability insurance coverage for this fire. Shifting to our investment plans, we provided an updated $45 billion five-year base capital expenditure forecast, which reflects annual rate base growth of 9.4%. These investments are critical to serve growing electric demand, meet clean energy goals and ensure system safety and reliability. We have an additional $10 billion plus pipeline of potential investment, which we view as conservative and could be significantly higher. This additional capital reflects generation from RFPs and resource plans, low growth from data centers and beneficial electrification and additional transmission, including opportunities from MISO Tranche 2 and the Southwest Power Pool. We also refreshed our base financing plan which reflects approximately $19 billion of debt and $4.5 billion of equity. We anticipate that any incremental capital investment will be funded by approximately 40% equity and 60% debt. It\u2019s important to recognize we\u2019ve always maintained a balanced financing strategy, which includes a mix of debt and equity to fund accretive growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet and credit metrics. As a result, you\u2019ll notice we issued $1.1 billion of equity via our ATM program this year. This equity issuance is not part of our 2025 to 2029 financing plan, and reflects our commitment to credit quality while delivering on our long-term financial objectives. Maintaining solid credit ratings and favorable access to capital markets are critical to fund the clean energy transition, deliver strong shareholder returns and keep customer bills low. Moving to earnings, we are reaffirming our 2024 ongoing earnings guidance range of $3.50 to $3.60 per share. We are also initiating our 2025 earnings guidance range of $3.75 to $3.85 per share, which reflects 7% growth from the midpoint of 2024 guidance. Key assumptions are detailed in our earnings release. We are updating our long-term EPS growth objective to 6% to 8% with expectations to deliver earnings in the upper half of the range. The increase in the EPS growth rate reflects our significant investment pipeline and confidence in our financial outlook. We also modified our dividend growth objective to 4% to 6%, with the expectation to be at the low end of the range. A lower dividend growth rate allows us to retain additional cash flow to fund growth and lowers equity funding needs. In addition, that will lower our dividend payout ratio over time, which provides greater financial flexibility and drive power for the future. With that, I will wrap up with a quick summary. We reached a settlement in our Minnesota resource plan and filed our latest Colorado resource plan, which allow us to lead the clean energy transition, ensuring customer affordability and reliability, while driving economic growth. We continue to make progress on our wildfire mitigation plans, which reduced risk from extreme weather. We announced an updated capital investment program that provides strong, transparent rate base growth and significant customer value. We provided a balanced financing plan to fund accretive growth, while maintaining a strong balance sheet and credit metrics. We are on track to meet our 2024 ongoing earnings guidance and have provided 2025 guidance consistent with our growth objectives. And we revised our long-term earnings growth to the upper half of the 6% to 8% objective range and dividend growth to the low end of the 4% to 6% objective range, which is indicative of our significant capital investment pipeline. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions.\nOperator: Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Nicholas Campanella with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nNicholas Campanella: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my quesotins.\nBob Frenzel: Good morning, Nick.\nNicholas Campanella: Good morning. So, I just wanted to ask, you talked in your prepared remarks, you had a customer make a large land acquisition. Where was that exactly? Was that in Minnesota, or could you provide more details on that? And then is that included in this 5% kind of consolidated load growth outlook long term for the company, or is that pressure higher? And then how do we think about rate design there? I know that\u2019s a lot in one. Thanks.\nBrian Van Abel: Hey Nick. Good morning. Undisclosed customer, but yes, it was in Minnesota. And that\u2019s one of the, call it, as we think about high probability loads. We\u2019ve been, as you can imagine, in active discussions with them and significant progress on services agreement. So, great to see the continued progress we have on the data center front. And so I mean, we\u2019re getting into as part of the negotiations, you get into rate design and in terms of pricing, but I think, it\u2019s important as Bob laid out the guiding principles and how we think about it and ensuring that all of our customers benefit from these large loads that come on, sort of help drive economic growth for our state, but also benefits all of our customers. I think it\u2019s just something I\u2019m not sure if people caught it, but there was a planning session at the Minnesota Commission on Tuesday that included the data centers, IBEW, Department of Commerce, us, and other significant stakeholders, talking about how do we support and move faster on the data center front. And so, we\u2019re pretty excited about those conversations. It\u2019s not really constructive and look forward to working with our commission on these opportunities.\nBob Frenzel: And Nick, just to answer, I think, probably part two of a three-part question was, is it included in our forecast, so we\u2019ve got about a quarter of that 9,000 megawatts are included in our five-year sales forecast. This land acquisition would be one of the projects that would be a part of that forecast. Obviously, we think that this is a trend that\u2019s likely to continue in our regions for a lot of reasons, and we have real confidence in our ability to meet that forecast as well as to continue to see sales growth transition into our regions over time.\nNicholas Campanella: Hey, that\u2019s great. I appreciate that. And maybe a one-part question. But on the financing, I know you\u2019ve priced the $1.1 billion, are you done for the year? Would you derisk the five-year plan at this point? And what\u2019s the right mechanisms to do that in your mind? Thanks\nBrian Van Abel: Yes, Nick, thanks for the question. Yes, as you can see, we did about $1 billion of ATM issuance in Q3. So certainly, a very strong quarter for us. And that does fulfill our equity needs for the year. That\u2019s our plan for the year. Now it doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t be opportunistic if we think through the end of the year, we like something, actually, we don\u2019t need to do anything through the end of the year. Second part of your question, look, we view an ATM, and we\u2019ve always talked about this, is it\u2019s an efficient mechanism to get our equity issuances one. But it doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t look at all other products and options on the table as we move forward.\nNicholas Campanella: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nSteve Fleishman: Hi. Good morning.\nBob Frenzel: Good morning.\nSteve Fleishman: Can you hear me okay.\nBob Frenzel: We can hear you.\nSteve Fleishman: Great. So, just wanted to reconcile the CapEx increase with the equity, because I think, CapEx went up about $6 billion of equity and we went up $0.5 billion. So, it\u2019s kind of a lot less than that 40%-60%. So, is that because you prefunded some with this $1 billion, is that because cash flows just getting better, or just how should we think about that?\nBrian Van Abel: Yes. Hey Steve, a couple of things, and thanks for the question. One, you\u2019re right. Generally, we guide investors to a 40%-60% mix. Part of that is we do get a little bit of benefit as we lower the dividend growth rate that I talked about that helps a little bit in the five-year, but also gives us more dry powder longer term. But it\u2019s really about kind of the cash flow and the timing of the capital. And if you look at how we design it, when we put together that slide around the credit metrics, our credit metrics are very stable. Generally, still going forward, we expect that 40%-60% mix, but we were able to be a little bit flexible here and not have as much equity as we need it as we roll forward our five-year.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. And then totally separate question, just knock on wood, we\u2019re getting, hopefully, near the end of wildfire season, if it ever ends, and we haven\u2019t seen anything happen. So maybe you could just talk to Bob, maybe just talk to the actions that you\u2019ve taken on wildfire mitigation, how you feel they\u2019re working, what else you might do? And just \u2013 and then related, could you just clarify the insurance amount? And are you including deferral of that in your guidance? Or are you assuming you have to expense it in 2025? Or yes, that would be helpful.\nBob Frenzel: Yes, great questions. Appreciate it. I\u2019ve said before, I\u2019m very proud of the activities and the accomplishments that the company has executed to protect our customers and our communities since the March time frame. I think we\u2019ve really built a lot of muscle around our wildfire protection mechanisms. First and foremost is operating the system with safety and so our capabilities in both enhanced power line safety settings and our abilities to execute PSPS is first and foremost in our minds of what helps protect our customers and communities in that process. I think we built a lot of muscle and capability there. Over time, we know that we have to harden the system and segment the system, and we take a lot of lessons learned from our peers in California and what they\u2019ve done in terms of situational awareness, the ability to see whether coming sooner, the ability to alert their customers faster and more confidently in their ability to segment the system, so that the impacts of EPSS or PSPS are mitigated or muted in that process. We\u2019ve been working on the intelligence side of that. We\u2019ve installed AI cameras. We\u2019re starting to look at weather stations, and starting to incorporate other data feeds in this time frame. And again, huge benefits from being a fast follower here to what other people have plowed ground on and learnings that they\u2019ve had over a decade of dealing with this kind of risk. And then with \u2013 on the regulatory side, obviously, we\u2019re moving forward with our wildfire plan in Colorado in a system resiliency plant in Texas. All of those will help us to accelerate pole inspections, accelerated replacements of anything that we see out there, more aggressive vegetation management. So I think we\u2019ve done a lot to protect the system in the short-term. And I think our actions as we go forward are going to be very much focused on how we mitigate the impacts on our customers over the long-term and making sure that we have a resilient and safe system into the future.\nBrian Van Abel: Hey Steve, I\u2019ll handle that second part of the question around just insurance deferrals. We completed our insurance renewable is this month, premiums are significantly higher as we kind of alluded to in Q2. We saw premiums triple on us capacity did shrink some. So we do have \u2013 we have a regulatory deferral docket in front of the Colorado Commission where they have a sudden expedited schedule to get decision by the end of the year. And we\u2019re in discussions with our peer utilities and staff in Texas around the industry issue around increasing excess liability premium. So we do include constructive regulatory outcomes in our 2025 guidance, and that is included getting recovery of our deferrals and constructive cost recovery around our wildfire mitigation plan is an overall part of our constructive regulatory outcomes for 2025.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Carly Davenport from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nCarly Davenport: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions and for the updates. Maybe just start on the new capital plan, I guess how should we think about the kind of $6 billion capital increase relative to the 40 basis points increase in the rate base CAGR. Is that just a function of base effects rolling forward the plan in other years? Or anything else that we should be keeping in mind there?\nBrian Van Abel: No, Carly, you\u2019re exactly right. It\u2019s just a function of rolling forward and having a bigger base as we roll forward to the next five years. So that\u2019s all it is a function of nothing else going on.\nCarly Davenport: Got it. Okay. Great. And then maybe to follow-up, just on the 5% new load growth forecast, you mentioned in the slides that being sort of back-end loaded due to the timing of data center load coming in. So is there any other granularity you can provide in terms of sort of when you expect to see that more significant inflection in load and any sense of the magnitude there?\nBrian Van Abel: Yes, Carly, I think if you look at our 2025 guidance, our sales guidance is 3% for 2025 and expect it to go up there to 5% to 8% in the years after that and really peaking in 2020 as we see it and that\u2019s really driven by, like I said, kind of a combination, which is what we view as a great to have the diversity. Half of that sales growth of the 5% is coming from data centers. But we also have significant growth in the oil and gas region in SPS out of the Permian Basin, and we\u2019re starting to see the effects of beneficial electrification around EVs and other BE in Colorado that helps driving kind of the other part of that growth. So I think we see kind of more kind of middle to back end weighted, but also having this diversity in growth is helpful in the overall plan.\nCarly Davenport: Great. Thanks so much for the color.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.\nBob Frenzel: Hey, good morning, Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: And Happy Halloween. Thank you for all the details that you provided on the call today. Just want to come back to kind of high-level thought process here. Historically, you\u2019ve stuck to the conservative 5% to 7% EPS CAGR with the plus more recently, but noted that there\u2019s all these array of new opportunities that you talked about. And so just wanted to get, I guess, your thought process on moving it to 6% to 8% CAGR at this point. And it sounds like you\u2019re still at the high end there. So I just wanted to kind of walk through that a little bit more if possible.\nBrian Van Abel: Yes. Hey, Jeremy, good morning. I think about it in two ways is one, if you just look at our base plan, the majority of that capital is investing in our wires business, right? We\u2019re focused on that kind of safety and resiliency in our wires business, and that base plan drives 9% \u2013 9.4% rate base growth. But then it\u2019s all about the additional steel underground related to the projects we need to deliver on retiring our coal plants, as Bob talked about, and executing on 5%-plus electric growth. So we view that as a tremendous opportunity. We\u2019ve talked \u2013 Bob talked about our resource plans in flight. When you add all those up, there\u2019s between 15,000 and nearly 30,000 megawatts of generation we need to add to our system to serve our customers over the call through 2030. So a huge opportunity. And I think the other part is we\u2019ve demonstrated through the RFP process recently, that can be extremely competitive in these generation procurement processes that we have a top-tier internal regulated development team that can bring projects that are very competitively priced. And so we expect to build a now, and I would say, at least $10 billion of those pipeline of projects. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re sitting here very confident about not only the next five years, but longer-term executing at an upper half of the range and potentially going above it.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That\u2019s very helpful there. So with that last comment potentially going above it, I thought it might be too early to ask there, but I just wanted to dive in a little bit more. I think you talked about three buckets that feed into the incremental CapEx opportunity. Can you weigh out I guess, over the next 12 months what some of the milestones could be and kind of what would it take to move more of that into plan?\nBrian Van Abel: Yes. So let\u2019s hit the first ones that are more near-term. MISO tranche 2.1, which we should get a decision by the end of the year. Then we\u2019ll need to go through the regulatory approval processes. But that\u2019s roughly about $2 billion of transmission opportunities. We got the SPP, ITP that was just approved by the Board this month. That\u2019s another about $2 billion of projects that we expect to be awarded to us because of reliability-driven projects, meaning that the need is within a few years. So those are kind of the transmission buckets. The SPS, RFP is another big bucket, 5,000 to 10,000 megawatts. We\u2019ll get bids in, in January. And the first look investors will probably get is roughly probably Q2 of next year when we file our preferred portfolio of New Mexico. So that will at least get some insight into that with approvals going into 2026 for that. The Minnesota resource plan, we should get a Q1 decision out of our commission on the overall resource plan, which includes, as Bob mentioned, 720 megawatts of storage and CTs in there, along with some additional RFPs we\u2019re working through. And then finally, related to Colorado. We just filed the Colorado resource plan, which we\u2019re pretty excited about with upwards of 14,000 megawatts in that we\u2019ll work through that resource plan, call it, within a year, and then we\u2019ll file RFPs. So that will be a little bit longer dated on all the opportunities. But you\u2019ll continue to see execution opportunities throughout the next 12 months to 24 months for us.\nBob Frenzel: Jeremy, just to add on to Brian\u2019s comments, I\u2019m really excited. We\u2019re starting to see this energy transition we\u2019ve been talking about and working on for the past five years, really start to accelerate as we start to get to the periods where we\u2019re proactively removing our coal plants from the system and replacing them with cleaner and, in some cases, lower cost generation resources. Brian is right, the development team that we\u2019ve built in-house, starting with our 2017 steel for fuel plan has been an incredible asset for the company. I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t talk about our transmission capabilities. Obviously, we have a lot of transmission to build in the company and across the country. We\u2019ve been the leading provider of new line miles of transmission over the last 15 years as a company. And with all the projects we mentioned here, whether it\u2019s the Colorado Power pathway, whether it\u2019s LRTP2.0, 2.1 billion the ITP process in the Southwest. We\u2019ve got a terrific transmission development construction team here that are helping us execute on a very strategic asset for the company and the country.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Exciting times ahead. Thank you for that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning, team. Keep going, I\u2019m super impressed, so thank you. Look, I wanted to follow up on the 6% to 8%. And obviously, the timing here is obviously coincident with an accelerating backdrop on sales growth here. But what does he say about confidence in wildfire outcomes in your mind? Is there anything implicit in the read into this? I mean, again, somewhat of an unknowable, but I\u2019m just curious if there\u2019s anything that you see in a litany of recent developments on that front as well here, if you can.\nBob Frenzel: Look, I'd suggest \u2013 sorry, Julien, it's Bob. Thanks for the question. First of all, as I think about wildfire current proceedings as well as litigation and long-term outcomes in our states. I feel confident in our wildfire position, both from my comments earlier on what we're doing to protect the customers and the community going forward. as well as our position is unchanged as it pertains to our litigation matters, both in the Southwest and in Colorado regarding Marshall and Smokehouse Creek, long-term, I think we're doing the right things in the system to harden it and protect our customers. There's obviously some investment that's needed there. I would suggest that obviously 6% to 8% is an ongoing earnings number. And if we had an unexpected outcome in any of the proceedings, we'd have to accommodate that. But our position has been \u2013 we didn't work \u2013 we didn't act negligently in our systems in the Smokehouse Creek. Our accruals are consistent quarter-over-quarter and within our limits of our insurance and we look forward to working through those proceedings and really getting behind us and starting to partner with our communities as we move forward in time with our resiliency plans.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay. All right. Fair enough, Bob. And actually, just going back to Steve's question for earlier and for the record, I get Jeremy all the time. Just on what we said, you mentioned EPSS and PSPS. I mean these are obviously terms we know well from California. I mean, given \u2013 you talked about being a fast forward, how quickly can some of this be implemented, right, in terms of achieving meaningful derisking of the system here? I mean what kind of time frame are you looking at? I mean, it seems like some fairly readily implemented kind of solutions.\nBob Frenzel: So look, I think quickly, and I mean that in a \u2013 the \u2013 we have the capability to do the PSPS today. We have the capability to do EPSS today as we think \u2013 and every single day, we do a wildfire risk assessment on the conditions across our system across all eight states and make decisions on how we position the system, how we set up breakers and how we set up controls. I think probably the difference between where we sit and where some of our peers in California said, is the granularity with which we can do that. Our protection may come at an entire feeder level, which might be a 10-mile long stretch of distribution line. Our goal in the future is to be able to segment that distribution line into much more manageable, maybe one mild chunk instead of one 10-mile chunks so that we can be more targeted with the protections and more protective of customers. So I think as the final analysis is we have great sort of bulk protection systems. And we need to get \u2013 I would say, we're working with a sledgehammer today. We need a scalpel in the future, and that takes investments over time. But I think from a true protection mechanism, we've got a lot of the capabilities that we need. It's just a little bit blunter than we'd like.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. All right, guys. Congrats, again. Nicely done.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey team, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Just maybe on the \u2013 good to see the equity out of the way for this year, strong quarter, Brian, like you mentioned. Maybe just how should we think about the timing of the $4.5 billion that is in the plan? Is that ratable over basically same amount over a year annually or back-end loaded? Just any color there?\nBrian Van Abel: Yes. Hey, good morning, Durgesh. Yes, I mean I think you've heard us before, we don't necessarily comment on \u2013 or give guidance on the timing of our equity, but here's the way to think about it is if you look at the shape of our annual CapEx over the next five years, that's a good way to assume it kind of follows that shape as our annual CapEx is larger in the first few years. So that's how I'd think about it.\nDurgesh Chopra: That's helpful. Thank you, Brian. And something that is near and dear to you, the transferability. Maybe just help out what portion of the CFO in the plan is transferability, how are you doing there versus your annual target for 2024?\nBrian Van Abel: Yes, we've executed all of our credit sales for 2024, working on 2025 significant demand. And really, it's kind of in and out, right, in terms of seeing give the customer what the offset in revenue and then we used to pick it up on the tax line. So from a cash flow perspective in and out, we've had many discussions about this, I think we lost as leaders in this in terms of the opportunity. Also working with the large buyers of this. It's helpful to have \u2013 we have 17 Fortune 500 companies in our backyard here that we know extremely well. And so we're not only looking at 2025, but also longer-term deals and getting the pricing we expected. So I think, overall, we expect we'll be monetizing $700-plus million of credits annually going forward and the markets there, and it's been a great tool to have.\nDurgesh Chopra: Thanks, Brian. How much do you do this year? Can you just remind us quickly?\nBrian Van Abel: Roughly $400 million to $500 million.\nDurgesh Chopra: Thanks so much. Congrats.\nDurgesh Chopra: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ross Fowler from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nBob Frenzel: Good morning, Ross.\nRoss Fowler: Good morning. So just a couple of things. Maybe winding back to the Marshall Fire a little bit. We saw the judge's order on September 30 on the 25 trial. So obviously, now we're talking a different level of multiplier from that, and we sort of bucketed it in two pieces from what I can tell. So is there any reduction or settlement of claims related to that? Or how do we think about the calendar from here given that, that order is out?\nBob Frenzel: Okay. Ross, it's Bob. Let me try and address what I think your question is, first of all, in Marshall, let's start with, we don't think we acted negligently. We know that the fire was started on the 12 tribes property, the first ignition occurred there, we don't believe we acted negligently in the operation of our system and we dispute the Sheriff\u2019s Report that we called the second ignition. Notwithstanding, obviously, the litigation persists and the structure of the trial was architected in the judge's orders about a month ago. And so the way they've constructed it is, the first trial will determine liability and the issue did Xcel Energy's equipment start a second ignition as part of the process of the overall fire. We'll use a second trial, if necessary, to determine damages and then each individual claimant is going to have to prove up their own damages, and we're not going to have sort of a blanket claim or a blanket number applied to any challenges. So yes, we think that the trial structure was constructive from the judge's perspective. So that's what happened in September. I'm not certain if I answered your question or not.\nBrian Van Abel: Yes. And I think the other part is just that in terms of \u2013 I think you're asking a little bit about the multiplier effect where the actual jury would have to hear each award damages and can have a multiplier across all plaintiffs. So helpful. I'll come in that regard.\nRoss Fowler: And then next calendar steps, what should we look for as the next sort of thing to watch for here in the process?\nBob Frenzel: So we're in diligence right now, heavy diligence, the trial set for next September for a couple of weeks. So I think we've got a while before there are any real milestones in the trial going forward.\nRoss Fowler: Okay. And then you go through in the slides today on Slide 11. You're well below the national average in most jurisdictions on bills. So maybe contextualize, there's a lot of increase in CapEx here and really good rate base growth. Have you sort of laid out what that increase would be the customer builds over the course of the forecast?\nBob Frenzel: Yes. Look, I think that we sit in a really good starting position, as you mentioned, and it's for a host of reasons, obviously. And as we move forward through time, we actually think the bill impacts are relatively benign as well. We sit in a region that is incredibly advantaged for renewables. And so this opportunity to invest in clean generation and maybe even fractions of the cost that other parts of the country see is really what helps us keep bills low for our customers. But there's a couple of other mechanisms. Obviously, we've been very prudent in managing our operating expenses over a decade and that helps keep bills well below the average. I think we have very proactive and productive energy efficiency and demand management programs, which help our customers manage the size of their energy usage and obviously, the access to lower-cost energy helps along the way. So these are the programs that we think help keep build down. I think probably the best thing we've done is we filed in our Colorado just transition solicitation proceeding, we filed a 20-year plan in Colorado that incorporates all the investment that's expected in Colorado over that period and yielded a customer bill increase of about 2.2% over that long duration. It will be ups and downs from that number and it won't be linear along the way, but we think it's relatively manageable. And we're always looking for ways to mitigate even those types of increases through. Again, very aggressive cost management. Our 1X LNG Way program I mentioned in my remarks, has delivered real benefits and avoided costs to our operating expense line and to our fuel line.\nBrian Van Abel: Yes. I'd just add, I think that's something we're really proud of. You mentioned Slide 11, but the slide before that around all residential share of wallet is something we're really proud of. Our bills on inflation-adjusted are lower than they were a decade ago. And then if you look at our two biggest jurisdictions, Colorado's second lowest of the country in share of wallet, Minnesota is fifth loss in the country in share of wallet. So we're starting from a really good place too, as we think about the significant investment cycle. So I appreciate the question on that.\nRoss Fowler: Thanks, Brian. Thanks, Bob. Great update today.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sophie Karp from KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nSophie Karp: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Congrats on a great update around here. A couple of questions for me. You guys have a couple of settlements in front of the Minnesota Commission. One is the resource plan gas rate case. Any reason to kind of think that some items in those two maybe controversial and caused some delay in the settlement approval?\nBrian Van Abel: Hey, Sophie, good morning. Let me take first one Minnesota gas case, unanimous settlement, I think, is very straightforward. ALJ recommended approval of our settlement this month. And so we expect the commission decision in Q1, so certainly optimistic that it will be approved. On the resource plan, I think, again, those \u2013 a resource settlement with the major stakeholders interveners in that document. I think it really demonstrates kind of our work with our stakeholders going forward, a settlement that not only addresses the resource plan into really an expeditious manner, which is great to see, but also resolves one of our RFPs outstanding. So overall, I think we're pretty excited about the work in partnership with our stakeholders and the resource plan and hopeful the Minnesota Commission, which would be a Q1 event, too.\nSophie Karp: Great. Great. Great. Thank you. And then on kind of like an wildfires, I know industry have been talking for a while about legislative solutions to that. I'm just kind of curious if you have any insight into which states where you operate or other states maybe in the West may take that up and come like session? Is there any kind of data points on that right now?\nBob Frenzel: Sophie, its Bob. From a regulatory perspective, obviously, we think Colorado will take up, and we expect a decision in our wildfire proceeding in August of this year \u2013 we, sorry, August of next year. Our resiliency plan in Texas, the commission has been working through those dockets very efficiently. So we expect outcomes in Texas next year as well. On the legislative front, I think that's probably a longer burn candle, making sure we look at the legislation in all the states, I think it's topical for certainly all the Western states as we move through time. I'm not certain, I'd suggest there's a lot of outcomes that we expect in 2025, but a lot of dialogue around how do we protect customers and communities in those states.\nBrian Van Abel: Yes. I'll just add, a lot of focus on education with our stakeholders and our legislature's partner in Colorado, and we're also working with our pure utilities in Texas on that front in terms of talking to stakeholders on Texas. It's also one of EEI's primary topics and issues that they're looking to address. So very topical for our industry, and we'll continue to work with our states to see if there's longer-term solutions.\nSophie Karp: Thank you. Appreciate the color.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Travis Miller with Morningstar. Please go ahead.\nTravis Miller: Good morning. Thank you.\nBob Frenzel: Hey Travis.\nTravis Miller: I know this is no longer the hot topic, but green hydrogen, I wondering if you had any update on where you all stand. I know that was a big initiative for you at least several quarters ago. Does it show up in pluses or minuses show up in the new investment plan, hydrogen hubs, any updates just generally on the green hydrogen initiatives?\nBob Frenzel: Yes. Thanks for the question. You're right. It's sort of been a bit on the back burner for the company and probably for the country as well. We're still seeing progress made in Europe around hydrogen. I saw a big energy pipeline complex get approved in Germany. This has been a big priority for the DOE, and I've been on record saying that the country needs a cleaner molecule. And hydrogen is probably the most flexible one that we've seen. And whether it's used in its pure form as green hydrogen or it's combined with CO2 to make something more like a clean fuel, like a green methane. I think that we're going to need a molecule like that in the country for industrial processes. It has slowed down in its initiatives. We were a recipient of a hydrogen grant with the DOE and that work continues, albeit fairly slowly. And we're still really waiting on regulations coming out of treasury final regulations on 45Q that would be on the production tax credit for hydrogen. So a little bit back burner for us. I still think \u2013 I think it's a promising technology. And as you look at the increase in growth that we're seeing across the country in terms of electricity, firming up wind and solar is going to need to happen. It's likely to happen with gas and batteries in the short-term. And over the longer term, maybe a combustion turbine fired on a cleaner fuel is the path forward. And so like we're seeing the acceleration in nuclear R&D, you might see some acceleration in green hydrogen, R&D and advancements in the cost curve because I think the need is going to be higher as we move forward in time.\nTravis Miller: And nothing is included in our capital forecast for hydrogen?\nBob Frenzel: Nothing.\nTravis Miller: Nothing. Did I hear you, is that right?\nBob Frenzel: Correct.\nTravis Miller: Okay. Okay. And then you kind of answered my question, but the resource plans, then it's too early to expect any kind of green hydrogen.\nBob Frenzel: Yes that's correct.\nTravis Miller: Okay. Okay. That's all I have. Thanks so much.\nBob Frenzel: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.\nPaul Patterson: Hey good morning.\nBob Frenzel: Hey Paul.\nPaul Patterson: Just back to the, I guess, Ross's question on the rate trajectory, I guess. You guys think you guys mentioned 2.2% in Colorado. Is that over the next few years? That sounds like a long-term thing. I'm just wondering just \u2013 I know you guys have a difference in expectation in terms of sales growth and what have you. And I would assume that would offset a lot of this over the next few years, is that kind of the area we should be thinking about just rough obviously, it's going to vary. But is that kind of roughly what we should be expecting around your service territories in the next three years or so just in that neighborhood?\nBrian Van Abel: Hey Paul, this is Brian. What Bob was mentioning was in our Colorado resource plan, we filed a longer-term rate trajectory that encompasses all of our expected investments over. It was a five-, 10-, 15- and 20-year period Bob was mentioning the 20-year numbers where you had a 2.2% rate growth over that time period, so right in line with inflation. And that included rate base growth of 9%, so significant investment. And that was the retail sales growth of roughly 5% for the time frame helped to offset that, which is really a point is those large loads can help provide customer headroom and bill headroom for all of their customers. And so a good piece of analysis that we included in our Colorado resource plan. I think over the next five years, look it's going to vary by jurisdiction. Over the next five years, we're roughly seeing about a 3% bill impact which we think is very manageable longer-term opportunity as we showed in the Colorado resource plan to have the large \u2013 to have kind of customer bill headroom created from the significant growth we're seeing across different industries.\nPaul Patterson: Okay. And then just on Slide 9 and the sort of the potential there on data centers. Just could you just remind me what that means? These customer requests and I guess sort of the cadence that we might see in terms of, I mean, just there's a huge delta between the two. Just if you could, I'm sorry, if you could just sort of elaborate a little bit more on that, what that...\nBrian Van Abel: Sure. That's \u2013 when you think of that as our pipeline of requests that we've actually taken in our \u2013 from our economic development team. But then it's \u2013 then we \u2013 how we get down to the high probability lowered is what Bob talked a little bit about is through publicly announced projects, we signed agreements whether they've acquired land or purchased from us and we're close to signing maybe in the next 12 months. So that's kind of how we bring that down to that 2.6% growth that we include on that slide. What this also demonstrates is if a high probability load doesn't come to a first on, there's a significant pipeline behind it. So not only do we think that's conservative, but we also see this growth extending beyond 2029. We just give you a five-year sales growth number, and we expect that to continue to build in our opportunity where we're focused on is continuing to help serve these data center customers in the long-term.\nBob Frenzel: Awesome. That's the sort of the very specific company answer. I think what you're seeing, though, is obviously big demand across the country. And we know there's double counting in a lot of people's inbound requests as these large loads come looking for transmission and generation service, but it highlights a different need, which is we as a country, we as an industry need to be accelerating our ability to develop both transmission and generation to serve the load that we think is on the come. And on the face of it, it's a meaningful load. It's a little more concentrated. If you can provide it across the entire country, it seems manageable as you get into very specific load pockets, it comes with a lot of need and a lot of speed that's needed. And so we think about a pace and a scale of both investments to meet this need as a company and as a country, and partnerships with our stakeholders and local communities, regulators, legislators coming together to make sure that we can solve this opportunity for the country as we see it. And as you mentioned, rising tide lifts all ships. If we have a higher load factor on our system, that brings the per unit cost down for everybody. And so today, if the country has a load factor in the 40% to 50% with high load factor customers like these with EVs charging at night with other high intensive energy loads, I think that is an opportunity for us to mitigate cost increases across the entire country as we transition both our transmission and generation footprint for the next generation. I'm excited about it. I really am. It's an opportunity that we're going to have to step into very quickly and in partnership with a lot of people and some new people at the table, but I'm excited about all of it.\nPaul Patterson: Awesome. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you very much. As we have no further questions in the queue, I would like to turn it back over to CFO, Brian Van Abel, for any closing remarks.\nBrian Van Abel: Yes. Thank you all for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions.\nOperator: Thank you very much. That concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Bob Frenzel",
            "content": "Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we delivered another quarter of solid operational and financial progress. We continue to deploy capital for the benefit of our customers and communities and we enable a future power by cleaner fuels and a more resilient and intelligent grid. We partner with stakeholders to encourage economic development, and we provide products and services capable of meeting our customers' most important needs. In the most recent quarter, we invested $2 billion in resilient and reliable energy infrastructure. We delivered ongoing earnings of $1.25 per share for our owners. We provided industry-leading storm response and strong customer reliability despite challenging conditions, and we accelerated our wildfire risk reduction measures to enable safer and more resilient communities. Xcel Energy's commitment to our communities and investors is anchored by our core investment thesis as a clean energy leader. For more than two decades, we've provided \u2013 we've been a leading provider of wind energy and with our filed resource plans we expect to stay in that position. We've delivered on our earnings guidance for 19 straight years, one of the best records in the industry and looking to make it 20 this year. We have a long-term and transparent growth plan, making investments in clean generation, new and enhanced energy grids and economic development programs to support our community's vitality. We've deepened our commitment to serve and support customer needs efficiently. For example, since 2020, our continuous improvement programs have saved almost $0.5 billion in O&M expense while improving operating outcomes and reducing risk. In addition, we've kept our O&M costs significantly below the rate of inflation over the last 10 years. And our Steel for Fuel strategy has delivered more than $4 billion in customer fuel-related savings since 2017. And finally, this discipline, alongside support of state and federal policies enable us to reduce emissions and keep residential electric and natural gas bills 28% and 14% below the industry average and growth well under the rate of inflation. We're $0.16 ahead of 2023 year-to-date earnings, and as a result, we are reaffirming our 2024 guidance of $3.50 to $3.60 per share, and we are initiating our 2025 earnings guidance range of $3.75 to $3.85 per share. And today, we're introducing our updated 5-year $45 billion capital investment plan, which centers on four key areas. Clean Energy, which continues investment in generation that provides customers with a secure and clean energy future while helping our states and our customers meet their ambitious policy goals. Customer electrification, which helps customers electrify their transportation needs, transitioning homes and businesses away from fossil fuel heating and converting fossil fuel loads to clean electric power loads. New load growth, which expands our electric system to support customers surging demand and requirements over the next decade and beyond and safety and reliability, which modernizes and hardens our system to ensure continued safe operations and address increasing risks from severe weather. There's a lot of focus across our industry and country regarding data centers. Xcel Energy has nearly 9,000 megawatts of opportunities in our customer pipeline before 2030. The scale of this pipeline gives us the ability to thoughtfully negotiate agreements that deliver the energy and capacity needed to important new customers in the region while protecting Xcel Energy and its customers and ensuring lasting relationships with our data center customers, ensures that new data center load that's brought onto our system benefits all customers. It drives load growth to our increasingly decarbonized energy system, generates economic growth in vitality in our communities and delivers on the national imperative to support a domestic data center industry. As a result of these guiding principles, we anticipate we will secure contracts with about 25% of this pipeline in the five-year forecast period. We also expect these opportunities to continue to grow and the need extends well past the next decade. We previously signed data center agreements with Meta and QTS and completed land sales with entities, including Microsoft to support new facilities. In October, a new data center customer completed a land acquisition in our service territory, and we're in the final stages of signing service contracts with that party. Turning to the supply side of the equation, we continued progress during the quarter on our clean energy transition through multiple resource planning and RFP processes. We reached a settlement in our Upper Midwest resource plan. And as part of that settlement, 720 megawatts of company-owned natural gas CTs and battery investments were selected. In addition, the agreement reflects the need for an incremental 4,200 megawatts of wind, solar and storage a portion of which is included in existing RFP solicitations. The settlement is pending a decision by the Minnesota Commission, which is expected in the first quarter of 2025. In October, we made a new energy resource filing in Colorado called the Just Transition solicitation. Our projections indicate the need for up to 14,000 megawatts of new generation to meet the phase out of our coal plants to accommodate increasing demand from data centers and to achieve state and customer emissions goals. We anticipate a decision on that filing in fall of 2025 with RFPs to be issued in early 2026. And we're working on our solicitation and SPS which could ultimately yield more than 5,000 megawatts of renewable and firm dispatchable generation. These are due in January of next year, and we expect commission approvals in 2026. Protecting our customers from the threats of extreme weather also remains a top priority. In August, severe thunderstorms brought heavy rain, hail and winds of over 60 miles an hour to customers in Minnesota and Wisconsin. Xcel Energy employees and contractors safely and promptly restored power to over 250,000 customers who lost service during those storms. We're thankful for the dedication of our employees and contractors that ensure that our communities continue to have safe and reliable service that they expect from Xcel Energy. In addition, we'd like to thank our crews who've worked tirelessly to provide mutual aid assistance to other utilities to support recovery and restoration efforts from the devastating hurricanes Helene and Milton. And regarding wildfire risk reduction, we continue to make progress on our accelerated wildfire mitigation efforts as well as our Colorado wildfire mitigation plan filing. In the fourth quarter, we anticipate filing our Texas resiliency plan, which will include wildfire mitigation in the Southwest. Finally, turning to a tradition that I'm very proud, during the third quarter, nearly 2,200 volunteers from Xcel Energy in our communities took action to support nonprofit organizations during our 14th annual day of service. Volunteers dedicated almost 8,000 hours to support 125 projects for nonprofits across our eight states. We're grateful to the thousands of volunteers and nonprofits that come together year-after-year to put good energy into action that fuels growth influences change and lifts up our neighbors. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian. Good morning, Nick. And Nick, just to answer, I think, probably part two of a three-part question was, is it included in our forecast, so we've got about a quarter of that 9,000 megawatts are included in our five-year sales forecast. This land acquisition would be one of the projects that would be a part of that forecast. Obviously, we think that this is a trend that's likely to continue in our regions for a lot of reasons, and we have real confidence in our ability to meet that forecast as well as to continue to see sales growth transition into our regions over time. Good morning. We can hear you. Yes, great questions. Appreciate it. I've said before, I'm very proud of the activities and the accomplishments that the company has executed to protect our customers and our communities since the March time frame. I think we've really built a lot of muscle around our wildfire protection mechanisms. First and foremost is operating the system with safety and so our capabilities in both enhanced power line safety settings and our abilities to execute PSPS is first and foremost in our minds of what helps protect our customers and communities in that process. I think we built a lot of muscle and capability there. Over time, we know that we have to harden the system and segment the system, and we take a lot of lessons learned from our peers in California and what they've done in terms of situational awareness, the ability to see whether coming sooner, the ability to alert their customers faster and more confidently in their ability to segment the system, so that the impacts of EPSS or PSPS are mitigated or muted in that process. We've been working on the intelligence side of that. We've installed AI cameras. We're starting to look at weather stations, and starting to incorporate other data feeds in this time frame. And again, huge benefits from being a fast follower here to what other people have plowed ground on and learnings that they've had over a decade of dealing with this kind of risk. And then with \u2013 on the regulatory side, obviously, we're moving forward with our wildfire plan in Colorado in a system resiliency plant in Texas. All of those will help us to accelerate pole inspections, accelerated replacements of anything that we see out there, more aggressive vegetation management. So I think we've done a lot to protect the system in the short-term. And I think our actions as we go forward are going to be very much focused on how we mitigate the impacts on our customers over the long-term and making sure that we have a resilient and safe system into the future. Hey, good morning, Jeremy. Jeremy, just to add on to Brian's comments, I'm really excited. We're starting to see this energy transition we've been talking about and working on for the past five years, really start to accelerate as we start to get to the periods where we're proactively removing our coal plants from the system and replacing them with cleaner and, in some cases, lower cost generation resources. Brian is right, the development team that we've built in-house, starting with our 2017 steel for fuel plan has been an incredible asset for the company. I'd be remiss if I didn't talk about our transmission capabilities. Obviously, we have a lot of transmission to build in the company and across the country. We've been the leading provider of new line miles of transmission over the last 15 years as a company. And with all the projects we mentioned here, whether it's the Colorado Power pathway, whether it's LRTP2.0, 2.1 billion the ITP process in the Southwest. We've got a terrific transmission development construction team here that are helping us execute on a very strategic asset for the company and the country. Look, I'd suggest \u2013 sorry, Julien, it's Bob. Thanks for the question. First of all, as I think about wildfire current proceedings as well as litigation and long-term outcomes in our states. I feel confident in our wildfire position, both from my comments earlier on what we're doing to protect the customers and the community going forward. as well as our position is unchanged as it pertains to our litigation matters, both in the Southwest and in Colorado regarding Marshall and Smokehouse Creek, long-term, I think we're doing the right things in the system to harden it and protect our customers. There's obviously some investment that's needed there. I would suggest that obviously 6% to 8% is an ongoing earnings number. And if we had an unexpected outcome in any of the proceedings, we'd have to accommodate that. But our position has been \u2013 we didn't work \u2013 we didn't act negligently in our systems in the Smokehouse Creek. Our accruals are consistent quarter-over-quarter and within our limits of our insurance and we look forward to working through those proceedings and really getting behind us and starting to partner with our communities as we move forward in time with our resiliency plans. So look, I think quickly, and I mean that in a \u2013 the \u2013 we have the capability to do the PSPS today. We have the capability to do EPSS today as we think \u2013 and every single day, we do a wildfire risk assessment on the conditions across our system across all eight states and make decisions on how we position the system, how we set up breakers and how we set up controls. I think probably the difference between where we sit and where some of our peers in California said, is the granularity with which we can do that. Our protection may come at an entire feeder level, which might be a 10-mile long stretch of distribution line. Our goal in the future is to be able to segment that distribution line into much more manageable, maybe one mild chunk instead of one 10-mile chunks so that we can be more targeted with the protections and more protective of customers. So I think as the final analysis is we have great sort of bulk protection systems. And we need to get \u2013 I would say, we're working with a sledgehammer today. We need a scalpel in the future, and that takes investments over time. But I think from a true protection mechanism, we've got a lot of the capabilities that we need. It's just a little bit blunter than we'd like. Good morning, Ross. Okay. Ross, it's Bob. Let me try and address what I think your question is, first of all, in Marshall, let's start with, we don't think we acted negligently. We know that the fire was started on the 12 tribes property, the first ignition occurred there, we don't believe we acted negligently in the operation of our system and we dispute the Sheriff's Report that we called the second ignition. Notwithstanding, obviously, the litigation persists and the structure of the trial was architected in the judge's orders about a month ago. And so the way they've constructed it is, the first trial will determine liability and the issue did Xcel Energy's equipment start a second ignition as part of the process of the overall fire. We'll use a second trial, if necessary, to determine damages and then each individual claimant is going to have to prove up their own damages, and we're not going to have sort of a blanket claim or a blanket number applied to any challenges. So yes, we think that the trial structure was constructive from the judge's perspective. So that's what happened in September. I'm not certain if I answered your question or not. So we're in diligence right now, heavy diligence, the trial set for next September for a couple of weeks. So I think we've got a while before there are any real milestones in the trial going forward. Yes. Look, I think that we sit in a really good starting position, as you mentioned, and it's for a host of reasons, obviously. And as we move forward through time, we actually think the bill impacts are relatively benign as well. We sit in a region that is incredibly advantaged for renewables. And so this opportunity to invest in clean generation and maybe even fractions of the cost that other parts of the country see is really what helps us keep bills low for our customers. But there's a couple of other mechanisms. Obviously, we've been very prudent in managing our operating expenses over a decade and that helps keep bills well below the average. I think we have very proactive and productive energy efficiency and demand management programs, which help our customers manage the size of their energy usage and obviously, the access to lower-cost energy helps along the way. So these are the programs that we think help keep build down. I think probably the best thing we've done is we filed in our Colorado just transition solicitation proceeding, we filed a 20-year plan in Colorado that incorporates all the investment that's expected in Colorado over that period and yielded a customer bill increase of about 2.2% over that long duration. It will be ups and downs from that number and it won't be linear along the way, but we think it's relatively manageable. And we're always looking for ways to mitigate even those types of increases through. Again, very aggressive cost management. Our 1X LNG Way program I mentioned in my remarks, has delivered real benefits and avoided costs to our operating expense line and to our fuel line. Sophie, its Bob. From a regulatory perspective, obviously, we think Colorado will take up, and we expect a decision in our wildfire proceeding in August of this year \u2013 we, sorry, August of next year. Our resiliency plan in Texas, the commission has been working through those dockets very efficiently. So we expect outcomes in Texas next year as well. On the legislative front, I think that's probably a longer burn candle, making sure we look at the legislation in all the states, I think it's topical for certainly all the Western states as we move through time. I'm not certain, I'd suggest there's a lot of outcomes that we expect in 2025, but a lot of dialogue around how do we protect customers and communities in those states. Hey Travis. Yes. Thanks for the question. You're right. It's sort of been a bit on the back burner for the company and probably for the country as well. We're still seeing progress made in Europe around hydrogen.

We were a recipient of a hydrogen grant with the DOE and that work continues, albeit fairly slowly. And we're still really waiting on regulations coming out of treasury final regulations on 45Q that would be on the production tax credit for hydrogen. So a little bit back burner for us. I still think \u2013 I think it's a promising technology. And as you look at the increase in growth that we're seeing across the country in terms of electricity, firming up wind and solar is going to need to happen. It's likely to happen with gas and batteries in the short-term. And over the longer term, maybe a combustion turbine fired on a cleaner fuel is the path forward. And so like we're seeing the acceleration in nuclear R&D, you might see some acceleration in green hydrogen, R&D and advancements in the cost curve because I think the need is going to be higher as we move forward in time. Nothing. Correct. Yes that's correct. Thanks. Hey Paul. Awesome. That's the sort of the very specific company answer. I think what you're seeing, though, is obviously big demand across the country.

            "content": "Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Starting with our financial results, Xcel Energy had ongoing earnings of $1.25 per share for the third quarter of 2024 compared to ongoing earnings of $1.23 per share in 2023. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter included the following: outcomes from rate cases and nonfuel riders increased earnings by $0.25 per share and higher AFUDC increased earnings by $0.04 per share. Offsetting these positive drivers were higher O&M expenses decreased earnings by $0.09 per share. Higher depreciation and amortization decreased earnings by $0.08 per share, reflecting our capital investment programs. Higher interest charges decreased earnings by $0.08 per share, driven by rising interest rates and increased debt levels to fund capital investments and other items increased earnings by $0.02 per share. Turning to sales, year-to-date weather and leap year adjusted electric sales increased 0.2%. However, third quarter weather adjusted sales increased 1.3%, based on our forecast, we are reaffirming our full year guidance of a 1% increase in weather-adjusted electric sales. Our new five-year plan includes 5% per year electric sales growth, of which approximately 50% is from data centers with other growth coming from the oil and gas industry and EVs. Our sales forecast only assumes contracted or high-probability data centers. We also large data center \u2013 we also expect that large data center low growth will continue beyond our five-year plan, and there is upside to what we have included. Year-to-date, O&M increased $58 million, primarily driven by increased generation maintenance, damage prevention, wildfire mitigation and storm expenses. In addition, we are facing increased costs from our recent excess liability insurance renewal. As such, we are revising our full year O&M forecast to 3% to 4% increase relative to 2023. During the quarter, we also made progress in several rate cases. Earlier this month, the Colorado Commission completed deliberations on our natural gas rate case, which reflects an estimated rate increase of approximately $130 million which includes $15 million of incremental depreciation that was not included in our original request. The decision was based on a historic test year with an average rate base and a weighted average cost of capital of 7%, reflecting an ROE range of 9.2% to 9.5% and an equity ratio of 52% to 55%. Rates will go into effect in November. In early November, we plan to file a Minnesota Electric Rate Case, seeking a rate increase of $490 million over two years based on an ROE of 10.3% and a 52.5% equity ratio. We're also requesting interim rates of $224 million to go in effect in January of 2025. The final decision is expected in 2026. We continue to make progress in the Smokehouse Creek wildfire claims process. We've settled 86 of the 179 submitted claims, which we view as a positive and constructive outcome, 23 lawsuits have also been filed. In addition, there is no change to our estimated accrued liability of $215 million. As a reminder, we have approximately $500 million of excess liability insurance coverage for this fire. Shifting to our investment plans, we provided an updated $45 billion five-year base capital expenditure forecast, which reflects annual rate base growth of 9.4%. These investments are critical to serve growing electric demand, meet clean energy goals and ensure system safety and reliability. We have an additional $10 billion plus pipeline of potential investment, which we view as conservative and could be significantly higher. This additional capital reflects generation from RFPs and resource plans, low growth from data centers and beneficial electrification and additional transmission, including opportunities from MISO Tranche 2 and the Southwest Power Pool. We also refreshed our base financing plan which reflects approximately $19 billion of debt and $4.5 billion of equity. We anticipate that any incremental capital investment will be funded by approximately 40% equity and 60% debt. It's important to recognize we've always maintained a balanced financing strategy, which includes a mix of debt and equity to fund accretive growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet and credit metrics. As a result, you'll notice we issued $1.1 billion of equity via our ATM program this year. This equity issuance is not part of our 2025 to 2029 financing plan, and reflects our commitment to credit quality while delivering on our long-term financial objectives. Maintaining solid credit ratings and favorable access to capital markets are critical to fund the clean energy transition, deliver strong shareholder returns and keep customer bills low. Moving to earnings, we are reaffirming our 2024 ongoing earnings guidance range of $3.50 to $3.60 per share. We are also initiating our 2025 earnings guidance range of $3.75 to $3.85 per share, which reflects 7% growth from the midpoint of 2024 guidance. Key assumptions are detailed in our earnings release. We are updating our long-term EPS growth objective to 6% to 8% with expectations to deliver earnings in the upper half of the range. The increase in the EPS growth rate reflects our significant investment pipeline and confidence in our financial outlook. We also modified our dividend growth objective to 4% to 6%, with the expectation to be at the low end of the range. A lower dividend growth rate allows us to retain additional cash flow to fund growth and lowers equity funding needs. In addition, that will lower our dividend payout ratio over time, which provides greater financial flexibility and drive power for the future. With that, I will wrap up with a quick summary. We reached a settlement in our Minnesota resource plan and filed our latest Colorado resource plan, which allow us to lead the clean energy transition, ensuring customer affordability and reliability, while driving economic growth. We continue to make progress on our wildfire mitigation plans, which reduced risk from extreme weather. We announced an updated capital investment program that provides strong, transparent rate base growth and significant customer value. We provided a balanced financing plan to fund accretive growth, while maintaining a strong balance sheet and credit metrics. We are on track to meet our 2024 ongoing earnings guidance and have provided 2025 guidance consistent with our growth objectives. And we revised our long-term earnings growth to the upper half of the 6% to 8% objective range and dividend growth to the low end of the 4% to 6% objective range, which is indicative of our significant capital investment pipeline. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions. Hey Nick. Good morning. Undisclosed customer, but yes, it was in Minnesota. And that's one of the, call it, as we think about high probability loads. We've been, as you can imagine, in active discussions with them and significant progress on services agreement. So, great to see the continued progress we have on the data center front. And so I mean, we're getting into as part of the negotiations, you get into rate design and in terms of pricing, but I think, it's important as Bob laid out the guiding principles and how we think about it and ensuring that all of our customers benefit from these large loads that come on, sort of help drive economic growth for our state, but also benefits all of our customers. I think it's just something I'm not sure if people caught it, but there was a planning session at the Minnesota Commission on Tuesday that included the data centers, IBEW, Department of Commerce, us, and other significant stakeholders, talking about how do we support and move faster on the data center front. And so, we're pretty excited about those conversations. It's not really constructive and look forward to working with our commission on these opportunities. Yes, Nick, thanks for the question. Yes, as you can see, we did about $1 billion of ATM issuance in Q3. So certainly, a very strong quarter for us. And that does fulfill our equity needs for the year. That's our plan for the year. Now it doesn't mean that we can't be opportunistic if we think through the end of the year, we like something, actually, we don't need to do anything through the end of the year. Second part of your question, look, we view an ATM, and we've always talked about this, is it's an efficient mechanism to get our equity issuances one. But it doesn't mean we won't look at all other products and options on the table as we move forward. Yes. Hey Steve, a couple of things, and thanks for the question. One, you're right. Generally, we guide investors to a 40%-60% mix. Part of that is we do get a little bit of benefit as we lower the dividend growth rate that I talked about that helps a little bit in the five-year, but also gives us more dry powder longer term. But it's really about kind of the cash flow and the timing of the capital. And if you look at how we design it, when we put together that slide around the credit metrics, our credit metrics are very stable. Generally, still going forward, we expect that 40%-60% mix, but we were able to be a little bit flexible here and not have as much equity as we need it as we roll forward our five-year. Hey Steve, I'll handle that second part of the question around just insurance deferrals. We completed our insurance renewable is this month, premiums are significantly higher as we kind of alluded to in Q2. We saw premiums triple on us capacity did shrink some. So we do have \u2013 we have a regulatory deferral docket in front of the Colorado Commission where they have a sudden expedited schedule to get decision by the end of the year. And we're in discussions with our peer utilities and staff in Texas around the industry issue around increasing excess liability premium. So we do include constructive regulatory outcomes in our 2025 guidance, and that is included getting recovery of our deferrals and constructive cost recovery around our wildfire mitigation plan is an overall part of our constructive regulatory outcomes for 2025. No, Carly, you're exactly right. It's just a function of rolling forward and having a bigger base as we roll forward to the next five years. So that's all it is a function of nothing else going on. Yes, Carly, I think if you look at our 2025 guidance, our sales guidance is 3% for 2025 and expect it to go up there to 5% to 8% in the years after that and really peaking in 2020 as we see it and that's really driven by, like I said, kind of a combination, which is what we view as a great to have the diversity. Half of that sales growth of the 5% is coming from data centers. But we also have significant growth in the oil and gas region in SPS out of the Permian Basin, and we're starting to see the effects of beneficial electrification around EVs and other BE in Colorado that helps driving kind of the other part of that growth. So I think we see kind of more kind of middle to back end weighted, but also having this diversity in growth is helpful in the overall plan. Yes. Hey, Jeremy, good morning. I think about it in two ways is one, if you just look at our base plan, the majority of that capital is investing in our wires business, right? We're focused on that kind of safety and resiliency in our wires business, and that base plan drives 9% \u2013 9.4% rate base growth. But then it's all about the additional steel underground related to the projects we need to deliver on retiring our coal plants, as Bob talked about, and executing on 5%-plus electric growth. So we view that as a tremendous opportunity. We've talked \u2013 Bob talked about our resource plans in flight. When you add all those up, there's between 15,000 and nearly 30,000 megawatts of generation we need to add to our system to serve our customers over the call through 2030. So a huge opportunity. And I think the other part is we've demonstrated through the RFP process recently, that can be extremely competitive in these generation procurement processes that we have a top-tier internal regulated development team that can bring projects that are very competitively priced. And so we expect to build a now, and I would say, at least $10 billion of those pipeline of projects. And that's why we're sitting here very confident about not only the next five years, but longer-term executing at an upper half of the range and potentially going above it. Yes. So let's hit the first ones that are more near-term. MISO tranche 2.1, which we should get a decision by the end of the year. Then we'll need to go through the regulatory approval processes. But that's roughly about $2 billion of transmission opportunities. We got the SPP, ITP that was just approved by the Board this month. That's another about $2 billion of projects that we expect to be awarded to us because of reliability-driven projects, meaning that the need is within a few years. So those are kind of the transmission buckets. The SPS, RFP is another big bucket, 5,000 to 10,000 megawatts. We'll get bids in, in January. And the first look investors will probably get is roughly probably Q2 of next year when we file our preferred portfolio of New Mexico. So that will at least get some insight into that with approvals going into 2026 for that. The Minnesota resource plan, we should get a Q1 decision out of our commission on the overall resource plan, which includes, as Bob mentioned, 720 megawatts of storage and CTs in there, along with some additional RFPs we're working through. And then finally, related to Colorado. We just filed the Colorado resource plan, which we're pretty excited about with upwards of 14,000 megawatts in that we'll work through that resource plan, call it, within a year, and then we'll file RFPs. So that will be a little bit longer dated on all the opportunities. But you'll continue to see execution opportunities throughout the next 12 months to 24 months for us. Yes. Hey, good morning, Durgesh. Yes, I mean I think you've heard us before, we don't necessarily comment on \u2013 or give guidance on the timing of our equity, but here's the way to think about it is if you look at the shape of our annual CapEx over the next five years, that's a good way to assume it kind of follows that shape as our annual CapEx is larger in the first few years. So that's how I'd think about it. Yes, we've executed all of our credit sales for 2024, working on 2025 significant demand. And really, it's kind of in and out, right, in terms of seeing give the customer what the offset in revenue and then we used to pick it up on the tax line. So from a cash flow perspective in and out, we've had many discussions about this, I think we lost as leaders in this in terms of the opportunity. Also working with the large buyers of this. It's helpful to have \u2013 we have 17 Fortune 500 companies in our backyard here that we know extremely well. And so we're not only looking at 2025, but also longer-term deals and getting the pricing we expected. So I think, overall, we expect we'll be monetizing $700-plus million of credits annually going forward and the markets there, and it's been a great tool to have. Roughly $400 million to $500 million. Yes. And I think the other part is just that in terms of \u2013 I think you're asking a little bit about the multiplier effect where the actual jury would have to hear each award damages and can have a multiplier across all plaintiffs. So helpful. I'll come in that regard. Yes. I'd just add, I think that's something we're really proud of. You mentioned Slide 11, but the slide before that around all residential share of wallet is something we're really proud of. Our bills on inflation-adjusted are lower than they were a decade ago. And then if you look at our two biggest jurisdictions, Colorado's second lowest of the country in share of wallet, Minnesota is fifth loss in the country in share of wallet. So we're starting from a really good place too, as we think about the significant investment cycle. So I appreciate the question on that. Hey, Sophie, good morning. Let me take first one Minnesota gas case, unanimous settlement, I think, is very straightforward. ALJ recommended approval of our settlement this month. And so we expect the commission decision in Q1, so certainly optimistic that it will be approved. On the resource plan, I think, again, those \u2013 a resource settlement with the major stakeholders interveners in that document. I think it really demonstrates kind of our work with our stakeholders going forward, a settlement that not only addresses the resource plan into really an expeditious manner, which is great to see, but also resolves one of our RFPs outstanding. So overall, I think we're pretty excited about the work in partnership with our stakeholders and the resource plan and hopeful the Minnesota Commission, which would be a Q1 event, too. Yes. I'll just add, a lot of focus on education with our stakeholders and our legislature's partner in Colorado, and we're also working with our pure utilities in Texas on that front in terms of talking to stakeholders on Texas. It's also one of EEI's primary topics and issues that they're looking to address. So very topical for our industry, and we'll continue to work with our states to see if there's longer-term solutions. Hey Paul, this is Brian. What Bob was mentioning was in our Colorado resource plan, we filed a longer-term rate trajectory that encompasses all of our expected investments over. It was a five-, 10-, 15- and 20-year period Bob was mentioning the 20-year numbers where you had a 2.2% rate growth over that time period, so right in line with inflation. And that included rate base growth of 9%, so significant investment. And that was the retail sales growth of roughly 5% for the time frame helped to offset that, which is really a point is those large loads can help provide customer headroom and bill headroom for all of their customers. And so a good piece of analysis that we included in our Colorado resource plan. I think over the next five years, look it's going to vary by jurisdiction. Over the next five years, we're roughly seeing about a 3% bill impact which we think is very manageable longer-term opportunity as we showed in the Colorado resource plan to have the large \u2013 to have kind of customer bill headroom created from the significant growth we're seeing across different industries. Sure. That's \u2013 when you think of that as our pipeline of requests that we've actually taken in our \u2013 from our economic development team. But then it's \u2013 then we \u2013 how we get down to the high probability lowered is what Bob talked a little bit about is through publicly announced projects, we signed agreements whether they've acquired land or purchased from us and we're close to signing maybe in the next 12 months. So that's kind of how we bring that down to that 2.6% growth that we include on that slide. What this also demonstrates is if a high probability load doesn't come to a first on, there's a significant pipeline behind it. So not only do we think that's conservative, but we also see this growth extending beyond 2029. We just give you a five-year sales growth number, and we expect that to continue to build in our opportunity where we're focused on is continuing to help serve these data center customers in the long-term. Yes. Thank you all for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions."

Please note this conference is being recorded. And for the duration of the call, your lines will be in a listen-only mode. However, a question-and-answer session will follow-up at the prepared remarks and questions will only be taken from institutional investors and analysts, reporters can contact media relations with inquiries and individual investors and others can reach out to Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to hand the call over to your host, Mr. Paul Johnson, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations to begin today\u2019s conference. Please go ahead, sir.\nPaul Johnson: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2024 second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Bob Frenzel, Chairman, President and President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer questions if needed. This morning, we will review our 2024 second quarter results and highlights and share recent business developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder, some comments made during today's call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and SEC filings. Today, we'll also discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures. Information on comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bob.\nBob Frenzel: Thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that the company delivered another quarter of solid operational and financial progress. Our long-term business model remains robust. We continue to deploy capital for the benefit of our customers and communities. We enable a future powered by cleaner fuels and a more resilient and intelligent grid. We partner with stakeholders to encourage economic development, we provide products and services capable of meeting our customers' most important needs. In the most recent quarter, we invested $1.7 billion in resilient and reliable energy infrastructure. We delivered earnings per share of $0.54 for our owners. We provided industry-leading storm response and strong customer reliability despite challenging weather conditions for our customers. We accelerated wildfire risk reduction measures to enable safer and more resilient communities. Xcel Energy's commitment to our communities and investors is anchored by our core investment thesis as an integrated pure-play utility and a clean energy leader. For more than two decades, we've been a leading provider of wind energy to our customers, and we were the first US energy company to commit to a carbon-free electric future. We delivered our earnings guidance for 19 straight years, one of the best records in our industry, and we look to make it 20 this year. We have a long-term and transparent growth plan, making investments in clean generation new to and enhanced energy grids and economic development programs to support our communities vitality. In 2020, our continuous improvement programs have saved $400 million in recurring O&M expense, while improving operating outcomes and reducing enterprise risk. Our steel for fuel strategy delivered more than $4 billion in customer fuel-related savings since 2017. This discipline alongside support of state and federal policies enables us to reduce emissions and keep residential electric and natural gas bills 28% and 14% below the industry average and growth well below the rate of inflation. With our 11,000-plus employees commitment to serving customers, we're $0.14 ahead of 2023 year-to-date earnings, and as a result, we are reaffirming our 2024 earnings guidance. During the quarter, continued our progress on our clean energy transition through multiple resource planning and RFP processes. We issued an RFP for 1,600 megawatts of wind, solar, storage and hybrid resources in the Upper Midwest. These are due in September, we expect commission decisions in 2025. We now have active RFPs for over 4,000 megawatts of resources in the Upper Midwest . In Mexico and Texas, commissions approved 418 megawatts of company-owned solar generation that's expected to be in service between 2026 and 2027. And last week, we issued an RFP and SPS seeking 3,100 megawatts of accredited capacity which could ultimately yield more than 5,000 megawatts of renewables and firm dispatchable generation. Bids are due in January of 2025, and we expect commission approval in 2026. Last quarter, I discussed a number of initiatives that Xcel Energy is taking to reduce wildfire risk. I'm incredibly proud of what our team has been able to accomplish in a short amount of time. Since March, we've developed the capability to deliver enhanced daily wildfire safety operations across the enterprise as well as the ability to conduct proactive, public safety power shutoff as evidenced by recent events in Colorado, Texas and New Mexico during threatening conditions. We've accelerated pole inspections, including replacing priority 1 and priority 2 poles across our system. We're expanding visual coverage with our Pano AI-enabled camera system to over 50,000 square miles in Colorado, enabling first responders access to critical information, including precision triangulation and fire locations. And we've accelerated deployment of Technosylva's risk modeling system and expect it to have it operational enterprise-wide by the end of the year. We recently filed an updated Colorado wildfire mitigation plan that integrates industry experience incorporates evolving risk assessment methodologies, adds new technology and expands the scope, pace and scale of our programs to reduce wildfire risk. The plan has four primary programs that include enhanced situational awareness, the improved meteorology, area risk mapping and modeling, artificial intelligence cameras and continuous monitoring. Operational mitigations that include enhanced power line safety settings and public safety, power shutoff capabilities, system resiliency through increased asset assessment and remediation, Pole replacements, line rebuilds, targeted undergrounding and vegetation management and improved coordination, technology and real-time data sharing with customers and other stakeholders as well as PSPS resiliency rebates. We expect to file resiliency plans with SPS that will include wildfire mitigation later this year and are developing former wildfire mitigation plans for the rest of our states. Finally, we're working with stakeholders at both the state and federal level on legislation to enhance the safety of our communities from evolving weather risks while protecting the financial integrity of companies that provide these essential services. Moving to economic development. We're seeing a material shift in long-term electric demand on our system after several years of relatively flat sales growth. Our current five-year electric sales forecast assumes approximately 3% annual growth. Nearly half of that growth is driven by electrification of oil and natural gas production, electric vehicle adoption, and beneficial electrification, economic growth and increasing customer counts. The remainder of that growth is driven by contracted and high-probability data center load, including previously announced deals of Meta and Microsoft in Minnesota and QTS in Colorado as well as others. We believe this forecast is now conservative, given a pipeline of data center requests totaling 6,700 megawatts by 2030. If all of the data center requests came to fruition, our data center sales CAGR would be over 9%. We continue working through the request and plan on updating our sales and capital investment forecast on the third quarter call. Xcel Energy is strategically positioned to secure economic data center load with high-quality partners due to our access low-cost renewable generation, the availability of water and fiber infrastructure, unencumbered land and our speed to market. At the same time, we'll continue to focus on the impacts to all customers, ensuring we have both economic contracts and system resources to provide safe, clean and reliable power to our communities. During the quarter, there were two regulatory outcomes that provide for cleaner and more resilient electric and natural gas distribution system, First, Colorado passed a bill that enables qualified electric utilities to make necessary distribution investments with timely recover to achieve state policy goals, including transportation and building electrification and enabling distributed energy resources. This was the result of extensive stakeholder process supported by the Colorado Energy office, our IBW labor partners, environmental advocates, NRDC and WRA as well as the Colorado Solar and Storage Association and others. Second, the Colorado Commission approved the modified clean heat plant, which establishes a starting point for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from our natural gas distribution system. Full year budget of up to $441 million was approved, which sets funding primarily for beneficial electrification and natural gas efficiency. We look forward to working with the stakeholders and regulators to implement these initiatives to meet our long-term sustainability goals in Colorado. Finally, we recently released our 19th sustainability report. We're proud of our history at Xcel Energy. And as we look forward, we're committed to delivering the essential energy services our customers value and need while driving positive change that supports the environment and communities. I'm deeply appreciative thankful for the commitment and hard work of our employees and partners to deliver a clean energy future. We remain relentless in our pursuit of our vision and will continue to deliver long-term value to shareholders an affordable, reliable and sustainable energy for the communities in which we live work. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\nBrian Van Abel: Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Starting with our financial results. Xcel Energy had earnings of $0.54 per share for the second quarter of 2024 compared to $0.52 per share in 2023. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter included the following: revenues from electric rate cases and riders to recover capital investments combined to increase earnings by $0.26 per share. Higher AFUDC increased earnings by $0.04 per share, and revenues from natural gas rate cases increased earnings by $0.02 per share. Offsetting these positive drivers were higher depreciation and amortization decreased earnings by $0.18 per share, reflecting our capital investment programs. Higher interest charges decreased earnings by $0.07 per share. Higher O&M expenses decreased earnings by $0.04 per share and other factors combined to reduce earnings by $0.01 per share. Turning to our sales discussion. Year-to-date weather and leap year adjusted electric sales decreased by 0.4% and natural gas sales increased by 0.4%. We're updating our 2024 forecast to reflect a 1% increase for electric sales with expected increases in C&I load in the second half of the year. Longer term, we continue to see robust demand in our C&I sector, driven by data center loads in Minnesota and Colorado, along with oil natural gas electrification and SPS. During the quarter, we continued to make progress on a relatively light rate case calendar. In June, we reached an uncontested settlement in our Minnesota natural gas case, providing a $46 million rate increase based on a 9.6% ROE and a 52.5% equity ratio. The final commission decision is expected by year-end. In our Colorado natural gas rate case, we received intervener testimony in July. There's a settlement deadline at the end of August with hearing scheduled for September. We expect a commission decision in in the fourth quarter. And July, the Texas Commission approved our $13 million distribution rider request. This represents our first distribution rider requests in Texas, and we expect it will allow us to reduce the frequency of future rate cases. We also continue to make progress on the claims process for the Smokehouse Creek wildfire. We've received 141 claims, of which 43 have been settled, which we view as a positive and constructive outcome. 21 lawsuits have also been filed. In addition, there is no change to our estimate of our accrued liability of $215 million. As a reminder, we have approximately $500 million of excess liability insurance coverage for the fire. Finally, we are reaffirming our 2024 earnings guidance range of $3.50 to $3.60 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%. In addition, we've updated key assumptions to reflect the latest information, which are detailed in our earnings release. With that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. We continue to expect to deliver 2024 earnings within our guidance range as we have for the past 19 years. We're executing on our capital investment plan, including clean generation, transmission and distribution to support reliability and resiliency economic development to support our communities. We're proactively enhancing our wildfire mitigation actions to manage the risk to our systems to protect our customers from extreme weather. We remain confident we can deliver long-term earnings growth at or above the top end of our 5% to 7% range starting in 2025. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take questions.\nOperator: Thank you very much, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi. Good morning.\nBob Frenzel: Hey, good morning, Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: I just wanted to start off with the wildfires, if I could, and risk mitigation there. How do you think system risk stands now? How do you expect it to, I guess, improve over time with the wildfire mitigation plan, is were kind of even across the system? Or are there certain parts in focus? And then finally, it seems like there's some fires in Colorado right now. Just wondering if any of your equipment was involved in any way?\nBob Frenzel: Yes, I appreciate the question. Look, as I said in my prepared remarks, I'm really proud of what we're going to accomplish on the operational side to provide the real-time risk reduction that we need today to give us the time to make the necessary enhancements and system resiliency and hardening for our system over time. Clearly, we're further ahead in Colorado. We just filed our second wildfire mitigation plan, and we've been working on the first one for over four years. But that shouldn't be taken as anything other than a huge focus that we also have in Texas and in Mexico around our plans there. Our capability to do wildfire safety operations and PSPS exists on a daily basis across the entire enterprise, which drives real-time risk reduction. We're benefited as a company by all the hard work of the people that have come in front of us in California. We expect to dramatically reduce our wildfire risk based on their experiences and doing some of the lessons learned from all of those organizations. They've been more than accommodating and helping us and others across the country. And clearly, the need is there and evidence, we think there's a real supportive backdrop in our states to help us pursue these necessary investments to continue to risk reduce our business.\nBrian Van Abel: And Jeremy, this is Brian. Good morning. Just on the second part of your question about the current fires in Colorado, our assets were more than a mile away from any of those believed ignition points.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That\u2019s all very helpful. Thank you for that. And then I just wanted to pivot here a little bit to the data center opportunity, as you outlined there, it seems like the opportunities are accelerating from when you discussed it with the market. Just wondering if you could frame that a bit more what you're seeing and where across your footprint that's happening? And just any more color would be helpful.\nBob Frenzel: Yes, Jeremy, Bob again. Look, we're really excited about what we're seeing. Obviously, we believe we have a very attractive service territory across all 8 of our states for different reasons in all of them. But when we speak with hyperscalers and other data center developers, we have what they're looking for low-cost clean energy, access to fiber access to water and other infrastructure, human capital, land that makes us attractive. Right now, we're seeing most of opportunities materialize in the Minnesota and Colorado footprint, but our deeper backlog, I would say, is across all of our service territories in all of our states.\nBrian Van Abel: Yes, Jeremy, I can just expand on that a little bit. If you could pop the slide that we put in our earnings release today, which is updated from the data center slide that we had a couple of months ago. You can see it's a significant increase in the customer requests. As Bob said, the biggest opportunity was in Minnesota, now it's growing. We're seeing significant opportunity in Colorado now and even expanding outside of Minnesota and Wisconsin and South Dakota. And so we're working closely internally with our economic development team. We think about it as we're updating our long-term sales forecast right now, which will roll out in Q3. Our long-term sales forecast right now is in the 2% to 3% range. I would expect that to look more like the 4% to 5% range and our base long-term sales forecast when we roll that out as we incorporate some of these high probability loads into our five-year guidance. Just another good example about how we look to proactively work with our commissions. The Minnesota commission here in Minnesota has publicly stated, they didn't have planning sessions around how do we accommodate and meet this both economic development opportunity for our communities and also, how do we provide benefit to all of our current customers and create more opportunity for investment.\nBob Frenzel: And Jeremy, I think this is part of a much broader theme that I've been talking about as it pertains to our company. If you put those criteria that data centers are looking at today, I would suggest that's true for almost any energy-intensive industry and our view that they're at some point going to overly co-locate in parts of the country where energy costs are lower and green energy could be cleaner, and that sits right across the footprint that we straddle. And so, as you look at stuff like hydrogen and clean energy production, if we get to direct their capture as a means of carbon mitigation, you could see a lot of that headquarter in itself or locating itself in our backyard as well as other manufacturing probably where transportation isn't as critical. I think all of those are economic development opportunities that are not in our forecast but areas that we think should beneficially accrue to the parts of the country that we serve.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Great to hear. Big numbers there. Congrats. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks.\nOperator: Thanks very much for your questions, sir.\nBob Frenzel: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll move to Carly Davenport of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nCarly Davenport: Hey. Good morning. Thanks so much for taking my questions.\nBob Frenzel: Hey. Good morning, Carly.\nCarly Davenport: Good morning. Wanted to just follow-up on a couple of Jeremy's questions there. Maybe just first on the wildfire front, is there any sort of feedback from stakeholders, you can share so far on the wildfire mitigation plan you filed in Colorado? And then you had mentioned plans to file additional wildfire mitigation or system resiliency plans in other states. Can you just talk about what forms that might take and where you're most focused in the near-term?\nBrian Van Abel: Yes. Hey Carly, this is Brian. It's now early in the process in the wildfire mitigation plan filing in Colorado. We're just starting to see some discovery requests. But overall, we think about the work and the scope we're getting from, call it, the first few responders and the community has been positive. Our investment in the Pano AI cameras is already -- there's been some recent articles where has helped identify fires not started by the utility, but helped work very proactively with the first responders to get them out and mitigate fire risk and protect our communities and our customers. So, I think overall, it has been supportive. But again, like I said, early in the process. Kind of the next kind of pivoting to your second part of the question, is we're focusing on right now is developing our system resiliency plan in Texas, which is what will incorporate our wildfire mitigation plan. So that will be later this year and look for a similar filing in New Mexico later this year, too, and then working through what it will look like in Minnesota in the Midwest for wildfire mitigation plans. We can incorporate a lot of the wildfire mitigation plan into our multiyear rate case in Minnesota as we think about which we'll file in November of this year.\nCarly Davenport: Great. That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you for that. And then the second one is just on the load growth in the data center piece. Could you just talk a little bit about your process for working down the request into the pipeline? Or I guess, said another way, what is sort of your bar for including load in that near-term pipeline estimate, which goes into your broader load growth estimate?\nBrian Van Abel: Yes. So, if you think -- I'll give you a little bit of color. We kind of highlighted on that slide in our earnings deck is one. We have a contract with them, for example, QTS and Meta that's included in our five-year forecast. And then we have something called near-term pipeline which, for example, maybe we've sold a parcel of land to them. And what we consider is 80% probability. So very high probability that it's going to come into our sales forecast within the next five years. And this is working very closely with our operating companies and our economic development team with these customers. And then everything above that, we do not have in our sales forecast. So there's a huge opportunity above what we call 80% high probability load. And so that's a little bit of color. So, as we continue to kind of march through time, you think some of the stuff that we don't view as 80% probability today becomes more of an opportunity and we drop into that what we included in our base forecast.\nCarly Davenport: Got it. Okay. Thank you so much for the time.\nOperator: Our next question today will be coming from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning, team. Thanks guys very much. Good to chat again.\nBrian Van Abel: Hey, Julien congratulations, I heard you proud papa these days.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Thank you. Appreciate that. Absolutely. Guys Nicely done here. I got to say, lots on that pipeline. Maybe to pick up where Carly lifted off here on just kind of probability weighting here. How do you think about that filtering through your processes? For instance, I know you didn't emphasize as much the relative load growth of the SPS, for instance, in the context of data centers. But how do you think about even the numbers that you guys were throwing out there of the 5 gigawatt number getting updated here sort of pro forma for that process that you're working through right now? Effectively, as you probability weight and update with 4Q, how does that filter into the processes you already have in flight for procurement given what seems like a perhaps more pressing need to address the RFPs that would need to be necessary?\nBob Frenzel: Yes. Thanks, Julien, so I'll start and then Brian can add on. I think you know the company pretty well we've generally taken a pretty conservative approach to forecasting whether it was capital investment opportunities in this case, sales opportunities. Our process is alive and well right now and is geared towards a comprehensive update in the third quarter earnings call. And so we'd expect for, as Brian walked through the sales funnel on Carly's question and then the update on our capital forecast, whether that's the RFP results coming into our forecast whether that's new sales or whether that's capital needs driven by our wildfire mitigation plans, our needs to serve customers to the extent that we see high probability load growth that needs investment as well as all of our resiliency and reliability plans as we roll forward in time. So expect something at the end of the third quarter into the fourth quarter from us on a fulsome enterprise-wide look at all the parameters.\nBrian Van Abel: Julien, just let me add to that a little bit. If we think about all the RFPs we have in flight, for example, Minnesota. We have multiple RFPs in flight while we're looking at this potential new load that's rapidly evolving. So we have that opportunity as we go through these RFPs and we're in a resource plan filing with the Minnesota Commission, which we provided kind of what call a base view, but also in electrification in a high load view. So we have processes in flight that helps us move quickly on the staff and secure resources and work with our stakeholders, similar in SPS. We just followed an RFP for over 3,000 megawatts of accredited capacity. Now that was based on our resource plan in New Mexico that had a base plan, but also a high electrification plan working with all of our oil and gas customers. And that's why you see us talking about this 5,000 to 10,000 megawatt nameplate capacity range in SPS because we see that load up there, we're working with our oil and gas customers. So SPS is much more of an electrification in the oil and gas industry. Down there, we're in Colorado, Minnesota, in the Midwest is much more of a potential data center opportunity.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent, guys. Thank you. And then maybe on the other side of this, nicely done in Colorado on some of this legislative effort here. How do you think about the time line and implementation of that legislation just given the sub 8% earned ROE on a trailing basis, how do you think about that improving said number of 50 basis points or what have you from the legislation here over time?\nBrian Van Abel: Julien, and maybe I'll just take a step back and just say this is a really good piece of legislation now supported by a broad coalition of stakeholders. As we think about it, it's really, kind of, how do we help advance state policy around beneficial expectation, whether that's electrification of the transport sector, electrification of home heating and so worked with a very broad group of stakeholders to get support and passage of this legislation. As I think about it, there is a distribution system plan that we'll file in November in Colorado, which is really kind of the basis of this legislation and think of it almost a resource plan for the distribution system above their capacity investments we need to make and how do we think about the different levels of penetration and how it accelerated some of this can be. And so we'll file that in November, work through that. And so there's a -- the full rider will be implemented in 2026 around the investments needed to kind of drive our distribution system forward. And now when we think about from an earned ROE perspective, we've earned about 8% approximately Colorado over the past few years. So this will really help us drive a significant closure of that gap as we think about it as we go through kind of like I said, 2026 when it's fully implemented. But we also have other investments in Colorado as we think about the renewable investments we're making and the transition investments that we're making to help drive state policy and achieve our decarbonization goals of the state that could concur recovery too. And so as those investments ramp up, that will help close that gap too.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Awesome. Nicely done guys. Perfectly.\nOperator: Thanks for your question, sir. We'll now move to Sophie Karp calling from KeyBanc. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am. Your line is open.\nSophie Karp: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I have a question on the -- going back to the data centers trend. So I guess is there a point at which this incremental loan growth and the acceleration of sales trends translates into the earnings growth at what point would you be comfortable sort of making that leap?\nBrian Van Abel: Yes. Sophie, as I think about it, right? I mean, I think about this data center opportunity in two ways. One is really getting the contracts right and having the data centers -- having -- adding new data centers provide benefit to all of our customers on the system. And that's really important to demonstrate benefit going to the commission with the contract that demonstrates benefit to our current customers. Now longer term, absolutely, there's an investment opportunity or investment need here to support these customers. These are large loads. And so as I think about it, we're moving through the planning process right now, both from, as I talk about a sales forecast perspective and the high probability loads and how did that translate into our capital forecast. So I expect a broader update from us bolt-on that 5-year capital plan and the sales forecast plan in Q3, and that should help address your question.\nSophie Karp: Got it. Got it. Thank you. And then a more higher level question. With all this new load coming in, and I'm not sure if load is going to be interruptible or not interruptible. But do you see the need for, I guess, more gas-fired generation on your grade anytime soon and how receptive do you think the regulators would be to those types of generation additions? Thank you.\nBob Frenzel : Hey, Sophie, it's Bob. So look, I think that -- great questions. We sit in a resource rich area for wind and solar. We see increasing needs for storage resources. But as evidenced by our most recent and our resource plans, we do have incremental combustion turbines that serve to back up and serve our customers to make sure that we have reliability when the wind or the sun or the storage is unavailable. So in our most recent ERPs in Colorado, our recent resource plan up here in the upper Midwest, we have incremental CTs coming back. And I think with increased load like of the magnitude we're talking about, we would actually see increased numbers of backup generation, almost as an insurance policy for our networks to make sure that we have reliable and affordable energy for all.\nSophie Karp: But no plans to add CCGTs from now?\nBob Frenzel : I'm sorry, can you say that again?\nSophie Karp: No plans to add CCGTs, combined cycle?\nBob Frenzel : No. At this point, we don't have any plans today to add any combined cycles to our network. But I mean, we have to evaluate the probability of real load and what the resource availability is to serve it. So not today, but I wouldn't say that anything is off the table.\nSophie Karp: Got it. thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now take questions from Greg Oro [ph] calling from UBS. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. Thanks very much. Just regarding -- the you're working your way through the Smokehouse fire settlements. And just kind of how are you thinking about whether -- how those are going in terms of -- are there any groups that are precedential? How do you think about kind of resolving that and moving forward, sort of timing and process?\nBrian Van Abel : Hey, Greg, I can provide some color on that. So 141 claims settled, and we're moving expeditiously through those and have already reached settlement on 43 of those claims. And so how I look at it, these claims have spanned, call it, a variety items, everything from homes to agriculture buildings, to fencing cattle, feed, personal property. So it gives us a pretty good data point while so -- well, 43 settled is not all encompassing, but it is a good data point. And I think the important point as we think about it, reassess our liability of $250 million and the claims so far support and help validate our accrual. Another data point, the report that received in Q2 was from the Texas A&M Agralife extension. And that report covered -- it was an economic estimate of the agricultural losses from the entire complex of fires down there. And that report for a value of $123 million agriculture losses. And that report included some very large buckets, cattle, feed, agricultural structures. And so when we look at that report, and that number and what we've included for our accrual, it does support our assumptions. And so that's the latest information we have through Q2, and we'll continue to try updates as we move through time.\nUnidentified Analyst: Helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will be coming from Nick Campanella calling from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nNick Campanella: Hey good morning everyone. I hopped on late, so hopefully I'm not repeating others, but just first, just as you're progressing through Colorado gas, what's the ability to settle this in your mind at this point? Is that something that you're open to? Or is this taking a fully litigated pass? And then I just have one follow-up. Thank you.\nBrian Van Abel: Yes. Nick, yes, we sort of received intervenor testimony relatively recently. We have a settlement deadline of August 27. And we certainly look forward to working with our stakeholders with interveners to attempt to reach a settlement. So, we've reached settlement in the past few cases in Colorado, so we're hopeful that we can reach this settlement, also ready to go through the fully litigated process if we need to, that'd be hearings in middle September and this CPUC decision by the end of the year.\nNick Campanella: That\u2019s great. I appreciate it. And then I guess if I could just ask on the financing quickly. I know you priced a little bit of ATM in the quarter. Is ATM the primary vehicle to use here for the rest of the year in terms of your equity needs?\nBrian Van Abel: Yes. I mean the ATM will be our primary vehicle. It doesn't mean we wouldn't be opportunistic if there's a potential block. We'll also look at some of the other equity content products as we go through the time. But overall, ATM is our plan. But also I look at where our CFO to debt is at 17%, right. Now we have flexibility, given we have strong credit metrics, and that's why maintain a strong balance sheet as we have flexibility in terms of when we can look at issuing equity.\nNick Campanella: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you, very much. Mr. Campanella. We'll now go to Travis Miller calling from Morningstar. Please go ahead.\nTravis Miller: Good morning. Thank you. I wonder if there was any update on timing or plans for a Minnesota electric rate case and then tied to that, any lessons learned or takeaways from the settlement in gas case that could be applied to any timing or requests on the electric side.\nBrian Van Abel: Travis. Yes, we're looking -- we're planning on November 1 filing for sort of a multiyear plan on the electric side. If you remember, we're in year 3 of our multiyear plan right now. So we've communicated that. As we think about the gas side, no, we always look to see if we're going to reach a constructive settlement with the parties, and we've been able to on the gas side. So I think that's a good data point as we think about it. So early days given that we haven't made the filing yet, but I think November 1 filing, it's longer process in Minnesota. But once we get through kind of the intervenor direct testimony or robotic testimony, we'll certainly look to see if there's an opportunity to settle.\nTravis Miller: Great. Okay. Thanks. And then back to the data center, that 6,700 or however much it ends up being in terms of requests and potential, how sensitive is that number to regulatory proceedings, whether it's the planning process that what you're talking about was going on in Minnesota, whether it's rig cases, RFPs, how much sensitivity is that to just all regulatory proceedings?\nBob Frenzel: Hey Travis, it's Bob. Look, when I think about the opportunity here that's in front of us, our obligation is the company is to make sure that we were able to serve current customers as well as our future customers and make sure that everyone is treated economically and fairly. I'll be honest, we don't have -- we're 21, 22 gigawatt peak load system today. We don't have 6,000 megawatts of capacity available today. We have some, but we would need to, as part of our existing RFPs and resource plans to add more generation to the stack. So that would take a resource planning process and a regulatory process. I think we've proven over the last seven or eight years, our ability to do that and do that with efficiency to make sure that we can address the expanding needs of our customers and states. So we will need generation over time. But I think we have plans and processes that are in place that allow us to speed the market to address the needs that our new customers might need today, as well as the growth that they forecast through the end of the decade.\nTravis Miller: Okay, great. And then just real quick, transmission distribution capacity. You talked about generation capacity, is there enough T&D? Or would that also be a constraint?\nBob Frenzel: So largely, these customers are largely transmission customers, so we'll talk transmission grid needs. And we've got, again, some capacity on the grid today to meet their needs today. In all of our jurisdictions, we're expanding our transition pretty aggressively, whether it's through the MISO LRTP processes, up here in the upper US and what's been approved and what's on the comment [ph], as well as the Power pathway in Colorado and other transmission proceedings in [indiscernible], and then our work in SPS with the Southwest Power Pool to build more transmission down there. So I think we've got transmission in flight. Again, the capacity today is available, but not the full extent of the 6,700. So our goal is to make sure the transmission generation needs are ramped according to what becomes our high probability customer needs.\nTravis Miller: Got it. Okay. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you for the questions Mr. Miller. Our next question will be coming from Ryan Levine calling from Citi. Please go ahead.\nRyan Levine: Good morning. Any color you could share around rate design for the data center opportunity? In an earlier answer, you mentioned economic development opportunity, does that signal a certain rate structure for this customer class? And on a similar vein, what role do you see VPPs impacting the ability of Xcel services, data center load in Colorado and more broadly across your service territories?\nBrian Van Abel: Ryan, you broke up on the second part of your question, but first part of the question seemed like it was around the rate design as we think about these data center loads. So far, we've approached that on a contract-by-contract basis, and so it can be unique. But the principle is that we need to make sure that the revenue that we receive from these data centers covers more than the incremental cost that comes to our system. So what I mean simply is that our current customers are not harmed by adding these. And whether that means you have a provision in the contract, that's a ratchet if they don't deliver on the load they said they're going to deliver or a take-or-pay type contract. So these are fluid conversations, but the principle is that we need to bring something to our commission that is in the best interest of our current customers. And if you wouldn't -- I couldn't catch up. You broke a little bit on the second part of your question, so if you could repeat it, it would be helpful.\nRyan Levine: Sure. What role do you see VPPs impacting the ability of Xcel to service this data center load in Colorado and across your service territories?\nBrian Van Abel: Look, I mean I think VPPs can almost be another demand-side management tool as we think about it. So we think there could be a role there. I didn\u2019t know that was part of our distribution legislation in Colorado to do some planning and study work around VPPs. So I absolutely think they can play a role in the future. Just like if you think about some of this potential large load, could you have it on an interruptible load uncertainty period. So I think there's a lot of opportunity, as you think about the overall umbrella of more demand side management tools to address in sort of this significant loan growth that we see in our future.\nBob Frenzel: And Ryan, today, we have almost 10% of our peak load in Colorado is available for demand management tools already. And so we'll continue to work with commission and providers as Brian said, with the distribution bill that was just passed to Colorado. So there's an opportunity here, but we do have a very full demand response program already in existence in Colorado.\nRyan Levine: Thank you. And then, do you have a way of quantifying what percentage of historical Wildfire risk has been reduced or will be reduced by the implementation of the current WMP? And how do you see this risk evolving in the coming years?\nBob Frenzel: I don't think we've got a quantitative number for you today, but as I made in my prepared remarks. As I think about the operational mitigations that we put place, dramatically reduce real-time Wildfire risk in our business. We do this on a daily basis, enterprise-wide, and that affords us the time to go in and then do some of the situational awareness and some hardening and enhanced operational things that we want to do in our system. Today, the tools we have are pretty Blood Tools we'd like to get to more surgical use of those tools overtime. And that's a big piece of what our Wildfire Mitigation plans to is just use the operational tools we got today, make them more surgical so they're less customer impactful overtime.\nBrian Van Abel: Yeah. And Ryan, if you run our wildfire mitigation plan in Colorado, we say that the WMP investments and plan will reduce our risk similar to that of what we see in the leading utilities in this space.\nRyan Levine: Thank you for the time.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. We do not have any further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to CFO, Brian Van Abel, for closing remarks. Thank you.\nBrian Van Abel: Thank you, all for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions.\nOperator: Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. We wish everyone a good day. And you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bob Frenzel",
            "content": "Thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that the company delivered another quarter of solid operational and financial progress. Our long-term business model remains robust. We continue to deploy capital for the benefit of our customers and communities. We enable a future powered by cleaner fuels and a more resilient and intelligent grid. We partner with stakeholders to encourage economic development, we provide products and services capable of meeting our customers' most important needs. In the most recent quarter, we invested $1.7 billion in resilient and reliable energy infrastructure. We delivered earnings per share of $0.54 for our owners. We provided industry-leading storm response and strong customer reliability despite challenging weather conditions for our customers. We accelerated wildfire risk reduction measures to enable safer and more resilient communities. Xcel Energy's commitment to our communities and investors is anchored by our core investment thesis as an integrated pure-play utility and a clean energy leader. For more than two decades, we've been a leading provider of wind energy to our customers, and we were the first US energy company to commit to a carbon-free electric future. We delivered our earnings guidance for 19 straight years, one of the best records in our industry, and we look to make it 20 this year. We have a long-term and transparent growth plan, making investments in clean generation new to and enhanced energy grids and economic development programs to support our communities vitality. In 2020, our continuous improvement programs have saved $400 million in recurring O&M expense, while improving operating outcomes and reducing enterprise risk. Our steel for fuel strategy delivered more than $4 billion in customer fuel-related savings since 2017. This discipline alongside support of state and federal policies enables us to reduce emissions and keep residential electric and natural gas bills 28% and 14% below the industry average and growth well below the rate of inflation. With our 11,000-plus employees commitment to serving customers, we're $0.14 ahead of 2023 year-to-date earnings, and as a result, we are reaffirming our 2024 earnings guidance. During the quarter, continued our progress on our clean energy transition through multiple resource planning and RFP processes. We issued an RFP for 1,600 megawatts of wind, solar, storage and hybrid resources in the Upper Midwest. These are due in September, we expect commission decisions in 2025. We now have active RFPs for over 4,000 megawatts of resources in the Upper Midwest . In Mexico and Texas, commissions approved 418 megawatts of company-owned solar generation that's expected to be in service between 2026 and 2027. And last week, we issued an RFP and SPS seeking 3,100 megawatts of accredited capacity which could ultimately yield more than 5,000 megawatts of renewables and firm dispatchable generation. Bids are due in January of 2025, and we expect commission approval in 2026. Last quarter, I discussed a number of initiatives that Xcel Energy is taking to reduce wildfire risk. I'm incredibly proud of what our team has been able to accomplish in a short amount of time. Since March, we've developed the capability to deliver enhanced daily wildfire safety operations across the enterprise as well as the ability to conduct proactive, public safety power shutoff as evidenced by recent events in Colorado, Texas and New Mexico during threatening conditions. We've accelerated pole inspections, including replacing priority 1 and priority 2 poles across our system. We're expanding visual coverage with our Pano AI-enabled camera system to over 50,000 square miles in Colorado, enabling first responders access to critical information, including precision triangulation and fire locations. And we've accelerated deployment of Technosylva's risk modeling system and expect it to have it operational enterprise-wide by the end of the year. We recently filed an updated Colorado wildfire mitigation plan that integrates industry experience incorporates evolving risk assessment methodologies, adds new technology and expands the scope, pace and scale of our programs to reduce wildfire risk. The plan has four primary programs that include enhanced situational awareness, the improved meteorology, area risk mapping and modeling, artificial intelligence cameras and continuous monitoring. Operational mitigations that include enhanced power line safety settings and public safety, power shutoff capabilities, system resiliency through increased asset assessment and remediation, Pole replacements, line rebuilds, targeted undergrounding and vegetation management and improved coordination, technology and real-time data sharing with customers and other stakeholders as well as PSPS resiliency rebates. We expect to file resiliency plans with SPS that will include wildfire mitigation later this year and are developing former wildfire mitigation plans for the rest of our states. Finally, we're working with stakeholders at both the state and federal level on legislation to enhance the safety of our communities from evolving weather risks while protecting the financial integrity of companies that provide these essential services. Moving to economic development. We're seeing a material shift in long-term electric demand on our system after several years of relatively flat sales growth. Our current five-year electric sales forecast assumes approximately 3% annual growth. Nearly half of that growth is driven by electrification of oil and natural gas production, electric vehicle adoption, and beneficial electrification, economic growth and increasing customer counts. The remainder of that growth is driven by contracted and high-probability data center load, including previously announced deals of Meta and Microsoft in Minnesota and QTS in Colorado as well as others. We believe this forecast is now conservative, given a pipeline of data center requests totaling 6,700 megawatts by 2030. If all of the data center requests came to fruition, our data center sales CAGR would be over 9%. We continue working through the request and plan on updating our sales and capital investment forecast on the third quarter call. Xcel Energy is strategically positioned to secure economic data center load with high-quality partners due to our access low-cost renewable generation, the availability of water and fiber infrastructure, unencumbered land and our speed to market. At the same time, we'll continue to focus on the impacts to all customers, ensuring we have both economic contracts and system resources to provide safe, clean and reliable power to our communities. During the quarter, there were two regulatory outcomes that provide for cleaner and more resilient electric and natural gas distribution system, First, Colorado passed a bill that enables qualified electric utilities to make necessary distribution investments with timely recover to achieve state policy goals, including transportation and building electrification and enabling distributed energy resources. This was the result of extensive stakeholder process supported by the Colorado Energy office, our IBW labor partners, environmental advocates, NRDC and WRA as well as the Colorado Solar and Storage Association and others. Second, the Colorado Commission approved the modified clean heat plant, which establishes a starting point for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from our natural gas distribution system. Full year budget of up to $441 million was approved, which sets funding primarily for beneficial electrification and natural gas efficiency. We look forward to working with the stakeholders and regulators to implement these initiatives to meet our long-term sustainability goals in Colorado. Finally, we recently released our 19th sustainability report. We're proud of our history at Xcel Energy. And as we look forward, we're committed to delivering the essential energy services our customers value and need while driving positive change that supports the environment and communities. I'm deeply appreciative thankful for the commitment and hard work of our employees and partners to deliver a clean energy future. We remain relentless in our pursuit of our vision and will continue to deliver long-term value to shareholders an affordable, reliable and sustainable energy for the communities in which we live work. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian. Hey, good morning, Jeremy. Yes, I appreciate the question. Look, as I said in my prepared remarks, I'm really proud of what we're going to accomplish on the operational side to provide the real-time risk reduction that we need today to give us the time to make the necessary enhancements and system resiliency and hardening for our system over time. Clearly, we're further ahead in Colorado. We just filed our second wildfire mitigation plan, and we've been working on the first one for over four years. But that shouldn't be taken as anything other than a huge focus that we also have in Texas and in Mexico around our plans there. Our capability to do wildfire safety operations and PSPS exists on a daily basis across the entire enterprise, which drives real-time risk reduction. We're benefited as a company by all the hard work of the people that have come in front of us in California. We expect to dramatically reduce our wildfire risk based on their experiences and doing some of the lessons learned from all of those organizations. They've been more than accommodating and helping us and others across the country. And clearly, the need is there and evidence, we think there's a real supportive backdrop in our states to help us pursue these necessary investments to continue to risk reduce our business. Yes, Jeremy, Bob again. Look, we're really excited about what we're seeing. Obviously, we believe we have a very attractive service territory across all 8 of our states for different reasons in all of them. But when we speak with hyperscalers and other data center developers, we have what they're looking for low-cost clean energy, access to fiber access to water and other infrastructure, human capital, land that makes us attractive. Right now, we're seeing most of opportunities materialize in the Minnesota and Colorado footprint, but our deeper backlog, I would say, is across all of our service territories in all of our states. And Jeremy, I think this is part of a much broader theme that I've been talking about as it pertains to our company. If you put those criteria that data centers are looking at today, I would suggest that's true for almost any energy-intensive industry and our view that they're at some point going to overly co-locate in parts of the country where energy costs are lower and green energy could be cleaner, and that sits right across the footprint that we straddle. And so, as you look at stuff like hydrogen and clean energy production, if we get to direct their capture as a means of carbon mitigation, you could see a lot of that headquarter in itself or locating itself in our backyard as well as other manufacturing probably where transportation isn't as critical. I think all of those are economic development opportunities that are not in our forecast but areas that we think should beneficially accrue to the parts of the country that we serve. Thank you. Hey. Good morning, Carly. Yes. Thanks, Julien, so I'll start and then Brian can add on. I think you know the company pretty well we've generally taken a pretty conservative approach to forecasting whether it was capital investment opportunities in this case, sales opportunities. Our process is alive and well right now and is geared towards a comprehensive update in the third quarter earnings call. And so we'd expect for, as Brian walked through the sales funnel on Carly's question and then the update on our capital forecast, whether that's the RFP results coming into our forecast whether that's new sales or whether that's capital needs driven by our wildfire mitigation plans, our needs to serve customers to the extent that we see high probability load growth that needs investment as well as all of our resiliency and reliability plans as we roll forward in time. So expect something at the end of the third quarter into the fourth quarter from us on a fulsome enterprise-wide look at all the parameters. Hey, Sophie, it's Bob. So look, I think that -- great questions. We sit in a resource rich area for wind and solar. We see increasing needs for storage resources. But as evidenced by our most recent and our resource plans, we do have incremental combustion turbines that serve to back up and serve our customers to make sure that we have reliability when the wind or the sun or the storage is unavailable. So in our most recent ERPs in Colorado, our recent resource plan up here in the upper Midwest, we have incremental CTs coming back. And I think with increased load like of the magnitude we're talking about, we would actually see increased numbers of backup generation, almost as an insurance policy for our networks to make sure that we have reliable and affordable energy for all. I'm sorry, can you say that again? No. At this point, we don't have any plans today to add any combined cycles to our network. But I mean, we have to evaluate the probability of real load and what the resource availability is to serve it. So not today, but I wouldn't say that anything is off the table. Hey Travis, it's Bob. Look, when I think about the opportunity here that's in front of us, our obligation is the company is to make sure that we were able to serve current customers as well as our future customers and make sure that everyone is treated economically and fairly. I'll be honest, we don't have -- we're 21, 22 gigawatt peak load system today. We don't have 6,000 megawatts of capacity available today. We have some, but we would need to, as part of our existing RFPs and resource plans to add more generation to the stack. So that would take a resource planning process and a regulatory process. I think we've proven over the last seven or eight years, our ability to do that and do that with efficiency to make sure that we can address the expanding needs of our customers and states. So we will need generation over time. But I think we have plans and processes that are in place that allow us to speed the market to address the needs that our new customers might need today, as well as the growth that they forecast through the end of the decade. So largely, these customers are largely transmission customers, so we'll talk transmission grid needs. And we've got, again, some capacity on the grid today to meet their needs today. In all of our jurisdictions, we're expanding our transition pretty aggressively, whether it's through the MISO LRTP processes, up here in the upper US and what's been approved and what's on the comment [ph], as well as the Power pathway in Colorado and other transmission proceedings in [indiscernible], and then our work in SPS with the Southwest Power Pool to build more transmission down there. So I think we've got transmission in flight. Again, the capacity today is available, but not the full extent of the 6,700. So our goal is to make sure the transmission generation needs are ramped according to what becomes our high probability customer needs. And Ryan, today, we have almost 10% of our peak load in Colorado is available for demand management tools already. And so we'll continue to work with commission and providers as Brian said, with the distribution bill that was just passed to Colorado. So there's an opportunity here, but we do have a very full demand response program already in existence in Colorado. I don't think we've got a quantitative number for you today, but as I made in my prepared remarks. As I think about the operational mitigations that we put place, dramatically reduce real-time Wildfire risk in our business. We do this on a daily basis, enterprise-wide, and that affords us the time to go in and then do some of the situational awareness and some hardening and enhanced operational things that we want to do in our system. Today, the tools we have are pretty Blood Tools we'd like to get to more surgical use of those tools overtime. And that's a big piece of what our Wildfire Mitigation plans to is just use the operational tools we got today, make them more surgical so they're less customer impactful overtime."

            "content": "Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Starting with our financial results. Xcel Energy had earnings of $0.54 per share for the second quarter of 2024 compared to $0.52 per share in 2023. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter included the following: revenues from electric rate cases and riders to recover capital investments combined to increase earnings by $0.26 per share. Higher AFUDC increased earnings by $0.04 per share, and revenues from natural gas rate cases increased earnings by $0.02 per share. Offsetting these positive drivers were higher depreciation and amortization decreased earnings by $0.18 per share, reflecting our capital investment programs. Higher interest charges decreased earnings by $0.07 per share. Higher O&M expenses decreased earnings by $0.04 per share and other factors combined to reduce earnings by $0.01 per share. Turning to our sales discussion. Year-to-date weather and leap year adjusted electric sales decreased by 0.4% and natural gas sales increased by 0.4%. We're updating our 2024 forecast to reflect a 1% increase for electric sales with expected increases in C&I load in the second half of the year. Longer term, we continue to see robust demand in our C&I sector, driven by data center loads in Minnesota and Colorado, along with oil natural gas electrification and SPS. During the quarter, we continued to make progress on a relatively light rate case calendar. In June, we reached an uncontested settlement in our Minnesota natural gas case, providing a $46 million rate increase based on a 9.6% ROE and a 52.5% equity ratio. The final commission decision is expected by year-end. In our Colorado natural gas rate case, we received intervener testimony in July. There's a settlement deadline at the end of August with hearing scheduled for September. We expect a commission decision in in the fourth quarter. And July, the Texas Commission approved our $13 million distribution rider request. This represents our first distribution rider requests in Texas, and we expect it will allow us to reduce the frequency of future rate cases. We also continue to make progress on the claims process for the Smokehouse Creek wildfire. We've received 141 claims, of which 43 have been settled, which we view as a positive and constructive outcome. 21 lawsuits have also been filed. In addition, there is no change to our estimate of our accrued liability of $215 million. As a reminder, we have approximately $500 million of excess liability insurance coverage for the fire. Finally, we are reaffirming our 2024 earnings guidance range of $3.50 to $3.60 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%. In addition, we've updated key assumptions to reflect the latest information, which are detailed in our earnings release. With that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. We continue to expect to deliver 2024 earnings within our guidance range as we have for the past 19 years. We're executing on our capital investment plan, including clean generation, transmission and distribution to support reliability and resiliency economic development to support our communities. We're proactively enhancing our wildfire mitigation actions to manage the risk to our systems to protect our customers from extreme weather. We remain confident we can deliver long-term earnings growth at or above the top end of our 5% to 7% range starting in 2025. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take questions. And Jeremy, this is Brian. Good morning. Just on the second part of your question about the current fires in Colorado, our assets were more than a mile away from any of those believed ignition points. Yes, Jeremy, I can just expand on that a little bit. If you could pop the slide that we put in our earnings release today, which is updated from the data center slide that we had a couple of months ago. You can see it's a significant increase in the customer requests. As Bob said, the biggest opportunity was in Minnesota, now it's growing. We're seeing significant opportunity in Colorado now and even expanding outside of Minnesota and Wisconsin and South Dakota. And so we're working closely internally with our economic development team. We think about it as we're updating our long-term sales forecast right now, which will roll out in Q3. Our long-term sales forecast right now is in the 2% to 3% range. I would expect that to look more like the 4% to 5% range and our base long-term sales forecast when we roll that out as we incorporate some of these high probability loads into our five-year guidance. Just another good example about how we look to proactively work with our commissions. The Minnesota commission here in Minnesota has publicly stated, they didn't have planning sessions around how do we accommodate and meet this both economic development opportunity for our communities and also, how do we provide benefit to all of our current customers and create more opportunity for investment. Yes. Hey Carly, this is Brian. It's now early in the process in the wildfire mitigation plan filing in Colorado. We're just starting to see some discovery requests. But overall, we think about the work and the scope we're getting from, call it, the first few responders and the community has been positive. Our investment in the Pano AI cameras is already -- there's been some recent articles where has helped identify fires not started by the utility, but helped work very proactively with the first responders to get them out and mitigate fire risk and protect our communities and our customers. So, I think overall, it has been supportive. But again, like I said, early in the process. Kind of the next kind of pivoting to your second part of the question, is we're focusing on right now is developing our system resiliency plan in Texas, which is what will incorporate our wildfire mitigation plan. So that will be later this year and look for a similar filing in New Mexico later this year, too, and then working through what it will look like in Minnesota in the Midwest for wildfire mitigation plans. We can incorporate a lot of the wildfire mitigation plan into our multiyear rate case in Minnesota as we think about which we'll file in November of this year. Yes. So, if you think -- I'll give you a little bit of color. We kind of highlighted on that slide in our earnings deck is one. We have a contract with them, for example, QTS and Meta that's included in our five-year forecast. And then we have something called near-term pipeline which, for example, maybe we've sold a parcel of land to them. And what we consider is 80% probability. So very high probability that it's going to come into our sales forecast within the next five years. And this is working very closely with our operating companies and our economic development team with these customers. And then everything above that, we do not have in our sales forecast. So there's a huge opportunity above what we call 80% high probability load. And so that's a little bit of color. So, as we continue to kind of march through time, you think some of the stuff that we don't view as 80% probability today becomes more of an opportunity and we drop into that what we included in our base forecast. Hey, Julien congratulations, I heard you proud papa these days. Julien, just let me add to that a little bit. If we think about all the RFPs we have in flight, for example, Minnesota. We have multiple RFPs in flight while we're looking at this potential new load that's rapidly evolving. So we have that opportunity as we go through these RFPs and we're in a resource plan filing with the Minnesota Commission, which we provided kind of what call a base view, but also in electrification in a high load view. So we have processes in flight that helps us move quickly on the staff and secure resources and work with our stakeholders, similar in SPS. We just followed an RFP for over 3,000 megawatts of accredited capacity. Now that was based on our resource plan in New Mexico that had a base plan, but also a high electrification plan working with all of our oil and gas customers. And that's why you see us talking about this 5,000 to 10,000 megawatt nameplate capacity range in SPS because we see that load up there, we're working with our oil and gas customers. So SPS is much more of an electrification in the oil and gas industry. Down there, we're in Colorado, Minnesota, in the Midwest is much more of a potential data center opportunity. Julien, and maybe I'll just take a step back and just say this is a really good piece of legislation now supported by a broad coalition of stakeholders. As we think about it, it's really, kind of, how do we help advance state policy around beneficial expectation, whether that's electrification of the transport sector, electrification of home heating and so worked with a very broad group of stakeholders to get support and passage of this legislation. As I think about it, there is a distribution system plan that we'll file in November in Colorado, which is really kind of the basis of this legislation and think of it almost a resource plan for the distribution system above their capacity investments we need to make and how do we think about the different levels of penetration and how it accelerated some of this can be. And so we'll file that in November, work through that. And so there's a -- the full rider will be implemented in 2026 around the investments needed to kind of drive our distribution system forward. And now when we think about from an earned ROE perspective, we've earned about 8% approximately Colorado over the past few years. So this will really help us drive a significant closure of that gap as we think about it as we go through kind of like I said, 2026 when it's fully implemented. But we also have other investments in Colorado as we think about the renewable investments we're making and the transition investments that we're making to help drive state policy and achieve our decarbonization goals of the state that could concur recovery too. And so as those investments ramp up, that will help close that gap too. Yes. Sophie, as I think about it, right? I mean, I think about this data center opportunity in two ways. One is really getting the contracts right and having the data centers -- having -- adding new data centers provide benefit to all of our customers on the system. And that's really important to demonstrate benefit going to the commission with the contract that demonstrates benefit to our current customers. Now longer term, absolutely, there's an investment opportunity or investment need here to support these customers. These are large loads. And so as I think about it, we're moving through the planning process right now, both from, as I talk about a sales forecast perspective and the high probability loads and how did that translate into our capital forecast. So I expect a broader update from us bolt-on that 5-year capital plan and the sales forecast plan in Q3, and that should help address your question. Hey, Greg, I can provide some color on that. So 141 claims settled, and we're moving expeditiously through those and have already reached settlement on 43 of those claims. And so how I look at it, these claims have spanned, call it, a variety items, everything from homes to agriculture buildings, to fencing cattle, feed, personal property. So it gives us a pretty good data point while so -- well, 43 settled is not all encompassing, but it is a good data point. And I think the important point as we think about it, reassess our liability of $250 million and the claims so far support and help validate our accrual. Another data point, the report that received in Q2 was from the Texas A&M Agralife extension. And that report covered -- it was an economic estimate of the agricultural losses from the entire complex of fires down there. And that report for a value of $123 million agriculture losses. And that report included some very large buckets, cattle, feed, agricultural structures. And so when we look at that report, and that number and what we've included for our accrual, it does support our assumptions. And so that's the latest information we have through Q2, and we'll continue to try updates as we move through time. Yes. Nick, yes, we sort of received intervenor testimony relatively recently. We have a settlement deadline of August 27. And we certainly look forward to working with our stakeholders with interveners to attempt to reach a settlement. So, we've reached settlement in the past few cases in Colorado, so we're hopeful that we can reach this settlement, also ready to go through the fully litigated process if we need to, that'd be hearings in middle September and this CPUC decision by the end of the year. Yes. I mean the ATM will be our primary vehicle. It doesn't mean we wouldn't be opportunistic if there's a potential block. We'll also look at some of the other equity content products as we go through the time. But overall, ATM is our plan. But also I look at where our CFO to debt is at 17%, right. Now we have flexibility, given we have strong credit metrics, and that's why maintain a strong balance sheet as we have flexibility in terms of when we can look at issuing equity. Travis. Yes, we're looking -- we're planning on November 1 filing for sort of a multiyear plan on the electric side. If you remember, we're in year 3 of our multiyear plan right now. So we've communicated that. As we think about the gas side, no, we always look to see if we're going to reach a constructive settlement with the parties, and we've been able to on the gas side. So I think that's a good data point as we think about it. So early days given that we haven't made the filing yet, but I think November 1 filing, it's longer process in Minnesota. But once we get through kind of the intervenor direct testimony or robotic testimony, we'll certainly look to see if there's an opportunity to settle. Ryan, you broke up on the second part of your question, but first part of the question seemed like it was around the rate design as we think about these data center loads. So far, we've approached that on a contract-by-contract basis, and so it can be unique. But the principle is that we need to make sure that the revenue that we receive from these data centers covers more than the incremental cost that comes to our system. So what I mean simply is that our current customers are not harmed by adding these. And whether that means you have a provision in the contract, that's a ratchet if they don't deliver on the load they said they're going to deliver or a take-or-pay type contract. So these are fluid conversations, but the principle is that we need to bring something to our commission that is in the best interest of our current customers. And if you wouldn't -- I couldn't catch up. You broke a little bit on the second part of your question, so if you could repeat it, it would be helpful. Look, I mean I think VPPs can almost be another demand-side management tool as we think about it. So we think there could be a role there. I didn't know that was part of our distribution legislation in Colorado to do some planning and study work around VPPs. So I absolutely think they can play a role in the future. Just like if you think about some of this potential large load, could you have it on an interruptible load uncertainty period. So I think there's a lot of opportunity, as you think about the overall umbrella of more demand side management tools to address in sort of this significant loan growth that we see in our future. Yeah. And Ryan, if you run our wildfire mitigation plan in Colorado, we say that the WMP investments and plan will reduce our risk similar to that of what we see in the leading utilities in this space. Thank you, all for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions."

        "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to Xcel Energy's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Melissa, and I will be your coordinator for today's event. Please note this conference is being recorded.\n [Operator Instructions]\n Questions will only be taken from institutional investors. Reporters can contact Media Relations with inquiries, and individual investors and others can reach out to Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions]\n I'll now turn the call over to Paul Johnson, Vice President, Treasurer, and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nPaul Johnson: Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2024 First Quarter Earnings Call. Joining me today are Bob Frenzel, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer questions if needed.\n This morning, we will review our '24 first quarter results and highlights, discuss recent wildfires and our mitigation efforts and share recent business developments. Slides accompany today's call are available on our website. Please note that we changed our presentation. As a result, we no longer refer to electric and natural gas margin. Instead, we'll discuss changes in revenue and cost of goods sold from the income statement.\n Please note that these most fluctuations in cost of electric fuel and natural gas are recovered through regulatory mechanisms and are generally earnings neutral. As a reminder, some of the comments during today's call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and SEC filings. Today, we'll discuss certain measures that are non-GAAP measures. Information on the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release.\n With that, I'll turn it over to Bob. \nRobert Frenzel: Thanks Paul, and good morning, and welcome, everyone. It's been 2 months since wildfires impacted our Texas neighbors and before Brian walks through our financial results, I'd like to discuss the actions we're taking to protect the public and to strengthen our systems resiliency in the states that we serve.\n In February, multiple wildfires were ignited in Texas. And from the outset of those fires, our focus has been on the people, in the communities, and the Panhandle and on the safety and the well-being of our coworkers and their families there. I want to thank all of the first responders, emergency personnel, state and local employees and our own SPS employees who worked tirelessly in support of our customers and our communities during and after the event.\n They provided wildfire response, community assistance, relief services and work tirelessly in the field to restore essential services. I've been to the panhandle and I've witnessed the impacted areas and I can see for the entire Xcel Energy team when I say that we are saddened by the losses, and we will stand with the Panhandle community as we recover, rebuild and renew that area as we have for over 100 years.\n Xcel Energy has acknowledged that our distribution poles appear to have been involved in an ignition of the Smoke House Creek fires and smaller Reamer Fire, which quickly burned into the Smokehouse Creek Fire footprint. We assume claims that Xcel Energy acted negligently in maintaining an operating infrastructure. In addition, we do not believe that our facilities caused the Windy Deuce or the Grapevine Creek fires and believe that their additions are caused by distribution lines owned by other companies.\n In an effort to expedite relief and recovery in the community, we've established a claims processes for those who have property or livestock loss in the Smokehouse Creek fires, and are actively settling a number of claims. So far, 46 claims have been submitted. And as on April 22, Xcel Energy and SPS have been named as defendants in 15 lawsuits.\n Based on the most current information, we believe it's probable that we incur a loss due to the Smokehouse Creek wildfire and accrued a liability of $215 million which is offset by an insurance receivable since it's lower than our approximately $500 million insurance.\n Please note that the $215 million loss equivalent preliminary estimate, which reflects the low end of our range and is subject to change based on new information. More information on Smokehouse Creek, please see our disclosures in our earnings release and our Form 10-Q.\n On all utilities we're experiencing profound changes in weather and climate related impacts on our operations. As a result, we must continue to evolve our operations for these unparalleled dynamics. Risk mitigation and system resiliency has long been a priority for Xcel Energy in continuing into the future.\n Our strategy consists of 3 phases: first, immediate near-term response; second, regulatory activities needed to address comprehensive wildfire mitigation and resiliency plans; third, additional state and federal legislation that could be valuable.\n Part of our first phase, we've accelerated risk-reduction initiatives across our system, including accelerating portfolio inspections and replacements as well as operational actions such as proactive deenergizing the lines and adjusting reclosure settings, known as power saving, power shells and enhanced power line safety setting.\n We've been operating under approved wildfire plant in Colorado since 2020. As part of our second phase strategy, we will file updated wildfire mitigation plans in our respective states beginning with an updated Colorado WMP later this quarter. The plans incorporate industry learnings that are tailored to our unique geographies and risk profiles.\n Newly expanded actions include increased vegetation management, accelerating pole inspections, hardening and replacements, distribution undergrounding segmentation and covered conductor programs, transition line hardening and ore rebuilds, enhanced reclosure settings and correctively energizing of lines and situational awareness programs, including weather stations, cameras, and other monitoring software.\n Later this year, we intend to file a system resiliency plan that will include wildfire mitigation at SPS is contemplated under recent Texas law. And the third component of our strategy is to continue to step up our efforts to innovate and plan for evolving climate wildfire risk.\n We know that our ability to enable a clean energy transition and to deliver important products to our customers is predicated on maintaining a reasonable cost of capital, and we believe that proactive legislation in a state and federal level is a potential vehicle to ensure that our customers continue to receive affordable, reliable, sustainable, and safe power service.\n We are doing this alone. We're working across the industry with peer utilities, industry groups such as EEI and EPRI, [ partner ] of Energy, federal, state, and global agencies, first responders, our labor partners, and countless others. While we need to reduce wildfire risk our core operations remain strong and our investment opportunities robust.\n During the first quarter, we made significant progress on our clean energy transition and resource plans. In February, we filed our resource plan for the NSP system, we proposed to add 6,400 megawatts of new resources and extend the lives of our Prairie Island and Monticello nuclear facilities past 2050.\n The proposed plan reduces carbon emissions by more than 80% while increasing customer bills by approximately 1% annually. We anticipate a decision on our proposal by the Minister of Commission in 2025. In New Mexico, the commission accepted our resource plan and proposed approximately 5,000 to 10,000 megawatts of new generation by 2030.\n We anticipate issuing an RFP for the resource needs this summer. And finally, the Minnesota Commission recently approved our updated transportation electrification plan, and we filed an updated transportation electrification plan in New Mexico in April. We also made continued progress with several economic and commercial development projects.\n In February, we announced that working with Microsoft to bring a new data center to our retiring Sherco coal facility. The proposed data center is positioned to be 1 of our largest customers in Minnesota and is projected to bring jobs and investments to the community.\n In March, Meta broke ground on its previously announced data center that will be powered by NSP Minnesota. Meta will provide funding for new infrastructure upgrades, including transmission lines to support the project, and the facility is slated to open in late summer 2025. Xcel Energy proactively worked with data center developers, communities, and stakeholders across our states to ensure that we can reliably and affordably serve this new demand while providing benefits to our other customers.\n With several additional opportunities in the pipeline, we expect data centers to drive further growth for the foreseeable future. Our employees are at the heart of these many accomplishments. Our team is composed of dedicated and hard-working and courageous employees are committed to serving our communities with safe clean, reliable, and affordable energy.\n For the 11th year in a row, Xcel Energy was honored as one of the world's most admired companies by Fortune Magazine, placing 2nd overall amongst the most admired gas electric company's in the country. For the fifth year in a row, Xcel Energy has been named one of the world's most ethical companies by Ethisphere. Xcel Energy is 1 of only 5 energy companies in the United States recognized this year. Xcel Energy also joined the Economic Opportunity Coalition, a public-private partnership with the U.S. government, where we committed to allocating 15% of our U.S.-based contract spending in the areas of energy supply, distribution, transition, and clean energy small and underserved businesses by 2025.\n With that, I'll turn it over to Brian. \nBrian Van Abel: Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Turning to our financial results. Xcel Energy had earnings of $0.88 per share for the first quarter of 2024 compared to $0.76 per share in 2023. The increase in earnings reflects our investment of approximately $8 billion over the last 5 quarters to improve resiliency and enable clean energy for our customers while delivering economic growth and vitality for our communities.\n The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter included the following: the impact of electric and natural gas rate reviews to recover our capital investments increased earnings by $0.12 per share. Lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.06 per share, reflecting lower labor and benefit costs, lower bad debt expenses and gains from a land sale for a data center.\n Non-fuel riders recover capital investment increased earnings by $0.05. Offsetting these positive drivers were higher depreciation and amortization decreased earnings by $0.05 per share, reflecting our capital investment programs. Higher interest charges decreased earnings by $0.05 per share. In addition, other items combined to decrease earnings by $0.01 per share.\n Coming to sales, year-to-date weather and leap year adjusted electric sales decreased by 0.3% and natural gas sales increased by 1.7% as compared to 2023. Please note that we have revised our projected electric sales growth to 1% to 2% for the year, largely due to declining use per customer and timing delays for expansions for some of our large C&I customers. However, we can certainly expect long-term electric sales to grow 3% annually.\n During the quarter, we also made progress on a relatively light rate [ calendar ]. In April, the Texas Commission approved our electric rate case settlement without modification. The settlement reflects a rate increase of $65 million based on the black box settlement which includes an ROE of 9.55% and an equity ratio of 54.5% AFUDC process.\n In our Minnesota Natural Gas rate case, we received intervenor testimony last week. Hearings were scheduled for July and expect the commission decision by year-end or in the first quarter of next year. And in our Colorado natural gas rate case, procedural schedule has been established that reflects intervenor testimony in July, hearings in September and a commission decision in the fourth quarter.\n Please see our earnings release for more details on our regulatory proceedings. We are reaffirming our 2024 earnings guidance range of $3.50 to $3.60 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%. In addition, we've updated our key assumptions to reflect the latest information, which are detailed in our earnings release.\n With that, I'll wrap up with a brief summary. We are proactively enhancing our operational and wildfire mitigation actions, commanded risk to our systems and protect our customers from extreme weather. We continue to expect to deliver 2024 earnings within our guidance range as [ we have for the past ] 19 years.\n We are executing on our capital investment plan, including clean generation, transmission, and distribution to support reliability and resiliency and economic development to support our communities. And we remain confident we can deliver long-term earnings growth at or above the top end of our 5% to 7% range starting in 2025 and dividend growth at the low end of our 5% to 7% objective range.\n This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]\n Our first question is from Nick Campanella with Barclays. \nNicholas Campanella: Thanks for all the information today. I guess a couple of questions to kick it off. You have a lot of resource plan activity going on across SPS and the RFPs seeming like they're coming out this summer. Just how are you kind of thinking about competition for capital within the current CapEx plan now that you're seemingly accelerating some resiliency plans at SPS and NIPSCO maybe you can kind of remind us what's incremental [ versus not? ] And then also just touch on your financing plan and [ it needs.] \nBrian Van Abel: Yes, certainly, Nick. If I go touch upon all that the multiple parts of that question, just please be feel free to follow up. Absolutely we're pretty excited about the upcoming RFP and SPS. We talked about it before seeking a range of generation between 5,000 and 10,000 megawatts combination of renewables and dispatchable firm capacity. And we'll look to launch that RFP in July. It's a little bit of a longer timeline. So I'll help you understand in terms of how -- what's underlying.\n We do expect to file CPCNs in the summer of 2025. So summer of next year with decisions in Q1 of 2026. So that capital really will be kind of in the '27 to 2030 type of spend time frames. So I think [ it was really elongating, ] adding to the sum of the back end over 5 years but elongating our growth opportunities beyond their 5 year and what we're seeing there. So that's how I think about that capital, but really great opportunity and excited to get started on that.\n You touched a little bit on that. Absolutely, we're looking to continue to invest in resiliency and risk mitigation spend. Just want to note, we have about $10 billion in our current CapEx spend around distribution and transition resiliency. But as we look to file our Colorado [ WNP ] here later in this Q2, there will certainly be incremental investment needs related to reducing our real wildfire risk.\n So we'll evaluate all of that within our kind of current normal cadence when we come back in October of this year to provide a kind of roll forward for a '25 to '29 plan, and we think about competition for capital. I think as we sit here today, we're very [ comfortable -- comparable ] with -- I reiterated we'll be at or above the top end of the 5% to 7% range. I think just looking at all the opportunities we have in front of us with rate base of [ opportunities ] above 9%. And we'll let the finance that as we always have been.\n I think it's important to maintain a strong balance sheet and important to keep that going forward. And so we'll look at it financing incremental growth with accretive equity at that kind of 60%, 40% range. So I hope I touched on everything you're asking about. \nRobert Frenzel: I think I'll just add 1 thing on the Brian's comment. I think you asked about sort of relative competitiveness of the company. We would expect to offer in our own development projects into the SPS proposal, and we've proven that we -- with our scale and utility-owned wind and our growing expertise in solar and storage, we think we would be very competitive for some of the generation in Southwestern Public Service RFP process. \nNicholas Campanella: Got it. That's really helpful. And then I guess just -- and you did hit all the points. To put a finer point on the equity needs, I guess, do you just see really kind of no change to current plans, even with the multiple a little bit lower here? \nBrian Van Abel: Yes. So the way we think about it, obviously, like I said and reiterated where we expect to be within the growth range. And that takes into account our lower multiple impacts over the past quarter, certainly. As I mentioned, we think about the significant investment opportunities going forward. And it's important to have a strong balance sheet. We try to maintain that strong balance sheet.\n But obviously, you will look at what is that that's on balance sheet gives us to some timing flexibility from an equity issuance perspective. And obviously, we'll evaluate that and obviously, we'll evaluate whether there's potential timing flexibility our own capital in the near term. But I think overall, as we think fundamentally, everything is intact from a long-term perspective in terms of maintaining a strong balance sheet and funding the investment needs for the clean energy transition with equity as we need to maintain the balance sheet. \nOperator: Our next question is from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. \nSteven Fleishman: So just on the Texas fire. You mentioned the legislative report coming out in May. Just what should we expect to be coming out in that? Is that -- who caused it? Or how should we think about what's going to come out in that report, like we focus on? \nRobert Frenzel: Look, at a macro level, I was pretty encouraged by the process we went through with the Texas House and the committee. I think one of the tenets of good risk mitigation is involving all the stakeholders who have a hand in doing that. And I think the committee hearings were a pretty good example of getting all -- mostly all of the interested parties and participants in our [ room ] proactively talking about the issues. And on balance, I think the sessions were productive, still the committee was looking to be prospective and gathering information for future solutions.\n And I think that's how I'd expect to report in May to come out. I think we'll see stuff on recommendations for utilities, emergency responders, proactive things that we're doing in the counties to mitigate fire risk. I think there's already [ tend to say ] for a service report on causation. I'm not certain we see something else from the committee on that. But I think the report is going to be in line with the sessions themselves with constructive recommendations for how to proceed going forward. \nSteven Fleishman: Okay. And then just on the damage estimate that you took as you've noted, I think, in your release a lot of kind of what's in there, what's not in there. One clarification just is how about not punitive damages, but noneconomic damages. Is that in your estimate or not in your estimate? \nBrian Van Abel: I think, yes, Steve. I'll handle this one, and I'll give you [ key helpers], obviously, we'll point to our disclosures. But I'll give you a little bit more color in terms of that $215 million in the lower end of. \nSteven Fleishman: Yes, that was great. \nBrian Van Abel: And here's very large that some of our pockets it includes. Residential properties and related losses, cattle and feed, agricultural structures and fencing, noneconomic damages and then a number of other items. So obviously, this is subject to changes again additional information since we're still early in the process. \nSteven Fleishman: That's helpful. And then just on a follow-up on the question about equity. Just given some of the overhang that's been caused by this, how are you -- are you kind of revisiting like other options of getting equity than just issuing it? Are there asset sales or other things that you might consider? Or is that just not as attractive as just funding with equity? \nBrian Van Abel: Obviously, it's something you'd expect. Bob and I to evaluate in the normal course, what other options are there. I think we've been -- what you've seen from us is that we were a pretty straightforward conservative financing plan from a company perspective. So I don't -- I think right now, that's our current plan of action. I think I've been on record about not at all interested in minority interest sale in the line. So that's our fair plan of action as we sit here today. \nSteven Fleishman: Okay. And then last thing on the data center growth. So just on the facility at the old Sherco site, how was that being served? And then just, Bob, you mentioned talking to a lot of others. Could you just talk to kind of how they're viewing your territory and just making sure you're able to kind of do this in a way that is kind of good for the broader customer base? \nRobert Frenzel: That's a great question. In the conversation and Steve, and it's very topical, both inside the walls of the building as well as around the industry. On your specific questions with regard to the Sherco site, the site get powered with grid energy. And as you know, we're the first company to commit to being a 100% carbon-free electricity.\n So we are a significant importance in the renewable [ knowledge ] system, and they will benefit from all our system actions. More broadly, as we look across our footprint in the company, we think, depending on the operating company, we have really attractive dynamics for super scalers and other data center and high energy use customers. And whether it's very low-cost C&I energy in the Southwest or [ knowing ] weather and high renewables in Colorado or a similar footprint here in the Upper Midwest. I think that we're having conversations across our footprint. And I think we've got both access to water transition infrastructure, land and energy, and clean energy that they find attractiveness.\n So we've got a significant amount of interest from super scalers and others and then look forward to sharing more of that as we develop our forecast. \nBrian Van Abel: Steve, I just want to -- just add a little bit of color to that. I think you kind of hinted that, how do we think about it from a current customer perspective [ build ]? I think as we bring on new data centers and is something we did with Meta and the approval of Meta in Minnesota. We make sure it's a win-win for our existing customers. That's really important as we continue to move forward with this significant opportunity. \n And I think there's an opportunity there to work with our policymakers and regulators, to help drive economic development within the right context and then also ensuring that we can move quickly because you will need to build out infrastructure both on the generation side and the wire side that can serve some of these significant opportunities that we're seeing over the next 5 to 10 years. \nOperator: Our next question is from Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan. \nJeremy Tonet: Just want to continue with the data center question with one more finer point here, I guess, as it relates to SPS, just given the need for power and given the very cheap natural gas in that area, I don't -- wouldn't necessarily think of SPS as a place that would -- data centers would target, but just wondering if what you're seeing there if cheap Power is a draw? Just any thoughts in general? \nBrian Van Abel: Yes. Jeremy, I think -- I mean, as Bob has mentioned, we're seeing data center interest across all our service territories. And so service are preferred to have maybe a little different point of attractiveness. And then you hit SPS as on the lowest C&I rates in the country. So interest there. But I would say the other significant growth that we continue to see in SPS, and this is really what you're seeing come through our numbers now when you look at the year-over-year growth from the C&I perspective is the oil and gas expansion in the Permian Basin there and [ averaging ] they're doing from an electrification perspective.\n So right now, that's the near-term growth of and SPS with longer-term data center opportunity we're discussing this with some data centers down there. We also have a fantastic renewable resources down there from a wind and solar perspective, a little bit leads to that. When we talk about that RFP coming out in SPS in our resource plan, those are the reason why we have a range of 5,000 to 10,000 megawatts and I'll try the range is ensure that we enable some of the growth that we're seeing. \nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Certainly, New Mexico, at the low end of the cost curve for production in North America there. So maybe continuing with Texas a little bit more and following up on the wildfires. Just wondering if Texas caps noneconomic damages or just any other details you could provide there? \nBrian Van Abel: Yes. Right now, there is no cap on noneconomic damages in Texas. There is a cap on [ punitive damages ] this 2x economic damages falls up to [ 750k ] cap for noneconomic. \nJeremy Tonet: Got it. And then looking forward to the Colorado Wildfire Mitigation Plan filing, there's been some press in the state around recent deenergization in Colorado. Can you speak to the opportunity for sectionalization or other efforts to reduce customer impact? Any other nuances to the filing you could share with us? \nRobert Frenzel: Yes. Jeremy, it's Bob. Thanks for the question. First, I'm really proud of what the team did in Colorado in executing on behalf of public safety during a volatile weather event. As you can imagine, the -- [ because we have the second ] file on our wildfire mitigation plan, it's going to have a lot of continuation of the existing plan and probably incremental areas that we'd be looking for. But as I think about the big buckets of opportunity there, really early warning capabilities.\n We've already sold 21 panel cameras, but I think there's a real opportunity for increased early warning capabilities with AI-powered cameras as well as weather stations in and around our territories and our equipment. Obviously, we have opportunities to improve our operating capabilities in public safety power [ shutoffs ], as well as even the power line enhanced power line safety settings. But we're executing those today, and we're doing a pretty good job. We have more work to do there.\n I think about the third bucket and where your question leads to is sort of asset resilience capabilities and we can continue to expect our poles and wires, replace stuff and maybe accelerating some of that. But I think [ we've also ] system resiliency, and this gets back to [ what ] your comment on sectionalizing. We've done some of that. We have a real opportunity to do that more, both our intelligence at a granular level of weather and what's happening in weather as well as our ability to control our system at a more micro level to mitigate customer impact is a real priority for us in this plan.\n And lastly, given as part of the plan is the public policy opportunity that we might have to protect our customers. So big buckets there, but hopefully, I got to your sectionalizing question as well as asset [ harving ] like undergrounding, covered conductors and other pieces of both transmission and distribution systems as we think about protecting public safety is a priority for us. \nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Very helpful, there. And just a last one, if I could, as it relates to gas cases in Minnesota and Colorado, any updates there that we should be thinking about or conversations with stakeholders and regulators on those cases and how you feel about those cases. \nBrian Van Abel: Yes. And just I'll get on first, the Minnesota natural gas case because that's probably the one that spurred us along, given that we just received intervenor testimony and the Department of Commerce recommended a $44 million increase of a 9.4% ROE. We have hearings in mid-July, but we'll certainly look [ into this ] opportunity to engage with our stakeholders to see if we've reached settlement, which we did in the last Minnesota gas rate case. So we'll look to engage, like I said, here is our July. So from now until July, we'll look to engage there.\n On the Colorado side, we're still pretty early in the process. We haven't received intervenor testimony yet. The procedural schedule just came out. So for us, it will be that the settlement -- we get intervenor testimony in mid-July. We get opportunity, there's a settlement deadline at the end of August, and then we don't reach a settlement, we'll be hearing in mid-September for the decision in Q4. \nOperator: Our next question is from Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. \nCarly Davenport: Thanks for all the details so far. Maybe just on the resiliency plan filing at SPS that you expect in late '24. Can you just remind us of the timing to getting that ultimately approved and when that spend would come into play? And then I guess any early views on kind of the sizing of that potential filing or in addition to the wildfire mitigation piece that you flagged what other buckets of spend do you think will be important there. \nBrian Van Abel: Carly, it's Brian. As I said, we're just looking to put that filing together, it will be late in Q4. So from a timing perspective, you probably into Q3 of the following year for it to get approved. So I think from an overall perspective, I mean, if you look at some of our kind of just distribution spend in SPS and you look at our 5-year capital plan, and what could be [ albacore ]. Obviously, we're currently focus on the Colorado WNP and we'll take a lot of those programs and apply it to SPS, but tailored because SPS is a very different geography than call it Texas is very different geography when we think about what should we be doing to have risk mitigation from wildfire perspective, and so we'll tailor it. But I think we'll give you more color as we get further development of that resiliency plan later this year. \nCarly Davenport: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then the follow-up is just on O&M, nice benefit during the quarter there. Is that just a function of kind of year-over-year timing? Or is there a potential downside to that annual guidance on O&M being up 1% to 2% for the year? \nRobert Frenzel: Yes, good question. I think from our perspective, really have, as you kind of noted, we haven't changed our guidance for the year-end even though we had a significant quarter-over-quarter change. So I look at it more from where we are from a budget perspective which you don't see. And we're slightly has our budget for the first quarter. But from where we sit, I think it's early in the year, that our goal is just to land within that 1% to 2% O&M guidance range as [ we sit here.] \nOperator: Our next question is from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. \nAnthony Crowdell: Just 2 quick ones. One is any major change in the company's cost to ensure the company's operations. \nBrian Van Abel: Anthony. Yes, that's a good question as we think about it. So I assume you're asking specifically about wildfire insurance or excess liability. \nAnthony Crowdell: Yes, I do. Yes. \nBrian Van Abel: I think yes, all our other programs, I would say, are relatively stable or don't have significant challenges. As I think about wildfire insurance and just let's say for the wildfire insurance versus the overall access liability is they are 2 different things. I think this is a very key industry issue, both at the state and federal level. And if you've been following with EEI, this is one of their top priorities this year from a federal perspective.\n In terms of how we think about getting a focus on [ damage ] limitations? Is there insurance backstop or solution at a federal level and think about specific criteria for wildfire mitigation plans in exchange for liability protection. So those are some of the broad buckets EEI, [ you're thinking about. ] Obviously we're thinking about it from a state perspective as we look forward. Our legislation sessions are wrapping up here or have already wrapped up this year.\n So what we will do is we'll look to work with our policymakers in our state's kind of from here for as we think about next year's last session to see if there's any state level solutions that we think about it.\n Now specifically from a company perspective or a commercial insurance perspective, even prior to Smokehouse Creek, we were seeing [ clinical ] understanding that from some of the commercial carriers, they were already looking to reduce their capacity and not just for us but overall, their exposure from a wildfire insurance perspective. And so that's going into the next policy cycle. These are annual renewals.\n So our renewal is in [ tele ] Q4. So we'll give more visibility into it, but I'll give you some -- a little bit of a sense of where we sit today as we have above $500 million of coverage, and we're paying about a $40 million premium for that coverage, and that's total excess liability, including wildfire. But I would expect that covers that capacity to come down and I expect premiums to be pressured, absolutely. So like we -- like I said, we're still a ways away from our renewal. So again, we'll provide more color as we get close to, but that's where we sit today. \nAnthony Crowdell: Great. And then just one last one. I think, Bob, you had mentioned pursuing some proactive legislation for wildfire risk. Would you be willing to let like hey, the maybe top 3 things? Or what are your goals in getting the legislation passed, like what's -- would you like to be included in your maybe first wave of legislation pass, whether it's limits on noneconomic liability? Or I'm just curious, any color on that you would provide. \nRobert Frenzel: Anthony, thanks for the question. As Brian said, this is a big and emerging national issue. And we've seen pressure both on the retail side of insurance, homeowners struggling to get homeowner insurance that protects from wildfire risk, and you're seeing it in the commercial side on the wholesale side as well.\n So we've been active at the federal level, particularly talking about sort of the national opportunity we might have here. I think about there are [ precedents ] at the federal level, you see something like where goods are really important for everybody like the FDIC or FEMA or for flood insurance or other type programs or even nuclear backstop insurance from the price standard [ connect ].\n So there's several [ precedents ] around protecting national goods like banking access, like access to affordable electricity. So as I think about where the federal government could help, is this probably applies to the state level, too, which is having approved wildfire mitigation plan that can be reviewed by an agency of a same or federal level. And then if you're in compliance and current on that plan, then you have access to some form of backstop insurance program that provides protection and maybe access that maybe the current carriers are providing at an attractive or an affordable cost, as that group of entities comes up to speed on risk and risk mitigation.\n So I think those are the big parameters that I would think about. And certainly, there's state precedents, you can take [ UTA ] or Nevada or California laws and seen programs where companies along with their regulators and legislators are coming up with programs that provide more cost-effective backstop for companies to bring down the risk.\n And as I said in my prepared remarks, at the end of the day, we have an enormous energy transition that we need to fund and making sure that our cost of capital is attractive to fund that keeps the transition affordable for our customers and for the country. And so I think it's important that we manage this risk, we manage the financial cost of this risk, and those are some of the areas that I would think are most important for us to go after. \nBrian Van Abel: Yes. Just to add a little bit to that. I think as Bob talked about importance of that insurance backstop and filling a WNP, but I think there's also an aspect there is if you're following [ the plans of the WMP to the presumption of routes ] which I think is important, too, and also looking at a limit job liability or limit on damages. \nOperator: Our next question is from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. \nSophie Karp: I have a couple of questions, today. So on the Texas fire, can you clarify how, I guess, the claims system and the litigations that's been filed against you are going to well work together for [ like I have a better word ]. Like are people who are litigating, not filing claims or can they do both? Like how does it work? \nBrian Van Abel: Sophie, yes. I mean, so first of all, I'll talk about the claims process and still early, but we obviously encourage people to submit claims. It was [ 46 ] so far. But how it works is anyone can submit a claim, and when they submit that claim, they don't waive their right to pursue a lawsuit. But if there is a claim settlement, then that absolves or release any other potential lawsuits that they could file.\n So that's how it could work, but also from a -- if someone files a lawsuit, it certainly could be an opportunity to settle through that lawsuit too. So -- but like I said we are encouraging people to enter the claims process, and we've settled a couple already that are in active settlement discussions with others. \nSophie Karp: Got it. Got it. And then my other question on Colorado and next to the gas got this clarification from the commission there that they want the utilities to pursue non-pipeline alternatives, I guess, for gas in Colorado. Could you comment on that and just sort of how that will impact your investment in that state, particularly with gas? \nRobert Frenzel: Sophie, it's Bob. Look, we've got a number of gas proceedings in Colorado over the last year. I think you're referring to our clean heat plan. And we think that was an industry leading or very unique filing and proactive on the company and the commissions' part to move forward that. Big picture, I think they're sitting, they're looking at the gas system as an effective delivery of energy but making sure that if we've got capacity need from a growing customer base out there that we're looking at something other than pipeline alternatives.\n And we're actively engaged in that and something we've always as a company looked at. But I don't think it's going to affect necessarily us going forward in terms of significant changes in capital forecast for where we sit today. But maybe a more proactive approach with stakeholders and communities about finding maybe different types of solutions to solve the similar issues, whether that's more beneficial electrification, more powering of homes for home heating and other needs. And we're certainly engaged in that process with them. \nSophie Karp: So the non-pipeline alternative is basically a word for electrification? Or could that be something like increasing like compression station output or something like that? Like just kind of -- what is that? \nBrian Van Abel: Yes. Sophie, so actually, you bring up increasing compression station, it's certainly an opportunity. I think generally it's thought of -- what are the electrification opportunities. Say, there's going to be a new neighborhood builds. What is the alternative, it's -- okay, you saw that [indiscernible] gas and expansion of a pipeline or what are the alternatives from electrification perspective. So that's probably the best way to think about it.\n I think if I were a [ bucket ] out there, and it's a very important project for the governor and the geothermal whether at a district level or a residential level or community level, exploring the possibilities of geothermal in the state are something we're willing to work with or we're going to work with our customers and our stakeholders in the state. So it's not necessarily just electrification. It could be more different forms of heat for homes and communities. \nOperator: Our next question is from Ryan Levine with Citi. \nRyan Levine: What role do you see PSPS having in terms of your wildfire mitigation plans? And are there any initiatives that you could take proactively to gain more stakeholder support to be able to implement that on a go-forward basis? \nRobert Frenzel: Ryan, it's Bob. Certainly, we think of PSPS as a kind of a tool of last resort. But public safety is our priority in making sure that our communities are protected in volatile wind events and wildfire risk case is really important to us as well. So are there opportunities for us to gain more public support, of course, there are. And the ways that we can improve our own performance as we, [ again ] more muscle here, because this is something that I don't love to do. But when we have to do it, I think there's areas of improvement that we as a company have identified and are working with our Colorado Commission to do so. And that includes early notification, excellence in outage maps, something I talked about earlier on segmentation.\n So all this comes as a function of our wildfire mitigation plan. If we have better early warning devices like cameras, weather stations, our ability to effect on a more localized level where the risk is and where the outage would need to can be can get better. But that's going to take some time, some effort, some partnership with our agencies and stakeholders in Colorado for sure. \nRyan Levine: And then shifting gears on the financing plan as security prices continue to move. How do you look at maybe assessing a time to come to market for capital raises. I think in earlier question, you suggested the avoidance of asset sales, but any color around response to maybe different security prices and how that can impact your financing plan? \nBrian Van Abel: Ryan, I think a little bit as the color I provided before is obviously, overall, we believe our growth plans from an investment perspective, a long-term EPS growth perspective impact and same in our chance of maintaining a strong balance sheet. What I talked about not necessarily in avoidance, but how do we look at the timing of equity and the timing of capital, particularly on the timing of the equity, given that we have a strong balance sheet, is we can look at being flexible there. But I would expect that when we're investing $39 billion of capital at a 9% rate base growth. That does come with the financings. And generally, our prior financing year in and year out, that's aligned with the capital spend.\n So that's the best way to think about it. But obviously, we'll understand what happened to the cost of equity here. And also with the cost of that we have gone off [ over ] the short term in terms of our [ churn ] rates have gone. So but that's factored into all of our plans, as I sit here today and talk about reiterating on being at or above our 5%, 7%. \nRyan Levine: Okay. And then just last question, in terms of CapEx outlook, given maybe acceleration of infrastructure build-out in North America. Are you seeing any indications that maybe costs will come higher for what's already slated to be built in the coming years. Any color you could share on that? \nRobert Frenzel: Yes. Ryan, it's Bob. Look, I think as we see reindustrialization, we see data center build-out. Certainly, there can be cost pressures that come from basic materials and construction materials like concrete, steel, and things like that. I think we take our best estimates when we put our capital forecast out, but something we watch pretty closely.\n Labor is another area of opportunity there. I think that one of the things we're very focused on as we see an energy sector transition, making sure that there's a pipeline of talent starting early on in trade schools and partnering with our labor unions and with business partners there, to make sure that the pipeline of [ linemen ] and pipe fitters and welders are capable of keeping up with the demand.\n So we try to send early demand signals to them, and it help them recruitment processes across our territories and really partner on a national level to make sure that we're seeing enough trade come into the business broadly that we don't see a an immense amount of labor pressure. \nOperator: Our next question is from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. \nPaul Patterson: Just -- I apologize if you guys have gone over this. But just on the [ NUC ] life extension, could you remind me what the impact financially is. Have you guys already -- it varies from company to company how the depreciation impact is reco -- when it's recognized, et cetera. I was just wondering if you could review that for me shortly, quickly if it's not a problem. \nBrian Van Abel: Paul. Yes, you're referencing the resource plan that we just filed here in Q1 related to the extension of Monticello. So Monticello we already extended to 2040, and we've recognized that depreciation in terms of lower customer bills. So we're looking to extend [ Monticello] from 2040 to 2050. And then Prairie Island both units [ 20 ] years, so we'll go from the early 2030s to the early 2050s. \n We have not recognized those 3, call it, lower depreciation rates in the customer [indiscernible] rate case. We'll wait until we get through this proceeding to get approval and like we wrap it into our next rate case. So this proceeding is probably going to take 18 months play at the very least. So it's going to be probably [ held before ] we can plow that back into customer rates in terms of lower depreciation. \nPaul Patterson: Okay. Great. But just is there any potential for regulatory -- sort of positive regulatory lag? Or does it -- are you guys planning on having immediately impact customer rates? \nBrian Van Abel: No, this would likely just be captured either how to defer here or likely if we're in a multiyear plan to have a [ true ] mechanism part. \nOperator: Thank you. As we have no further questions in the queue, I'd like to turn it back over to CFO, Brian Van Abel for any closing remarks. \nBrian Van Abel: Yes. Thank you all for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions. \nOperator: Thank you very much. That concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect. Hosts, you may stay on the line.",

It's been 2 months since wildfires impacted our Texas neighbors and before Brian walks through our financial results, I'd like to discuss the actions we're taking to protect the public and to strengthen our systems resiliency in the states that we serve.\n In February, multiple wildfires were ignited in Texas. And from the outset of those fires, our focus has been on the people, in the communities, and the Panhandle and on the safety and the well-being of our coworkers and their families there. I want to thank all of the first responders, emergency personnel, state and local employees and our own SPS employees who worked tirelessly in support of our customers and our communities during and after the event.\n They provided wildfire response, community assistance, relief services and work tirelessly in the field to restore essential services. I've been to the panhandle and I've witnessed the impacted areas and I can see for the entire Xcel Energy team when I say that we are saddened by the losses, and we will stand with the Panhandle community as we recover, rebuild and renew that area as we have for over 100 years.\n Xcel Energy has acknowledged that our distribution poles appear to have been involved in an ignition of the Smoke House Creek fires and smaller Reamer Fire, which quickly burned into the Smokehouse Creek Fire footprint. We assume claims that Xcel Energy acted negligently in maintaining an operating infrastructure. In addition, we do not believe that our facilities caused the Windy Deuce or the Grapevine Creek fires and believe that their additions are caused by distribution lines owned by other companies.\n In an effort to expedite relief and recovery in the community, we've established a claims processes for those who have property or livestock loss in the Smokehouse Creek fires, and are actively settling a number of claims. So far, 46 claims have been submitted. And as on April 22, Xcel Energy and SPS have been named as defendants in 15 lawsuits.\n Based on the most current information, we believe it's probable that we incur a loss due to the Smokehouse Creek wildfire and accrued a liability of $215 million which is offset by an insurance receivable since it's lower than our approximately $500 million insurance.\n Please note that the $215 million loss equivalent preliminary estimate, which reflects the low end of our range and is subject to change based on new information. More information on Smokehouse Creek, please see our disclosures in our earnings release and our Form 10-Q.\n On all utilities we're experiencing profound changes in weather and climate related impacts on our operations. As a result, we must continue to evolve our operations for these unparalleled dynamics. Risk mitigation and system resiliency has long been a priority for Xcel Energy in continuing into the future.\n Our strategy consists of 3 phases: first, immediate near-term response; second, regulatory activities needed to address comprehensive wildfire mitigation and resiliency plans; third, additional state and federal legislation that could be valuable.\n Part of our first phase, we've accelerated risk-reduction initiatives across our system, including accelerating portfolio inspections and replacements as well as operational actions such as proactive deenergizing the lines and adjusting reclosure settings, known as power saving, power shells and enhanced power line safety setting.\n We've been operating under approved wildfire plant in Colorado since 2020. As part of our second phase strategy, we will file updated wildfire mitigation plans in our respective states beginning with an updated Colorado WMP later this quarter. The plans incorporate industry learnings that are tailored to our unique geographies and risk profiles.\n Newly expanded actions include increased vegetation management, accelerating pole inspections, hardening and replacements, distribution undergrounding segmentation and covered conductor programs, transition line hardening and ore rebuilds, enhanced reclosure settings and correctively energizing of lines and situational awareness programs, including weather stations, cameras, and other monitoring software.\n Later this year, we intend to file a system resiliency plan that will include wildfire mitigation at SPS is contemplated under recent Texas law. And the third component of our strategy is to continue to step up our efforts to innovate and plan for evolving climate wildfire risk.\n We know that our ability to enable a clean energy transition and to deliver important products to our customers is predicated on maintaining a reasonable cost of capital, and we believe that proactive legislation in a state and federal level is a potential vehicle to ensure that our customers continue to receive affordable, reliable, sustainable, and safe power service.\n We are doing this alone. We're working across the industry with peer utilities, industry groups such as EEI and EPRI, [ partner ] of Energy, federal, state, and global agencies, first responders, our labor partners, and countless others. While we need to reduce wildfire risk our core operations remain strong and our investment opportunities robust.\n During the first quarter, we made significant progress on our clean energy transition and resource plans. In February, we filed our resource plan for the NSP system, we proposed to add 6,400 megawatts of new resources and extend the lives of our Prairie Island and Monticello nuclear facilities past 2050.\n The proposed plan reduces carbon emissions by more than 80% while increasing customer bills by approximately 1% annually. We anticipate a decision on our proposal by the Minister of Commission in 2025. In New Mexico, the commission accepted our resource plan and proposed approximately 5,000 to 10,000 megawatts of new generation by 2030.\n We anticipate issuing an RFP for the resource needs this summer. And finally, the Minnesota Commission recently approved our updated transportation electrification plan, and we filed an updated transportation electrification plan in New Mexico in April. We also made continued progress with several economic and commercial development projects.\n In February, we announced that working with Microsoft to bring a new data center to our retiring Sherco coal facility. The proposed data center is positioned to be 1 of our largest customers in Minnesota and is projected to bring jobs and investments to the community.\n In March, Meta broke ground on its previously announced data center that will be powered by NSP Minnesota. Meta will provide funding for new infrastructure upgrades, including transmission lines to support the project, and the facility is slated to open in late summer 2025. Xcel Energy proactively worked with data center developers, communities, and stakeholders across our states to ensure that we can reliably and affordably serve this new demand while providing benefits to our other customers.\n With several additional opportunities in the pipeline, we expect data centers to drive further growth for the foreseeable future. Our employees are at the heart of these many accomplishments. Our team is composed of dedicated and hard-working and courageous employees are committed to serving our communities with safe clean, reliable, and affordable energy.\n For the 11th year in a row, Xcel Energy was honored as one of the world's most admired companies by Fortune Magazine, placing 2nd overall amongst the most admired gas electric company's in the country. For the fifth year in a row, Xcel Energy has been named one of the world's most ethical companies by Ethisphere. Xcel Energy is 1 of only 5 energy companies in the United States recognized this year. Xcel Energy also joined the Economic Opportunity Coalition, a public-private partnership with the U.S. government, where we committed to allocating 15% of our U.S.-based contract spending in the areas of energy supply, distribution, transition, and clean energy small and underserved businesses by 2025.\n With that, I'll turn it over to Brian. I think I'll just add 1 thing on the Brian's comment. I think you asked about sort of relative competitiveness of the company. We would expect to offer in our own development projects into the SPS proposal, and we've proven that we -- with our scale and utility-owned wind and our growing expertise in solar and storage, we think we would be very competitive for some of the generation in Southwestern Public Service RFP process. Look, at a macro level, I was pretty encouraged by the process we went through with the Texas House and the committee. I think one of the tenets of good risk mitigation is involving all the stakeholders who have a hand in doing that. And I think the committee hearings were a pretty good example of getting all -- mostly all of the interested parties and participants in our [ room ] proactively talking about the issues. And on balance, I think the sessions were productive, still the committee was looking to be prospective and gathering information for future solutions.\n And I think that's how I'd expect to report in May to come out. I think we'll see stuff on recommendations for utilities, emergency responders, proactive things that we're doing in the counties to mitigate fire risk. I think there's already [ tend to say ] for a service report on causation. I'm not certain we see something else from the committee on that. But I think the report is going to be in line with the sessions themselves with constructive recommendations for how to proceed going forward. That's a great question. In the conversation and Steve, and it's very topical, both inside the walls of the building as well as around the industry. On your specific questions with regard to the Sherco site, the site get powered with grid energy. And as you know, we're the first company to commit to being a 100% carbon-free electricity.\n So we are a significant importance in the renewable [ knowledge ] system, and they will benefit from all our system actions. More broadly, as we look across our footprint in the company, we think, depending on the operating company, we have really attractive dynamics for super scalers and other data center and high energy use customers. And whether it's very low-cost C&I energy in the Southwest or [ knowing ] weather and high renewables in Colorado or a similar footprint here in the Upper Midwest. I think that we're having conversations across our footprint. And I think we've got both access to water transition infrastructure, land and energy, and clean energy that they find attractiveness.\n So we've got a significant amount of interest from super scalers and others and then look forward to sharing more of that as we develop our forecast. Yes. Jeremy, it's Bob. Thanks for the question. First, I'm really proud of what the team did in Colorado in executing on behalf of public safety during a volatile weather event. As you can imagine, the -- [ because we have the second ] file on our wildfire mitigation plan, it's going to have a lot of continuation of the existing plan and probably incremental areas that we'd be looking for. But as I think about the big buckets of opportunity there, really early warning capabilities.\n We've already sold 21 panel cameras, but I think there's a real opportunity for increased early warning capabilities with AI-powered cameras as well as weather stations in and around our territories and our equipment. Obviously, we have opportunities to improve our operating capabilities in public safety power [ shutoffs ], as well as even the power line enhanced power line safety settings. But we're executing those today, and we're doing a pretty good job. We have more work to do there.\n I think about the third bucket and where your question leads to is sort of asset resilience capabilities and we can continue to expect our poles and wires, replace stuff and maybe accelerating some of that. But I think [ we've also ] system resiliency, and this gets back to [ what ] your comment on sectionalizing. We've done some of that. We have a real opportunity to do that more, both our intelligence at a granular level of weather and what's happening in weather as well as our ability to control our system at a more micro level to mitigate customer impact is a real priority for us in this plan.\n And lastly, given as part of the plan is the public policy opportunity that we might have to protect our customers. So big buckets there, but hopefully, I got to your sectionalizing question as well as asset [ harving ] like undergrounding, covered conductors and other pieces of both transmission and distribution systems as we think about protecting public safety is a priority for us. Yes, good question. I think from our perspective, really have, as you kind of noted, we haven't changed our guidance for the year-end even though we had a significant quarter-over-quarter change. So I look at it more from where we are from a budget perspective which you don't see. And we're slightly has our budget for the first quarter. But from where we sit, I think it's early in the year, that our goal is just to land within that 1% to 2% O&M guidance range as [ we sit here.] Anthony, thanks for the question. As Brian said, this is a big and emerging national issue. And we've seen pressure both on the retail side of insurance, homeowners struggling to get homeowner insurance that protects from wildfire risk, and you're seeing it in the commercial side on the wholesale side as well.\n So we've been active at the federal level, particularly talking about sort of the national opportunity we might have here. I think about there are [ precedents ] at the federal level, you see something like where goods are really important for everybody like the FDIC or FEMA or for flood insurance or other type programs or even nuclear backstop insurance from the price standard [ connect ].\n So there's several [ precedents ] around protecting national goods like banking access, like access to affordable electricity. So as I think about where the federal government could help, is this probably applies to the state level, too, which is having approved wildfire mitigation plan that can be reviewed by an agency of a same or federal level. And then if you're in compliance and current on that plan, then you have access to some form of backstop insurance program that provides protection and maybe access that maybe the current carriers are providing at an attractive or an affordable cost, as that group of entities comes up to speed on risk and risk mitigation.\n So I think those are the big parameters that I would think about. And certainly, there's state precedents, you can take [ UTA ] or Nevada or California laws and seen programs where companies along with their regulators and legislators are coming up with programs that provide more cost-effective backstop for companies to bring down the risk.\n And as I said in my prepared remarks, at the end of the day, we have an enormous energy transition that we need to fund and making sure that our cost of capital is attractive to fund that keeps the transition affordable for our customers and for the country. And so I think it's important that we manage this risk, we manage the financial cost of this risk, and those are some of the areas that I would think are most important for us to go after. Sophie, it's Bob. Look, we've got a number of gas proceedings in Colorado over the last year. I think you're referring to our clean heat plan. And we think that was an industry leading or very unique filing and proactive on the company and the commissions' part to move forward that. Big picture, I think they're sitting, they're looking at the gas system as an effective delivery of energy but making sure that if we've got capacity need from a growing customer base out there that we're looking at something other than pipeline alternatives.\n And we're actively engaged in that and something we've always as a company looked at. But I don't think it's going to affect necessarily us going forward in terms of significant changes in capital forecast for where we sit today. But maybe a more proactive approach with stakeholders and communities about finding maybe different types of solutions to solve the similar issues, whether that's more beneficial electrification, more powering of homes for home heating and other needs. And we're certainly engaged in that process with them. Ryan, it's Bob. Certainly, we think of PSPS as a kind of a tool of last resort. But public safety is our priority in making sure that our communities are protected in volatile wind events and wildfire risk case is really important to us as well. So are there opportunities for us to gain more public support, of course, there are. And the ways that we can improve our own performance as we, [ again ] more muscle here, because this is something that I don't love to do. But when we have to do it, I think there's areas of improvement that we as a company have identified and are working with our Colorado Commission to do so. And that includes early notification, excellence in outage maps, something I talked about earlier on segmentation.\n So all this comes as a function of our wildfire mitigation plan. If we have better early warning devices like cameras, weather stations, our ability to effect on a more localized level where the risk is and where the outage would need to can be can get better. But that's going to take some time, some effort, some partnership with our agencies and stakeholders in Colorado for sure. Yes. Ryan, it's Bob. Look, I think as we see reindustrialization, we see data center build-out. Certainly, there can be cost pressures that come from basic materials and construction materials like concrete, steel, and things like that. I think we take our best estimates when we put our capital forecast out, but something we watch pretty closely.\n Labor is another area of opportunity there. I think that one of the things we're very focused on as we see an energy sector transition, making sure that there's a pipeline of talent starting early on in trade schools and partnering with our labor unions and with business partners there, to make sure that the pipeline of [ linemen ] and pipe fitters and welders are capable of keeping up with the demand.\n So we try to send early demand signals to them, and it help them recruitment processes across our territories and really partner on a national level to make sure that we're seeing enough trade come into the business broadly that we don't see a an immense amount of labor pressure."

            "name": "Brian Van Abel",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Turning to our financial results. Xcel Energy had earnings of $0.88 per share for the first quarter of 2024 compared to $0.76 per share in 2023. The increase in earnings reflects our investment of approximately $8 billion over the last 5 quarters to improve resiliency and enable clean energy for our customers while delivering economic growth and vitality for our communities.\n The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter included the following: the impact of electric and natural gas rate reviews to recover our capital investments increased earnings by $0.12 per share. Lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.06 per share, reflecting lower labor and benefit costs, lower bad debt expenses and gains from a land sale for a data center.\n Non-fuel riders recover capital investment increased earnings by $0.05. Offsetting these positive drivers were higher depreciation and amortization decreased earnings by $0.05 per share, reflecting our capital investment programs. Higher interest charges decreased earnings by $0.05 per share. In addition, other items combined to decrease earnings by $0.01 per share.\n Coming to sales, year-to-date weather and leap year adjusted electric sales decreased by 0.3% and natural gas sales increased by 1.7% as compared to 2023. Please note that we have revised our projected electric sales growth to 1% to 2% for the year, largely due to declining use per customer and timing delays for expansions for some of our large C&I customers. However, we can certainly expect long-term electric sales to grow 3% annually.\n During the quarter, we also made progress on a relatively light rate [ calendar ]. In April, the Texas Commission approved our electric rate case settlement without modification. The settlement reflects a rate increase of $65 million based on the black box settlement which includes an ROE of 9.55% and an equity ratio of 54.5% AFUDC process.\n In our Minnesota Natural Gas rate case, we received intervenor testimony last week. Hearings were scheduled for July and expect the commission decision by year-end or in the first quarter of next year. And in our Colorado natural gas rate case, procedural schedule has been established that reflects intervenor testimony in July, hearings in September and a commission decision in the fourth quarter.\n Please see our earnings release for more details on our regulatory proceedings. We are reaffirming our 2024 earnings guidance range of $3.50 to $3.60 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%. In addition, we've updated our key assumptions to reflect the latest information, which are detailed in our earnings release.\n With that, I'll wrap up with a brief summary. We are proactively enhancing our operational and wildfire mitigation actions, commanded risk to our systems and protect our customers from extreme weather. We continue to expect to deliver 2024 earnings within our guidance range as [ we have for the past ] 19 years.\n We are executing on our capital investment plan, including clean generation, transmission, and distribution to support reliability and resiliency and economic development to support our communities. And we remain confident we can deliver long-term earnings growth at or above the top end of our 5% to 7% range starting in 2025 and dividend growth at the low end of our 5% to 7% objective range.\n This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions. Yes, certainly, Nick. If I go touch upon all that the multiple parts of that question, just please be feel free to follow up. Absolutely we're pretty excited about the upcoming RFP and SPS. We talked about it before seeking a range of generation between 5,000 and 10,000 megawatts combination of renewables and dispatchable firm capacity. And we'll look to launch that RFP in July. It's a little bit of a longer timeline. So I'll help you understand in terms of how -- what's underlying.\n We do expect to file CPCNs in the summer of 2025. So summer of next year with decisions in Q1 of 2026. So that capital really will be kind of in the '27 to 2030 type of spend time frames. So I think [ it was really elongating, ] adding to the sum of the back end over 5 years but elongating our growth opportunities beyond their 5 year and what we're seeing there. So that's how I think about that capital, but really great opportunity and excited to get started on that.\n You touched a little bit on that. Absolutely, we're looking to continue to invest in resiliency and risk mitigation spend. Just want to note, we have about $10 billion in our current CapEx spend around distribution and transition resiliency. But as we look to file our Colorado [ WNP ] here later in this Q2, there will certainly be incremental investment needs related to reducing our real wildfire risk.\n So we'll evaluate all of that within our kind of current normal cadence when we come back in October of this year to provide a kind of roll forward for a '25 to '29 plan, and we think about competition for capital. I think as we sit here today, we're very [ comfortable -- comparable ] with -- I reiterated we'll be at or above the top end of the 5% to 7% range. I think just looking at all the opportunities we have in front of us with rate base of [ opportunities ] above 9%. And we'll let the finance that as we always have been.\n I think it's important to maintain a strong balance sheet and important to keep that going forward. And so we'll look at it financing incremental growth with accretive equity at that kind of 60%, 40% range. So I hope I touched on everything you're asking about. Yes. So the way we think about it, obviously, like I said and reiterated where we expect to be within the growth range. And that takes into account our lower multiple impacts over the past quarter, certainly. As I mentioned, we think about the significant investment opportunities going forward. And it's important to have a strong balance sheet. We try to maintain that strong balance sheet.\n But obviously, you will look at what is that that's on balance sheet gives us to some timing flexibility from an equity issuance perspective. And obviously, we'll evaluate that and obviously, we'll evaluate whether there's potential timing flexibility our own capital in the near term. But I think overall, as we think fundamentally, everything is intact from a long-term perspective in terms of maintaining a strong balance sheet and funding the investment needs for the clean energy transition with equity as we need to maintain the balance sheet. I think, yes, Steve. I'll handle this one, and I'll give you [ key helpers], obviously, we'll point to our disclosures. But I'll give you a little bit more color in terms of that $215 million in the lower end of. And here's very large that some of our pockets it includes. Residential properties and related losses, cattle and feed, agricultural structures and fencing, noneconomic damages and then a number of other items. So obviously, this is subject to changes again additional information since we're still early in the process. Obviously, it's something you'd expect. Bob and I to evaluate in the normal course, what other options are there. I think we've been -- what you've seen from us is that we were a pretty straightforward conservative financing plan from a company perspective. So I don't -- I think right now, that's our current plan of action. I think I've been on record about not at all interested in minority interest sale in the line. So that's our fair plan of action as we sit here today. Steve, I just want to -- just add a little bit of color to that. I think you kind of hinted that, how do we think about it from a current customer perspective [ build ]? I think as we bring on new data centers and is something we did with Meta and the approval of Meta in Minnesota. We make sure it's a win-win for our existing customers. That's really important as we continue to move forward with this significant opportunity. \n And I think there's an opportunity there to work with our policymakers and regulators, to help drive economic development within the right context and then also ensuring that we can move quickly because you will need to build out infrastructure both on the generation side and the wire side that can serve some of these significant opportunities that we're seeing over the next 5 to 10 years. Yes. Jeremy, I think -- I mean, as Bob has mentioned, we're seeing data center interest across all our service territories. And so service are preferred to have maybe a little different point of attractiveness. And then you hit SPS as on the lowest C&I rates in the country. So interest there. But I would say the other significant growth that we continue to see in SPS, and this is really what you're seeing come through our numbers now when you look at the year-over-year growth from the C&I perspective is the oil and gas expansion in the Permian Basin there and [ averaging ] they're doing from an electrification perspective.\n So right now, that's the near-term growth of and SPS with longer-term data center opportunity we're discussing this with some data centers down there. We also have a fantastic renewable resources down there from a wind and solar perspective, a little bit leads to that. When we talk about that RFP coming out in SPS in our resource plan, those are the reason why we have a range of 5,000 to 10,000 megawatts and I'll try the range is ensure that we enable some of the growth that we're seeing. Yes. Right now, there is no cap on noneconomic damages in Texas. There is a cap on [ punitive damages ] this 2x economic damages falls up to [ 750k ] cap for noneconomic. Yes. And just I'll get on first, the Minnesota natural gas case because that's probably the one that spurred us along, given that we just received intervenor testimony and the Department of Commerce recommended a $44 million increase of a 9.4% ROE. We have hearings in mid-July, but we'll certainly look [ into this ] opportunity to engage with our stakeholders to see if we've reached settlement, which we did in the last Minnesota gas rate case. So we'll look to engage, like I said, here is our July. So from now until July, we'll look to engage there.\n On the Colorado side, we're still pretty early in the process. We haven't received intervenor testimony yet. The procedural schedule just came out. So for us, it will be that the settlement -- we get intervenor testimony in mid-July. We get opportunity, there's a settlement deadline at the end of August, and then we don't reach a settlement, we'll be hearing in mid-September for the decision in Q4. Carly, it's Brian. As I said, we're just looking to put that filing together, it will be late in Q4. So from a timing perspective, you probably into Q3 of the following year for it to get approved. So I think from an overall perspective, I mean, if you look at some of our kind of just distribution spend in SPS and you look at our 5-year capital plan, and what could be [ albacore ]. Obviously, we're currently focus on the Colorado WNP and we'll take a lot of those programs and apply it to SPS, but tailored because SPS is a very different geography than call it Texas is very different geography when we think about what should we be doing to have risk mitigation from wildfire perspective, and so we'll tailor it. But I think we'll give you more color as we get further development of that resiliency plan later this year. Anthony. Yes, that's a good question as we think about it. So I assume you're asking specifically about wildfire insurance or excess liability. I think yes, all our other programs, I would say, are relatively stable or don't have significant challenges. As I think about wildfire insurance and just let's say for the wildfire insurance versus the overall access liability is they are 2 different things. I think this is a very key industry issue, both at the state and federal level. And if you've been following with EEI, this is one of their top priorities this year from a federal perspective.\n In terms of how we think about getting a focus on [ damage ] limitations? Is there insurance backstop or solution at a federal level and think about specific criteria for wildfire mitigation plans in exchange for liability protection. So those are some of the broad buckets EEI, [ you're thinking about. ] Obviously we're thinking about it from a state perspective as we look forward. Our legislation sessions are wrapping up here or have already wrapped up this year.\n So what we will do is we'll look to work with our policymakers in our state's kind of from here for as we think about next year's last session to see if there's any state level solutions that we think about it.\n Now specifically from a company perspective or a commercial insurance perspective, even prior to Smokehouse Creek, we were seeing [ clinical ] understanding that from some of the commercial carriers, they were already looking to reduce their capacity and not just for us but overall, their exposure from a wildfire insurance perspective. And so that's going into the next policy cycle. These are annual renewals.\n So our renewal is in [ tele ] Q4. So we'll give more visibility into it, but I'll give you some -- a little bit of a sense of where we sit today as we have above $500 million of coverage, and we're paying about a $40 million premium for that coverage, and that's total excess liability, including wildfire. But I would expect that covers that capacity to come down and I expect premiums to be pressured, absolutely. So like we -- like I said, we're still a ways away from our renewal. So again, we'll provide more color as we get close to, but that's where we sit today. Yes. Just to add a little bit to that. I think as Bob talked about importance of that insurance backstop and filling a WNP, but I think there's also an aspect there is if you're following [ the plans of the WMP to the presumption of routes ] which I think is important, too, and also looking at a limit job liability or limit on damages. Sophie, yes. I mean, so first of all, I'll talk about the claims process and still early, but we obviously encourage people to submit claims. It was [ 46 ] so far. But how it works is anyone can submit a claim, and when they submit that claim, they don't waive their right to pursue a lawsuit. But if there is a claim settlement, then that absolves or release any other potential lawsuits that they could file.\n So that's how it could work, but also from a -- if someone files a lawsuit, it certainly could be an opportunity to settle through that lawsuit too. So -- but like I said we are encouraging people to enter the claims process, and we've settled a couple already that are in active settlement discussions with others. Yes. Sophie, so actually, you bring up increasing compression station, it's certainly an opportunity. I think generally it's thought of -- what are the electrification opportunities. Say, there's going to be a new neighborhood builds. What is the alternative, it's -- okay, you saw that [indiscernible] gas and expansion of a pipeline or what are the alternatives from electrification perspective. So that's probably the best way to think about it.\n I think if I were a [ bucket ] out there, and it's a very important project for the governor and the geothermal whether at a district level or a residential level or community level, exploring the possibilities of geothermal in the state are something we're willing to work with or we're going to work with our customers and our stakeholders in the state. So it's not necessarily just electrification. It could be more different forms of heat for homes and communities. Ryan, I think a little bit as the color I provided before is obviously, overall, we believe our growth plans from an investment perspective, a long-term EPS growth perspective impact and same in our chance of maintaining a strong balance sheet. What I talked about not necessarily in avoidance, but how do we look at the timing of equity and the timing of capital, particularly on the timing of the equity, given that we have a strong balance sheet, is we can look at being flexible there. But I would expect that when we're investing $39 billion of capital at a 9% rate base growth. That does come with the financings. And generally, our prior financing year in and year out, that's aligned with the capital spend.\n So that's the best way to think about it. But obviously, we'll understand what happened to the cost of equity here. And also with the cost of that we have gone off [ over ] the short term in terms of our [ churn ] rates have gone. So but that's factored into all of our plans, as I sit here today and talk about reiterating on being at or above our 5%, 7%. Paul. Yes, you're referencing the resource plan that we just filed here in Q1 related to the extension of Monticello. So Monticello we already extended to 2040, and we've recognized that depreciation in terms of lower customer bills. So we're looking to extend [ Monticello] from 2040 to 2050. And then Prairie Island both units [ 20 ] years, so we'll go from the early 2030s to the early 2050s. \n We have not recognized those 3, call it, lower depreciation rates in the customer [indiscernible] rate case. We'll wait until we get through this proceeding to get approval and like we wrap it into our next rate case. So this proceeding is probably going to take 18 months play at the very least.
